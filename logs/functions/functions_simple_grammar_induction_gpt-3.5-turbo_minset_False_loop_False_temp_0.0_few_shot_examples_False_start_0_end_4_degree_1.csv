    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use the given input-output pairs to find the values of ""a"" and ""b"" in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's plug in the first input-output pair (-10, -213) into the equation:

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10)b

Similarly, let's plug in the other input-output pairs:

167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a + (-3)b

387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

We now have a system of linear equations. To find the values of ""a"" and ""b"", we can solve this system.

Adding up the first, second, and third equations, we get:

-213 + 167 + 67 = 3a + 12b
21 = 3a + 12b   [Equation 4]

Adding up the first and fourth equations, we get:

-213 + 387 = 2a + 10b
174 = 2a + 10b   [Equation 5]

Subtracting Equation 4 from Equation 5:

174 - 21 = (2a + 10b) - (3a +12b)
153 = -a - 2b

Simplifying:

-a - 2b = 153
a + 2b = -153   [Equation 6]

We now have two equations (Equation 5 and Equation 6) with two variables (a and b). We can solve this system of equations to find the values of ""a"" and ""b"".

Multiplying Equation 6 by 2, we get:

2a + 4b = -306   [Equation 7]

Adding Equation 5 and Equation 7, we have:

2a + 10b + 2a + 4b = -153 - 306
4a + 14b = -459

Since Equation 7 is a multiple of Equation 6, we can subtract Equation 6 from Equation 5 to eliminate the ""a"" term:

(4a + 14b) - (a + 2b) = -459 - (-153)
 3a + 12b = -306       [Equation 8]

We now have two equations (Equation 8 and Equation 4) with two variables (a and b). We can solve this system of equations to find the values of ""a"" and ""b"".

Now, adding up Equation 4 and Equation 8:

(3a + 12b) + (3a + 12b) = -306 + 21
6a + 24b = -285

Dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

a + 4b = -47.5   [Equation 9]

Subtracting Equation 9 from Equation 8:

(3a + 12b) - (a + 4b) = -306 - (-47.5)
2a + 8b = -258.5

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

a + 4b = -129.25   [Equation 10]

Comparing Equation 9 and Equation 10, we can see that they are the same equation multiplied by different constants. Therefore, we can conclude that ""a"" = -47.5 and ""b"" = 4.

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

Output: y = -47.5x^0 + 4x^1
