"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can create a system of equations using the given data points.

Using the form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 represents a constant term and x^1 represents the input value, we can substitute the given data points into the equation and solve for a and b.

When solving for a and b, we have:

For the input -10 and output -213:
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1

For the input 9 and output 167:
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1

For the input 4 and output 67:
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1

For the input -3 and output -73:
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1

For the input 20 and output 387:
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1

Simplifying these equations, we get:

-213 = a + (-10)b

167 = a + (9)b

67 = a + (4)b

-73 = a + (-3)b

387 = a + (20)b

Now we have a system of equations where we can solve for a and b. By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b, and then express the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form of the function.

Solving this system of equations, we find:

a = -4

b = 18

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -4x^0 + 18x^1

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of a and b in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can form the following equations:

-213 = a - 10b    (1)
167 = a + 9b    (2)
67 = a + 4b      (3)
-73 = a - 3b    (4)
387 = a + 20b   (5)

To solve this system of equations, we can subtract equations (2) and (3) to eliminate a:

167 - 67 = a + 9b - (a + 4b)
100 = 5b
b = 20

Now, we can substitute the value of b back into equations (2), (3), (4), and (5) to find a:

167 = a + 9(20)
167 = a + 180
a = -13

67 = a + 4(20)
67 = a + 80
a = -13

-73 = a - 3(20)
-73 = a - 60
a = -13

387 = a + 20(20)
387 = a + 400
a = -13

We can see that for all equations, the value of a is consistently -13 regardless of the input.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -13x^0 + 20x^1
Simplified: y = -13 + 20x

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can form the equations:

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1

Simplifying these equations, we get:

-213 = a + (-10)b
167 = a + 9b
67 = a + 4b
-73 = a + (-3)b
387 = a + 20b

Now, we can solve this system of equations. Subtracting the third equation from the second equation, and subtracting the fifth equation from the fourth equation gives us:

100 = 5b
460 = 23b

Solving for b, we find that b = 20. Substituting this value of b into the first equation, we get:

-213 = a + (-10)(20)
-213 = a - 200
a = -13

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship can be approximated by a linear function. Let's write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

For the inputs and outputs provided:

Input: 5, Output: -31
Input: 9, Output: -51
Input: -11, Output: 49
Input: -4, Output: 14
Input: -12, Output: 54

From the given data points, we can observe that when the input increases, the output decreases. Therefore, we can assume a negative relationship between input and output.

Considering the linear form, we can write the function as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Simplifying the equation, we have:

Output: y = a + bx

To determine the values of a and b, we can use any two of the given input-output pairs.

Taking the first and third pairs:

For Input: 5, Output: -31

-31 = a + 5b    ........(1)

For Input: -11, Output: 49

49 = a - 11b    ........(2)

Solving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):

-80 = 16b

Dividing both sides by 16:

b = -5

Substituting b = -5 into equation (1):

-31 = a + 5(-5)

-31 = a - 25

a = -31 + 25

a = -6

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -6 + (-5x)

Simplifying further, we get:

Output: y = -5x - 6
