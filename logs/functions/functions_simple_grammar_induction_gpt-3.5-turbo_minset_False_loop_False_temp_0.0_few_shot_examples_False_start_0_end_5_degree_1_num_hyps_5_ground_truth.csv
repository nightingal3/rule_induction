    Based on the given data, we can write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Let's denote y as the output and x as the input.

From the data, we can observe that the coefficients a and b are not constant across all inputs. So, we will treat a and b as variables.

Using the first data point (-10, -213), we can substitute the values of x and y into the function:

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1

Simplifying this equation, we get:

-213 = a - 10b

By rearranging the equation, we obtain a in terms of b:

a = 213 - 10b

Now, we can substitute the second data point (9, 167) into the function:

167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1

Simplifying this equation:

167 = a + 9b

Substituting the value of a from the previous equation into this equation, we get:

167 = (213 - 10b) + 9b

Simplifying further:

167 = 213 - b

Rearranging the equation, we find b in terms of a:

b = 213 - 167

b = 46

Substituting the value of b into the equation a = 213 - 10b, we can solve for a:

a = 213 - 10(46)

a = 213 - 460

a = -247

Therefore, the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 can be written as:

y = -247x^0 + 46x^1

Simplified form: y = -247 + 46x

    The outputs seem to be related to the inputs in a linear manner. To capture this relationship, we can use the linear function y = ax + b.

To find the values of a and b, we can use two of the given input-output pairs.

Using the pairs (-10, -213) and (9, 167), we can solve for a and b:

-213 = -10a + b 
167 = 9a + b

Subtracting these two equations gives:
-380 = -19a 
a = 380/19 = 20

Substituting this value of a into one of the equations, we find:
9 * 20 + b = 167
180 + b = 167
b = -13

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
Output: y = 20x - 13

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, let's try to find a function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Looking at the data, we can observe that for each input value x, the corresponding output y can be obtained by multiplying x by a certain coefficient and adding a constant term. Let's denote the constant term as a0 and the coefficient of x as a1.

Thus, the function can be expressed as:

Output: y = a0 + a1x

To find the values of a0 and a1, we can use any two data points. Let's choose the first and second data points (-10, -213) and (9, 167):

-213 = a0 + a1(-10)   ...(1)
167 = a0 + a1(9)      ...(2)

Simplifying equation (1), we get:

-213 = a0 - 10a1

Simplifying equation (2), we get:

167 = a0 + 9a1

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables (a0 and a1). By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a0 and a1 and obtain the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Solving the system of linear equations, we find:

a0 = -243
a1 = 3.0

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -243 + 3.0x
