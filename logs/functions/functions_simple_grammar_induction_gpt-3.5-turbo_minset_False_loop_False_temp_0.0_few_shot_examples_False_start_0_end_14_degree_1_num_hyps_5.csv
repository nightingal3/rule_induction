"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to use the given input-output pairs and solve the system of equations.

Let's denote the input as x and the output as y.
We can write the equations as follows:

Equation 1: -10^0*a + (-10)^1*b = -213
Equation 2: 9^0*a + 9^1*b = 167
Equation 3: 4^0*a + 4^1*b = 67
Equation 4: (-3)^0*a + (-3)^1*b = -73
Equation 5: 20^0*a + 20^1*b = 387

Simplifying each equation, we get:

Equation 1: a - 10b = -213
Equation 2: a + 9b = 167
Equation 3: a + 4b = 67
Equation 4: a - 3b = -73
Equation 5: a + 20b = 387

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = 127 and b = 25.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 127x^0 + 25x^1

Simplifying further:

Output: y = 127 + 25x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    y = ax^0 + bx^1

For each input x, we can determine the corresponding output y using the given data points. Based on the provided inputs and outputs, we can set up the following system of equations:

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1   (equation 1)
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1         (equation 2)
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1          (equation 3)
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1       (equation 4)
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1       (equation 5)

Simplifying the equations, we get:

-213 = a - 10b   (equation 1)
167 = a + 9b     (equation 2)
67 = a + 4b      (equation 3)
-73 = a - 3b     (equation 4)
387 = a + 20b    (equation 5)

To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution. From equation 4, we can isolate a:

a = -73 + 3b

Substituting this expression for a in equations 1, 2, 3, and 5, we get:

-213 = (-73 + 3b) - 10b       (equation 1)
167 = (-73 + 3b) + 9b         (equation 2)
67 = (-73 + 3b) + 4b          (equation 3)
387 = (-73 + 3b) + 20b        (equation 5)

Simplifying these equations, we have:

-213 = -73 - 7b               (equation 1)
167 = -73 + 12b               (equation 2)
67 = -73 + 7b                 (equation 3)
387 = -73 + 23b               (equation 5)

Rearranging the equations, we find:

7b = -140              (equation 1)
12b = 240              (equation 2)
7b = 140               (equation 3)
23b = 460              (equation 5)

Dividing both sides of equations 1, 2, 3, and 5 by 7, 12, 7, and 23 respectively, we get:

b = -20
b = 20
b = 20
b = 20

Substituting these values of b in equations 1, 2, 3, and 5, we can solve for a:

-213 = -73 - 7(-20)
-213 = -73 + 140
a = -213 + 73 + 140
a = 0

167 = -73 + 12(20)
167 = -73 + 240
a = 167 + 73 - 240
a = 0

67 = -73 + 7(20)
67 = -73 + 140
a = 67 + 73 - 140
a = 0

387 = -73 + 23(20)
387 = -73 + 460
a = 387 + 73 - 460
a = 0

Based on the calculations, we find that a = 0 and b = 20.

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = 0x^0 + 20x^1

Simplifying, the function can be written as:

Output: y = 20x

    The function can be written as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

To find the values of a and b, we can use the provided input-output pairs.

1) For the first pair (-18, 339):
339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
339 = a + (-18)b
339 = a - 18b   ----(1)

2) For the second pair (0, -3):
-3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-3 = a + 0 (since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1)
-3 = a   ----(2)

3) For the third pair (5, -98):
-98 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-98 = a + 5b   ----(3)

4) For the fourth pair (-3, 54):
54 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
54 = a - 3b   ----(4)

5) For the fifth pair (-16, 301):
301 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
301 = a - 16b   ----(5)

Using equations 2, 3, 4, and 5 to substitute for ""a"" in equation 1:

339 = (-3) - 18b
339 = -3 - 18b
342 = -18b
b = -342/18
b = -19

Substituting the value of b into equation 2: 
-3 = a

Therefore, a = -3 and b = -19.

Thus, the relationship between input and output is given by the function:

Output: y = -3x^0 - 19x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs provided, we can use the two given expressions: y = ax^0 + bx^1.

By substituting the given inputs and outputs into this expression and solving for the coefficients a and b, we can determine the function.

Substituting the first input and output:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
339 = a(1) + b(-18)
339 = a - 18b              (Equation 1)

Substituting the second input and output:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
-3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-3 = a(1) + b(0)
-3 = a                    (Equation 2)

Using Equation 2, we know that a = -3.

Substituting the third input and output:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
-98 = (-3)(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-98 = -3 + 5b
-95 = 5b
b = -19                (Equation 3)

Now we have a = -3 and b = -19.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can form a system of equations:

1. -18 = a(0)^0 + b(-18)^1
2. 0 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
3. 5 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
4. -3 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
5. -16 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1

Simplifying these equations, we have:

1. -18 = a + (-18)b
2. 0 = a
3. 5 = a + 5b
4. -3 = a - 3b
5. -16 = a - 16b

From equation 2, we can determine that a = 0. Substituting this value into equations 1, 3, 4, and 5, we get:

1. -18 = 0 + (-18)b => -18 = -18b => b = 1
3. 5 = 0 + 5(1) => 5 = 5
4. -3 = 0 - 3(1) => -3 = -3
5. -16 = 0 - 16(1) => -16 = -16

So, the coefficients a and b are a = 0 and b = 1.

    Function: 
Output: y = -6x^0 + 7x^1

Explanation: 
Given the input-output pairs, we can write two equations in terms of variables a and b:

For the first input-output pair (5, -31):
-31 = -6*5^0 + 7*5^1
-31 = -6*1 + 7*5
-31 = -6 + 35
-31 = 29

For the second input-output pair (9, -51):
-51 = -6*9^0 + 7*9^1
-51 = -6*1 + 7*9
-51 = -6 + 63
-51 = 57

For the third input-output pair (-11, 49):
49 = -6*(-11)^0 + 7*(-11)^1
49 = -6*1 + 7*(-11)
49 = -6 - 77
49 = -83

For the fourth input-output pair (-4, 14):
14 = -6*(-4)^0 + 7*(-4)^1
14 = -6*1 + 7*(-4)
14 = -6 - 28
14 = -34

For the fifth input-output pair (-12, 54):
54 = -6*(-12)^0 + 7*(-12)^1
54 = -6*1 + 7*(-12)
54 = -6 - 84
54 = -90

Solving these equations, we get the values of a and b:
a = -6
b = 7

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = -6x^0 + 7x^1

    y = ax^0 + bx^1

For the first two inputs and outputs:

Using the first input and output:
-31 = a(5^0) + b(5^1)
-31 = a + 5b

Using the second input and output:
-51 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)
-51 = a + 9b

Now we have a system of equations:

a + 5b = -31   (Equation 1)
a + 9b = -51   (Equation 2)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

Multiply Equation 1 by -9 and Equation 2 by 5:

-9a - 45b = 279   (Equation 3)
5a + 45b = -255   (Equation 4)

Adding Equation 3 and Equation 4:

-4a = 24

Dividing both sides by -4:

a = -6

Substituting the value of a back into Equation 1:

-6 + 5b = -31
5b = -25
b = -5

Substituting the values of a and b back into the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1:

y = -6(0) - 5x^1
y = -5x

    Based on the provided inputs and outputs, we can find the relationship as:

Input: 5 -> Output: -31 -> -31 = a(5^0) + b(5^1) -> -31 = a + 5b

Input: 9 -> Output: -51 -> -51 = a(9^0) + b(9^1) -> -51 = a + 9b

Input: -11 -> Output: 49 -> 49 = a((-11)^0) + b((-11)^1) -> 49 = a - 11b

Input: -4 -> Output: 14 -> 14 = a((-4)^0) + b((-4)^1) -> 14 = a - 4b

Input: -12 -> Output: 54 -> 54 = a((-12)^0) + b((-12)^1) -> 54 = a - 12b

Simplifying these equations, we get:

-31 = a + 5b  ->  Eq1
-51 = a + 9b  ->  Eq2
49 = a - 11b  ->  Eq3
14 = a - 4b  ->  Eq4
54 = a - 12b  ->  Eq5

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

By solving Eq1 and Eq2:
From Eq1: a = -31 - 5b
Substituting this in Eq2:
-51 = (-31 - 5b) + 9b
20 = 4b
b = 5

Substituting this value of b in Eq1:
-31 = a + 5(5)
-31 = a + 25
a = -56
