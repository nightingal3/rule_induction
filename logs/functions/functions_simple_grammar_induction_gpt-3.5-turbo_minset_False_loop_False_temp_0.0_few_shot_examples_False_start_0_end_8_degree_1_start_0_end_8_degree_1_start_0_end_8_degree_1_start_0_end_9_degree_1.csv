"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given points to solve for the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the first point (-10, -213), we can substitute the values into the equation:
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10)b

Using the second point (9, 167):
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Using the third point (4, 67):
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Using the fourth point (-3, -73):
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

Using the fifth point (20, 387):
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Now we have a system of equations:
-213 = a + (-10)b
167 = a + 9b
67 = a + 4b
-73 = a - 3b
387 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = 3 and b = 20.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
Output: y = 3x^0 + 20x^1
