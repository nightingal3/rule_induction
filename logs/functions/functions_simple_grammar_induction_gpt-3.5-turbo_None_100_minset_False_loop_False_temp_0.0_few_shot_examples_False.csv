"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the method of least squares to fit a linear equation to the given data points. The linear equation can be written in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 represents the constant term and x^1 represents the coefficient of x.

Using the given data points, we can set up a system of equations:

1907 = a(96)^0 + b(96)^1
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
927 = a(47)^0 + b(47)^1
-1653 = a(-82)^0 + b(-82)^1
-1373 = a(-68)^0 + b(-68)^1

Simplifying the equations, we get:

1907 = a + 96b
67 = a + 4b
927 = a + 47b
-1653 = a - 82b
-1373 = a - 68b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Using a calculator or a system of equations solver, we find that a = 23 and b = 19.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 23x^0 + 19x^1

Simplifying further, we get:

y = 23 + 19x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's substitute the given inputs and outputs into the equation:

For the first pair (64, -1219):
-1219 = a(64^0) + b(64^1)
-1219 = a + 64b

For the second pair (-82, 1555):
1555 = a(-82^0) + b(-82^1)
1555 = a - 82b

For the third pair (15, -288):
-288 = a(15^0) + b(15^1)
-288 = a + 15b

For the fourth pair (19, -364):
-364 = a(19^0) + b(19^1)
-364 = a + 19b

For the fifth pair (74, -1409):
-1409 = a(74^0) + b(74^1)
-1409 = a + 74b

We now have a system of equations:

-1219 = a + 64b
1555 = a - 82b
-288 = a + 15b
-364 = a + 19b
-1409 = a + 74b

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b, which will define the function.

Using a calculator or a system of equations solver, we find that a = -5 and b = -15.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -5x^0 - 15x^1

Simplifying, we get:

y = -5 - 15x

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given data points to solve for the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the first data point (67, 1359), we can substitute the values into the equation:

1359 = a(67^0) + b(67^1)
1359 = a + 67b

Using the second data point (72, 1459), we can substitute the values into the equation:

1459 = a(72^0) + b(72^1)
1459 = a + 72b

Using the third data point (20, 419), we can substitute the values into the equation:

419 = a(20^0) + b(20^1)
419 = a + 20b

Using the fourth data point (-27, -521), we can substitute the values into the equation:

-521 = a((-27)^0) + b((-27)^1)
-521 = a - 27b

Using the fifth data point (37, 759), we can substitute the values into the equation:

-50 = a - 50b
54 = a + 54b
30 = a + 30b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Adding the second and third equations, we get:

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the method of least squares to fit a linear equation to the given data points. The linear equation can be written in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 represents the constant term and x^1 represents the coefficient of x.

Using the given data points, we can set up a system of equations:

-893 = a(74)^0 + b(74)^1
-773 = a(64)^0 + b(64)^1
-929 = a(77)^0 + b(77)^1
391 = a(-33)^0 + b(-33)^1
-677 = a(56)^0 + b(56)^1

Simplifying the equations, we get:

-893 = a + 74b
-773 = a + 64b
-929 = a + 77b
391 = a - 33b
-677 = a + 56b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Using a matrix representation, the system of equations can be written as:

| 1  74 | | a |   | -893 |
| 1  64 | | b | = | -773 |
| 1  77 |         | -929 |

| 1  56 |         | -677 |

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = -1.5 and b = -10.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's substitute the given inputs and outputs into the equation:

For the first pair (-51, -751):
-751 = a(-51)^0 + b(-51)^1
-751 = a + (-51)b

For the second pair (-37, -541):

For the first pair (74, -1170):
-1170 = a(74^0) + b(74^1)
-1170 = a + 74b

For the second pair (93, -1474):

-818 = a + 52b

For the fourth pair (-80, 1294):
