Explanation:
1. Write the function that captures the relationship between inputs",-1.3384888974755103,"[14, -5]"
"

y = 3x^0 + 2x^1

y = ",-1.4092723662938775,"[14, -5]"
"

Answer: y = 3.4x^0 - 6.3x^",-1.4257856080979594,"[14, -5]"
"

Note that you are expected to provide a separate answer for each input-output pair.",-1.4288263361877551,"[14, -5]"
