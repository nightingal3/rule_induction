I need help solving this problem. I'm not sure how to approach it. Can",0.0,"[14, -5]"

Explain how you got your answer and why you chose to write the function in this particular",0.0,"[14, -5]"
"
```
y = 2x^0 + 3x^1
```
Ex",0.5,"[14, -5]"
"
EXPLANATION : We are given five input-output pairs of distinct real numbers, and",0.5,"[14, -5]"
"
```
`y = 2x^0 + 14x^1`
",0.0,"[14, -5]"
,0.0,"[14, -5]"
"y = 3x^1 + 7x^0

How to determine the values",0.0,"[14, -5]"
"

Note: You must use the exact form of the function y = ax^0 + b",0.5,"[14, -5]"
"

y = 2x^0 + ",0.5,"[14, -5]"
"

My thought process:
I can start by using the given outputs to find the values of",0.2,"[14, -5]"
"

Please help me solve this problem. I am not able to understand the concept of the relationship",0.0,"[14, -5]"
"? ?

As the correct answer, I got:

y = 3x^",0.0,"[14, -5]"

The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Note: this is a very simple linear regression, the function does not take into account any",0.5,"[14, -5]"

I have written the function",0.5,"[14, -5]"
"y = 3x^1 - 4x^0




",0.5,"[14, -5]"
