"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the function that captures the relationship is a quadratic equation. Let's assume the function as y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given data points.

Using the first data point (-10, -213), we can substitute the values into the function:

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10)b

Using the second data point (9, 167):

167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Using the third data point (4, 67):

67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Using the fourth data point (-3, -73):

-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

Using the fifth data point (20, 387):

387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

-213 = a + (-10)b   ...(1)
167 = a + 9b         ...(2)
67 = a + 4b          ...(3)
-73 = a - 3b         ...(4)
387 = a + 20b        ...(5)

Solving this system of equations will yield the values of a and b, which will allow us to write the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems like the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, where a and b are coefficients. 

Let's calculate the values of a and b using the given data points:

Using the first data point (-10, -213):
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10b)

Using the second data point (9, 167):
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Using the third data point (4, 67):
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Using the fourth data point (-3, -73):
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

Using the fifth data point (20, 387):
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

1: -213 = a + (-10b)
2: 167 = a + 9b
3: 67 = a + 4b
4: -73 = a - 3b
5: 387 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b, which will allow us to write the function:

From equation 1: a = -213 + 10b
Substituting this into equations 2, 3, 4, and 5:

167 = (-213 + 10b) + 9b
67 = (-213 + 10b) + 4b
-73 = (-213 + 10b) - 3b
387 = (-213 + 10b) + 20b

Simplifying these equations:

167 = -213 + 19b
67 = -213 + 14b
-73 = -213 + 7b
387 = -213 + 30b

We can write these equations as a matrix equation:
⎡1   -19⎤     ⎡-213⎤     ⎡167⎤
⎢1   -14⎥  *  ⎢-213⎥  =  ⎢67 ⎥
⎢1   -7 ⎥     ⎢-213⎥     ⎢-73 ⎥
⎣1   -30⎦     ⎣-213⎦     ⎣387⎦

Using matrix inversion to solve for the coefficients:
⎡a⎤     ⎡1   -19⎤^(-1)    ⎡-213⎤     ⎡167⎤
⎢ ⎥  =  ⎢1   -14⎥      *  ⎢-213⎥  =  ⎢67 ⎥
⎢b⎥     ⎢1   -7 ⎥         ⎢-213⎥     ⎢-73 ⎥
⎣ ⎦     ⎣1   -30⎦         ⎣-213⎦     ⎣387⎦

Calculating the inverse of the matrix:
⎡1   -19⎤^(-1) = ⎡-8/286⎤
⎢1   -14⎥           ⎢162/286⎥
⎢1   -7 ⎥           ⎢-144/286⎥
⎣1   -30⎦           ⎣276/286⎦

Multiplying the inverse of the matrix by the output values:
⎡a⎤     ⎡-8/286⎤    ⎡-213⎤     ⎡167⎤
⎢ ⎥  =  ⎢162/286⎥  *  ⎢-213⎥  =  ⎢67 ⎥
⎢b⎥     ⎢-144/286⎥    ⎢-213⎥     ⎢-73 ⎥
⎣ ⎦     ⎣276/286⎦    ⎣-213⎦     ⎣387⎦

Calculating the values of a and b:
a = (-8/286)(-213) + (162/286)(-213) + (-144/286)(-213) + (276/286)(-213) = -183.48
b = (-8/286)(167) + (162/286)(67) + (-144/286)(-73) + (276/286)(387) = 10.84

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = -183.48x^0 + 10.84x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's first observe the pattern. 

From the given inputs and outputs, we can deduce that the input value is related to the output value through a combination of exponential and linear functions. 

Let's assume the function to be in the form:
y = a * x^0 + b * x^1

Substituting the given inputs and outputs into the equation, we can solve for the coefficients:

For the input -10 and output -213:
-213 = a * (-10)^0 + b * (-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10)b

For the input 9 and output 167:
167 = a * 9^0 + b * 9^1
167 = a + 9b

For the input 4 and output 67:
67 = a * 4^0 + b * 4^1
67 = a + 4b

For the input -3 and output -73:
-73 = a * (-3)^0 + b * (-3)^1
-73 = a + (-3)b

For the input 20 and output 387:
387 = a * 20^0 + b * 20^1
387 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, I can observe that the relationship between the input and output values can be approximated using a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

By plugging in the given input-output pairs into the equation, we can solve for the coefficients a and b. Let's denote the input as x and the output as y:

For the input x = -10, the output y = -213:
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10)b

For the input x = 9, the output y = 167:
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

For the input x = 4, the output y = 67:
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

For the input x = -3, the output y = -73:
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

For the input x = 20, the output y = 387:
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b:

From the first and third equation, we have:
a + (-10)b = -213
a + 4b = 67

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation:
(-10)b - 4b = -213 - 67
-14b = -280
b = 20

Substituting the value of b in the second equation, we can solve for a:
a + 4(20) = 67
a + 80 = 67
a = -13

Hence, the function that best captures the relationship between the input and output values is:
Output: y = -13x^0 + 20x^1
Simplified: y = -13 + 20x.

Using the five input-output pairs provided:
