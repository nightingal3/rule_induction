"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to recognize that this is a linear function where ax^0 is the constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is the term with x. Therefore, the function we are trying to find will look like y = a + bx.

We can use two points to calculate the coefficients a and b.

Let's use the following two points: (9, 167) and (-10, -213).

We'll set up two equations based on these two points:

1. For x = 9: 167 = a + 9b
2. For x = -10: -213 = a - 10b

Next, we solve this system of linear equations for a and b:

From equation 1:
a = 167 - 9b

Substitute a from equation 1 into equation 2:
-213 = (167 - 9b) - 10b
-213 = 167 - 9b - 10b
-213 = 167 - 19b
-213 - 167 = -19b
-380 = -19b
b = 20

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into the equation for a:
a = 167 - 9b
a = 167 - 9(20)
a = 167 - 180
a = -13

Thus, the function that describes the data is:
y = -13 + 20x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
