    Based on the given data, it is possible to see that the output values can be represented using a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x represents the input value. 

By observing the input and output values, we can find the coefficients of the quadratic function as follows:

For Input: -18, Output: 339
a + (-18)b = 339           (Equation 1)

For Input: 0, Output: -3
a + 0b = -3                  (Equation 2)

For Input: -16, Output: 301

To solve this system of equations, we can rewrite it in matrix form:

| 1    0  |  | b | =  |  -3   |
| 1    5  |    |     | = | -98 |
| 1   -3  |    |     |   | 54   |
| 1  -16 |    |     |   | 301 |

Using matrix inversion, we can solve for a and b:

Let's assume the equation to be y = ax^0 + bx^1, where ax^0 represents the constant term and bx^1 represents the linear term.

By substituting the given inputs and outputs, we can find the values of a and b that best fit the data.

When x = 5, y = -31

The general form of a linear function is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. In this case, since the slope is negative, the equation becomes y = (-mx) + b.

-169 = a + (-11)b

For the input 20, the output is 265:
265 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
265 = a + 20b

For the input -10, the output is -155:
-155 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1

    The pattern in the given inputs and outputs can be captured by a quadratic function of the form:

Output (y) = ax^0 + bx^1 

After analyzing the given data points, we can calculate the coefficients a and b using the method of least squares regression:

Let's denote x as the input and y as the output.

Using the first data point (-2, 17):
17 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1
17 = a - 2b

Using the second data point (7, -145):
-145 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1 
-145 = a + 7b

Using the third data point (-10, 161):
161 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
161 = a - 10b

Using the fourth data point (9, -181):
-181 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
-181 = a + 9b

Using the fifth data point (-20, 341):
341 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
341 = a - 20b

We now have a system of equations:

17 = a - 2b
-145 = a + 7b
161 = a - 10b
-181 = a + 9b
341 = a - 20b

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = -3 and b = -20.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can assume a linear relationship between the input and output. Therefore, the function can be written in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

For the first input and output (20, -307), we have:
-307 = a + 20b

For the second input and output (-1, 8), we have:
8 = a - b

For the third input and output (20, -307) (which is the same as the first input and output), we have:
-307 = a + 20b

For the fourth input and output (12, -187), we have:
-187 = a + 12b

For the fifth input and output (18, -277), we have:
-277 = a + 18b

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b:

From equations 1 and 3:
a + 20b = -307
a + 20b = -307 (Same as equation 1)

From equations 1 and 4:
a + 20b = -307
a + 12b = -187

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation:
20b - 12b = -307 + 187
8b = -120
b = -15

Substituting the value of b back into any of the original equations, we can solve for a:

From equation 2:
8 = a - b
8 = a - (-15)
8 = a + 15

    Since we are given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs can be written as follows:

Output = y = a(1) + bx

Now, using the given input-output pairs, we can solve for the values of a and b.

When the input is 13, the output is -66:
-66 = a(1) + 13b

When the input is -20, the output is 132:
132 = a(1) + (-20)b

When the input is 18, the output is -96:
-96 = a(1) + 18b

When the input is 0, the output is 12:
12 = a(1) + 0b
12 = a

When the input is 11, the output is -54:
-54 = a(1) + 11b

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b:

12 = a (from the fourth equation)
-66 = 12 + 13b (substitute a=12 in the first equation)
-54 = 12 + 11b (substitute a=12 in the fifth equation)

From the first equation, a = 12. Substituting this value in the second and fifth equations:

-66 = 12 + 13b
-54 = 12 + 11b

Simplifying these equations:

13b = -78            (subtract 12 from both sides in the second equation)
11b = -66            (subtract 12 from both sides in the fifth equation)

Solving for b:

b = -6              (divide both sides by 13 in the second equation)
b = -6              (divide both sides by 11 in the fifth equation)

Since both equations give the same value for b, we can conclude that b = -6.

Substituting this value of b in the first equation:

-66 = 12 + 13(-6)
-66 = 12 - 78
-66 = -66

This equation is satisfied, which means our values of a = 12 and b = -6 are correct.

Therefore, the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by the function:

Let's find the values of a and b by substituting the given data points into the equation:

For input 13, output -66:
-66 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
-66 = a + 13b    -- equation (1)

For input -20, output 132:
132 = a(-20^0) + b(-20^1)
132 = a - 20b    -- equation (2)

For input 18, output -96:
-96 = a(18^0) + b(18^1)
-96 = a + 18b    -- equation (3)

For input 0, output 12:

12 = a            -- equation (4)

For input 11, output -54:
-54 = a(11^0) + b(11^1)
-54 = a + 11b    -- equation (5)

From equations (4) and (5), we can find the value of a:
a = 12

Substituting this value of a into equations (1), (2), and (3), we can solve for b:

-66 = 12 + 13b
-78 = 13b
b = -6

-96 = 12 + 18b
-108 = 18b
b = -6

    Based on the given input-output pairs, we can see that the output values are increasing with the input values. Additionally, the relationship between the inputs and outputs follow a linear pattern. Therefore, we can model this relationship with a linear equation in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve for the coefficients. Let's solve for a and b using two of the given pairs:

Input: 10
Output: 142

142 = a(10^0) + b(10^1)
142 = a + 10b        (equation 1)

Input: 15
Output: 217

217 = a(15^0) + b(15^1)
217 = a + 15b        (equation 2)

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying equation 1 by 15:
15(142) = 15a + 150b
2130 = 15a + 150b    (equation 3)

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 3:
2130 - 217 = 15a + 150b - (a + 15b)
1913 = 14a + 135b

Dividing by 7:
1913/7 = 2a + 19.2857b

Now, let's solve for a and b.

a = (1913/7) - 19.2857b

Substituting this value of a into equation 1:
142 = [(1913/7) - 19.2857b] + 10b
142 = 273.2857/7 - 9.2857b
142 = 39.04 - 9.2857b
9.2857b = 142 - 39.04
9.2857b = 102.96
b = 102.96 / 9.2857
b ≈ 11.082

Substituting the value of b into the equation for a:
a = (1913/7) - 19.2857(11.082)
a ≈ 135.85

    Since the function is in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify it as y = a + bx.

Looking at the given input-output pairs, we can find the values of a and b.

For the first input-output pair (-1, -8):
-8 = a + b(-1)
-8 = a - b ... (1)

For the second input-output pair (5, 76):
76 = a + b(5)
76 = a + 5b ... (2)

For the third input-output pair (3, 48):

By substituting the provided inputs and outputs values into the equation, we can solve for the coefficients a and b.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's look at the given inputs and outputs:

Input: 5, Output: -26

Input: 1, Output: -14

Input: -14, Output: 31

Input: -5, Output: 4

Input: -8, Output: 13

To find the values of a and b, we can create a system of two equations using the given input-output pairs:

-26 = a * 5^0 + b * 5^1   (equation 1)
-14 = a * 1^0 + b * 1^1   (equation 2)

Equation 1 simplifies to -26 = a + 5b
Equation 2 simplifies to -14 = a + b

Now we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1, we get:

-26 - (-14) = (a + 5b) - (a + b)
-12 = 4b

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:

b = -3

Substituting this value of b into equation 2, we get:

-14 = a - 3

Adding 3 to both sides, we find:

a = -11

So the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -11x^0 - 3x^1 or y = -11 - 3x

    After analyzing the given data points, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function. Let's use the general form of a linear function, y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since x^0 equals 1 for any number, we can rewrite the function as:

y = a(1) + bx

Now, let's substitute the input-output pairs into the function and solve for a and b:

For input 5, output -26:
-26 = a(1) + b(5)

For input 1, output -14:
-14 = a(1) + b(1)

For input -14, output 31:
31 = a(1) + b(-14)

For input -5, output 4:
4 = a(1) + b(-5)

For input -8, output 13:
13 = a(1) + b(-8)

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b:

a + 5b = -26   (Equation 1)
a + b = -14     (Equation 2)
a - 14b = 31   (Equation 3)
a - 5b = 4      (Equation 4)
a - 8b = 13    (Equation 5)

By solving these equations simultaneously, we find a = -2 and b = -4. 

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -2(1) + (-4x)
y = -2 - 4x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    First, let's assume that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations:

    64 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
    22 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
    -62 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
    36 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
    113 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1

Since any number raised to the power of zero is equal to 1, the equations simplify to:

    64 = a + (-9)b
    22 = a + (-3)b
    -62 = a + (9)b
    36 = a + (-5)b
    113 = a + (-16)b

We now have a system of linear equations that we can solve to find the values of a and b.

Using a matrix approach, we can write the system of equations in matrix form as:

    | 1  -9 |   | a |   |  64 |
    | 1  -3 | * | b | = |  22 |
    | 1   9 |   |   |   | -62 |
    | 1  -5 |           |  36 |
    | 1 -16 |           | 113 |

Using matrix inversion, we can solve for the vector of unknowns:

    | a |   | 1  -9 |^-1   |  64 |
    | b | = | 1  -3 |   *   |  22 |
              | 1   9 |
              | 1  -5 |
              | 1 -16 |

Calculating the inverse of the coefficient matrix | 1   -9 |:

    | 1  9/7 |
    | 1/4 -1/36 |

Applying the inverse matrix to the right-hand side vector:

    | a |   | 1  9/7 |   |  64 |
    | b | = | 1/4 -1/36 | * |  22 |

Simplifying the computation:

    | a |   | 1   9/7 |   |   64  |
    | b | = | 1/4 -1/36 | * |   22  |

    | a |   | 1 + 9/7 |
    | b | = | 1/4 -1/36 |

    | a |   | 16/7 |
    | b | = | 7/36 |

Hence, the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by the function:

    Output: y = (16/7)x^0 + (7/36)x^1

Simplifying the equation:

    Output: y = 16/7 + 7/36x

    Based on the given input-output pairs, it doesn't seem like the relationship can be accurately represented by a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. However, it is possible to use another form to represent the relationship. Let's try using a quadratic equation of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c.

From the given input-output pairs, we can construct the following equations:

Equation 1: 
64 = a(-9)^2 + b(-9) + c

Equation 2:
22 = a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c

Equation 3:
-62 = a(9)^2 + b(9) + c

Equation 4:
36 = a(-5)^2 + b(-5) + c

Equation 5: 
113 = a(-16)^2 + b(-16) + c

Now, we need to solve this system of equations to find the coefficients a, b, and c.

The solution to this system of equations is a = 1, b = -3, and c = 14.

    Based on the given data, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function of the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Input: -18, Output: -265

Input: 19, Output: 253

(1) -265 = a - 18b
(2) 253 = a + 19b
(3) -223 = a - 15b
(4) 71 = a + 6b
(5) 225 = a + 17b

Solving this system of equations using a method like Gaussian elimination:

[1  19]   [71]  ==>  [225]

-199 = 37b
b = -199 / 37 ≈ -5.378

a ≈ 103.27

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given input-output pairs, we can observe that the exponent of x remains constant (x^0), while the output is directly proportional to x (x^1). Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be written as follows:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Here, the coefficient of x^0 can be denoted as a, and the coefficient of x^1 can be denoted as b.

By substituting the input-output pairs into the equation, we can solve for the values of a and b:

For the input-output pair (0, -15):

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the method of least squares to fit a linear equation to the data.

From the given input-output pairs, we can observe that the output (y) can be represented as a linear equation of the input (x) with two unknown coefficients a and b.

Let's consider y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation, we get:

-15 = a(0^0) + b(0^1)
=> -15 = a + 0b
=> -15 = a

-35 = a(-5^0) + b(-5^1)
=> -35 = a - 5b

-31 = a(-4^0) + b(-4^1)
=> -31 = a - 4b

5 = a(5^0) + b(5^1)
=> 5 = a + 5b

-63 = a(-12^0) + b(-12^1)
=> -63 = a - 12b

Simplifying the above equations:

a = -15

-35 = -15 - 5b

    From the given data, we can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs follows a linear pattern. Therefore, we will assume a linear function of the form y = ax + b, where a and b are constants. 

To find the values of a and b, we can select any two points from the given data and use them to form a system of equations. Let's select the first two points (9, 133) and (19, 283):

Using the first point:
x = 9, y = 133
133 = a * 9 + b      -> Equation 1

Using the second point:
x = 19, y = 283
283 = a * 19 + b     -> Equation 2

Simplifying Equation 1 and Equation 2, we get:

9a + b = 133      -> Equation 3
19a + b = 283     -> Equation 4

Subtracting Equation 3 from Equation 4, we eliminate b:

19a + b - (9a + b) = 283 - 133
10a = 150
a = 15

Now substituting the value of a (a = 15) into Equation 3, we can solve for b:

For the first pair (9, 133):
133 = a + b*9

    The given data points can be represented by a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Using the given input-output pairs, we can write down a system of equations:

13 = a(1) + b(13)
55 = a(0) + b(55)

-20 = a(1) + b(-20)
-44 = a(0) + b(-44)

15 = a(1) + b(15)
61 = a(0) + b(61)

-1 = a(1) + b(-1)
13 = a(0) + b(13)

-14 = a(1) + b(-14)
-26 = a(0) + b(-26)

Simplifying these equations, we get:
13 = a + 13b
55 = 55b

-20 = -20b
-44 = -44b

15 = a + 15b
61 = 61b

-1 = a - b
13 = 13b

-14 = a - 14b
-26 = -26b

From equation 2, we know that b = 1.

Substituting this value of b in equations 1, 3, 4, and 5, we can solve for the values of a:

13 = a + 13(1) => a = 0
15 = a + 15(1) => a = 0
-1 = a - 1 => a = 0
-14 = a - 14(1) => a = 0

Therefore, a = 0 and b = 1.

    From the given inputs and outputs, we can see that the relationship between the input and output values can be modeled by a linear equation in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the given data points, we can solve for the values of a and b:

For the first data point (-16, 109), we have: 109 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1 => 109 = a + (-16)b

For the second data point (-3, 18), we have: 18 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1 => 18 = a + (-3)b

For the third data point (2, -17), we have: -17 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1 => -17 = a + 2b

For the fourth data point (12, -87), we have: -87 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1 => -87 = a + 12b

For the fifth data point (5, -38), we have: -38 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1 => -38 = a + 5b

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = -7 and b = 5.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function. The general form of a linear function is y = mx + b, where m represents the slope and b represents the y-intercept.

Using the given data points, we can determine the values of m and b in the linear function.

When the input is -16, the output is 109. So, we have the equation:
109 = m * (-16) + b    (Equation 1)

When the input is -3, the output is 18. So, we have the equation:
18 = m * (-3) + b    (Equation 2)

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1, we get:
109 - 18 = m * (-16) - m * (-3) + b - b
91 = -16m + 3m
91 = -13m

Dividing both sides by -13, we find:
m = -7

Substituting this value of m into Equation 1, we get:
109 = (-7) * (-16) + b
109 = 112 + b

Subtracting 112 from both sides, we find:
b = -3

    The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs in the given data can be written as:

Output = y = ax^0 + bx^1

Considering the given inputs and outputs, we can rewrite the function as:

Output = y = a + bx

where a and b are constants that represent the coefficients of the function.

To find the values of a and b, we can solve a system of linear equations using two data points from the given pairs of input and output.

Using the data points (-9, 162) and (-4, 82), we can write two equations:

162 = a + b(-9)     (Equation 1)
82 = a + b(-4)      (Equation 2)

Simplifying both equations, we get:

162 = a - 9b         (Equation 3)
82 = a - 4b          (Equation 4)

Solving the system of linear equations (Equation 3 and Equation 4), we find:

For these data points, we can observe that the output values appear to follow a linear relationship with the input values. To find the function, we can use the least squares method to fit a line to the data points.

Using the least squares method, we can find the values of a and b by minimizing the sum of squared errors between the predicted y-values and the actual y-values.

Solving for a and b:

a = (-254 + 82 + 306 + 242 + 162) / (-9 + 17 - 4 - 18 - 14) = 538 / -28 ≈ -19.214

b = (17*(-254) + (-4)*82 + (-18)*306 + (-14)*242 + (-9)*162) / (-9 + 17 - 4 - 18 - 14) = -6734 / -28 ≈ 240.5
