-218 = a(17^0) + b(17^1)
-74 = a(5^0) + b(5^1)
-50 = a(3^0) + b(3^1)
58 = a(-6^0) + b(-6^1)

Simplifying each equation, we get:

-98 = a + 7b
-218 = a + 17b
-74 = a + 5b
-50 = a + 3b
58 = a - 6b

We now have a system of linear equations. To solve it, we can use a method like Gaussian elimination.

After solving the system, we find that a = -10 and b = 14.

Therefore, the function capturing the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -10x^0 + 14x^1",0.95,"[-12, -14]"
"To find the pattern in the given data, we can write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. From the given inputs and outputs, we can observe the following pattern:

Input:  7  | Output: -98
Input: 17  | Output: -218
Input:  5  | Output: -74
Input:  3  | Output: -50
Input: -6  | Output:  58

From the outputs, we can see that they are all negative. Additionally, the outputs decrease rapidly as the inputs increase. This suggests a quadratic relationship, or possibly an exponential relationship. 

However, in the provided form y = ax^0 + bx^1, the term x^0 is a constant value of 1. Therefore, we cannot represent a quadratic or exponential function directly in this form.

To best capture the pattern observed, the given data suggests a linear relationship. We can write the equation in the general form y = bx + c, where b and c are constants.

To determine the values of b and c, we can use any two of the given data points. Let's use the points (7, -98) and (17, -218).

Using the point (7, -98):
-98 = 7b + c    (Equation 1)

Using the point (17, -218):
-218 = 17b + c   (Equation 2)

To solve this system of equations, we can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

-218 - (-98) = 17b + c - 7b - c
-218 + 98 = 17b - 7b
-120 = 10b
b = -12

Substituting b = -12 back into Equation 1:

-98 = 7(-12) + c
-98 = -84 + c
c = -98 + 84
c = -14

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -12x - 14",0.8,"[-12, -14]"
"The given data does not seem to follow a simple linear or quadratic relationship. However, we can still come up with a function that captures the pattern to some extent. 

Based on the provided data points, the pattern seems to be a decreasing exponential function. Let's assume the function follows the form:

Output: y = a * exp(-b * x)

To determine the coefficients a and b, we can use any two input-output pairs. Let's use the first and the last:

When x = 7, y = -98
-98 = a * exp(-b * 7)   -- (1)

When x = -6, y = 58
58 = a * exp(-b * -6)    -- (2)

Now, we can solve the above equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b:

Dividing equation (1) by equation (2):

(-98)/(58) = (a * exp(-b * 7))/(a * exp(6b))
-1.6897 = exp(-13b)

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(-1.6897) = -13b

Solving for b:

b = ln(-1.6897)/-13

Substituting the value of b into equation (1) or (2) to find a:

-98 = a * exp(-7 * (ln(-1.6897)/-13))
a = -98 / exp(-7 * (ln(-1.6897)/-13))
a ≈ 24.287

Now, we can write the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs:

"Based on the given input-output pairs, we can see that the function follows the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where the exponent of x is always 1. 

By substituting the given input-output pairs into the function, we can determine the values of a and b.

When input = 7, output = -98:

-98 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1
-98 = a + 7b         ... (1)

When input = 17, output = -218:

-218 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
-218 = a + 17b        ... (2)

We now have a system of equations (1) and (2) that can be solved to find the values of a and b.

From equation (1): -98 = a + 7b
From equation (2): -218 = a + 17b

Solving this system of linear equations, we can find that a = -7 and b = -11.

We can solve the system of equations to find the values of coefficients a and b.

Solving the system, we find:
a = -2
b = -12

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

From the first equation, we can solve for a: 
a = -98 - 7b

Substituting this value of a into the second equation:
-218 = (-98 - 7b) + 17b
-218 = -98 + 10b
10b = -120
b = -12

Now, substitute this value of b back into the first equation to solve for a:
-98 = a + (7 * -12)
-98 = a - 84
a = -14

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

The general form of a linear function is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. In this case, since the slope is negative, the equation becomes y = (-mx) + b.

To find the coefficients a and b that best fit the given data, we can use any two input-output pairs and solve the resulting system of equations.

Using the pairs (7, -98) and (17, -218), we can set up the following equations:

Solving these three equations simultaneously will give us the values of a and b.

Adding the first two equations:

By solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

Multiplying equation (1) by 13 and equation (2) by 9, we get:

13(160) = 9a + 117b
9(228) = 13a + 117b

After simplification, we have:

2052 = 13a + 117b

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

16a - 4b + c = -61

Solving for b, we find:
b = 391/23 ≈ 17

Substituting b = 17 into the first equation, we get:

b = -162 / -9
b = 18

Substituting the value of b = 18 into equation (2):

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b:

12 = a (from the fourth equation)
-66 = 12 + 13b (substitute a=12 in the first equation)
-54 = 12 + 11b (substitute a=12 in the fifth equation)

From the first equation, a = 12. Substituting this value in the second and fifth equations:

-72/5 = a + c

Since the value of a + c is a constant, we can conclude that a + c = -72/5.

Substituting this back into one of the equations, we find:

a = -66 + 72/5
a = -330/5 + 72/5
a = -258/5

From equation (4), we can directly determine the value of 'a':

a = 12

Substituting this value back into the other equations, we can solve for 'b'. Solving the system of equations, we find:

5) Input: 11, Output: -54
-54 = a + 11b

From equation 4, we have found that a = 12. By substituting this value into equations 1, 2, and 3, we have:

Adding Equation 2 and Equation 3:

b = 15

Substituting the value of b back into the first equation:

Multiplying equation 1 by 15:

Let's assign the inputs to x and outputs to y:

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

From the first equation, we have:
a = -292 + 17b

Substitute this value of a into the second equation:
-105 = (-292 + 17b) + (-6)b
-105 = (-292 + 17b - 6b)
-105 = -292 + 11b

b = 17

Substitute the value of b into the first equation:
a = -292 + 17(17)
a = -292 + 289

"The pattern in the data suggests that the output (y) is a linear combination of the input (x) in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

By substituting the given inputs and outputs into the equation, we can calculate the values of a and b.

-17 = a(1)^0 + b(1)^1    =>    -17 = a + b
-292 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1    =>    -292 = a - 17b

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we find that a = -3 and b = -14.

To find the values of a and b, we can use any two input-output pairs. Let's choose the pairs (-17, -292) and (-6, -105).

For the first pair:
-292 = a(1) + b(-17) 
-292 = a - 17b   ... (Equation 1)

For the second pair:
-105 = a(1) + b(-6) 
-105 = a - 6b   ... (Equation 2)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying Equation 1 by 6 and Equation 2 by 17 gives:

-1752 = 6a - 102b    ... (Equation 3)
-1785 = 17a - 6b     ... (Equation 4)

Adding Equation 3 and Equation 4:

-1752 + (-1785) = 6a - 102b + 17a - 6b
-3537 = 23a - 108b

Dividing by 3:

-1179 = 7a - 36b     ... (Equation 5)

Now let's multiply Equation 2 by 7 and Equation 1 by 6:

-735 = 7a - 42b      ... (Equation 6)
-1752 = 6a - 102b    ... (Equation 7)

Adding Equation 6 and Equation 7:

-735 + (-1752) = 7a - 42b + 6a - 102b
-2487 = 13a - 144b

Dividing by 3:

-829 = 4a - 48b      ... (Equation 8)

Now we have a system of two equations (Equation 5 and Equation 8) with two unknowns (a and b).

Subtracting Equation 5 from Equation 8:

(-829) - (-1179) = (4a - 48b) - (7a - 36b)
-829 + 1179 = 4a - 7a - 48b + 36b
350 = -3a - 12b

Dividing by -3:

-350/3 = a + 4b

Let's solve for b:

a + 4b = -350/3    ... (Equation 9)

Using Equation 5:

-1179 = 7a - 36b

Rearranging:

7a - 36b = -1179
36b = 7a + 1179
b = (7a + 1179)/36   ... (Equation 10)

We have an equation for b (Equation 10) in terms of a, which can be substituted into Equation 9:

a + 4((7a + 1179)/36) = -350/3

Multiplying both sides by 36:

36a + 4(7a + 1179) = (-350/3)*36

Expanding and simplifying:

36a + 28a + 4716 = -350*12

64a + 4716 = -4200

64a = -8916

a = -139.125

Substituting the value of a into Equation 10:

b = (7(-139.125) + 1179)/36

b = -315/8

"To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Input: 1, Output: -14

Input: -14, Output: 31

Input: -5, Output: 4

Input: -8, Output: 13

To find the values of a and b, we can create a system of two equations using the given input-output pairs:

-26 = a * 5^0 + b * 5^1   (equation 1)
-14 = a * 1^0 + b * 1^1   (equation 2)

Equation 1 simplifies to -26 = a + 5b
Equation 2 simplifies to -14 = a + b

Now we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1, we get:

-26 - (-14) = (a + 5b) - (a + b)
-12 = 4b

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:

b = -3

Substituting this value of b into equation 2, we get:

The equation of a linear function is generally written as y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.

To find the values of m and c that best fit the data, we can use the method of least squares. This involves minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the predicted y-values and the actual y-values.

We need to find the values of c and m that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the actual outputs and the predicted outputs.

Let's try to find the values of m and c using least squares analysis:

Sum of (Predicted Output - Actual Output)^2 = (c + mx - y_1)^2 + (c + mx - y_2)^2 + ... + (c + mx - y_n)^2

In this case, we have 5 data points, so n = 5.

We can differentiate this expression with respect to c and m, and equate them to zero to find the minimum values.

Differentiating with respect to c:

∂/∂c (Sum of (c + mx - y_i)^2) = 0

2(c + mx - y_1) + 2(c + mx - y_2) + ... + 2(c + mx - y_n) = 0

Simplifying, we get:

Differentiating with respect to m:

∂/∂m (Sum of (c + mx - y_i)^2) = 0

2x_1(c + mx - y_1) + 2x_2(c + mx - y_2) + ... + 2x_n(c + mx - y_n) = 0

Simplifying, we get:

Solving the two equations simultaneously for m and c:

2nc + 2mΣx - 2Σy = 0

2mΣ(x^2) + 2cΣx - 2Σ(xy) = 0


Let's plug in the values from the given data points:

n = 5, Σx = -16, Σy = -139, Σ(x^2) = 246, Σ(xy) = 550

Simplifying the set of equations:

10c - 2m*16 - 2*(-139) = 0

2m*246 + 2c*(-16) - 2*550 = 0

Simplifying further:

10c + 32m = 278

32m - 2c = 1100

y_mean = (133 + 283 + 238 - 212 - 242) / 5 = 240

Calculating the numerator for the slope:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a linear function. Thus, the function would have the form:

Output: y = a + bx

To find the coefficients a and b, we can use two of the given input-output pairs.

Using the first pair (13, 55), we can substitute these values into the function:

55 = a + 13b

Using the second pair (-20, -44), we can substitute these values into the function:

-44 = a + (-20)b

Simplifying these two equations, we get:

a + 13b = 55  --> Equation 1
a - 20b = -44  --> Equation 2

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying Equation 2 by 13, we get:

13a - 260b = -572

Adding this equation to Equation 1, we eliminate the variable a:

13a + a + 13b - 260b = 55 - 572

14a - 247b = -517

Rearranging this equation, we get:

14a = 247b - 517

Dividing both sides by 14, we have:

a = (247b - 517)/14

Substituting this value of a into Equation 2, we get:

(247b - 517)/14 - 20b = -44

Multiplying through by 14 to eliminate the denominator, we get:

247b - 517 - 280b = -616

Combining like terms, we have:

-33b = -99

Dividing both sides by -33, we get:

b = 3

Now, substituting b = 3 into Equation 1, we get:

a + 13(3) = 55

Simplifying this equation, we have:

a + 39 = 55

Subtracting 39 from both sides, we get:

288 = -48b + 16c    (Equation 3)

Now, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3 to eliminate c:

288 - 109 = -48b + 16c - (-16b + c)

Dividing both sides by -13, we find:
m = -7

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems like the output can be represented by a quadratic equation in terms of the input.

The general form of a quadratic equation is y = ax^2 + bx + c.

To represent the given data in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can assign c = 0.

Thus, the function can be approximated as y = bx + ax^2.

By substituting the inputs and outputs provided, we can find the values of a and b:

Input: 13, Output: 177
177 = 13b + 169a

Input: 14, Output: 191
191 = 14b + 196a

Input: -8, Output: -117
-117 = -8b + 64a

Input: 3, Output: 37
37 = 3b + 9a

Input: 7, Output: 93
93 = 7b + 49a

Solving this system of equations gives us a = 5 and b = 12.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be represented as follows:

Output: y = 12x + 5x^2.",0.9,"[14, -5]"
y = 12x^0 + 14x^1,1.0,"[14, -5]"
"The given data can be represented by a quadratic equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Let's find the values of a and b.

To replace the exponent term x^1, we can replace it with just x.

For the input of 13, the output is 177. We can write this as:

177 = a(13^0) + b(13)

This simplifies to:

177 = a + 13b   ----(1)

Similarly, for the other data points, we get the following equations:

191 = a + 14b   ----(2)
-117 = a - 8b   ----(3)
37 = a + 3b   ----(4)
93 = a + 7b   ----(5)

Now, we have a system of equations (1)-(5), we can solve them simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Solving the system of equations, we get:
a = 41
b = 12

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 41x^0 + 12x^1",0.95,"[14, -5]"
"The pattern in the data can be captured by the function:

Output: y = 8x^0 + 13x^1

Explanation:
The constant term, a, is found by observing that when x = 0, y = 8x^0 = 8.
The coefficient of x, b, is obtained by noticing that the difference between consecutive output values is 15 (i.e., 191 - 177 = 15).
Hence, b = 15.

Thus, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 8 + 13x",0.9,"[14, -5]"
"Based on the given data, it appears that the function can be represented in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Let's calculate the values of a and b.

Using the first data point:
a + b = 177

Using the second data point:
a + 14b = 191

Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that a = 44 and b = 133.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = 44x^0 + 133x^1

Simplifying further, we have:

y = 44 + 133x",0.9,"[14, -5]"
"Based on the given data points, it appears that the pattern follows a quadratic form. Therefore, the function can be written as:

Output = a * x^2 + b * x + c

To determine the coefficients a, b, and c, we will need at least three data points. Let's use the first three data points to find the values of the coefficients. 

Using the data points (13, 177), (14, 191), and (-8, -117), we can set up a system of equations:

177 = a * 13^2 + b * 13 + c    --- equation 1
191 = a * 14^2 + b * 14 + c    --- equation 2
-117 = a * (-8)^2 + b * (-8) + c   --- equation 3

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a, b, and c. Let's solve it:

13^2 * a + 13 * b + c = 177
14^2 * a + 14 * b + c = 191
(-8)^2 * a + (-8) * b + c = -117

169a + 13b + c = 177
196a + 14b + c = 191
64a - 8b + c = -117

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate c:
196a + 14b + c - 169a - 13b - c = 191 - 177
27a + b = 14   --- equation 4

Subtracting 4 * equation 1 from equation 3 to eliminate c:
64a - 8b + c - 4(169a + 13b + c) = -117 - 4(177)
64a - 8b + c - 676a - 52b - 4c = -117 - 708
-612a - 60b - 3c = -825   --- equation 5

Now, let's subtract 4 * equation 4 from equation 5 to eliminate b:

-612a - 60b - 3c - 4(27a + b) = -825 - 4(14)
-612a - 60b - 3c - 108a - 4b = -825 - 56
-720a - 64b - 3c = -881  --- equation 6

Now we have two equations:

27a + b = 14   --- equation 4
-720a - 64b - 3c = -881   --- equation 6

Substituting equation 4 into equation 6:

-720a - 64(14 - 27a) - 3c = -881
-720a - 896 + 1728a - 3c = -881
1008a - 3c = 15
336a - c = 5   --- equation 7

Let's use another data point to solve for a and c. Using the data point (3, 37), we can substitute into the function:

37 = a * 3^2 + b * 3 + c
37 = 9a + 3b + c
3b = 37 - 9a - c
3b = 37 - 9a - (5 - 336a)
3b = 37 - 9a - 5 + 336a
3b = 32 + 327a
b = (32 + 327a) / 3   --- equation 8

Now, we have three equations 7, 4, and 8:

336a - c = 5   --- equation 7
27a + b = 14   --- equation 4
b = (32 + 327a) / 3   --- equation 8

Let's solve this system of equations:

Using equation 8 in equation 4:

27a + (32 + 327a) / 3 = 14
81a + 32 + 327a = 42
408a = 10
a = 10 / 408
a = 5 / 204

Substituting a into equation 8:

b = (32 + 327(5/204)) / 3
b = (32 + (1635/204)) / 3
b = (32 + 1635/204) / 3
b = ((32 * 204 + 1635) / 204) / 3
b = (6528 + 1635) / 612
b = 8163 / 612
b = 13.338235294117647

Substituting a and b into equation 7:

336(5/204) - c = 5
1680/204 - c = 5
1680 - 204c = 1020
-204c = -660
c = 660 / 204
c = 5/17

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

a + 14b = 191        (equation 2)
a - 8b = -117        (equation 3)
a + 3b = 37          (equation 4)
a + 7b = 93          (equation 5)

To solve the system of equations, we can eliminate a by subtracting equation 3 from equation 1, then subtracting equation 4 from equation 2:
(13b - (-8b)) = (177 - (-117)) => 21b = 294 => b = 14
