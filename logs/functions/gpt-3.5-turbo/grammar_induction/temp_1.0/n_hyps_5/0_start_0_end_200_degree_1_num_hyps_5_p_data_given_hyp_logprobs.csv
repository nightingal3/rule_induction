    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that there is a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. Let's call the input x and the output y.

The general form of a linear function is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

However, in this case, we can rewrite this linear function as y = a * x^0 + b * x^1, where a and b are constants.

By substituting the given inputs and outputs into this function, we can solve for a and b.

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve for a and b.

Substituting (-10, -213) into the equation:
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10)b

Substituting (9, 167) into the equation:
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Substituting (4, 67) into the equation:
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Substituting (-3, -73) into the equation:

a + 9b = 167
a + 4b = 67

    From the given inputs and outputs, it seems like the relationship between the input and output can be described by a linear equation. Let's assume the equation is:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Using the provided data points, we can set up a system of linear equations:

For the first data point (-18, 339):
339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
339 = a + -18b

For the second data point (0, -3):
-3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1

54 = a + -3b

For the fifth data point (-16, 301):
301 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
301 = a + -16b

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations to find the values of a and b.

By substituting the value of a (-3) into the other equations, we can solve for b:

339 = -3 + (-18b)
336 = -18b
b = -336/18
b = -56/3

Now, substituting the value of b into any of the equations, we can solve for a:

339 = a + (-18)(-56/3)
339 = a + 336
a = 339 - 336
a = 3

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    In order to find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's analyze the data and find a pattern or trend.

From the given data, we can observe that there is a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. To represent this relationship in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the values of a and b.

Let's calculate the values of a and b using the given input-output pairs:
1. For the first pair (-18, 339):
   339 = a*(-18)^0 + b*(-18)^1
   339 = a - 18b
   
2. For the second pair (0, -3):
   -3 = a*(0)^0 + b*(0)^1
   -3 = a
   
3. For the third pair (5, -98):
   -98 = a*(5)^0 + b*(5)^1
   -98 = a + 5b
   
4. For the fourth pair (-3, 54):
   54 = a*(-3)^0 + b*(-3)^1
   54 = a - 3b
   
5. For the fifth pair (-16, 301):
   301 = a*(-16)^0 + b*(-16)^1
   301 = a + 16b

Now, let's solve the system of equations to find the values of a and b.

From equations 3 and 5, we have:
-98 = a + 5b         (equation 3)
301 = a + 16b        (equation 5)

Subtracting equation 3 from equation 5, we can eliminate a:
301 - (-98) = (a + 16b) - (a + 5b)
399 = 11b
b = 36

Now, substitute the value of b into equation 3:
-98 = a + 5(36)
-98 = a + 180
a = -278

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can use the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

For the first input, -18, the output is 339. So we have:
339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
339 = a + (-18b)

For the second input, 0, the output is -3. So we have:
-3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-3 = a

For the third input, 5, the output is -98. So we have:
-98 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-98 = a + 5b

For the fourth input, -3, the output is 54. So we have:
54 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
54 = a - 3b

For the fifth input, -16, the output is 301. So we have:
301 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
301 = a - 16b

Now we have a system of equations to solve for a and b. We can solve this system to find the values of a and b.

From the second equation, we know that a = -3. Substituting this into the first, third, fourth, and fifth equations, we have:

339 = -3 + (-18b)
-98 = -3 + 5b
54 = -3 - 3b
301 = -3 - 16b

Simplifying these equations:

339 = -3 - 18b
-98 = 5b - 3
54 = -3 - 3b
301 = -3 - 16b

Simplifying further:

339 = -3 - 18b
-95 = 5b
54 = -3 - 3b
304 = -16b

Solving these equations:

b = -95/5
b = -19

Substituting this value of b back into one of the equations, we can solve for a:

339 = -3 + (-18)(-19)
339 = -3 + 342
339 = 339

    After examining the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the function represents a quadratic relationship. Therefore, we need to find a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2.

By substituting the given input-output pairs, we can form a system of equations:

Equation 1: 339 = a(1)^0 + b(1)^1 + c(1)^2
Equation 2: -3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1 + c(0)^2
Equation 3: -98 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1 + c(5)^2
Equation 4: 54 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1 + c(-3)^2
Equation 5: 301 = a(16)^0 + b(16)^1 + c(16)^2

Simplifying these equations, we get:

Equation 1: 339 = a + b + c
Equation 2: -3 = a
Equation 3: -98 = 1a + 5b + 25c
Equation 4: 54 = 1a - 3b + 9c
Equation 5: 301 = 1a + 16b + 256c

From Equation 2, we know a = -3. Substituting this value into Equations 1 and 5, we get:

339 = -3 + b + c
301 = -3 + 16b + 256c

Simplifying these equations, we get:

Equation 6: b + c = 342

We can plug in the values of x and y to find the values of a and b that satisfy the equation. In this case, let's assume a = c and b = d for simplicity.

Using the given data points, we have the following equations:

-61 = c * (-4^0) + d * (-4^1)   ------- (3)
262 = c * (15^0) + d * (15^1) ------ (4)
-333 = c * (-20^0) + d * (-20^1) ------- (5)

Simplifying each equation, we get:

160 = c + 9d   ------- (1)
228 = c + 13d  ------ (2)
-61 = c - 4d   ------- (3)
262 = c + 15d  ------ (4)
-333 = c - 20d ------- (5)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of c and d. Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2), we get:

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:

d = 17

Substituting this value of d into equation (1), we get:

Simplifying, we find:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can determine that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a linear equation of the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

where a and b are the coefficients that need to be determined.

Using the given input and output pairs, we can form the following system of equations:

Equation 1: -307 = a(20^0) + b(20^1)
Equation 2: 8 = a(-1^0) + b(-1^1)
Equation 3: -307 = a(20^0) + b(20^1)
Equation 4: -187 = a(12^0) + b(12^1)
Equation 5: -277 = a(18^0) + b(18^1)

Simplifying these equations, we get:

Equation 1: -307 = a + 20b
Equation 2: 8 = a - b
Equation 3: -307 = a + 20b
Equation 4: -187 = a + 12b
Equation 5: -277 = a + 18b

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

Solving Equation 2 for a, we get: a = 8 + b.
Substituting this value of a in Equation 1, we get: -307 = (8 + b) + 20b. Simplifying this equation, we get: -307 = 8 + 21b.
Rearranging and solving this equation, we get: b = (-307 - 8) / 21 = -315 / 21 = -15.

Substituting this value of b in Equation 2, we get: a = 8 - (-15) = 8 + 15 = 23.

    The given data does not seem to follow a linear or exponential pattern. However, it is possible that it could be best represented by a quadratic function. To determine the parameters a, b, and c of the quadratic function, we can use the least squares method to fit a quadratic equation to the given data. This will minimize the sum of the squared differences between the actual outputs and the values predicted by the quadratic equation.

Using the least squares method, the quadratic function that best fits the given data can be represented as follows:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

Using the given data points, we can calculate the values of a, b, and c that minimize the sum of the squared differences.

Substituting the given data points:

-307 = a*1 + b*20 + c*400

-187 = a*1 + b*12 + c*144

Input: 18, Output: -277
-277 = a*1 + b*18 + c*324

Simplifying these equations, we have:

1a + 20b + 400c = -307  (Equation 1)
1a - 1b + c = 8  (Equation 2)
1a + 20b + 400c = -307  (Equation 3)

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to determine the coefficients (a and b) in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's represent the input as x and the output as y. By substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation, we can solve for the values of a and b.

From the first pair (Input: 13, Output: -66):
-66 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
-66 = a + 13b

From the second pair (Input: -20, Output: 132):
132 = a(-20^0) + b(-20^1)
132 = a - 20b

From the third pair (Input: 18, Output: -96):
-96 = a(18^0) + b(18^1)
-96 = a + 18b

From the fourth pair (Input: 0, Output: 12):
12 = a(0^0) + b(0^1)
12 = a

From the fifth pair (Input: 11, Output: -54):
-54 = a(11^0) + b(11^1)
-54 = a + 11b

We now have a system of equations:

-66 = a + 13b   ------(1)
132 = a - 20b   ------(2)
-96 = a + 18b   ------(3)
12 = a          ------(4)
-54 = a + 11b   ------(5)

From equation (4), we get a = 12.

Substituting a = 12 into equation (1), we get -66 = 12 + 13b.
Simplifying, we find 13b = -78, which implies b = -6.

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = 12x^0 + (-6)x^1.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can solve for the values of 'a' and 'b' in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1 using the provided inputs and corresponding outputs.

Using the given inputs and outputs:

Input: 13, Output: -66
Input: -20, Output: 132
Input: 18, Output: -96
Input: 0, Output: 12
Input: 11, Output: -54

We can solve for 'a' and 'b' as follows:

For the input 13, output -66:
-66 = a*13^0 + b*13^1
-66 = a + 13b    (equation 1)

For the input -20, output 132:
132 = a*(-20)^0 + b*(-20)^1
132 = a - 20b    (equation 2)

For the input 18, output -96:
-96 = a*18^0 + b*18^1
-96 = a + 18b    (equation 3)

For the input 0, output 12:
12 = a*0^0 + b*0^1
12 = a           (equation 4)

For the input 11, output -54:
-54 = a*11^0 + b*11^1
-54 = a + 11b    (equation 5)

From equation 4, we have a = 12.

Substituting this value of 'a' into equations 1, 2, and 3, we get:

-66 = 12 + 13b       (from equation 1)
132 = 12 - 20b       (from equation 2)
-96 = 12 + 18b       (from equation 3)

Simplifying the equations:

13b = -78          (equation 6)
-20b = 120         (equation 7)
18b = -108         (equation 8)

Solving equations 6, 7, and 8 for 'b', we find:

b = -6
b = -6
b = -6

Since all three equations give the same value for 'b', we can conclude that 'b' is equal to -6.

Finally, substituting 'a' = 12 and 'b' = -6 back into equation 1 (or any other equation), we can confirm our solution:

-66 = 12 + 13(-6)

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Let's assign the input as x and the output as y.

Looking at the data, we can observe that the output values alternate between positive and negative. Moreover, the output values decrease as the input values increase. 

We can express the function as:

y = a + bx

To calculate the values of a and b, we can plug in the given input and output pairs into the equation.

When x = -7, y = 130:
130 = a - 7b

When x = 14, y = -290:
-290 = a + 14b

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

From the first equation, a = 130 + 7b. Substituting this value into the second equation, we get:

-290 = (130 + 7b) + 14b
-290 = 130 + 21b

Subtracting 130 from both sides of the equation:

-420 = 21b

Dividing both sides by 21:

b = -20

Substituting this value back into the first equation:

130 = a - 7(-20)
130 = a + 140
a = -10

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -10 + (-20)x

    From the given inputs and outputs, we can see that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear. However, we can attempt to fit a polynomial function of degree 1 to capture the general trend of the data. 

Let's consider the function in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

For the given inputs and outputs:

Input: -7   ->   Output: 130
Input: 14   ->   Output: -290
Input: -12  ->   Output: 230
Input: 16   ->   Output: -330
Input: 16   ->   Output: -330

We can rewrite the table as a system of equations in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1:

130 = a + (-7)b       (Equation 1)
-290 = a + 14b        (Equation 2)
230 = a + (-12)b      (Equation 3)
-330 = a + 16b        (Equation 4)
-330 = a + 16b        (Equation 5)

By solving this system of equations, we can obtain the values of a and b that would best fit the data:

Adding equation 5 to equation 4:  -330 + (-330) = 2a + 32b
-660 = 2a + 32b                  (Equation 6)

Subtracting equation 4 from equation 3: (230) - (-330) = (a) + (-12b) - (a) - (16b)
560 = 4b                         (Equation 7)
b = 140

Substituting the value of b into equation 7: 560 = 4(140)
560 = 560

From equation 7, we can see that the value of b is consistent with the data.

Now substituting the value of b into either equation 4 or equation 5: -330 = a + 16(140)
-330 = a + 2240
a = -2570

Thus, the values of a and b that best fit the given data are a = -2570 and b = 140.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

We can determine the values of 'a' and 'b' by substituting the input-output pairs into the equation.

For the first input-output pair (-7, 130), we have:
130 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7)^1
130 = a + (-7)b ------ (1)

For the second input-output pair (14, -290), we have:
-290 = a(14)^0 + b(14)^1

For the third input-output pair (-12, 230), we have:
230 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
230 = a + (-12)b ------ (3)

For the fourth input-output pair (16, -330), we have:
-330 = a(16)^0 + b(16)^1
-330 = a + 16b ------ (4)

For the fifth input-output pair (16, -330), we have:
-330 = a(16)^0 + b(16)^1
-330 = a + 16b ------ (5)

We now have a system of equations with two unknowns ('a' and 'b'). Solving this system of equations will give us the values of 'a' and 'b', which can be used to form the function.

By solving the system of equations (1)-(5), we find:

a = 10

Substituting the input-output values into the equation, we have the following equations:

130 = a + (-7)b^(1)
-290 = a + (14)b^(1)
230 = a + (-12)b^(1)
-330 = a + (16)b^(1)

Simplifying these equations, we can solve for a and b:

eq1: 130 = a - 7b
eq2: -290 = a + 14b
eq3: 230 = a - 12b
eq4: -330 = a + 16b

Adding eq1 to eq2, we get:

-160 = 21b
b = -160/21 ≈ -7.619

Substituting this value of b in eq1, we get:

130 = a - 7(-7.619)

-49 = -7b - 175c   => 7b = -49 - 175c  (Equation 6)

Substituting Equation 6 into Equation 2:
22 = a - 3(-49 - 175c) + 9c
22 = a + 147 + 525c + 9c
a = 22 - 147 - 534c - 9c
a = -125 - 543c

Substituting the values of b and c into Equation 1:
64 = (-125 - 543c) - 9(-49 - 175c) + 81c
64 = 2006c - 81c - 441 + 1575c + 81c + 81c
64 = 2637c - 441
2637c = 505
c = 505/2637 = 0.1916

Substituting c back into Equation 6:
7b = -49 - 175(0.1916)
7b = -80.559
b = -80.559/7 = -11.508

Substituting b and c into a:
a = -125 - 543(0.1916)
a = -227.084

Therefore, the best function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -227.084 + (-11.508)x + 0.1916x^2

    This dataset does not have a linear relationship. To better capture the pattern, we can try a quadratic function of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c. Let's calculate the values of a, b, and c.

Input: -20, Output: 265
265 = a(-20)^2 + b(-20) + c

Input: -15, Output: 195
195 = a(-15)^2 + b(-15) + c

Input: -5, Output: 55
55 = a(-5)^2 + b(-5) + c

Input: -10, Output: 125
125 = a(-10)^2 + b(-10) + c

Input: 6, Output: -99
-99 = a(6)^2 + b(6) + c

Simplifying these equations, we have a system of equations:

400a - 20b + c = 265
225a - 15b + c = 195
25a - 5b + c = 55
100a - 10b + c = 125
36a + 6b + c = -99

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = -2, b = -1, and c = 3.

    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can formulate a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x is the input and y is the output.

Given the data:

Input: -20, Output: 265
Input: -15, Output: 195
Input: -5, Output: 55
Input: -10, Output: 125
Input: 6, Output: -99

We can solve for the coefficients a and b using a system of linear equations.

Let's denote the inputs as x_i and the outputs as y_i, where i = 1, 2, ..., n.

For the first data point, we have -20 = a(1^0) + b(1^1), or -20 = a + b.
For the second data point, we have -15 = a(1^0) + b(1^1), or -15 = a + b.
For the third data point, we have -5 = a(1^0) + b(1^1), or -5 = a + b.
For the fourth data point, we have -10 = a(1^0) + b(1^1), or -10 = a + b.
For the fifth data point, we have 6 = a(1^0) + b(1^1), or 6 = a + b.

We can rewrite these equations in matrix form as:

| -20 |   | 1 1 |   |a|   | b |
| -15 | = | 1 1 | * |a| = | b |
| -5  |   | 1 1 |   |a|   | b |
| -10 |   | 1 1 |   |a|   | b |
|  6  |   | 1 1 |   |a|   | b |

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

By solving the above matrix equation, we get a = 130 and b = -150.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
Output: y = 130x^0 - 150x^1, or more simply, y = 130 - 150x.

From the given data, we can see that as the input increases by 5, the output decreases by 70 (-70). This suggests a linear relationship between the input and output, where the slope of the line is -70.

Now, let's consider the y-intercept. By examining the provided data, we can see that when the input is -20, the output is 265. Since the y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0, we can calculate it by subtracting 5 times the slope from the output when x = -20:

y-intercept = 265 - 5(-70) = 265 + 350 = 615

After analyzing the given data points, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be approximated by a quadratic function in the form of y = ax^2 + bx + c.

2) (4)^2a + (4)b + c = 2
3) (-20)^2a + (-20)b + c = -94
4) (4)^2a + (4)b + c = 2

Simplifying the equations:

3) 400a - 20b + c = -94

If we assume that the relationship between inputs and outputs is linear, we can represent it as:

Output = a + b * Input,

where 'a' and 'b' are constants that need to be determined. 

To find the values of 'a' and 'b', we can use the given data points:

For the first data point (-10, -54), we have:
-54 = a + b * (-10)

For the second data point (4, 2), we have:
2 = a + b * 4

For the third data point (-20, -94), we have:

For the fourth data point (4, 2), we have:
2 = a + b * 4

For the fifth data point (-4, -30), we have:

By solving this system of linear equations, we can find the values of 'a' and 'b':

From the first and third equations, we can solve for 'a':
a = -54 - b * (-10)
a = -94 - b * (-20)

Equating both expressions for 'a', we get:
-54 - b * (-10) = -94 - b * (-20)
-54 + 10b = -94 + 20b
10b - 20b = -94 + 54

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the data can be approximated well using a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

From the given inputs and outputs, we can calculate the coefficients a and b by solving the following system of equations:

-310 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1
302 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
176 = a(10)^0 + b(10)^1
212 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1
230 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1

Simplifying the equations, we get:

-310 = a - 17b
302 = a + 17b
176 = a + 10b
212 = a + 12b
230 = a + 13b

By solving this system of equations, we find that a = 24 and b = -14.

By substituting the given inputs and outputs into the equation, we can solve for the values of a and b.

For the first pair of inputs and outputs:
-17 = a + b(-17)^1

To find the values of a and b, we can use the method of least squares or rely on intuition. However, given the limited number of input-output pairs, intuition seems to be the more feasible approach in this case.

By observing the pattern, it appears that the constant term (a) is -18, and the coefficient of x (b) is 18. Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can see that the relationship between the input and output values can be described by a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's consider the relationship between the inputs and outputs:
Input: -16, Output: 297
Input: 18, Output: -315
Input: -16, Output: 297
Input: -5, Output: 99
Input: 5, Output: -81

We can see that the output values are calculated by the formula:
Output = a + b * Input

By substituting the given values, we can solve for the coefficients a and b.

Using the first pair of input and output values (-16, 297), we have:
297 = a + b * (-16)

Using the second pair of input and output values (18, -315), we have:
-315 = a + b * 18

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

a = 279
b = -15

    In order to find the pattern and describe the relationship between inputs and outputs, let's first list the inputs and outputs in a table:

Input      | Output
-----------|--------
-16        | 297
18         | -315
-16        | 297
-5         | 99
5          | -81

From the table, we can observe that the outputs alternate between positive and negative values. Additionally, the outputs seem to follow a pattern where the absolute value of the output increases as the input value increases.

Let's assume there are two constants, a and b, such that the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 captures this relationship. Since x^0 is equal to 1, we can simplify the equation to y = a + bx.

For positive inputs, we have:

y = a + bx

For negative inputs, we have:

y = a - bx

Based on the output values, we can see that when x = -16, y = 297. Plugging these values into the second equation, we get:

297 = a - b(-16)
297 = a + 16b

Similarly, when x = 18, y = -315. Plugging these values into the first equation, we get:

-315 = a + b(18)

With these two equations, we can solve for the constants a and b.

Let's first solve for a:

297 = a + 16b (equation 1)
-315 = a + 18b (equation 2)

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

297 - (-315) = (a + 16b) - (a + 18b)
612 = -2b

Simplifying:

b = -306

Now, let's substitute the value of b into equation 1:

297 = a + 16(-306)
297 = a - 4896
5193 = a

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function of the form:

Let's determine the values of a and b by substituting the input-output pairs into the equation:

For the first pair (-16, 297):

297 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
297 = a + (-16b)

For the second pair (18, -315):

-315 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1
-315 = a + 18b

For the third pair (-16, 297): (same as the first pair)

297 = a + (-16b)

For the fourth pair (-5, 99):

99 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
99 = a + (-5b)

For the fifth pair (5, -81):

-81 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-81 = a + 5b

We now have a system of five equations with two unknowns, a and b. We can solve this system to find the values of a and b:

From the first and third equations:
a + (-16b) = 297
a + (-16b) = 297
Subtracting the second equation from the first:
0 = 0
This means that these equations are dependent, indicating that they do not provide new information. Therefore, we can remove the second equation from consideration.

From the fourth and fifth equations:
a + (-5b) = 99
a + 5b = -81

Adding these equations together:
2a = 18
a = 9

Substituting a = 9 into one of the equations:
9 + 5b = -81
5b = -90
b = -18

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Simplifying the equations, we get:

256a - 16b + c = 297                 (Equation 1')
324a + 18b + c = -315               (Equation 2')
256a + 16b + c = 297                 (Equation 3')
25a - 5b + c = 99                        (Equation 4')
25a + 5b + c = -81                         (Equation 5')

Using these values of a and b, equation (3) becomes -15(-4^0) + (-4)(-4^1) = -31, which simplifies to -15 - 16 = -31.

    Based on the provided data, let's try fitting a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Output: -15

Output: -35

Input: -4
Output: -31

Input: 5
Output: 5

Input: -12
Output: -63

The linear function can be expressed as:

Output: y = a*1 + b*x

Let's denote the variable ""x"" as the input and ""y"" as the output. We need to find the values of ""a"" and ""b"" that best fit the data.

To solve for the coefficients ""a"" and ""b"", we can use the method of least squares. By solving the system of equations using the given data points, we can estimate the values of ""a"" and ""b"".

Solving for ""a"" and ""b"" using the given data:

For input 0:
-15 = a*1 + b*0
-15 = a

For input -5:
-35 = a*1 + b*(-5)
-35 = -5a - 5b

For input -4:
-31 = a*1 + b*(-4)
-31 = -4a - 4b

For input 5:
5 = a*1 + b*5
5 = a + 5b

For input -12:
-63 = a*1 + b*(-12)
-63 = -12a - 12b

Simplifying the equations:

-15 = a
-35 = -5a - 5b
-31 = -4a - 4b
5 = a + 5b
-63 = -12a - 12b

Substituting the value of ""a"" in the equations:

-35 = -5*(-15) - 5b
-31 = -4*(-15) - 4b
5 = -15 + 5b
-63 = -12*(-15) - 12b

Simplifying further, we get:

-35 = 75 - 5b
-31 = 60 - 4b
5 = -15 + 5b
-63 = 180 - 12b

-110 = -5b
-91 = -4b
20 = 5b
-243 = -12b

Solving for ""b"" in the equations:

b = -110 / -5
b = 22

b = -91 / -4
b = 22.75

b = 20 / 5
b = 4

b = -243 / -12
b = 20.25

Substituting the value of ""b"" in the equations:

-35 = 75 - 5*(-22)
-31 = 60 - 4*(-22)
5 = -15 + 5*4
-63 = 180 - 12*(-22)

-35 = 75 + 110
-31 = 60 + 88
5 = -15 + 20
-63 = 180 + 264

-35 = 185
-31 = 148
5 = 5
-63 = 444

As we can see, substituting the value of ""b"" in the equations doesn't yield consistent results. Hence, the given data cannot be fit with a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can infer the following relationship:

Input: x
Output: y

For x = 0, y = -15
For x = -5, y = -35
For x = -4, y = -31
For x = 5, y = 5
For x = -12, y = -63

By observation, we can see that the output (y) is equal to the input (x) multiplied by a certain factor (b) plus a constant term (a). Therefore, the function can be represented as:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Since x^0 is always equal to 1, the equation simplifies to:

y = a + bx

By substituting the given data points, we can find the values of a and b:

For x = 0 and y = -15:
-15 = a + 0b
a = -15

For x = -5 and y = -35:

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the method of least squares regression. By fitting a line to the data points, we can approximate the relationship in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the given input-output pairs:
(9, 133), (19, 283), (16, 238), (-14, -212), (-16, -242)

Let's use the equations:
y = a + bx

Substituting the input-output pairs into the equation:
133 = a + 9b
283 = a + 19b
238 = a + 16b
-212 = a - 14b
-242 = a - 16b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Adding the first and third equations, we get:
133 + 238 = 2a + 25b
371 = 2a + 25b

Subtracting the fourth equation from the fifth equation, we get:
-242 - (-212) = a - 16b - (a - 14b)
-30 = -2b
b = 15

Substituting the value of b into the second equation, we get:
283 = a + 19(15)
283 = a + 285
a = -2

    From the given data, we can determine that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a quadratic equation. 

Using the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, a quadratic equation can be written as y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2.

Let's denote the coefficient for x^2 as c.

To find the values of a, b, and c, we can substitute the given inputs and outputs into the equation and solve for the coefficients.

Using the first data point (2, 59):

59 = a(2^0) + b(2^1) + c(2^2)

59 = a + 2b + 4c

Using the second data point (-16, -301):

-301 = a(-16^0) + b(-16^1) + c(-16^2)

-301 = a - 16b + 256c

Using the third data point (-5, -81):

-81 = a(-5^0) + b(-5^1) + c(-5^2)

-81 = a - 5b + 25c

Using the fourth data point (3, 79):

79 = a(3^0) + b(3^1) + c(3^2)

79 = a + 3b + 9c

Using the fifth data point (-2, -21):

-21 = a(-2^0) + b(-2^1) + c(-2^2)

-21 = a - 2b + 4c

Now we have a system of equations:

59 = a + 2b + 4c
-301 = a - 16b + 256c
-81 = a - 5b + 25c
79 = a + 3b + 9c
-21 = a - 2b + 4c

To solve this system, we can use a matrix representation:

⎡  1    2    4   |  59 ⎤
⎢  1   -16  256 | -301 ⎥
⎢  1   -5   25  | -81  ⎥
⎢  1    3    9   |  79 ⎥

Upon observing the given data points, it is evident that the pattern corresponds to a quadratic relationship. Hence, we can rewrite the equation as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

To find the values of a, b, and c, we can substitute each input-output pair into the equation:

For the first pair: 59 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1 + c(2)^2
Simplifying, we get: 59 = a + 2b + 4c  -- (1)

For the second pair: -301 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1 + c(-16)^2
Simplifying, we get: -301 = a - 16b + 256c  -- (2)

For the third pair: -81 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1 + c(-5)^2
Simplifying, we get: -81 = a - 5b + 25c  -- (3)

For the fourth pair: 79 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1 + c(3)^2

Multiplying equation (2) by 64 and adding it to equation (4) multiplied by 16 results in:

    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

By analyzing the given inputs and outputs, we can find the values of a and b:

Input: -16, Output: 82
82 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
82 = a - 16b

Input: -11, Output: 52
52 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
52 = a - 11b

Input: 14, Output: -98
-98 = a(14)^0 + b(14)^1
-98 = a + 14b

Input: -18, Output: 94
94 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
94 = a - 18b

Input: 3, Output: -32
-32 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1
-32 = a + 3b

Now, we can solve these equations to find the values of a and b. Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we have:

82 - 52 = (a - 16b) - (a - 11b)
30 = 5b
b = 6

Substituting the value of b into any of the two equations, we can solve for a:

82 = a - 16(6)
82 = a - 96
a = 82 + 96
a = 178

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 178x^0 + 6x^1

    Based on the given data points, it seems like a quadratic function would better capture the relationship between inputs and outputs. So, instead of using the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, I will write the function in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c.

Using the given data points, we can create a system of equations:

82 = a*(-16)^2 + b*(-16) + c
52 = a*(-11)^2 + b*(-11) + c
-98 = a*(14)^2 + b*(14) + c
94 = a*(-18)^2 + b*(-18) + c
-32 = a*(3)^2 + b*(3) + c

Simplifying these equations, we get:

256a - 16b + c = 82   (equation 1)
121a - 11b + c = 52   (equation 2)
196a + 14b + c = -98  (equation 3)
324a - 18b + c = 94   (equation 4)
9a + 3b + c = -32     (equation 5)

We can solve for the coefficients a, b, and c in the equation y = a*x^2 + b*x + c.

The coefficients are found as follows:

Using the first data point (6, 74):

Using the second data point (19, 191):

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the input and output values can be described by a linear equation in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Input: 19, Output: 191
Input: -11, Output: -79
Input: -5, Output: -25

Using these data points, we can create a system of linear equations and solve for 'a' and 'b'.

From the first equation:
74 = a(6^0) + b(6^1)
74 = a + 6b     -- (1)

From the second equation:
191 = a(19^0) + b(19^1)
191 = a + 19b   -- (2)

From the third equation:
-79 = a(-11^0) + b(-11^1)
-79 = a - 11b   -- (3)

From the fourth equation:

From the fifth equation:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's first assume that the relationship is best described by a linear function of the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

where x^0 represents the constant term and x^1 represents the linear term.

Let's substitute the given inputs and outputs into the equation to find the values of a and b.

Input: -16, Output: 109
109 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
109 = a + (-16)b

Let's now determine the values of coefficients a, b, and c using the given input-output pairs.

Input: -16, Output: 109

a - 3b + 9c = 18
a + 2b + 4c = -17
a + 12b + 144c = -87

-17 = a + 2b

For the input 12 (x = 12), we have the output -87 (y = -87). Substituting these values in the equation, we get:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems like the relationship can be described by a linear equation in the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1 = a + bx

To find the values of a and b, let's substitute each pair of input and output into the equation:

For input 13, output 177:
177 = a + 13b   -->  Equation 1

For input 14, output 191:
191 = a + 14b   -->  Equation 2

For input -8, output -117:
-117 = a + (-8)b   -->  Equation 3

For input 3, output 37:
37 = a + 3b   -->  Equation 4

For input 7, output 93:
93 = a + 7b   -->  Equation 5

We now have a system of 5 equations with two unknowns (a and b). We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Solving this system of equations yields:

a ≈ 0.8
b ≈ 13.2

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 0.8 + 13.2x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Looking at the data, it appears that the output is dependent on the input raised to the power of 0 and 1. Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be written as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Substituting the given data points into the equation:

When input (x) is 13, output (y) is 177:
177 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)

When input (x) is 14, output (y) is 191:
191 = a(14^0) + b(14^1)

When input (x) is -8, output (y) is -117:
-117 = a((-8)^0) + b((-8)^1)

When input (x) is 3, output (y) is 37:
37 = a(3^0) + b(3^1)

When input (x) is 7, output (y) is 93:
93 = a(7^0) + b(7^1)

Simplifying the equations:

177 = a + 13b
191 = a + 14b
-117 = a - 8b
37 = a + 3b
93 = a + 7b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
