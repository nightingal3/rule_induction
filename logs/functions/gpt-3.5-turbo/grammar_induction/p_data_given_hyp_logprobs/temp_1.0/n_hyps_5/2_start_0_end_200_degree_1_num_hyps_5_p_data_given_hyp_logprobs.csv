"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's consider the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's calculate the values of a and b using the given inputs and outputs:

For the first set of input and output:
Input: -10
Output: -213

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

Input: 9
Output: 167

167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Input: 4
Output: 67

67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Input: -3
Output: -73

-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

Input: 20
Output: 387

387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

We have a system of linear equations:
-213 = a - 10b
167 = a + 9b
67 = a + 4b
-73 = a - 3b
387 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations allows us to determine the values of a and b, which can then be used to define the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use the method of least squares regression to fit a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 to the given data.

Using the given data points:

Point 1: (-10, -213)
Point 2: (9, 167)
Point 3: (4, 67)
Point 4: (-3, -73)
Point 5: (20, 387)

We can solve for the coefficients a and b by creating a system of linear equations:

For Point 1: -213 = a + b(-10)^1
For Point 2: 167 = a + b(9)^1
For Point 3: 67 = a + b(4)^1
For Point 4: -73 = a + b(-3)^1
For Point 5: 387 = a + b(20)^1

Simplifying these equations:

-213 = a - 10b
167 = a + 9b
67 = a + 4b
-73 = a - 3b
387 = a + 20b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it is clear that the relationship between the input and output values can be represented by a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the values of a and b, we can use a system of equations. By substituting the given input and output values into the equation, we can solve for a and b.

Using the provided pairs of inputs and outputs:

For the first pair: 
Input: -10, Output: -213
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

For the second pair:
Input: 9, Output: 167
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

For the third pair:
Input: 4, Output: 67
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

For the fourth pair:
Input: -3, Output: -73
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

For the fifth pair:
Input: 20, Output: 387
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Simplifying the equations:

-213 = a - 10b      [ Equation 1 ]
167 = a + 9b        [ Equation 2 ]
67 = a + 4b         [ Equation 3 ]
-73 = a - 3b        [ Equation 4 ]
387 = a + 20b       [ Equation 5 ]

By solving this system of equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b:

Adding Equation 1 to Equation 3:
-146 = 2a - 6b    [ Equation 6 ]

Adding Equation 1 to Equation 4:
-286 = 2a - 13b   [ Equation 7 ]

Adding Equation 2 to Equation 5:
554 = 2a + 29b     [ Equation 8 ]

Now, subtracting Equation 6 from Equation 8:
700 = 35b
b = 20

Substituting the value of b into Equation 2:
167 = a + 9(20)
167 = a + 180
a = -13

    After observing the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the function can be approximated by a quadratic equation. Therefore, let's assume the function can be defined as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

Now, let's use the provided input-output pairs to solve for the coefficients a, b, and c.

1. Input: -10
   Output: -213

   -213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1 + c(-10)^2
   -213 = a - 10b + 100c

2. Input: 9
   Output: 167

   167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1 + c(9)^2
   167 = a + 9b + 81c

3. Input: 4
   Output: 67

   67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1 + c(4)^2
   67 = a + 4b + 16c

4. Input: -3

   -73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1 + c(-3)^2

5. Input: 20
   Output: 387

   387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1 + c(20)^2
   387 = a + 20b + 400c

Now, we have a system of 5 equations with 3 unknowns (a, b, c). By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a, b, and c, which will allow us to write the exact equation.

Solving this system of equations, we get:
a = -2.27272727
b = 23.86363636
c = -0.11363636

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    The given input-output pairs do not follow a linear relationship of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. However, we can try to find a function that captures the trend as best as possible. 

Based on the given data, it appears that the relationship between the input and output may be quadratic. Hence, we can try to formulate a quadratic function of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c. 

Let's find the coefficients a, b, and c that fit the best for the given data.

Input: -18, Output: 339
Input: 0, Output: -3
Input: 5, Output: -98
Input: -3, Output: 54
Input: -16, Output: 301

Using these input-output pairs, we can set up a system of equations to solve for a, b, and c:

339 = a(-18)^2 + b(-18) + c
-3 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c
-98 = a(5)^2 + b(5) + c
54 = a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c
301 = a(-16)^2 + b(-16) + c

Simplifying the equations, we get:

324a - 18b + c = 339   (equation 1)
c = -3               (equation 2)
25a + 5b + c = -98     (equation 3)
9a - 3b + c = 54       (equation 4)
256a - 16b + c = 301  (equation 5)

Substituting equation 2 into equations 1, 3, 4, and 5, the system becomes:

324a - 18b - 3 = 339
25a + 5b - 3 = -98
9a - 3b - 3 = 54
256a - 16b - 3 = 301

Simplifying further:

324a - 18b = 342   (equation 6)
25a + 5b = -95     (equation 7)
9a - 3b = 57       (equation 8)

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can try to fit the given data points into a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's assume the function is y = a + bx.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given data points to create a system of equations:

For the first data point (-18, 339):
339 = a + (-18)b

For the second data point (0, -3):
-3 = a + (0)b

For the third data point (5, -98):
-98 = a + (5)b

For the fourth data point (-3, 54):
54 = a + (-3)b

For the fifth data point (-16, 301):
301 = a + (-16)b

Let's solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

From the second equation, we can deduce that a = -3.

Substituting a = -3 into the first equation, we get:
339 = -3 + (-18)b
342 = -18b

    From the given inputs and outputs, we can see that the relationship between the input and output is not a linear one. Instead, it seems to be quadratic or higher order. Let's try to capture this relationship through a quadratic function.

Considering the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx:

Using the given data points, we can set up a system of equations:

Equation 1: -18 = a + b(-18)^1
Equation 2: 0 = a + b(0)^1
Equation 3: 5 = a + b(5)^1
Equation 4: -3 = a + b(-3)^1
Equation 5: -16 = a + b(-16)^1

Simplifying these equations, we get:

Equation 1: -18 = a - 18b
Equation 2: 0 = a
Equation 3: 5 = a + 5b
Equation 4: -3 = a - 3b
Equation 5: -16 = a + 16b

From Equation 2, we can deduce that a = 0.

Substituting the value of a in Equations 1, 3, 4, and 5, we get:

Equation 1: -18 = -18b
Equation 3: 5 = 5b
Equation 4: -3 = -3b
Equation 5: -16 = 16b

Simplifying these equations, we get:

Equation 1: b = 1
Equation 3: b = 1
Equation 4: b = 1
Equation 5: b = -1

Since we have different values for b, there is no consistent value for b that satisfies all the equations. Therefore, we can conclude that the relationship between the inputs and outputs cannot be accurately described by a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

For Input: 0 and Output: -3:

For a = -166.6, using equation (1):
-98 = (-166.6) + 7b
-68.4 = 7b
b = -9.77

For a = -109, using equation (1):
-98 = (-109) + 7b
11 = 7b
b = 1.57

Thus, we have two possible equations representing the relationship between the inputs and outputs:

For a = -166.6 and b = -9.77:
Output: y = -166.6x^0 - 9.77x^1

For a = -109 and b = 1.57:
Output: y = -109x^0 + 1.57x^1

From the first data point (7, -98), we have:

By observing the inputs and outputs, it appears that the output can be described by a linear equation with respect to the input.

Let's define the function as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given input and output values:

1) When input = -13, output = -197:
-197 = a(-13)^0 + b(-13)^1
-197 = a + (-13b)

2) When input = -11, output = -169:
-169 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
-169 = a + (-11b)

3) When input = 20, output = 265:
265 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
265 = a + 20b

4) When input = -10, output = -155:

-155 = a + (-10b)

5) When input = 7, output = 83:

Now we have a system of equations. By solving this system, we can find the values of a and b.

Using any method of solving simultaneous equations (such as substitution or elimination), we find:

a = -4
b = 15

Equation 1: -197 = a(-13)^0 + b(-13)^1
Equation 2: -169 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1

From these equations, we can solve for the values of a and b.

Equation 1: -197 = a + (-13)b
Equation 2: -169 = a + (-11)b

By subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

-197 - (-169) = a + (-13)b - (a + (-11)b)

b = 14

Substituting b = 14 into Equation 1, we get:

-145 = 7b + c      ... (2)

To solve this system, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate c:

-145 - 17 = 7b - (-2b)
-162 = 9b
b = -18

Substituting this value of b into equation (1), we can find c:

17 = -2(-18) + c
17 = 36 + c
c = -19

Therefore, our function to describe the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    The given data suggests that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be approximated by a linear function:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

By substituting the given inputs and outputs into the function, we can solve for the values of a and b. Plugging in the first pair of data points:

-307 = a(20^0) + b(20^1)
-307 = a + 20b

Similarly, we can substitute the remaining data points and solve for a and b:

8 = a(-1^0) + b(-1^1)
8 = a - b

-307 = a(20^0) + b(20^1)
-307 = a + 20b

-187 = a(12^0) + b(12^1)
-187 = a + 12b

-277 = a(18^0) + b(18^1)

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can infer that the function has a linear relationship. We can write it in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Let's denote the input as x and the output as y.

Using the given data points, we can form the following equations:

20a + 20b = -307   -- (1)
(-1)a + (-1)b = 8   -- (2)
20a + 20b = -307   -- (3)
12a + 12b = -187   -- (4)
18a + 18b = -277   -- (5)

From equations (1) and (3), we can see that they are the same equation, so we only need to consider them once. 

Simplifying equations (2), (4), and (5), we get:

-a - b = 8
a + b = -16
3a + 3b = -52

Now we can eliminate variable b by subtracting equation (2) from equation (5):

3a + 3b - (a + b) = -52 - (-16)
2a + 2b = -36
a + b = -18

Now we have a system of equations:

a + b = -18
2a + 2b = -36

Dividing the second equation by 2, we get:

a + b = -18
a + b = -18

Since these two equations are the same, we can say that the system is dependent.

Thus, there are infinitely many solutions to this system of equations, and there is no unique function that can capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs based on the given data.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given input-output pairs. Let's consider any two pairs, for example:

Substituting these values into the equation:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be represented by a linear function of the form y = bx^1 + a. By substituting the given inputs and outputs into this function, we can determine the specific values of a and b.

Let's solve for a and b using the given pairs of inputs and outputs:
1. When input is 20, output is -307:
-307 = b(20^1) + a

2. When input is -1, output is 8:
8 = b(-1^1) + a

3. When input is 12, output is -187:
-187 = b(12^1) + a

4. When input is 18, output is -277:

Simplifying the equations, we get:
20b + a = -307     (Equation 1)
-b + a = 8          (Equation 2)
12b + a = -187    (Equation 3)
18b + a = -277     (Equation 4)

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use linear regression to determine the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Input: 13, Output: -66
Input: -20, Output: 132
Input: 18, Output: -96
Input: 0, Output: 12
Input: 11, Output: -54

The inputs are represented by x and the outputs are represented by y.

We can use the values of x and y to set up a system of equations and solve for a and b:

y1 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)  -> -66 = a + 13b
y2 = a(-20^0) + b(-20^1)  -> 132 = a - 20b
y3 = a(18^0) + b(18^1)  -> -96 = a + 18b
y4 = a(0^0) + b(0^1)  -> 12 = a
y5 = a(11^0) + b(11^1)  -> -54 = a + 11b

Simplifying these equations, we have:

a + 13b = -66
a - 20b = 132
a + 18b = -96
a = 12
a + 11b = -54

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

First, we rewrite the equations:

a + 13b = -66  -> Equation 1
a - 20b = 132  -> Equation 2
a + 18b = -96  -> Equation 3
a = 12  -> Equation 4
a + 11b = -54  -> Equation 5

Substituting Equation 4 into Equation 1:
12 + 13b = -66
13b = -66 - 12
13b = - 78
b = -78 / 13
b = -6

Substituting b = -6 into Equation 4:
a + 11(-6) = -54
a - 66 = -54
a = -54 + 66

    The outputs do not follow a linear relationship y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x is the input. However, by looking at the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship can be described by a quadratic function of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c. 

Let's try to find the coefficients a, b, and c that best describe the relationship:

Using the given data:

Input: 13, Output: -66
Input: -20, Output: 132
Input: 18, Output: -96
Input: 0, Output: 12
Input: 11, Output: -54

We can solve a system of equations using these data points to find the coefficients a, b, and c.

From the first data point, we have:
-66 = a(13)^2 + b(13) + c

From the second data point, we have:
132 = a(-20)^2 + b(-20) + c

From the third data point, we have:
-96 = a(18)^2 + b(18) + c

From the fourth data point, we have:
12 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c
which simplifies to: 
c = 12

From the fifth data point, we have:
-54 = a(11)^2 + b(11) + c

Now, using the value of c, we can rewrite the equations as:

-66 = a(13)^2 + b(13) + 12
132 = a(-20)^2 + b(-20) + 12
-96 = a(18)^2 + b(18) + 12
-54 = a(11)^2 + b(11) + 12

Simplifying each equation:

169a + 13b = -78
400a - 20b = 120
324a + 18b = -108
121a + 11b = -66

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can attempt to find a function that captures the relationship between them. 

Let's form the function:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

For the first data point (-1, -8):
-8 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1
-8 = a - b

For the second data point (5, 76):
76 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
76 = a + 5b

For the third data point (3, 48):
48 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1

118 = a + 8b

For the fifth data point (13, 188):
188 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1
188 = a + 13b

We now have a system of equations. Let's solve it to find the values of a and b.

From the first equation, we have: -8 = a - b
Rearranging the equation, we get: a = 8 + b

Substituting this value of a into the second equation, we have: 76 = (8 + b) + 5b
Combining like terms, we get: 76 = 8 + 6b
Rearranging the equation: 6b = 68
Solving for b, we get: b = 68/6 = 34/3

Substituting the value of b back into the first equation: a = 8 + (34/3)
Combining like terms: a = (24 + 34)/3
Simplifying: a = 58/3

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = (58/3) - (170/3)

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can start by observing the pattern in the given data points.

We can notice that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear, as the increase in outputs is not constant for each increment in inputs. However, there appears to be a pattern where the output values increase as the inputs increase.

Based on the given data points, we can try to fit a quadratic function in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

Let's substitute the given data points and solve for the unknown coefficients a, b, and c.

When the input is -1, the output is -8:

-8 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1 + c(-1)^2
-8 = a - b + c      [Eq. 1]

When the input is 5, the output is 76:

76 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1 + c(5)^2
76 = a + 5b + 25c   [Eq. 2]

When the input is 3, the output is 48:

48 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1 + c(3)^2
48 = a + 3b + 9c    [Eq. 3]

When the input is 8, the output is 118:

118 = a(8)^0 + b(8)^1 + c(8)^2
118 = a + 8b + 64c  [Eq. 4]

When the input is 13, the output is 188:

188 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1 + c(13)^2
188 = a + 13b + 169c [Eq. 5]

Now, we have a system of equations consisting of Eq. 1, Eq. 2, Eq. 3, Eq. 4, and Eq. 5. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a, b, and c.

Solving these equations, we find:
a = 4
b = -3
c = 2

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be approximated by a linear function. 

The general form of a linear function is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. 

To find the parameters a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can equate the general form y = mx + b to the given equation. Rearranging the terms, we get:

Solving the system of equations, we find:
a = -60
b = 20

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = -60x^0 + 20x^1 

Simplifying further, the function can be expressed as:

y = -60 + 20x

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can observe that the outputs are changing in a linear fashion. 

Let's denote the input as x and the output as y. 

For the given inputs and outputs, we can define the function as follows:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Substituting the given inputs and outputs, we can form the following equations:

For the input -7, the output 130 gives us:

130 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7)^1
130 = a + (-7)b          Equation 1

For the input 14, the output -290 gives us:

-290 = a(14)^0 + b(14)^1
-290 = a + 14b             Equation 2

For the input -12, the output 230 gives us:

230 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
230 = a + (-12)b            Equation 3

For the input 16, the output -330 gives us:

-330 = a(16)^0 + b(16)^1
-330 = a + 16b               Equation 4

For the input 16, the output -330 gives us:

-330 = a(16)^0 + b(16)^1
-330 = a + 16b               Equation 5

Now, we have a system of equations. We can solve this system to find the values of a and b.

Solving Equations 1 and 4 simultaneously:

130 = a + (-7)b
-330 = a + 16b

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

-460 = 23b

Therefore, b = -20.

Substituting b = -20 into Equation 1:

130 = a + (-7)(-20)
130 = a + 140

Subtracting 140 from both sides, we get:

-10 = a

Hence, a = -10.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = (-10)x^0 + (-20)x^1
Output: y = -10 - 20x

So, the function is y = -10 - 20x.

    From the given inputs and outputs, it seems that there is a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. We can represent this relationship using the equation:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

where ""a"" is the coefficient for x^0 (which is 1 since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and ""b"" is the coefficient for x^1.

Now let's find the values of ""a"" and ""b"" using the given input-output pairs:

For Input: -7, Output: 130:
130 = a * (-7)^0 + b * (-7)^1
130 = a + (-7b)          (since any number to the power of 0 is 1)
130 = a - 7b

For Input: 14, Output: -290:
-290 = a * 14^0 + b * 14^1
-290 = a + 14b

For Input: -12, Output: 230:
230 = a * (-12)^0 + b * (-12)^1
230 = a - 12b

For Input: 16, Output: -330:
-330 = a * 16^0 + b * 16^1
-330 = a + 16b

For Input: 16, Output: -330:
-330 = a * 16^0 + b * 16^1
-330 = a + 16b

We have a system of equations with four unknowns (a and b) and four equations. We can solve this system using matrix algebra or other methods to find the values of ""a"" and ""b"".

Solving the system of equations (using matrix algebra), we find:

a ≈ -5
b ≈ -10

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between input and output is:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, let's first observe the pattern:

Input: -7, Output: 130
Input: 14, Output: -290
Input: -12, Output: 230
Input: 16, Output: -330
Input: 16, Output: -330

We can see that regardless of the input value, the output is always a multiple of 10. So, we can start with a simple function of the form:

Output = 10 * x

However, this function does not account for the cases where the output is negative. To adjust for this, we can introduce a coefficient term:

Output = a + (10 * x)

By adjusting the coefficient ""a"", we can account for the different output values obtained for the same input value. Let's find the appropriate values for ""a"" and ""x"" for each input-output pair:

Input: -7, Output: 130  =>  a + (10 * -7) = 130  =>  a - 70 = 130  =>  a = 200
Input: 14, Output: -290  =>  a + (10 * 14) = -290  =>  a + 140 = -290  =>  a = -430
Input: -12, Output: 230  =>  a + (10 * -12) = 230  =>  a - 120 = 230  =>  a = 350
Input: 16, Output: -330  =>  a + (10 * 16) = -330  =>  a + 160 = -330  =>  a = -490
Input: 16, Output: -330  =>  a + (10 * 16) = -330  =>  a + 160 = -330  =>  a = -490

So, we can write the function that captures the relationship as:

Output = a + (10 * x)

Substituting the appropriate coefficients, we get:

Output = 200 + (10 * x)

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear. It is more likely to be a quadratic relationship.

In a quadratic relationship, the function can be written in the form: y = ax^2 + bx + c

To find the quadratic function that describes the data, we can solve for the coefficients a, b, and c using the given inputs and outputs.

Using the first pair of inputs and outputs (input: -7, output: 130), we can substitute these values into the quadratic equation:

130 = a(-7)^2 + b(-7) + c
130 = 49a - 7b + c   ----(1)

Using another pair of inputs and outputs (input: 14, output: -290), we get:

-290 = a(14)^2 + b(14) + c
-290 = 196a + 14b + c   ----(2)

Using a third pair of inputs and outputs (input: -12, output: 230), we get:

230 = a(-12)^2 + b(-12) + c
230 = 144a - 12b + c    ----(3)

We now have a system of three equations (equations 1, 2, and 3) with three unknowns (a, b, and c). Solving this system of equations will give us the coefficients of the quadratic function that describes the data.

By solving the system of equations, we find:
a = -3
b = 4
c = 0

Thus, the quadratic function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

For Input = -14: y = -7 + 15(-14) = -7 - 210 = -217 ≈ -97 (approximately matches the given output)

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship can be described by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Let's calculate the values of a and b using two pairs of inputs and outputs:

Using the first pair (-14, -97):
-97 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1
-97 = a - 14b

Using the third pair (7, 50):
50 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1
50 = a + 7b

Now we have a system of equations:

a - 14b = -97   (Equation 1)
a + 7b = 50     (Equation 2)

To solve this system, we can use various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiplying Equation 1 by 7:
7a - 98b = -679   (Equation 3)

Multiplying Equation 2 by 14:
14a + 98b = 700    (Equation 4)

Adding Equation 3 and Equation 4:
7a - 98b + 14a + 98b = -679 + 700
21a = 21
a = 1

Substituting the value of a into Equation 1:

    Using the given inputs and outputs, we can try to find the relationship between them. Based on the values provided, it seems that the output (y) is related to the input (x) through a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the two equations provided, with the same input value (-14) corresponding to the same output value (-97), as well as the input value (7) corresponding to the output value (50).

Equation 1: -97 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1

Simplifying these equations gives:
Equation 1: -97 = a + (-14)b
Equation 2: 50 = a + 7b

We can now solve these simultaneous equations to find the values of a and b.

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2 yields:

147 = 7b + 14b

To determine the coefficients a and b, we can use the given input-output pairs. Plugging in the values, we have:

For the pair (5, -26):
-26 = a(5^0) + b(5^1)
-26 = a + 5b

    The function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be represented as:

Output: y = -15 + 2x

Explanation:
To find the function, we need to look for patterns in the data.

From the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that:
- When the input is 1, the output is -14.
- When the input is 5, the output is -26.

From these two data points, we can calculate the difference in input and output:
- The difference in input: 5 - 1 = 4
- The difference in output: -26 - (-14) = -12

Now, to find the coefficients of the function, let's suppose the function is y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Since x^0 is always 1, we can rewrite the function as y = a + bx.

Using the data points (1, -14) and (5, -26) to solve for a and b:
- When x = 1, y = a + b(1) = a + b
- When x = 5, y = a + b(5) = a + 5b

From the first data point (1, -14):
a + b = -14    -----(1)

From the second data point (5, -26):
a + 5b = -26   -----(2)

To solve these equations, we can multiply equation (1) by 5 and subtract it from equation (2):

5a + 5b = -70   (multiplying equation (1) by 5)
a + 5b = -26    (equation (2))

Subtracting gives us:
4a = -44

Simplifying further:
a = -11

Plugging this value of a in equation (1):
-11 + b = -14

Solving for b:
b = -14 + 11 = -3

Output: 31    13    4     -14  -26

From the table, we can observe that when the input increases by 1, the output decreases by 12. This suggests that the coefficient of x^1, 'b', is -12. 

To find the value of 'a', we can substitute any input and output pair into the equation and solve for 'a'.

Let's use the pair (-14, 31):
31 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1  
31 = a + (-12)(-14)

Using the input-output pairs:

-62 = a + 9b + 81c
36 = a + 5b + 25c

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a, b, and c.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use a quadratic polynomial function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x is the input value.

Since the values for y are not linearly related to x, we can consider a quadratic relationship between x and y.

Let's write the function explicitly:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

We can rewrite this as:

Output: y = a + bx

Now, let's substitute the given inputs and outputs to solve for the values of a and b:

    Based on the given data points, it appears that the relationship between the input and output values follows a quadratic pattern. Therefore, a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2 can be used to capture this relationship.

Let's try to find the values of a, b, and c by substituting the input-output pairs into the equation:

64 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1 + c(-9)^2
64 = a + (-9)b + 81c

For Input = -9, Output = 64:

For Input = -3, Output = 22:
22 = a + b * (-3)

For Input = 9, Output = -62:

Let's calculate the values of a and b by substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation.

For the input -20, the output is 265:
265 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
265 = a + (-20b)

For the input -15, the output is 195:

For the input 6, the output is -99:

Now we have a system of linear equations:
a - 20b = 265
a - 15b = 195
a - 5b = 55
a - 10b = 125
a + 6b = -99

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b, which will allow us to express the relationship between inputs and outputs.

Solving this system of equations, we find:
a = -5
b = -10

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Thus, the function is simplified to:

385 = a - 10b

Substituting this result into the third equation:

55 = 385 -5b
5b = 330
b = 66

Substituting this into the fifth equation:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 can be simplified to y = bx^1. 

Let's calculate the value of b:

For input -17 and output -310:
-310 = b * (-17)^1
b = -310 / (-17)
b ≈ 18.24

For input 17 and output 302:
302 = 18.24 * (17)^1

For input 10 and output 176:
176 = 18.24 * (10)^1

212 = 18.24 * (12)^1

For input 13 and output 230:

    Based on the given data points, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be approximated using a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Using this form, we can determine the values of a and b by plugging in the input-output pairs into the equation and solving for a and b simultaneously.

Let's start by using the first data point (Input: -17, Output: -310):
-310 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1
-310 = a + (-17)b                 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1)
-310 = a - 17b

Next, we can use the second data point (Input: 17, Output: 302):
302 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
302 = a + 17b

By solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use regression analysis. Let's assume the function takes the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given inputs and outputs:

-310 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1
302 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
176 = a(10)^0 + b(10)^1
212 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1
230 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1

Simplifying these equations, we have:

-310 = a + (-17)b
302 = a + 17b
176 = a + 10b
212 = a + 12b
230 = a + 13b

To solve for a and b, we can multiply each equation by the respective coefficient of a or b:

-310 = a - 17b
302 = a + 17b
176 = 10a + 10b
212 = 12a + 12b
230 = 13a + 13b

Now we have a system of linear equations. We can solve this system using various methods, such as substitution or elimination. For simplicity, we can use the elimination method.

Adding the first and second equation,
-310 + 302 = 2a
-8 = 2a
a = -4

Adding the third and fourth equation,
176 + 212 = 22a + 22b
388 = 22a + 22b
194 = 11a + 11b
194 = 11(-4) + 11b
194 = -44 + 11b
238 = 11b
b = 238 / 11

302 = a + 17b
176 = a + 10b

By solving this system, we get a = 72 and b = -10.

The function also takes the input value and raises it to the power of 1, and multiplies it by another constant coefficient (b).

Using the given data, we can find the values of a and b by substituting the inputs and outputs into the equation.

We can see that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be represented by a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 is always 1. By observing the given data, we can find the values of a and b.

When x = 0, the output is -15. Substituting these values into our equation, we get:

-15 = a(1) + b(0)
-15 = a

Similarly, by substituting the other given data points into our equation, we can find the value of b:

-35 = a(1) + b(-5)
-31 = a(1) + b(-4)
5 = a(1) + b(5)
-63 = a(1) + b(-12)

Solving these four equations simultaneously, we find that a = -15 and b = -3.

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    The pattern in the given inputs and outputs suggests a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. Let's write the function that captures this relationship.

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

After substituting the given input-output pairs, we have the following equations:

-15 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-35 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
-31 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
5 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1

Simplifying, we can rewrite these equations as:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs follows a linear pattern. We can represent this relationship using the equation:

Output = a + b * Input

where a and b are constants that we need to determine. To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given inputs and outputs into the equation and solve the resulting system of equations:

For the first pair of inputs and outputs (9, 133):
133 = a + b * 9

For the second pair (19, 283):
283 = a + b * 19

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the input and output values follows a linear pattern. Thus, the function that describes the relationship can be written as:

Substituting the given input and output pairs into the function, we can solve for the values of a and b.

Using the first input and output pair:
133 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)
133 = a + 9b

Using the second input and output pair:

Using the fifth input and output pair:
-242 = a(-16^0) + b(-16^1)

To solve for a and b, we can form a system of linear equations using these equations:

To solve this system of equations, we can use any method such as substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:
(283 - 133) = (a + 19b) - (a + 9b)

  Output:  59   -301   -81   79   -21

Let's assume the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

For the first data point (2, 59), we have:
59 = a(2^0) + b(2^1)
59 = a + 2b  ----(1)

For the second data point (-16, -301), we have:
-301 = a(-16^0) + b(-16^1)
-301 = a - 16b ----(2)

For the third data point (-5, -81), we have:
-81 = a(-5^0) + b(-5^1)
-81 = a - 5b ----(3)

For the fourth data point (3, 79), we have:
79 = a(3^0) + b(3^1)
79 = a + 3b  ----(4)

For the fifth data point (-2, -21), we have:
-21 = a(-2^0) + b(-2^1)
-21 = a - 2b ----(5)

From equations (1) and (4), we can add them to eliminate 'a':
59 + 79 = (a + 2b) + (a + 3b)
138 = 2a + 5b

From equations (2) and (3), we can add them to eliminate 'a':
-301 + (-81) = (a - 16b) + (a - 5b)
-382 = 2a - 21b

Now, we have two equations with two unknowns:
138 = 2a + 5b  ----(6)
-382 = 2a - 21b  ----(7)

Let's solve equations (6) and (7) to find the values of 'a' and 'b'.

Multiplying equation (6) by 2, we get:
276 = 4a + 10b

Subtracting equation (7) from equation (6), we get:
658 = 31b

Therefore, b = 658 / 31 ≈ 21.226

Substituting b = 21.226 back into equation (6), we can solve for 'a':
138 = 2a + 5(21.226)
138 = 2a + 106.13
2a = 138 - 106.13
2a = 31.87
a = 31.87 / 2 ≈ 15.935

Now, we have the values of 'a' and 'b'. The function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

From the input-output pair (-16, 82), we have:
82 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
82 = a + (-16)b

From the input-output pair (-11, 52), we have:
52 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
52 = a + (-11)b

From the input-output pair (14, -98), we have:
-98 = a(14)^0 + b(14)^1
-98 = a + 14b

From the input-output pair (-18, 94), we have:
94 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
94 = a + (-18)b

From the input-output pair (3, -32), we have:
-32 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1
-32 = a + 3b

Simplifying each of these equations, we get:

82 = a - 16b     (Eqn 1)
52 = a - 11b     (Eqn 2)
-98 = a + 14b    (Eqn 3)
94 = a - 18b     (Eqn 4)
-32 = a + 3b      (Eqn 5)

Now, let's solve this system of linear equations to find the values of a and b.

We can start by subtracting Eqn 2 from Eqn 1:
30 = -5b        =>   b = -6

Substituting b = -6 into Eqn 2, we get:
52 = a - 11(-6)
52 = a + 66
a = -14

So the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -14x^0 - 6x^1

Simplifying further:

Output: y = -14 - 6x

By comparing the inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between them is non-linear and doesn't fit into the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Instead, it looks like the output is related to the input by a quadratic equation.

Let's assume that the relationship can be described by a quadratic equation of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c. To find the values of a, b, and c, we can use the given data.

By substituting the first pair of values (-18, -75) into the quadratic equation, we have:
-75 = a(-18)^2 + b(-18) + c
-75 = 324a - 18b + c

Similarly, substituting the next pair (-1, -7) into the equation gives us:
-7 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c
-7 = a - b + c

And for the third pair (3, 9):
9 = a(3)^2 + b(3) + c

Now we have a system of equations:

1) -75 = a + (-18)b
2) -7 = a - b
3) 9 = a + 3b
4) -75 = a + (-18)b
5) 5 = a + 2b

Simplifying the equations, we have:

2) a - b = -7
3) a + 3b = 9
4) a + (-18)b = -75
5) a + 2b = 5

From equation 2), we can solve for a: a = -7 + b

Substituting a in equations 1), 3), 4), and 5), we have:

1) (-7 + b) + (-18)b = -75
2) -7 + b - b = -7
3) (-7 + b) + 3b = 9
4) (-7 + b) + (-18)b = -75
5) (-7 + b) + 2b = 5

Simplifying further, we get:

1) -19b = -68
2) 0 = 0
3) 4b = 16
4) -19b = -68

Now, we can solve for b:

From the given data, we can deduce the values of a and b by substituting the inputs and outputs:

-75 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
-7 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1
9 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1

From these equations, we can solve for a and b:

5 = a + 2b

Simplifying these equations, we get:

When the input is 6, the output is 74.
When the input is 19, the output is 191.
When the input is -11, the output is -79.
When the input is -5, the output is -25.
When the input is -10, the output is -70.

From this information, we can see that when the input increases by 13 (from 6 to 19), the output increases by 117 (from 74 to 191). This suggests that the coefficient b can be determined as the ratio of the change in output to the change in input, which is 117/13 = 9.

Now, let's substitute the values of b and any input-output pair into the function to solve for a. Let's use the third input-output pair (-11, -79):

For the first data point (6, 8), we have 8 = b6^1 + a6^0, which simplifies to 8 = 6b + a.
For the second data point (-5, -25), we have -25 = b(-5)^1 + a(-5)^0, which simplifies to -25 = -5b + a.
For the third data point (-3, -19), we have -19 = b(-3)^1 + a(-3)^0, which simplifies to -19 = -3b + a.
For the fourth data point (-10, -40), we have -40 = b(-10)^1 + a(-10)^0, which simplifies to -40 = -10b + a.
For the fifth data point (-14, -52), we have -52 = b(-14)^1 + a(-14)^0, which simplifies to -52 = -14b + a.

We now have a system of five linear equations:

8 = 6b + a
-25 = -5b + a
-19 = -3b + a
-40 = -10b + a
-52 = -14b + a

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

Adding equations (1) and (2):
8 + (-25) = 6b + a + (-5b + a)
-17 = b + 2a

Adding equations (2) and (3):
-25 + (-19) = -5b + a + (-3b + a)
-44 = -8b + 2a

Adding equations (3) and (4):
-19 + (-40) = -3b + a + (-10b + a)
-59 = -13b + 2a

Adding equations (4) and (5):
-40 + (-52) = -10b + a + (-14b + a)

Using the given data, we can substitute the inputs and outputs to find the values of a and b:

When x = 9, y = 29:

When x = 2, y = 8:
8 = b(2)^1 + a(2)^0
8 = 2b + a

When x = -1, y = -1:

-1 = -b + a

When x = -6, y = -16:

-1 = -b + a   ---- (3)
-16 = -6b + a ---- (4)

Subtracting equation (3) from (1) and equation (4) from (2), we get:

30 = 10b
9 = 3b

Solving these equations, we find b = 3, and substituting this value into equation (1), we get:

29 = 9(3) + a
29 = 27 + a
a = 29 - 27
a = 2

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the relationship between the input and output can be described by a linear function. Let's write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1:

To determine the values of a and b, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve for a and b. Let's do that:

For input 9 and output 29:

For input 2 and output 8:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can see that the relationship between inputs and outputs is not a simple linear or quadratic relationship. However, we can try to fit the data with a polynomial function of degree 2.

To find the polynomial function, we will use the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations:

For the first data point (-16, 109):
109 = a - 16b + 256c

For the second data point (-3, 18):
18 = a - 3b + 9c

For the third data point (2, -17):
-17 = a + 2b + 4c

For the fourth data point (12, -87):
-87 = a + 12b + 144c

For the fifth data point (5, -38):
-38 = a + 5b + 25c

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a, b, and c.

Using a matrix form, we have:

| 1  -16   256 | | a |   | 109 |
| 1   -3    9  | | b | = | 18  |
| 1    2    4  | | c |   | -17 |

    To analyze the given data, we will use the generic form of the equation as requested: y = ax^0 + bx^1.
By examining the input and output values, we can find the corresponding coefficients a and b.

Let's create a table based on the given input and output data:

Input    Output
-16       109
-3         18
2         -17
12       -87
5         -38

Based on the data, it seems apparent that the coefficient a correlates with the output values when the input is raised to the power of 0, resulting in 109, 18, -17, -87, and -38. Therefore, we can assign the constant term a to these values.

Now, let's consider the coefficient b. We observe that when the coefficient b is multiplied by the input raised to the power of 1, we obtain the output values -16, -3, 2, 12, and 5. Thus, the coefficient b corresponds with these values.

Therefore, our function can be expressed as:

Output = a + bx

Substituting the input and output values we obtained from the table, we have:

y = 109 + (-7)x

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems like the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given inputs and outputs into the equation and solve for a and b. 

When input = -16 and output = 109:
109 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
109 = a - 16b

When input = -3 and output = 18:
18 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
18 = a - 3b

When input = 2 and output = -17:
-17 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1
-17 = a + 2b

When input = 12 and output = -87:
-87 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1
-87 = a + 12b

When input = 5 and output = -38:
-38 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-38 = a + 5b

By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b:

From the first two equations, we can eliminate a by subtracting the second equation from the first:
109 - 18 = a - a - 16b + 3b
91 = -13b

From the second and third equations, we can eliminate a by subtracting the second equation from the third:
-17 - 18 = a - a + 2b - 3b
-35 = -b

From the third and fourth equations, we can eliminate a by subtracting the fourth equation from the third:
-17 + 87 = a - a + 2b - 12b
70 = -10b

From the fourth and fifth equations, we can eliminate a by subtracting the fifth equation from the fourth:
-87 + 38 = a - a + 12b - 5b
-49 = 7b

Now, we can solve for b by combining the equations -35 = -b and -49 = 7b:
-35 = -(-7b)
-35 = 7b
b = -5

Substituting the value of b back into any of the equations, we can solve for a:
70 = -10(-5)
70 = 50
a = 120

    The given data points do not currently provide enough information to determine an equation in the exact form y = ax^0 + bx^1. To capture the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can attempt to find a general equation that fits the given points.

Using the method of least squares, let's try to fit a linear equation of the form y = ax + b to the given data points:

Input: -16, Output: 109
Input: -3, Output: 18
Input: 2, Output: -17
Input: 12, Output: -87

Converting the given data points to coordinates:

(-16, 109)
(-3, 18)
(2, -17)
(12, -87)
(5, -38)

Applying the least squares method, we can solve for the slope (a) and y-intercept (b) of the linear equation:

a = (n * Σ(xy) - Σx * Σy) / (n * Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2)
b = (Σy - a * Σx) / n

where n is the number of data points, Σ represents summation, and (x, y) represents each data point.

Calculating the necessary values:

n = 5
Σx = -16 + (-3) + 2 + 12 + 5 = 0
Σy = 109 + 18 - 17 - 87 - 38 = -15
Σxy = (-16 * 109) + (-3 * 18) + (2 * -17) + (12 * -87) + (5 * -38) = -2263
Σ(x^2) = (-16^2) + (-3^2) + (2^2) + (12^2) + (5^2) = 354

Substituting these values into the equations for a and b:

a = (5 * -2263 - 0 * -15) / (5 * 354 - 0^2) ≈ -0.905
b = (-15 - (-0.905 * 0)) / 5 ≈ -3

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the input and output can be described by a quadratic function. The function can be written in the form:
Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

To find the coefficients a, b, and c, we can solve a system of equations using the provided input-output pairs.
 
1. Substituting the first input-output pair (13, 177) into the function:
177 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1 + c(13)^2
177 = a + 13b + 169c

2. Substituting the second input-output pair (14, 191) into the function:
191 = a(14)^0 + b(14)^1 + c(14)^2
191 = a + 14b + 196c

3. Substituting the third input-output pair (-8, -117) into the function:
-117 = a(-8)^0 + b(-8)^1 + c(-8)^2
-117 = a - 8b + 64c

Solving the system of equations, we find the values of the coefficients:
a = -1/2
b = 5
c = 3/2

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
Output: y = (-1/2)x^0 + 5x^1 + (3/2)x^2

    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can write the function in the form 

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Let's solve for the coefficients a and b using the given input-output pairs:

For the first pair (13, 177):
177 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
177 = a + 13b

For the second pair (14, 191):
191 = a(14^0) + b(14^1)
191 = a + 14b

For the third pair (-8, -117):
-117 = a((-8)^0) + b((-8)^1)
-117 = a - 8b

For the fourth pair (3, 37):
37 = a(3^0) + b(3^1)
37 = a + 3b

For the fifth pair (7, 93):
93 = a(7^0) + b(7^1)
93 = a + 7b

We now have a system of linear equations:

a + 13b = 177   ...(1)
a + 14b = 191   ...(2)
a - 8b = -117   ...(3)
a + 3b = 37     ...(4)
a + 7b = 93     ...(5)

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = 10 and b = 13.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

By substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation, we can form a system of equations and solve for a and b.

When input is 13, output is 177:
177 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
177 = a + 13b

When input is 14, output is 191:
191 = a(14^0) + b(14^1)
191 = a + 14b

When input is -8, output is -117:
-117 = a(-8^0) + b(-8^1)
-117 = a - 8b

When input is 3, output is 37:
37 = a(3^0) + b(3^1)
37 = a + 3b

When input is 7, output is 93:
93 = a(7^0) + b(7^1)

We now have a system of 5 equations with 2 variables (a and b). By solving this system, we can determine the values of a and b.

By solving the system of equations, we find that a = 4 and b = 17.
