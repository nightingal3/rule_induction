Using Input: -10, Output: -213:
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1

Simplifying the equation:

To find the values of a and b, we can use two data points from the given inputs and outputs. Let's use the first and third data points:

When x = -10, y = -213:
-213 = a + (-10)b   -- (1)

When x = 4, y = 67:
67 = a + 4b   -- (2)

Multiplying equation (2) by 5, we get:

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (3) to eliminate a:

335 - (-213) = 5a + 20b - a - (-10)b
548 = 4a + 30b

Simplifying equation (3):
137 = a + 7.5b

Now we have a system of equations:

a + 4b = 67
a + 7.5b = 137

Multiplying equation (1) by 7.5 and equation (2) by 4, we get:

7.5a + 30b = 1005   -- (4)
4a + 30b = 548   -- (5)

Subtracting equation (5) from equation (4) to eliminate b:

7.5a + 30b - 4a - 30b = 1005 - 548
3.5a = 457

Dividing both sides by 3.5, we get:

a = 457 / 3.5
a ≈ 130.57

Substituting the value of a into equation (1):

-3 = a                 [Eq2]
-98 = a + 5b + 25c     [Eq3]
54 = a - 3b + 9c       [Eq4]
301 = a + 16b + 256c   [Eq5]

Substituting Eq2 into Eq1, Eq3, Eq4, and Eq5, we get:

339 = -18b + 324c    [Eq6]
-98 = 5b + 25c      [Eq7]
54 = - 3b + 9c       [Eq8]
301 = 16b + 256c    [Eq9]

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of b and c. 

Solving Eq7 for b, we get:
b = (-98 - 25c) / 5

Substituting this value of b into Eq8 and Eq9, we have:
54 = 3(-98 - 25c) / 5 + 9c
301 = 16((-98 - 25c) / 5) + 256c

Simplifying these equations, we get:
270 = -294 -75c + 45c
301 = -784 - 400c + 256c

270 = -294 - 30c
301 = -784 - 144c

Solving these equations, we find:
c = 2
b = -3

Now, substituting the values of b and c into Eq6, we have:

339 = 54 + 648
339 = 702

Substituting the first pair of input-output values (5, -31):

Substituting the second pair (9, -51):

Substituting the third pair (-11, 49):

By representing the input as x and the output as y, we can use the method of least squares to find the coefficients a and b that minimize the error between the actual outputs and the predicted outputs based on the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

-51 = a + 9b                          --- equation 2

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b.

Multiplying equation 1 by 9 and multiplying equation 2 by 5, we get:

-279 = 9a + 45b        --- equation 3

Subtracting equation 4 from equation 3, we obtain:

Substituting a = 0.9b - 0.351 into equations 1 to 4, we can solve for b and c:

Equation 1: 1 = 4(0.9b - 0.351) - 2b + c
Equation 2: 17 = 49(0.9b - 0.351) + 7b + c
Equation 3: -145 = 100(0.9b - 0.351) - 10b + c

Equation 3: -145 = 90b - 35.1 - 10b + c

Substituting the first input and output:
-307 = a(20^0) + b(20^1)
-307 = a + 20b

Substituting the second input and output:
8 = a(-1^0) + b(-1^1)
8 = a - b

To solve this system of equations, we can use any method, such as substitution or elimination.

Solving by substitution:
From the second equation, we can express a in terms of b:
a = 8 + b

Substituting into the first equation:
-307 = (8 + b) + 20b
-307 = 8 + 21b
-315 = 21b

Substituting the value of b into the second equation:

20 = a + 20b

Using the second input and output:

Using linear regression, we can solve for a and b in the equation y = a + bx by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the actual outputs and the predicted outputs using the equation y = a + bx.

The calculation is as follows:

Sum of x_i: 8
Sum of y_i: -18
Sum of x_i^2: 502
Sum of x_iy_i: -246

The formula for b can be found using:

b = (n * sum(x_iy_i) - sum(x_i) * sum(y_i)) / (n * sum(x_i^2) - (sum(x_i))^2)

Substituting the values:

b = (5 * (-246) - 8 * (-18)) / (5 * 502 - (8)^2)

By substituting the given values into the equation, we can solve for the values of a and b:

For the first input and output:
-310 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1
-310 = a - 17b

By solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

Adding the two equations:

Solving for b:
b = -8/34 = -4/17

Substituting the value of b into one of the equations, we can solve for a:

"To capture the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can assume a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. However, we have observed that the output does not seem to have a linear relationship with the input. Let's try fitting a quadratic equation y = ax^2 + bx + c instead.

Given the data points, we can create a set of equations:

(9)^2a + 9b + c = 133
(19)^2a + 19b + c = 283
(16)^2a + 16b + c = 238
(-14)^2a - 14b + c = -212
(-16)^2a - 16b + c = -242

Simplifying these equations, we obtain:

Solving these equations simultaneously, the values of a, b, and c can be determined. However, this requires a system of linear equations to be solved.

To estimate the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, the values of a, b, and c can be determined using data fitting techniques such as least squares regression or polynomial fitting algorithms.

Since the exact form of the output function cannot be explicitly determined without more data points or additional information, it is outside the scope of this pattern recognition system to accurately determine the true function.",-0.21432436880244896,"[15, -2]"

"From the given data, we can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear. Instead, it appears to be quadratic or possibly higher order. 

A quadratic function can be represented as y = ax^2 + bx + c, but this does not fit the given form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

To capture the relationship with a linear function, we can use the given form y = ax^0 + bx^1, and consider that the exponent of x is always 1. Therefore, b = 1 in all cases. 

Now, we need to find the coefficient a for the input and output pairs provided. One possible approach is to fit a line through any two given points and find the slope. However, this method may not accurately represent the entire data set. 

Given the limited data points, it is difficult to determine an exact function that captures the relationship perfectly. However, we can still attempt to find a suitable linear approximation. 

Let's fit a line to the two closest points, (9, 133) and (16, 238), using the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using these two points, we can write the following equations:

133 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
238 = a(16)^0 + b(16)^1

Simplifying these equations gives us:

133 = a + 9b  ->  (1)
238 = a + 16b ->  (2)

We have a system of two equations with two unknowns (a and b). We can solve these equations to find the values of a and b.

From equation (1), we can solve for b:

b = (133 - a) / 9

Plugging this value into equation (2):

238 = a + 16((133 - a) / 9)

Simplifying:

238 = a + (16/9)(133 - a)
246 = 9a + 16(133 - a)
246 = 9a + 2128 - 16a
16a - 9a = 2128 - 246
7a = 1882
a = 268

Now we can substitute the value of a back into equation (1) to find b:

133 = 268 + 9b
9b = 133 - 268

b = -15

Input: -10, Output: -40 --> -40 = a((-10)^0) + b((-10)^1) = a - 10b
Input: -14, Output: -52 --> -52 = a((-14)^0) + b((-14)^1) = a - 14b

Let's solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

8 = a + 6b
-25 = a - 5b
-19 = a - 3b

Substituting the value of b into equation 1:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the input and output values follows a linear pattern.

Let's assume the function to be in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the given data points, we can form a system of equations:

-25 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1

Simplifying these equations, we get:

"Given the input-output pairs, we can see that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a quadratic function. However, the function should be written in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's first define x to be the input variable and y to be the output variable.

Looking at the inputs and outputs, we can see that when x = 6, y = 8. Therefore, one equation we have is 8 = a(6^0) + b(6^1), which simplifies to 8 = a + 6b.

Similarly, we can form equations for the other input-output pairs:

-25 = a + (-5)b
-19 = a + (-3)b
-40 = a + (-10)b
-52 = a + (-14)b

We now have a system of four equations with two variables (a and b). Solving this system of equations will yield the values of a and b, allowing us to write the function in the desired form.

Solving the system of equations:

8 = a + 6b
-25 = a - 5b
-19 = a - 3b
-40 = a - 10b
-52 = a - 14b

Subtracting equation 1 from equations 2 to 5 respectively:

-33 = -11b    --> equation 6: -33 = -11b
-27 = -9b     --> equation 7: -27 = -9b
-48 = -16b    --> equation 8: -48 = -16b
-60 = -20b    --> equation 9: -60 = -20b

Dividing equations 6, 7, 8, and 9 by -11, -9, -16, and -20 respectively:

3 = b         --> equation 10: b = 3
3 = b         --> equation 11: b = 3
3 = b         --> equation 12: b = 3
3 = b         --> equation 13: b = 3

Substituting b = 3 into equation 6, we have:

-33 = -11b = -11(3) = -33

Therefore, equation 6 is redundant and does not provide any new information.

Now, let's substitute b = 3 into equation 1:

8 = a + 6b
8 = a + 6(3)
8 = a + 18
a = 8 - 18
a = -10

So, the values of a and b that satisfy the system of equations are a = -10 and b = 3.

"To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of 'a' and 'b' in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: 13, Output: 177
Input: 14, Output: 191
Input: -8, Output: -117
Input: 3, Output: 37
Input: 7, Output: 93

By observing the given data, we can deduce that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not a simple linear relationship, as the coefficients of 'x' are different for each input-output pair. 

To find the function, we can use the method of least squares regression, which will help us find the best-fit line for the data. However, since the data does not form a clear pattern, it may not be possible to find a simple equation that describes the relationship accurately.

Instead, we can approximate the relationship using a polynomial regression equation with higher-order terms, such as a quadratic or cubic equation. However, without a larger dataset or additional information, it is difficult to determine the exact form of the function that perfectly captures the relationship between inputs and outputs.

Nevertheless, a simple quadratic function might provide a reasonable approximation:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

"Based on the given data, it appears that the output (y) is related to the input (x) using the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since any value raised to the power of 0 equals 1, we can simplify the equation to y = a + bx.

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve for the unknowns using a system of equations.

Using the input-output pairs (13, 177) and (14, 191):
177 = a + 13b          (Equation 1)
191 = a + 14b          (Equation 2)

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:
191 - 177 = a + 14b - a - 13b
14 = b                    (Equation 3)

Substituting b = 14 into Equation 1:
177 = a + 13(14)
177 = a + 182
a = -5                  (Equation 4)
