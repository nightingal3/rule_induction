"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The given inputs and outputs do not follow a linear relationship y = ax^0 + bx^1. To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find a different pattern or equation that describes the data. 

Let's investigate the relationship between the inputs and outputs:

Input: -10, Output: -213
Input: 9, Output: 167
Input: 4, Output: 67
Input: -3, Output: -73
Input: 20, Output: 387

By observing the outputs, we can see that they are not linearly related to the inputs. There is no clear pattern or equation that can be expressed in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Therefore, a different approach or additional information is needed to determine the relationship accurately.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: -10

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given data points to solve for the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the first data point (-10, -213), we have:
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

Using the second data point (9, 167), we have:
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Using the third data point (4, 67), we have:
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Using the fourth data point (-3, -73), we have:
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

Using the fifth data point (20, 387), we have:
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

From the equations -213 = a - 10b and 167 = a + 9b:
a = 167 - 9b

Plugging this into the equations 67 = a + 4b, -73 = a - 3b, and 387 = a + 20b:
67 = (167 - 9b) + 4b
-73 = (167 - 9b) - 3b
387 = (167 - 9b) + 20b

Simplifying each equation:
67 = 167 - 5b
-73 = 167 - 12b
387 = 167 + 11b

Rearranging the equations:
5b = 100
12b = 240
11b = 220

Solving for b:
b = 20
b = 20
b = 20

Substituting b = 20 back into one of the previous equations, let's use 5b = 100, we have:
5(20) = 100
a = 100 - 100
a = 0

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = 20x^1

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can form the following table:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| -10   | -213   |
| 9     | 167    |
| 4     | 67     |
| -3    | -73    |
| 20    | 387    |

To fit the given data, we can express the relationship between inputs and outputs using the linear equation:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Using the method of least squares, we can perform linear regression to determine the values of a and b.

Calculating the slope (b):

b = [Σ(x * y) - (Σx)(Σy) / n * Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2]

Let's calculate the required values:

Σx = -10 + 9 + 4 - 3 + 20 = 20
Σy = -213 + 167 + 67 - 73 + 387 = 335

Σ(x * y) = (-10 * -213) + (9 * 167) + (4 * 67) + (-3 * -73) + (20 * 387) = -4260 + 1503 + 268 + 219 + 7740 = 6630
Σ(x^2) = (-10)^2 + 9^2 + 4^2 + (-3)^2 + 20^2 = 100 + 81 + 16 + 9 + 400 = 606

n = 5 (number of data points)

Now, we can calculate b:

b = (6630 - (20 * 335) / 5 * 606 - 20^2
b = (6630 - 6700) / (5 * 606 - 400)
b = -70 / 2030
b = -0.034483

Calculating the y-intercept (a):

a = (Σy - b * Σx) / n
a = (335 - (-0.034483 * 20)) / 5
a = (335 + 0.68966) / 5
a = 335.68966 / 5
a = 67.13793

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given input-output pairs to solve for the coefficients in the function.

Let's assume the function is of the form: y = a + bx.

Using the input-output pairs, we can create a system of equations:

For Input: -10, Output: -213:
-213 = a + (-10)b

For Input: 9, Output: 167:
167 = a + (9)b

For Input: 4, Output: 67:

For Input: -3, Output: -73:
-73 = a + (-3)b

For Input: 20, Output: 387:
387 = a + (20)b

Now, we can solve this system of equations for the constants a and b to determine the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Solving these equations, we get:
a = -59
b = 22

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Substituting the given inputs and outputs into the function:

    From the given input-output pairs, we can see that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function, where the output (y) is determined by the input (x) with coefficients (a and b).

Using the given input-output pairs, we can find the values of a and b by solving a system of equations.

For Input = -18, Output = 339:
339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1 
339 = a + (-18)b

For Input = 0, Output = -3:
-3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1 
-3 = a + 0b
-3 = a

For Input = 5, Output = -98:

-98 = a + 5b

For Input = -3, Output = 54:
54 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1 
54 = a + (-3)b

For Input = -16, Output = 301:
301 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1 
301 = a + (-16)b

Simplifying the equations:
a + (-18)b = 339     -> Equation 1
a = -3                          -> Equation 2
a + 5b = -98           -> Equation 3
a + (-3)b = 54        -> Equation 4
a + (-16)b = 301    -> Equation 5

-3 + 5b = -98             -> Equation 7
-3 + (-3)b = 54         -> Equation 8
-3 + (-16)b = 301    -> Equation 9

When input is 17, output is -218: -218 = a(17^0) + b(17^1)
When input is 5, output is -74: -74 = a(5^0) + b(5^1)
When input is 3, output is -50: -50 = a(3^0) + b(3^1)
When input is -6, output is 58: 58 = a((-6)^0) + b((-6)^1)

Simplifying these equations, we have:

-98 = a + 7b
-218 = a + 17b
-74 = a + 5b
-50 = a + 3b
58 = a - 6b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

Using the second and third equations, we can eliminate a:
-218 - (-74) = (a + 17b) - (a + 5b)
-144 = 12b
b = -12

Substituting this value of b back into the third equation:
-74 = a + 5(-12)
-74 = a - 60
a = -14

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = -14x^0 - 12x^1
y = -14 - 12x

    Based on the given data, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be approximated using a quadratic function of the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

However, since the prompt specifically asks for a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify the quadratic form to a linear form by setting the coefficient of x^2 (c) to zero. This results in the following linear function:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve for a and b.

Using the given input-output pairs, we can set up a system of equations:

58 = a - 6b                 ---(5)

Solving equations (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) simultaneously will give us the values of a and b.

Solving these equations, we get:

    The given data doesn't follow a linear relationship as the outputs do not vary linearly with the inputs. Therefore, a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 will not accurately describe the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

To determine the relationship, we need to look for a pattern in the given data points.

When examining the outputs, we can see that they are all odd numbers, with the first output being 17. Additionally, the outputs seem to be increasing at an irregular rate.

After analyzing these insights, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by an equation of the form:

Output: y = ax^2 + bx + c

Using the given data points, we can try to determine the values of a, b, and c.

Input: -10, Output: 161

161 = 100a - 10b + c   (Equation 3)

Solving this system of equations simultaneously will give us the values of a, b, and c:

Equation 1 - Equation 3:
17 - 161 = 4a - 2b + c - (100a - 10b + c)
-144 = -96a + 8b
12 = 8b - 96a
3 = 2b - 24a   (Equation 4)

Equation 1 - Equation 2:
17 - (-145) = 4a - 2b + c - (49a + 7b + c)
162 = -45a - 9b
18 = -5a - b
5a + b = -18   (Equation 5)

Solving Equations 4 and 5 simultaneously:
3 = 2b - 24a
5a + b = -18

Multiplying Equation 5 by 2 and subtracting it from Equation 4:
3 - 2(5a + b) = 2b - 24a - 2(-18)
3 - 10a - 2b = 2b - 24a + 36
3 - 34a = 4b - 24a + 36
10a + 24a = 4b + 36 - 3
34a = 4b + 33
34a - 4b = 33   (Equation 6)

Using Equation 5, isolate b:
5a + b = -18
b = -18 - 5a   (Equation 7)

Substituting Equation 7 into Equation 6:
34a - 4(-18 - 5a) = 33
34a + 72 + 20a = 33
54a + 72 = 33
54a = -39
a = -39/54
a = -13/18

Now substitute the value of a into Equation 7 to find b:
b = -18 - 5(-13/18)
b = -18 + 65/18
b = (65 - 18*18)/(18)
b = -283/18

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -13/18x^2 - 283/18x + c

To determine the value of c, we can substitute any of the given input-output pairs into the equation. Let's use the first pair (Input: -2, Output: 17):

17 = -13/18(-2)^2 - 283/18(-2) + c
17 = -52/18 + 566/18 + c
17 = 514/18 + c
c = 17 - 514/18
c = (18*17 - 514)/18
c = 306/18
c = 17

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's first analyze the pattern:

Input: -2, Output: 17
Input: 7, Output: -145
Input: -10, Output: 161
Input: 9, Output: -181
Input: -20, Output: 341

At first glance, it is not apparent what the exact form of the function is. However, we can observe that the outputs seem to decrease as the inputs increase, and vice versa. 

To capture this relationship, we can use a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x represents the input. In this case, as the outputs seem to decrease as the inputs increase, we can assume that the coefficient of x^1 should be negative.

Let's define the function using the provided inputs and outputs:

x = Input value
y = Output value

For the first input-output pair:
-2 = x, 17 = y

We can substitute the values into the function:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
17 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1
17 = a + (-2b)

Simplifying the equation, we have:

a - 2b = 17   ----(1)

Similarly, we can substitute the values for the remaining input-output pairs into the function:

7 = x, -145 = y
-10 = x, 161 = y
9 = x, -181 = y
-20 = x, 341 = y

This gives us the following equations:

a + 7b = -145  ----(2)
a - 10b = 161  ----(3)
a + 9b = -181  ----(4)
a - 20b = 341  ----(5)

We now have a system of linear equations (1)-(5) that we can solve to find the coefficients a and b.

Solving the system of equations, we find:
a = -2
b = -15

To solve for a and b, we can subtract the fourth equation from the first one, which eliminates b:

To determine the values of a and b, we can make use of the given input-output pairs:

For the first pair (13, -66):

-66 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1
-66 = a + 13b

For the second pair (-20, 132):

132 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
132 = a - 20b

For the third pair (18, -96):

-96 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1
-96 = a + 18b

For the fourth pair (0, 12):

12 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
12 = a + 0

For the fifth pair (11, -54):

-54 = a(11)^0 + b(11)^1
-54 = a + 11b

Simplifying the above equations, we get:

132 = a - 20b             ------ (2)

12 = a                    ------ (4)
-54 = a + 11b             ------ (5)

Substituting equation (4) into equations (1), (2), and (3), we have:

-66 = 12 + 13b            =>   -78 = 13b     =>   b = -6

132 = 12 - 20b            =>   144 = 20b    =>   b = 7.2

-96 = 12 + 18b            =>   -108 = 18b   =>   b = -6

Thus, a = 12 and b = -6.

    The data points given do not seem to follow a clear pattern or relationship where a single equation can fit accurately. However, if we assume a linear relationship between the input and output, we can try to find the best-fit line using a linear regression approach.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's represent the input as x and the output as y. 

Looking at the given data, we can observe that y is a linear combination of x^0 and x^1. 

Let's assume the function is of the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Substituting the given inputs and outputs into the equation, we have:

142 = a(10)^0 + b(10)^1

217 = a(15)^0 + b(15)^1

-158 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1

-68 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1

187 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1

Since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, the equation simplifies to:

142 = a + 10b

217 = a + 15b

-158 = a - 10b

-68 = a - 4b

187 = a + 13b

Now we have a system of linear equations. Solving for a and b:

Adding the 1st and 3rd equations:

142 - 158 = 2a

-16 = 2a

a = -8

Substituting a = -8 into the 1st or 3rd equation:

142 = -8 + 10b

150 = 10b

b = 15

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

14 = a(1)^0 + b(1)^1

Simplifying the equations, we get:

-292 = a - 17b     ...(1)
-105 = a - 6b      ...(2)
-275 = a - 16b     ...(3)
-309 = a - 18b     ...(4)
14 = a + b         ...(5)

To solve this system of equations, we can use any method of solving simultaneous equations, such as substitution or elimination.

By subtracting equations (1) and (2), we can eliminate the variable 'a':

-292 - (-105) = (a - 17b) - (a - 6b)
-187 = -11b
b = 17

Substituting the value of b into equation (5), we can solve for a:

14 = a + 17
a = -3

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -3x^0 + 17x^1
or

    From the given inputs and outputs, it seems like the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a quadratic function. The quadratic function can be written in the form:

y = ax^2 + bx + c

To find the coefficients a, b, and c, we can use the input and output values provided. We can create a system of equations using the given data points and solve for the coefficients.

From the given data:

Input: -7, Output: 130
Input: 14, Output: -290
Input: -12, Output: 230
Input: 16, Output: -330
Input: 16, Output: -330

We can form the system of equations as follows:

130 = a(-7)^2 + b(-7) + c
-290 = a(14)^2 + b(14) + c
230 = a(-12)^2 + b(-12) + c
-330 = a(16)^2 + b(16) + c
-330 = a(16)^2 + b(16) + c

Simplifying the equations:

49a - 7b + c = 130
196a + 14b + c = -290
144a - 12b + c = 230
256a + 16b + c = -330
256a + 16b + c = -330

Rearranging the equations:

49a - 7b + c = 130
196a + 14b + c = -290
144a - 12b + c = 230
256a + 16b + c = -330
256a + 16b + c = -330

Solving the system of equations, we find:

a = -3.5
b = 10
c = 70

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -3.5x^2 + 10x + 70

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can see that there is a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. We can represent this relationship as:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Simplifying further, we get:

y = a + bx

To find the values of the constants a and b, we can use any two input-output pairs. Let's choose (-7, 130) and (14, -290). Plugging in the values, we get:

130 = a + (-7)b

-290 = a + 14b

Solving these two equations simultaneously will give us the values of a and b.

Adding the two equations:

130 - 290 = a + -7b + a + 14b

-160 = 2a + 7b

Rearranging this equation, we get:

7b = -160 - 2a

We can substitute this value of 7b in any of the two original equations to obtain the value of a.

Let's choose the first equation:

130 = a + (-7)b

Substituting 7b as -160 - 2a, we get:

130 = a + (-7)(-160 - 2a)

130 = a + 1120 + 14a

Combining like terms, we have:

0 = 15a + 1120 - 130

0 = 15a + 990

Subtracting 990 from both sides, we get:

-990 = 15a

Dividing both sides by 15, we find:

a = -66

Now, substituting this value of a into one of the original equations, we can find the value of b.

Using the first equation:

130 = a + (-7)b

Substituting a = -66, we have:

130 = -66 + (-7)b

Combining like terms, we get:

196 = -7b

Dividing both sides by -7, we find:

b = -28

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -66 + (-28)x

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can write the equation as y = ax^0 + bx^1. Let's solve for a and b using the given inputs and outputs:

For the first data point (input: -7, output: 130):

130 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7)^1
130 = a + (-7)b

For the second data point (input: 14, output: -290):

-290 = a(14)^0 + b(14)^1
-290 = a + 14b

For the third data point (input: -12, output: 230):

230 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
230 = a + (-12)b

For the fourth data point (input: 16, output: -330):

-330 = a(16)^0 + b(16)^1
-330 = a + 16b

From these equations, we can solve for a and b using any method. Let's use the method of substitution:

First, solve the equation 130 = a + (-7)b for a:
a = 130 - (-7)b
a = 130 + 7b

Substitute this value of a into the second equation -290 = a + 14b:
-290 = (130 + 7b) + 14b
-290 = 130 + 21b
21b = -290 - 130
21b = -420
b = -420/21
b = -20

Substitute the value of b = -20 into the equation a = 130 + 7b:
a = 130 + 7(-20)
a = 130 - 140
a = -10

Therefore, the equation that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    After analyzing the data, we can see that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be approximated by a linear function. The function can be expressed as:

Output = a + b * Input

Now, let's find the values of a and b that best fit the given data points.

For the first data point (-14, -97):

-97 = a + b * (-14)

For the second data point (7, 50):

50 = a + b * 7

We now have a system of linear equations that we can solve to find the values of a and b. Subtracting the second equation from the first equation:

-97 - 50 = a + b * (-14) - a - b * 7

-147 = -21b

b = 7

Substituting b = 7 into the second equation:

50 = a + 7 * 7
50 = a + 49

a = 1

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the pattern can be represented by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since any number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1, the equation can be simplified to y = a + bx.

To determine the values of a and b, we need to look for the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Looking at the inputs and outputs provided:
Input: -14, Output: -97
Input: 7, Output: 50

We can observe that when the input increases by 14, the output increases by 47. This tells us that the coefficient b is equal to 47.

We can then substitute one of the input-output pairs into the equation to find the value of a. Let's use the input-output pair (-14, -97):
-97 = a + 47 * -14
-97 = a - 658
a = -97 + 658

When Input = -14, Output = -97
When Input = 7, Output = 50
When Input = 2, Output = 15

By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can see that the relationship between Input and Output can be expressed as a linear equation. We can write the function in the form:

Output = a * Input^0 + b * Input^1

Simplifying the equation:

Output = a * 1 + b * Input

Now, let's substitute the values from the examples to find the values of 'a' and 'b':

For Input = -14, Output = -97:

-97 = a + (-14)b

For Input = 7, Output = 50:

50 = a + 7b

For Input = 2, Output = 15:

15 = a + 2b

We have a system of equations:

a + (-14)b = -97   --- (1)
a + 7b = 50       --- (2)
a + 2b = 15       --- (3)

Let's solve this system of equations to find the values of 'a' and 'b':

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):

(-14 - 7)b = -97 - 50
-21b = -147
b = 7

Substituting the value of 'b' into equation (3):

(5, -26)
(1, -14)
(-14, 31)
(-5, 4)

By substituting the values, we get the following equations:

-26 = a(5^0) + b(5^1)  => -26 = a + 5b         (Equation 1)
-14 = a(1^0) + b(1^1)  => -14 = a + b           (Equation 2)
31 = a((-14)^0) + b((-14)^1) => 31 = a - 14b   (Equation 3)
4 = a((-5)^0) + b((-5)^1)   => 4 = a - 5b      (Equation 4)
13 = a((-8)^0) + b((-8)^1)  => 13 = a - 8b     (Equation 5)

Now, we have a system of equations (Equations 1-5) that can be solved simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Solving equations (Equation 2) and (Equation 4) simultaneously:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems like a linear function might not be the best fit for describing the relationship between the inputs and outputs. The outputs do not appear to vary linearly with the inputs.

However, we can try to identify some patterns in the data. If we assume that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is nonlinear, we can try fitting a quadratic function of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are coefficients to be determined.

Let's try to find the coefficients by using the given inputs and outputs:

1. (-9, 64):
64 = a(-9)^2 + b(-9) + c

2. (-3, 22):
22 = a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c

3. (9, -62):
-62 = a(9)^2 + b(9) + c

4. (-5, 36):
36 = a(-5)^2 + b(-5) + c

5. (-16, 113):
113 = a(-16)^2 + b(-16) + c

Simplifying the equations above, we can solve them simultaneously to find the coefficients a, b, and c.

We can use an equation solver to obtain the exact coefficients. But without the use of a solver, let's find an approximate solution:

From the 1st equation: 64 = 81a - 9b + c
From the 2nd equation: 22 = 9a - 3b + c
From the 3rd equation: -62 = 81a + 9b + c
From the 4th equation: 36 = 25a - 5b + c
From the 5th equation: 113 = 256a + 16b + c

By adding the 1st, 2nd, and 4th equations, we can eliminate c:

122 = 115a - 5b

Adding this result with the 3rd equation gives:

60 = 196a

a ≈ 0.30612244898

Substituting this value of a back into the equation we derived earlier:

122 = 115(0.30612244898) - 5b

b ≈ 231.324

Now that we have approximate values for a and b, we can substitute them back into any of the original equations to find c.

Let's substitute them into the 1st equation:

    By observing the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) can be approximated using a quadratic function. Therefore, let's assume the function is in the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Simplifying further, we have:

y = a + bx

To find the values of ""a"" and ""b,"" we can use the given input-output pairs:

When x = -9, y = 64: 64 = a - 9b ...........(1)

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between inputs and outputs cannot be accurately captured in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. This is because the outputs do not seem to follow any specific pattern that can be described by a simple linear equation.

However, we can still try to find a function that approximates the relationship. One possible function that could describe the data is a quadratic function in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c. Let me evaluate the coefficients a, b, and c using the given inputs and outputs:

1. For the input -9 and output 64:

   64 = 81a - 9b + c

2. For the input -3 and output 22:

3. For the input 9 and output -62:

    Given the input-output pairs (-9, 64), (-3, 22), (9, -62), (-5, 36), and (-16, 113), it seems like a linear function might not accurately capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Let's try a quadratic function instead.

The general form of a quadratic function is y = ax^2 + bx + c. However, since we are given input-output pairs of the form (x, y), where y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can rewrite the quadratic function as y = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c. Simplifying, we have:

y = a + b + c

Now, let's substitute the given input-output pairs into our equation and solve for the coefficients a, b, and c:

For the input (-9), the output (64) gives us the equation:

64 = a + b + c           (Equation 1)

Similarly, for the inputs -3, 9, -5, and -16, we have:

22 = a - b + c            (Equation 2)
-62 = a + b + c          (Equation 3)
36 = a - b + c            (Equation 4)
113 = a + b + c          (Equation 5)

Next, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a, b, and c.

Adding equations (2) and (4), we eliminate b:

58 = 2a + 2c             (Equation 6)

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (3), we eliminate b again:

-40 = -2a                (Equation 7)

From equation (7), we can solve for a:

a = 20

Substituting the value of a back into equation (7), we find:

-40 = -2(20)

-40 = -40

This tells us that equation (7) is consistent. Now, substituting the value of a into equation (6), we have:

58 = 2(20) + 2c

58 = 40 + 2c

18 = 2c

c = 9

Finally, we can substitute the values of a and c into any of the equations (1), (2), (3), or (4) to solve for b. We will use equation (3):

-62 = 20 + b + 9

-62 = 29 + b

b = -91

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 20 + (-91)x + 9

We can observe that as the input value decreases, the output value also generally decreases. This suggests a negative relationship between the input and the output. 

Considering the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify it to y = a + bx. 

Let's solve for the values of a and b by substituting the input and output values into the equation:

For the first data point (-20, 265):
265 = a + b*(-20)

For the second data point (-15, 195):

Using the given inputs and outputs:

For the first data point: -10 = a + b(-10)^1
For the second data point: -20 = a + b(-20)^1

This forms a system of equations that we can solve simultaneously to find the values of a and b. 

Solving the system of equations:

From the first equation, we can substitute a = -10 - b(-10)^1 into the second equation:

-20 = (-10 - b(-10)^1) + b(-20)^1
-20 = -10 + 10b + (-20)b
-20 = -10(1 + b) - 20b
-20 = -10 - 30b
30b = -10 + 20
30b = 10
b = 10/30
b = 1/3

Now, substituting the value of b back into the first equation:

-10 = a + (1/3)(-10)^1
-10 = a - 10/3
-30/3 + a = -10
-30 + 3a = -30

To find the values of a and b, let's substitute the given input-output pairs into the function:

1) When x = -11, y = -20
   -20 = a + b(-11)

2) When x = -8, y = -14
   -14 = a + b(-8)

3) When x = -2, y = -2
   -2 = a + b(-2)

4) When x = -7, y = -12
   -12 = a + b(-7)

5) When x = -17, y = -32
   -32 = a + b(-17)

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since x^0 is equal to 1, the function can be simplified as y = a + bx.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given inputs and outputs to form a system of linear equations. Let's calculate the values of a and b using the first two data points:

For the first data point:

For the second data point:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be best described by a quadratic function, rather than a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

A quadratic function can be written in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants.

To find the specific values of a, b, and c that best fit the given data, we can use a quadratic regression analysis. However, since you specifically asked for a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, I will simplify the quadratic function by assuming a constant term (c) of 0. 

Therefore, the simplified function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = bx + ax^2

Next, we can use the given data to solve for the values of a and b using substitution. Taking two arbitrary data points:

When Input = -17, Output = -310:

-310 = b(-17) + a(-17)^2

-310 = -17b + 289a ..... (Equation 1)

When Input = 17, Output = 302:

302 = b(17) + a(17)^2

302 = 17b + 289a ..... (Equation 2)

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b:

2a = -612
a = -306

Substituting this value of a into Equation 1:

-310 = -17b + 289(-306)

-310 = -17b - 88134

b = 88124/17
b = 5178.118

For Input = -17, Output = -310:

-310 = a + (-17)b

For Input = 17, Output = 302:

302 = a + 17b

For Input = 10, Output = 176:
176 = a(10)^0 + b(10)^1
176 = a + 10b

For Input = 12, Output = 212:
212 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1
212 = a + 12b

For Input = 13, Output = 230:
230 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1
230 = a + 13b

We have a system of linear equations with two unknowns, a and b. To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. However, we can also use a regression analysis to determine the coefficients a and b directly.

Using a regression analysis tool or a curve fitting algorithm, we can find that the function that best fits the given data points is:

Output = y = ax^0 + bx^1 

The quadratic equation can be represented as:

Output = y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

However, since the given data does not contain a quadratic term, we can assume that the coefficient c is zero. Hence, the function can be simplified to:

Output = y = ax^0 + bx^1

Now, let's calculate the values of a and b using the given data points:

1. When Input = -16, Output = 297

297 = a*(-16)^0 + b*(-16)^1
297 = a + (-16)b

2. When Input = 18, Output = -315

Based on the given pairs of inputs and outputs, we can observe that the output is always the result of a combination of two terms: a constant term (x^0) and a linear term (x^1). 

The constant term seems to be consistently negative, with a value of -15 when the input is 0. This suggests that the coefficient of x^0 is -15.

The linear term, on the other hand, varies depending on the input. It appears to be a decreasing linear function, as the coefficient of x^1 decreases as the input decreases. Specifically, when the input is -5, the coefficient of x^1 is -35, and when the input is -4, the coefficient is -31.

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is given by:
y = -15 + (-x)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: 0
Output: -15

    Based on the given data points, we can observe that the pattern between the inputs and outputs is not a linear relationship. Instead, it appears to be a polynomial relationship of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the coefficients a and b, let's substitute each data point into the equation:

For input 0, output -15:
-15 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-15 = a

For input -5, output -35:
-35 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
-35 = a - 5b

For input -4, output -31:
-31 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
-31 = a - 4b

For input 5, output 5:
5 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
5 = a + 5b

For input -12, output -63:
-63 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
-63 = a - 12b

Simplifying the equations, we have:

-15 = a                 --> Equation 1
-35 = a - 5b          --> Equation 2
-31 = a - 4b          --> Equation 3
5 = a + 5b            --> Equation 4
-63 = a - 12b         --> Equation 5

Let's solve the system of equations to find the values of a and b:

From Equations 1 and 2, we can eliminate a:
-35 + 15 = -5b
-20 = -5b
b = 4

Substituting the value of b into Equation 1:
-15 = a
a = -15

Therefore, the equation that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output (y) = -15(x^0) + 4(x^1)
y = -15 + 4x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To capture the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Looking at the given data, we notice that when the input is 0, the output is -15. This suggests that the coefficient a of the constant term (x^0) is -15.

Now, we can use another data point to find the coefficient b. When the input is 5, the output is 5. Plugging these values into our function:

5 = -15(5^0) + b(5^1)
5 = -15 + 5b

Solving for b:

5b = 5 + 15
5b = 20
b = 4

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -15(1) + 4x

    After observing the given input-output pairs, it seems that the output can be represented as a linear function of the input. Let's denote the input as x and the output as y. 

From the given pairs, we can represent the function in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

To simplify, we know that any number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1. Therefore, x^0 is equal to 1 for any value of x. 

So, the function can be written as:

Output: y = a(1) + bx

Based on the given data, we can calculate the values of a and b as follows:

When Input = 0, Output = -15:
-15 = a(1) + 0b
-15 = a

When Input = -5, Output = -35:
-35 = a(1) - 5b

When Input = -4, Output = -31:
-31 = a(1) - 4b

When Input = 5, Output = 5:
5 = a(1) + 5b

When Input = -12, Output = -63:
-63 = a(1) + 12b

From these equations, we can solve for a and b:

a = -15
b = 5

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between input and output can be expressed as:

Output: y = -15 + 5x

    To capture the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can observe that the output values seem to be related to the input values by a linear equation. The equation takes the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 represents the constant term and x^1 represents the coefficient of x.

Let's find the values of a and b by substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation.

For the input-output pair (0, -15):
-15 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-15 = a

For the input-output pair (-5, -35):
-35 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
-35 = a - 5b

For the input-output pair (-4, -31):
-31 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
-31 = a - 4b

For the input-output pair (5, 5):
5 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
5 = a + 5b

For the input-output pair (-12, -63):
-63 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
-63 = a - 12b

Now we have a system of equations:
-15 = a,
-35 = a - 5b,
-31 = a - 4b,
5 = a + 5b,
-63 = a - 12b.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the values of a and b. We can do this by solving a system of linear equations using the given data points.

Input: 19, Output: 283
Input: 16, Output: 238

a*16^0 + b*16^1 = 238
a*(-14)^0 + b*(-14)^1 = -212

a + 19b = 283
a + 16b = 238
a - 14b = -212
a - 16b = -242

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of a and b that make the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 fit the given data.

For the first data point (9, 133):
133 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)
133 = a(1) + b(9)
133 = a + 9b

For the second data point (19, 283):
283 = a(19^0) + b(19^1)
283 = a(1) + b(19)
283 = a + 19b

For the third data point (16, 238):
238 = a(16^0) + b(16^1)
238 = a(1) + b(16)
238 = a + 16b

For the fourth data point (-14, -212):
-212 = a((-14)^0) + b((-14)^1)

-242 = a((-16)^0) + b((-16)^1)
-242 = a(1) + b(-16)
-242 = a - 16b

1) 133 = a + 9b
2) 283 = a + 19b
3) 238 = a + 16b
4) -212 = a - 14b
5) -242 = a - 16b

Solving the system of equations gives us a = -4 and b = 15.

    Let's ignore the outputs for now and focus on finding the relationship between inputs and outputs. 

We can observe that the output values seem to increase linearly with the input values. To find the linear equation that relates inputs and outputs, we can calculate the slope and y-intercept using the given data points.

Using the first and second data points (9, 133) and (19, 283), we can calculate the slope (b) as:
b = (283 - 133)/(19 - 9) = 150/10 = 15

Taking any one of the data points and the calculated slope, we can find the y-intercept (a):

a = -2

Therefore, the equation that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
Output: y = -2 + 15x

Now, let's check if this equation holds true for the given data points:
For input 9, using the equation: -2 + 15*9 = -2 + 135 = 133 (Matches the output)
For input 19, using the equation: -2 + 15*19 = -2 + 285 = 283 (Matches the output)
For input 16, using the equation: -2 + 15*16 = -2 + 240 = 238 (Matches the output)
For input -14, using the equation: -2 + 15*(-14) = -2 + (-210) = -212 (Matches the output)
For input -16, using the equation: -2 + 15*(-16) = -2 + (-240) = -242 (Matches the output)

To find the values of a and b, we can use two of the input-output pairs, such as (9, 133) and (19, 283). 

Using the first pair:

When Input is 9, Output is 133:
133 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)   ->   133 = a + 9b

When Input is 19, Output is 283:
283 = a(19^0) + b(19^1)   ->   283 = a + 19b

Solving these two equations, we can find the values of a and b.

Divide the first equation by 9:  133/9 = a/9 + b
Divide the second equation by 19:  283/19 = a/19 + b

Simplifying, we get:
14.78 = a/9 + b
14.89 = a/19 + b

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Subtract the second equation from the first equation:

a/9 - a/19 = 14.78 - 14.89

Simplifying, we get:
(19a - 9a) / (9 * 19) = -0.11

10a / 171 = -0.11

10a = -0.11 * 171

a = -1.881

We can use two equations with two unknowns to solve for a and b.

Similarly, we can write equations for the other examples:

61 = a(15^0) + b(15^1)
13 = a(-1^0) + b(-1^1)

    To find a function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use the given inputs and outputs to find the values of the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the provided data points:

For the input of 13, the output is 55:
55 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
55 = a(1) + b(13)
55 = a + 13b      ----> Equation 1

For the input of -20, the output is -44:
-44 = a(-20^0) + b(-20^1)
-44 = a(1) - 20b
-44 = a - 20b       ----> Equation 2

For the input of 15, the output is 61:
61 = a(15^0) + b(15^1)
61 = a(1) + 15b
61 = a + 15b        ----> Equation 3

For the input of -1, the output is 13:
13 = a(-1^0) + b(-1^1)
13 = a(1) - b
13 = a - b          ----> Equation 4

For the input of -14, the output is -26:
-26 = a(-14^0) + b(-14^1)
-26 = a(1) - 14b
-26 = a - 14b       ----> Equation 5

Now we have a system of equations (Equations 1-5) with two unknowns (a and b). We can solve this system of equations to find the values of the coefficients a and b.

    In order to find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs given, we can represent it as a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Looking at the input-output pairs:

Input: -11, Output: 72
Input: -3, Output: 8
Input: -2, Output: 0
Input: 18, Output: -160
Input: -7, Output: 40

we can see that the function is not a simple linear relationship. Instead, it seems to be a quadratic relationship. Thus, we would need a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c.

We can use the method of finite differences to calculate the coefficients of the quadratic equation.

First, let's calculate the values of the second finite difference:

(-11, 72) -> (-3, 8) -> (-2, 0) -> (18, -160) -> (-7, 40)

1st finite difference: 72 - 8 = 64
2nd finite difference: 8 - 0 = 8
3rd finite difference: 0 - (-160) = 160
4th finite difference: (-160) - 40 = -200

Since the 4th finite difference is a constant (-200), it suggests a quadratic relationship.

Now, we substitute the values into the quadratic equation: y = ax^2 + bx + c

(-11, 72) -> 72 = a(-11)^2 + b(-11) + c
72 = 121a - 11b + c  ---- (1)

(-3, 8) -> 8 = a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c
8 = 9a - 3b + c  ---- (2)

(-2, 0) -> 0 = a(-2)^2 + b(-2) + c
0 = 4a - 2b + c  ---- (3)

(18, -160) -> -160 = a(18)^2 + b(18) + c
-160 = 324a + 18b + c  ---- (4)

(-7, 40) -> 40 = a(-7)^2 + b(-7) + c
40 = 49a + 7b + c  ---- (5)

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a, b, and c.

From (2) - (1):
8 - 72 = (9a - 3b + c) - (121a - 11b + c)
-64 = -112a + 8b  ---- (6)

From (3) - (2):
0 - 8 = (4a - 2b + c) - (9a - 3b + c)
-8 = -5a + b  ---- (7)

From (4) - (3):
-160 - 0 = (324a + 18b + c) - (4a - 2b + c)
-160 = 320a + 20b  ---- (8)

From (5) - (4):
40 - (-160) = (49a + 7b + c) - (324a + 18b + c)
200 = -275a - 11b  ---- (9)

Equations (6) and (7) are a system of linear equations that can be solved simultaneously:

-64 = -112a + 8b  ---- (6)
-8 = -5a + b  ---- (7)

Multiplying the equation (7) by 8 we have:
-64 = -40a + 8b  ---- (10)

Now, adding equation (6) and equation (10):
-64 + (-64) = -112a + 8b + (-40a + 8b)
-128 = -152a + 16b

Rearranging the terms:
-152a + 16b = -128
8b - 152a = -128  ---- (11)

Substituting equation (8) into equation (9):
200 = -275a - 11b  ---- (9)
200 + 11b = -275a
11b - 275a = 200  ---- (12)

Multiplying equation (11) by 11, and equation (12) by 8:
88b - 1672a = -1408  ---- (13)
88b - 2200a = 1600  ---- (14)

Subtracting equation (14) from equation (13):
88b - 2200a - (88b - 1672a) = -1408 - 1600
88b - 88b - 2200a + 1672a = -3008
-528a = -3008
a = -3008 / -528
a = 5.67

Substituting the value of a into equation (11):
8b - 152(5.67) = -128
8b - 860.84 = -128
8b = -128 + 860.84
8b = 732.84
b = 732.84 / 8
b = 91.605

Finally, substituting the values of a and b into equation (1):
72 = 5.67(-11)^2 + 91.605(-11) + c
72 = 5.67(121) - 1007.655 + c
72 = 685.07 - 1007.655 + c
72 = -322.585 + c
c = 322.585 + 72
c = 394.585

Therefore, the quadratic equation that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 5.67x^2 + 91.605x + 394.585

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems like the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a quadratic function. Therefore, the function can be written as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

By substituting x and y values from the given examples into this equation, we can solve for the coefficients a and b. Let's start by substituting the values from the first example (-11, 72):

72 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1

72 = a - 11b

By substituting values from the second example (-3, 8):

8 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1

8 = a - 3b

By substituting values from the third example (-2, 0):

0 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1

0 = a - 2b

By substituting values from the fourth example (18, -160):

-160 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1

-160 = a + 18b

Finally, by substituting values from the fifth example (-7, 40):

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear. Instead, it may be better described by a quadratic function in the form of y = ax^2 + bx + c.

To determine the function that captures this relationship, we can use the given data points to solve for the coefficients a, b, and c. By substituting the inputs and outputs into the quadratic equation, we can create a system of equations to solve.

Using the first three data points:
1) 72 = a(-11)^2 + b(-11) + c
2) 8 = a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c
3) 0 = a(-2)^2 + b(-2) + c

Simplifying each equation:
1) 72 = 121a - 11b + c
2) 8 = 9a - 3b + c
3) 0 = 4a - 2b + c

Subtracting equation 3 from equation 2 to eliminate c:
8 - 0 = (9a - 3b + c) - (4a - 2b + c)
8 = 5a - b

Substituting equation 3 into equation 1 to eliminate c:
72 = (121a - 11b + c) - (4a - 2b + c)
72 = 117a - 13b

Now we have a system of equations:
8 = 5a - b
72 = 117a - 13b

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b:

Rearranging the equations:
5a - b = 8      (equation A)
117a - 13b = 72 (equation B)

Solving the system:
Multiply equation A by 13:
65a - 13b = 104  (equation A')
117a - 13b = 72   (equation B)

Subtract equation B from equation A':
65a - 117a = 104 - 72
-52a = 32
a = -32/52
a = -8/13

Substituting the value of a into equation A to solve for b:
5(-8/13) - b = 8
-40/13 - b = 8
b = -40/13 - 8
b = -40/13 - 104/13
b = -144/13

Now we have the values of a = -8/13 and b = -144/13. To find the value of c, we can substitute these values into any of the original equations:

Using equation 1:
72 = (-8/13)(-11)^2 + (-144/13)(-11) + c
72 = 88/13 + 1584/13 + c
72 = 1672/13 + c
c = 72 - 1672/13
c = (936 - 1672)/13
c = -736/13

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can compute the slope (b) and y-intercept (a) of the linear function.

Given the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can create the following equations:

66 = a - 4b
300 = a - 17b

    To capture the relationship between the input and output in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, let's denote the input as x and the output as y.

Given the input-output pairs:
(-12, 9)
(20, -55)
(-4, -7)
(-10, 5)
(8, -31)

We can write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 as:

9 = a + (-12)b

For (20, -55):
-55 = a + (20)b

For (-4, -7):
-7 = a + (-4)b

For (-10, 5):
5 = a + (-10)b

For (8, -31):

We now have a system of equations:

-55 = a + 20b
-7 = a - 4b
5 = a - 10b
-31 = a + 8b

Solving this system of equations, we get:

    By observing the given data, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear. Therefore, we need to consider a higher order function to describe the data accurately. Assuming a quadratic relationship, the function can be written as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

To find the coefficients a, b, and c, we can use the given data points:

Using the first data point (-12, 9):
9 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1 + c(-12)^2
9 = a - 12b + 144c

Using the second data point (20, -55):
-55 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1 + c(20)^2
-55 = a + 20b + 400c

Using the third data point (-4, -7):
-7 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1 + c(-4)^2
-7 = a - 4b + 16c

Using the fourth data point (-10, 5):

    To describe the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of 'a' and 'b' in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fit the given data points.

Let's consider the inputs and outputs provided:

Input: 6, Output: 74
Input: 19, Output: 191
Input: -11, Output: -79
Input: -5, Output: -25
Input: -10, Output: -70

By substituting the inputs and outputs into the function, we get the following equations:

Equation 1: 74 = a(6^0) + b(6^1)
Equation 2: 191 = a(19^0) + b(19^1)
Equation 3: -79 = a((-11)^0) + b((-11)^1)
Equation 4: -25 = a((-5)^0) + b((-5)^1)
Equation 5: -70 = a((-10)^0) + b((-10)^1)

Since any number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1, the equations simplify to:

Equation 1: 74 = a + 6b
Equation 2: 191 = a + 19b
Equation 3: -79 = a - 11b
Equation 4: -25 = a - 5b

    By examining the given input-output pairs, we can see that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function. 

Let's assume the function has the general form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since any number raised to the power of 0 is always 1, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

To find the values of a and b that best fit the given data, we can use two of the input-output pairs:

From input 6 and output 74:

74 = a + 6b      (Equation 1)

From input -5 and output -25:

-25 = a - 5b     (Equation 2)

Solving these equations simultaneously, we can determine the values of a and b.

Multiplying Equation 1 by 5 gives us:

5(74) = 5a + 30b

370 = 5a + 30b    (Equation 3)

Multiplying Equation 2 by 6 gives us:

6(-25) = 6a - 30b

-150 = 6a - 30b    (Equation 4)

Adding Equation 3 and Equation 4 together, we eliminate the variable b:

370 - 150 = 5a + 6a

220 = 11a

a = 220/11 = 20

Plugging the value of a back into Equation 3:

370 = 5(20) + 30b

370 = 100 + 30b

30b = 270

b = 270/30 = 9

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    The pattern between the inputs and outputs seems to be a linear relationship. From the given inputs and outputs, we can determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the value of the coefficient a, we can substitute one of the given inputs and outputs into the equation and solve for a.

Substituting the input 6 and output 74:
74 = a * 6^0 + b * 6^1
74 = a + 6b

To find the value of the coefficient b, we can substitute another set of input and output values into the equation and solve for b.

Substituting the input 19 and output 191:
191 = a * 19^0 + b * 19^1
191 = a + 19b

Now we have a system of two linear equations to solve simultaneously. Solving this system will give us the values of a and b, which can be used to write the function explicitly.

Solving the system of equations:
74 = a + 6b
191 = a + 19b

Rearranging the first equation:
a = 74 - 6b

Substituting this expression for a into the second equation:
191 = (74 - 6b) + 19b
191 = 74 + 13b
13b = 191 - 74
13b = 117
b = 117/13
b = 9

Substituting the value of b back into the first equation to find a:
a = 74 - 6(9)
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

Therefore, we can write the function as follows:

Output: y = 2x - 4

By substituting the given input values, we can verify the function:

Let's analyze the given data:

Input: 9, Output: 29
Input: 2, Output: 8
Input: -1, Output: -1
Input: -6, Output: -16

From the first two pairs, we can write the following equations:

29 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
8 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1

Since any number raised to the 0th power is equal to 1, we can simplify the equations:

29 = a + 9b
8 = a + 2b

Now we have a system of linear equations that we can solve to find the values of a and b.

To do this, we can subtract the second equation from the first:

(29 - 8) = (a - a) + (9b - 2b)
21 = 7b
b = 3

Substituting the value of b into the second equation:

Let's assume the function is in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where a and b are coefficients to be determined. Since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1, the x^0 term simplifies to 1, giving us:

y = a(1) + bx

Using the given data points, we can solve for the coefficients a and b:

1. When the input is 9, the output is 29:
29 = a(1) + 9b

2. When the input is 2, the output is 8:
8 = a(1) + 2b

3. When the input is -1, the output is -1:
-1 = a(1) - b

4. When the input is -6, the output is -16:
-16 = a(1) - 6b

Solving this system of equations gives us the values of a and b:

From equation 1 and equation 3, we get:

-1 = a - b (Equation B)

From equation 2 and equation 3, we get:

Simplifying Equations A, B, and C, and using Equation B to eliminate a, we have:
29 = 9b + b
8 = 2b - 1

From the first equation, we get 10b = 29, which gives b = 2.9

    Based on the given input-output pairs, we can form a linear regression equation of the form:

Now, let's solve the linear system of equations using the given pairs:

For the first pair, -16 = a + b * -16, we get -16 = a - 16b, which gives a - 16b = -16.

For the second pair, 109 = a + b * -3, we get 109 = a - 3b, which gives a - 3b = 109.

For the third pair, -3 = a + b * 2, we get -3 = a + 2b, which gives a + 2b = -3.

For the fourth pair, 18 = a + b * 12, we get 18 = a + 12b, which gives a + 12b = 18.

For the fifth pair, 2 = a + b * 5, we get 2 = a + 5b, which gives a + 5b = 2.
