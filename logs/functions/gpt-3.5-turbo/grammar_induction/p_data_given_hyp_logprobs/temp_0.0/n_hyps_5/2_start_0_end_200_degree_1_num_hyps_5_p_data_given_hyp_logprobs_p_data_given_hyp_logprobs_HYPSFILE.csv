"Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the relationship between inputs and outputs can be represented by a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Let's calculate the values of a and b using the given data.

Using the first pair (-10, -213), we have:
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10)b
-213 = a - 10b            [Equation 1]

Using the second pair (9, 167), we have:
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b               [Equation 2]

Using the third pair (4, 67), we have:
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b                [Equation 3]

Using the fourth pair (-3, -73), we have:
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b               [Equation 4]

Using the fifth pair (20, 387), we have:
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b              [Equation 5]

Now, we have a system of linear equations (Equations 1-5). By solving this system, we can find the values of a and b.

Solving equations 3 and 4:
(67) - (73) = (a + 4b) - (a - 3b)
-6 = 7b
b = -6/7

Plugging b = -6/7 into equation 3:
67 = a + 4(-6/7)
67 = a - 24/7
67 + 24/7 = a
469/7 + 24/7 = a
(469 + 24)/7 = a
493/7 = a

So, the values of a and b are a = 493/7 and b = -6/7.

Therefore, the function (in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1) that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = (493/7)x^0 + (-6/7)x^1

"To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs given, we can use basic regression techniques. Since the given function is in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can assume that the relationship is linear.

To find the coefficients a and b, we can solve a system of linear equations using the given input-output pairs.

Using the method of least squares, we can fit a line to the data points:

Input: -10, Output: -213
Input: 9, Output: 167
Input: 4, Output: 67

Let's define x as the input and y as the output:

(-10, -213), (9, 167), (4, 67), (-3, -73), (20, 387)

We can use the equations from the least squares method:

Σx = -10 + 9 + 4 - 3 + 20 = 20
Σy = -213 + 167 + 67 - 73 + 387 = 335
Σxy = (-10 * -213) + (9 * 167) + (4 * 67) + (-3 * -73) + (20 * 387) = 10 + 1503 + 268 + 219 + 7740 = 9997
Σx^2 = (-10)^2 + 9^2 + 4^2 + (-3)^2 + 20^2 = 100 + 81 + 16 + 9 + 400 = 606

Now, we can solve for the coefficients a and b:

a = (Σy * Σx^2 - Σx * Σxy) / (n * Σx^2 - (Σx)^2)
     = (335 * 606 - 20 * 9997) / (5 * 606 - 20^2)
     = (202410 - 199940) / (3030 - 400)
     = 2470 / 2630
     ≈ 0.9389

b = (n * Σxy - Σx * Σy) / (n * Σx^2 - (Σx)^2)
     = (5 * 9997 - 20 * 335) / (5 * 606 - 20^2)

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be represented by a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Let's find the values of coefficients a and b that best fit the data.

Using the least squares approach, we can solve for a and b by setting up and solving a system of linear equations. We know that for each input-output pair, the equation should be satisfied:

-213 = a*(-10)^0 + b*(-10)^1
167 = a*(9)^0 + b*(9)^1
67 = a*(4)^0 + b*(4)^1
-73 = a*(-3)^0 + b*(-3)^1

-73 = a + (-3)b
387 = a + 20b

By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b:

From the first and second equations, we can eliminate a:
a = -10b - 213 - (-9b)
a = -b - 213 + 9b
a = 8b - 213

Substituting this value of a into the third equation:

"To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of ""a"" and ""b"" in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Looking at the provided inputs and outputs, we can see that when x is 0, the value of y is always a constant value. Therefore, the term ax^0 will always be the same.

Let's calculate the value of ""a"" by substituting one of the given input-output pairs into the equation:

For the second pair (9, 167):

167 = a + 9b      ... (2)

Now we have a system of two equations (equations 1 and 2) that we can solve simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

To solve the system of equations, we can multiply equation (2) by 10 and subtract equation (1) from it:
10(167) = 10a + 90b
1670 = 10a + 90b
-213 = a - 10b        ... (1)

Dividing both sides by 100:
b = 1457 / 100
b = 14.57

"To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, let's analyze the given inputs and outputs:

Input: 17  ---> Output: -218
Input: 5  ---> Output: -74
Input: 3  ---> Output: -50
Input: -6 ---> Output: 58

We observe that the outputs are negative and decrease as the inputs increase. Additionally, there is a linear pattern present, as the outputs can be written in the form:

Output = m * Input + c

where m represents the slope and c represents the y-intercept.

To determine the values of m and c, let's take two data points:

Using Input: 7 (Output: -98) and Input: 17 (Output: -218):

-98 = m * 7 + c    ...(1)
-218 = m * 17 + c   ...(2)

Solving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously, we can find the values of m and c.

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):

-218 - (-98) = m * 17 + c - (m * 7 + c)
-120 = m * 17 - m * 7
-120 = m * (17 - 7)
-120 = m * 10

Dividing both sides by 10:

m = -12

Substituting m = -12 into equation (1):

-98 = -12 * 7 + c
-98 = -84 + c

Adding 84 to both sides:

c = -14

Input: 17, Output: -218

Input: -6, Output: 58

From these values, we can observe that as the input increases, the output decreases. Additionally, the output values seem to be related to the input values in a nonlinear manner.

A polynomial function that can capture this relationship is a quadratic function of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c. However, since we want the function to be of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify the quadratic function.

Let's assume the simplified function is y = ax^0 + bx^1.
For the input-output pairs (7, -98), (5, -74), and (3, -50), we can substitute the input values into the function to get the following equations:

7^0a + 7^1b = -98         -> Equation 1
5^0a + 5^1b = -74         -> Equation 2
3^0a + 3^1b = -50         -> Equation 3

Solving these equations simultaneously, we can determine the values of a and b that satisfy all three equations.

From Equation 1: 1a + 7b = -98
From Equation 2: 1a + 5b = -74

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1, we get:
2b = -24
b = -12

Substituting the value of b into Equation 1 or Equation 2, we can solve for a.

2a = -14
a = -7

y = -7(-6)^0 - 12(-6)^1 
  = -7 + 72
  = 65

Substituting the values from the second data point (13, 228):

Let's assign x as the input values and y as the output values.

Using the given data, we have the following equations:

-289 = c + (-15)d

By solving this system of linear equations, we can determine the values of c and d.

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation:
(-325) - (-109) = c + (-17)d - c - (-5)d

d = 18

Substituting the value of d into any of the equations to find c:

Using the provided data:

For the input x = 10, the output y = 142. This gives us the equation 142 = a(10^0) + b(10^1).

For the input x = 15, the output y = 217. This gives us the equation 217 = a(15^0) + b(15^1).

For the input x = -10, the output y = -158. This gives us the equation -158 = a((-10)^0) + b((-10)^1).

For the input x = -4, the output y = -68. This gives us the equation -68 = a((-4)^0) + b((-4)^1).

Looking at the outputs, we can observe that they are roughly 14 times greater than the inputs. Therefore, we can form a linear equation in the form:

Output = a * (Input^0) + b * (Input^1)

Since any number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1, the equation simplifies to:

Output = a + b * Input

To find the values of a and b, let's substitute one of the input-output pairs into the equation:

142 = a + b * 10

We can solve this equation for either a or b, and then substitute the values back into the equation to find the other unknown.

Using the second input-output pair:

217 = a + b * 15

Now we have two equations with two unknowns, which we can solve simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

217 - 142 = a + b * 15 - a - b * 10

75 = 5b

b = 75 / 5 = 15

Substituting the value of b into the first equation:

142 = a + 15 * 10

142 = a + 150

a = 142 - 150 = -8

Therefore, the equation that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

a = -16/200 = -0.08

Substituting the value of a into Equation (4), we have:

142 = -8 + 10b + c

Let's rewrite this equation as:
10b + c = 142 + 8

Adding Equations (5) and (6), we eliminate the c term:

3. (-5, 55): 55 = a * (-5)^2 + b * (-5) + c
4. (-10, 125): 125 = a * (-10)^2 + b * (-10) + c

Now, let's solve the above equations to find a, b, and c.

From the first equation: 265 = 400a - 20b + c
From the second equation: 195 = 225a - 15b + c
From the third equation: 55 = 25a - 5b + c
From the fourth equation: 125 = 100a - 10b + c

We have a system of equations, so we can solve it to find the values of a, b, and c. Solving the system of equations, we find:

a = -0.3
b = -6
c = 75

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, the relationship seems to be a linear function. We can represent it in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Now let's find the values of a and b. We can use the given pairs of inputs and outputs to form a system of equations:

1) When input = -20, output = 265:
265 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
265 = a - 20b

2) When input = -15, output = 195:
195 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)^1
195 = a - 15b

3) When input = -5, output = 55:
55 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
55 = a - 5b

4) When input = -10, output = 125:
125 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
125 = a - 10b

5) When input = 6, output = -99:
-99 = a(6)^0 + b(6)^1
-99 = a + 6b

Simplifying these equations:

1) 265 = a - 20b
2) 195 = a - 15b
3) 55 = a - 5b
4) 125 = a - 10b
5) -99 = a + 6b

From equations 1) and 2), we can subtract them to get:
265 - 195 = (a - 20b) - (a - 15b)
70 = 5b
b = 14

Now substituting b = 14 into equation 3):
55 = a - 5(14)
55 = a - 70
a = 55 + 70
a = 125

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

265 = a + (-20)b

Substituting the second data point (-15, 195):

"Based on the given data points, we can try to find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Since the function is in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 is equal to 1, we need to find the values of a and b.

One way to approach this is to substitute the values of the inputs and outputs into the function and solve for a and b. Let's consider the first data point:

Input: -16
Output: 297

Substituting these values into the function, we get:

297 = a(1) + b(-16)

"Based on the given data, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be represented by a quadratic function, rather than a linear function. Therefore, the function should be written in the form y = ax^2 + bx^1 + cx^0.

To find the values of a, b, and c, we can substitute the given inputs and outputs into the equation. Let's solve for a, b, and c using three of the given data points:

1. Input: -16, Output: 297

297 = 256a - 16b + c

2. Input: 18, Output: -315

-315 = 324a + 18b + c

3. Input: -5, Output: 99
99 = a(-5)^2 + b(-5)^1 + c(-5)^0
99 = 25a - 5b + c

The system of equations can be solved to find the values of a, b, and c.

Solving the system of equations:

-315 = 324a + 18b + c  ---- (2)
99 = 25a - 5b + c      ---- (3)

By subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):
-612 = 68a + 34b

By subtracting equation (1) from equation (3):
-198 = -231a + 11b

Now, by solving the system of equations:
-612 = 68a + 34b  ---- (4)
-198 = -231a + 11b ---- (5)

Multiplying equation (4) by 11, and equation (5) by 34:
-6732 = 748a + 374b   ---- (6)
-6732 = -7834a + 374b ---- (7)

By subtracting equation (7) from equation (6):
0 = 1106a

Thus, a = 0.

Substitute a = 0 in equation (4):

b = -612/34 = -18

Substitute a = 0 and b = -18 in equation (1):

Equation 2: -315 = a + 18b

Subtract Eq. 2 from Eq. 1: 297 - (-315) = (a - 16b) - (a + 18b)

From the first equation, we already have a = -15. By substituting this value into the other equations, we can solve for b:

-31 = (-15) - 4b -> -16 = -4b -> b = 4
5 = (-15) + 5b -> 20 = 5b -> b = 4

-15 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-15 = a

For the second data point (-5, -35):
-35 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
-35 = a - 5b
-5b = -35 - a
b = (a - 7)

For the third data point (-4, -31):

20b = -31 + 35
20b = 4
b = 4/20
b = 1/5

From the fourth data point:
b = (5 - a)/5
1/5 = (5 - a)/5
1 = 5 - a
a = 5 - 1
a = 4

From the fifth data point:
b = (-63 - a)/-12
1/5 = (-63 - 4)/-12
12/5 = 67
This equation does not have a solution that satisfies the other data points, indicating that it may be an outlier.

-15 = a + 0

Thus, a = -15.

Now let's consider the relationship between x and y for the remaining data points. We'll assume that these data points follow a linear pattern. 

When x is -5, y is -35. This gives us the second equation:

a + b(-5) = -35  -->  -15 - 5b = -35
a + b(-4) = -31  -->  -15 - 4b = -31
a + b(5) = 5  -->  -15 + 5b = 5
a + b(-12) = -63  -->  -15 - 12b = -63

Solving the above equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b:

-15 + 5b = 5  -->  5b = 20  -->  b = 4
-15 - 12b = -63  -->  -12b = -48  -->  b = 4

Since we obtained the same value of b from different equations, we can conclude that b = 4.

Finally, we substitute the value of b back into any of the equations to find the value of a:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it doesn't seem that the data can be accurately modeled by a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. However, we might be able to capture the pattern by using exponentials or higher-order polynomial functions. 

Here's an example function in the form y = a * x^b + c * x^d, which might be more appropriate for this data:

Output: y = 3 * x^2 - 22 * x + 40",-1.4191242975163265,"[15, -2]"
"The given data does not fit a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 because the outputs are not solely dependent on the input values raised to a power. To capture the relationship, we need to find a different function that could fit the data.

By observing the input-output pairs, it appears that the outputs are calculated using a quadratic equation. Let's try to fit the data with a quadratic equation of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c.

Using the given data:

Input: 2, Output: 59
Input: -16, Output: -301
Input: -5, Output: -81
Input: 3, Output: 79
Input: -2, Output: -21

We can form the following system of equations:

(1) 4a + 2b + c = 59
(2) 256a - 16b + c = -301
(3) 25a - 5b + c = -81
(4) 9a + 3b + c = 79
(5) 4a - 2b + c = -21

Solving this system of equations will give us the coefficients a, b, and c, which will be used to write the explicit function.

After solving the system of equations, we find that the coefficients are:

a = 1
b = -2
c = 5

So the explicit function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = x^2 - 2x + 5",-0.2175542219030612,"[20, 19]"
"The given data points can be represented by a quadratic equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2. By fitting a quadratic equation to the data, we can capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Let's start by organizing the given data points:

Input:   -16,  -5,   -2,   2,    3
Output: -301, -81, -21, 59,  79

By observation, it seems that the data points can be approximated by a quadratic equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2.

Plugging in the input and output values, we get the following equations:

-301 = a - 16b + 256c   (1)
-81 = a - 5b + 25c       (2)
-21 = a - 2b + 4c        (3)
59 = a + 2b + 4c         (4)
79 = a + 3b + 9c         (5)

To solve these equations, we can use matrix algebra or any other method. Since the equations are not in standard form, let's rewrite them in matrix form:

[-16,    256,    -16]   [a]    [-301]
[-5,      25,      -5]   [b]  = [-81]
[-2,       4,         -2]   [c]    [-21]
[2,         4,         8]     [c]    [59]
[3,         9,         27]   [c]    [79]

To solve the system of equations, we need to find the inverse of the coefficient matrix and multiply it with the column vector of output values.

Finding the inverse of the coefficient matrix, we get:

[  340,   208,   -60,     -4,    -20]
[-16,      12,           -6,       -2,     5]
[   -28,   -20,      9,        -2,     2]

Multiplying the inverse of the coefficient matrix by the column vector of output values, we get:

[a] = [  340,   208,   -60,     -4,    -20] * [-301]
[b]     [-16,      12,           -6,       -2,     5]    * [-81]
[c]     [   -28,   -20,      9,        -2,     2]     * [-21]

Calculating the product, we find:

[a] = -415
[b] = -58
[c] = 7

40 = a * (-7)^2 + b * (-7) + c

Solving this system of equations, we find that the quadratic function that best fits the data is:

"After examining the given data, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

To find the values of a and b, we can plug in the given inputs and outputs into the equation and solve for the coefficients.

From the given data:

Input: -11, Output: 72

Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of a and b.

By solving these equations, we find a = -2 and b = 6.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Using the provided data points:

Input: -11, Output: 72
Input: -3, Output: 8
Input: -2, Output: 0
Input: 18, Output: -160

We can represent these data points as equations:

72 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
8 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
0 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1
-160 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1
40 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7)^1

Simplifying these equations, we get:

72 = a + (-11)b
8 = a + (-3)b
0 = a + (-2)b
-160 = a + 18b
40 = a + (-7)b

We can then solve this system of equations using various methods such as Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion. For simplicity, we will use the inverse matrix method.

Writing these equations as a matrix equation:

| 1   18  |         | -160 |
| 1  -7   |         | 40  |

We can solve for the vector [a b] transpose by multiplying both sides of the equation by the inverse of the left-hand side matrix:

| a | = | 1 -11 |^-1  | 72 |
| b |   | 1 -3  |      | 8  |
                    | 1 -2  |

Input: 18, Output: -160
-160 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1
-160 = a + 18b

Input: -7, Output: 40
40 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7)^1
40 = a + (-7)b

We now have a system of equations:

a - 11b = 72     (1)
a - 3b = 8       (2)
a - 2b = 0       (3)
a + 18b = -160   (4)
a - 7b = 40      (5)

Solving this system of equations yields a = 16 and b = -4.

0 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1
-160 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1

Simplifying the equations, we get:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Let's determine the values of a and b:

When input = -11, output = 72:

When input = -3, output = 8: 
8 = a + b(-3)^1

When input = -2, output = 0:

When input = 18, output = -160: 
-160 = a + b(18)^1

When input = -7, output = 40: 
40 = a + b(-7)^1

To solve this system of equations, we can substitute the known values for input and output and solve for a and b using standard algebraic techniques.

Doing the calculations:

72 = a - 11b
8 = a - 3b
0 = a - 2b
-160 = a + 18b
40 = a - 7b

Adding equations (1) and (3):

72 + 0 = 2a - 9b
72 = 2a - 9b        (Equation 4)

Multiplying equation (2) by 2:

16 = 2a - 6b         (Equation 5)

Now, subtracting equation (4) from equation (5):

16 - 72 = 2a - 6b - (2a - 9b)
-56 = 3b
b = -56/3

Substituting the value of b into equation (2):

8 = a - 3(-56/3)
8 = a + 56
a = -48

So, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Substituting these values into the equation:

8 = a + (-3)b      ----(1)

0 = a + (-2)b      ----(2)

Simplifying equation (1):

8 = a - 3b

Solving equation (2) for a, we get:

a = -2b

Substituting this value of a in equation (1):

8 = -2b - 3b

Simplifying further:

8 = -5b

Dividing both sides by -5:

b = -8/5

Substituting the value of b back in equation (2):

0 = (-2b) + (-2)(-8/5)

0 = -2b + 16/5

Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate fractions:

0 = -10b + 16

10b = 16

b = 16/10

b = 8/5

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back in equation (1) to find a:

8 = a - 24/5

Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate fractions:

Using the method of least squares, we can find the best-fit line by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the predicted y-values and the actual y-values.

By substituting x and y values from the given inputs and outputs, we can solve for the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

We can now solve the system of linear equations to find the values of a and b:

-570 = 2a +31b

Adding equation 3 and equation 4:
300 + 264 = a + a - 17b - 15b
564 = 2a - 32b

Multiplying equation 2 by 31 and subtracting it from the previous result:
564 - 31(66) = 2a - 32b - 31(a - 4b)

-75 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
-75 = a - 18b

17b = 75 + 7
17b = 82
b = 82/17 ≈ 4.82

When input (x) = -18, output (y) = -75:

Expanding this equation further, y = a + bx.

Now, let's calculate the values of a and b using the given data points.

Using the first pair of data points (-18, -75), we can substitute these values into the equation:

-75 = a - 18b

Similarly, using the second pair of data points (-1, -7):

-7 = a - b

Using these two equations, we can solve for a and b.

First, we rearrange the second equation to isolate a:

a = b - 7

Substituting this value of a into the first equation:

-75 = (b - 7) - 18b
-75 = -75b - 7

Simplifying this equation further:

0 = -75b + 68
75b = 68
b = 68/75

Now, substituting b back into the second equation to solve for a:

a = (68/75) - 7
a = (68 - 525)/75
a = -457/75

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

Substituting the values into the function, we get:

Substituting the values into the function, we get:
-254 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
-254 = a + 17b

For the third example:
Input: -4
Output: 82

Substituting the values into the function, we get:
82 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
82 = a + (-4)b

For the fourth example:

Substituting the values into the function, we get:

Based on these data points, we can determine the values of a and b by fitting a line to the points. To do this, we can use the method of least squares regression. This will give us the values that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the predicted outputs and actual outputs.

"To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of 'a' and 'b' in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's substitute the given inputs and outputs into the equation to form a system of equations:

When x = -9, y = 162:
162 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
162 = a + (-9)b ....... Equation 1

When x = 17, y = -254:

When x = -4, y = 82:

When x = -18, y = 306:

When x = -14, y = 242:

-254 = a + 17b
82 = a - 4b
306 = a - 18b
242 = a - 14b

We can solve this system of equations using elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use substitution:

From Equation 1, rearranging it, we have:
a = -9b + 162

Now substitute 'a' in the remaining equations:

-254 = (-9b + 162) + 17b   ---> replace 'a' with '-9b + 162'
82 = (-9b + 162) - 4b      ---> replace 'a' with '-9b + 162'
306 = (-9b + 162) - 18b    ---> replace 'a' with '-9b + 162'
242 = (-9b + 162) - 14b    ---> replace 'a' with '-9b + 162'

Simplifying each equation:
-9b - 9b + 162 = -254
-9b - 4b + 162 = 82
-9b - 18b + 162 = 306
-9b - 14b + 162 = 242

-18b + 162 = -254
-13b + 162 = 82

Solving these equations:

-13b = 82 - 162
-27b = 306 - 162
-23b = 242 - 162

-18b = -416

b = (-416) / (-18)
b = (-80) / (-13)

b = 80 / (-23)

b = 23.111...
b = 6.153...

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given inputs and outputs into the function and solve for the coefficients. 

Using the first pair of input and output (-9, 162), we have:

"Based on the given data, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be approximated by a linear function. The general form of a linear function is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. We can determine the values of m and b by substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation.

Using the method of least squares, we obtain the following calculations:

Sum of inputs: 18 + 12 + (-13) + 4 + 16 = 37
Sum of outputs: 350 + 230 + (-270) + 70 + 310 = 690

Sum of inputs squared: 18^2 + 12^2 + (-13)^2 + 4^2 + 16^2 = 879
Sum of inputs multiplied by their corresponding outputs: 18 * 350 + 12 * 230 + (-13) * (-270) + 4 * 70 + 16 * 310 = 14170

Now, we can substitute the values into the equation y = mx + b and solve for m and b.

690 = 37m + 5b  (equation 1)
14170 = 879m + 37b  (equation 2)

Multiplying equation 1 by 37 and equation 2 by 5, we have:

25530 = 1369m + 185b  (equation 3)
70850 = 4395m + 185b  (equation 4)

Subtracting equation 3 from equation 4, we get:

Solving for m, we have:

m = 45320 / 3026 ≈ 14.981

Substituting the value of m into equation 1, we can solve for b:

To find the values of a and b, we can use any two pairs of input and output values. Let's choose (18, 350) and (12, 230):

Using (18, 350):
350 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1
350 = a + 18b

Using (12, 230):
230 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1
230 = a + 12b

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

350 = a + 18b
