"To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given data points to solve for the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the first data point (-10, -213), we have:
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

Using the second data point (9, 167), we have:
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Using the third data point (4, 67), we have:
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Using the fourth data point (-3, -73), we have:
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

Using the fifth data point (20, 387), we have:
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

From the equations -213 = a - 10b and 167 = a + 9b:
a = 167 - 9b

Plugging this into the equations 67 = a + 4b, -73 = a - 3b, and 387 = a + 20b:
67 = (167 - 9b) + 4b
-73 = (167 - 9b) - 3b
387 = (167 - 9b) + 20b

Simplifying each equation:
67 = 167 - 5b
-73 = 167 - 12b
387 = 167 + 11b

Rearranging the equations:
5b = 100
12b = 240
11b = 220

Solving for b:
b = 20
b = 20
b = 20

Substituting b = 20 back into one of the previous equations, let's use 5b = 100, we have:

To find the values of 'a' and 'b', we can substitute any of the input-output pairs into the equation and solve the resulting equations simultaneously.

Using the first pair (-10, -213):

-213 = a + b(-10)

Solving for 'a' and 'b' using this equation leads us to:

To fit the given data, we can express the relationship between inputs and outputs using the linear equation:

Using the method of least squares, we can perform linear regression to determine the values of a and b.

Calculating the slope (b):

b = [Σ(x * y) - (Σx)(Σy) / n * Σ(x^2) - (Σx)^2]

Let's calculate the required values:

Σx = -10 + 9 + 4 - 3 + 20 = 20
Σy = -213 + 167 + 67 - 73 + 387 = 335

Σ(x * y) = (-10 * -213) + (9 * 167) + (4 * 67) + (-3 * -73) + (20 * 387) = -4260 + 1503 + 268 + 219 + 7740 = 6630
Σ(x^2) = (-10)^2 + 9^2 + 4^2 + (-3)^2 + 20^2 = 100 + 81 + 16 + 9 + 400 = 606

n = 5 (number of data points)

Now, we can calculate b:

b = (6630 - (20 * 335) / 5 * 606 - 20^2
b = (6630 - 6700) / (5 * 606 - 400)
b = -70 / 2030
b = -0.034483

Calculating the y-intercept (a):

a = (Σy - b * Σx) / n
a = (335 - (-0.034483 * 20)) / 5
a = (335 + 0.68966) / 5
a = 335.68966 / 5

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the input (x) and output (y) can be approximated by a linear function. 

To find the coefficients a and b in the linear function, we can use the given data points. Let's assume that the linear function is of the form y = a + bx.

Using the first data point (-10, -213):
-213 = a + (-10)b      ---- (1)

Using the second data point (9, 167):

Using the fifth data point (20, 387):
387 = a + 20b         ---- (5)

Now we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Solving equations (1) and (3), we get:
-213 = a + (-10)b     ---- (1)
67 = a + 4b           ---- (3)

Adding these equations, we have:
-213 + 67 = a + (-10)b + a + 4b
-146 = 2a - 6b
-73 = a - 3b          ---- (6)

Solving equations (2) and (4), we get:
167 = a + 9b          ---- (2)
-73 = a + (-3)b       ---- (4)

Adding these equations, we have:
167 - 73 = a + 9b + a + (-3)b
94 = 2a + 6b           ---- (7)

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns (equations 6 and 7), so we can solve it to find the values of a and b.

To find a, multiply equation 6 by 3 and equation 7 by 1, and then add them:
-219 = 3a - 9b
94 = 2a + 6b

Summing these two equations gives:
-219 + 94 = 3a - 9b + 2a + 6b

To find b, multiply equation 6 by 2 and equation 7 by 9, and then add them:
-146 = 2a - 6b
846 = 18a + 54b

Summing these two equations gives:
-146 + 846 = 2a - 6b + 18a + 54b

Multiplying equation (8) by 20 and equation (9) by 5, we get:

Summing these equations, we have:
-2500 + 3500 = 100a - 60b + 100a + 240b
1000 = 200a + 180b
1000/20 = 200a/20 + 180b/20
50 = 10a + 9b

Now we have another system of two linear equations with two unknowns:
50 = 10a + 9b             ---- (10)
-125 = 5a - 3b            ---- (11)

Multiplying equation (10) by 5 and equation (11) by 10, we get:

Summing these equations, we have:
250 - 1250 = 50a + 45b + 50a - 30b
-1000 = 100a + 15b
-1000/100 = 100a/100 + 15b/100
-10 = a + 0.15b

From equation (10), we have:
50 = 10a + 9b

Rearranging this equation, we get:
9b = 50 - 10a

Substituting this expression for 9b into the equation -10 = a + 0.15b, we have:
-10 = a + 0.15(50 - 10a)
-10 = a + 7.5 - 1.5a
-10 - 7.5 = a - 1.5a
-17.5 = -0.5a
a = (-17.5)/(-0.5)
a = 35

Substituting the value of a into the equation 9b = 50 - 10a, we have:
9b = 50 - 10(35)
9b = 50 - 350
9b = -300
b = -300/9
b = -33.33 (approximately)

Subtracting the fourth equation from the second equation, we get:

228 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
228 = a + 13b

For the third point (-4, -61):
-61 = a(-4^0) + b(-4^1)
-61 = a - 4b

By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b:

160 = a + 9b     (1)
228 = a + 13b    (2)
-61 = a - 4b     (3)

Subtracting (1) from (2), we get:

(2) - (1): 228 - 160 = (a + 13b) - (a + 9b)
68 = 4b
b = 17

Substituting the value of b back into equation (1):

160 = a + 9(17)
160 = a + 153
a = 7

"Based on the given data, it appears that the exponent of x in the function is changing while the coefficient of x^1 remains constant. Therefore, the function can be written as:

To determine the values of a and b, let's use the given inputs and outputs.

Using (Input: -2, Output: 17):
17 = a + b(-2)^1
17 = a - 2b          --- (1)

Using (Input: 7, Output: -145):
-145 = a + b(7)^1
-145 = a + 7b         --- (2)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying equation (2) by 2 and adding it to equation (1), we get:
(2a - 2b) + (2a + 14b) = 2(-145) + 17
4a + 14b - 2b = -290 + 17
4a + 12b = -273

Dividing this equation by 4, we get:
a + 3b = -68.25          --- (3)

Now, solving equations (1) and (3) simultaneously will give us the values of a and b.

From equation (1):
a - 2b = 17
Multiplying this equation by 3, we get:
3a - 6b = 51           --- (4)

Subtracting equation (3) from equation (4), we have:
(3a - 6b) - (a + 3b) = 51 - (-68.25)
2a - 9b = 119.25

Dividing this equation by 2, we get:

(4.5b - 4.5b) = (59.625 - -68.25)

"The given data doesn't follow a linear relationship as the outputs do not vary linearly with the inputs. Therefore, a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 will not accurately describe the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

To determine the relationship, we need to look for a pattern in the given data points.

When examining the outputs, we can see that they are all odd numbers, with the first output being 17. Additionally, the outputs seem to be increasing at an irregular rate.

After analyzing these insights, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by an equation of the form:

Output: y = ax^2 + bx + c

Using the given data points, we can try to determine the values of a, b, and c.

Input: -2, Output: 17
17 = a(-2)^2 + b(-2) + c
17 = 4a - 2b + c   (Equation 1)

Input: 7, Output: -145
-145 = a(7)^2 + b(7) + c
-145 = 49a + 7b + c   (Equation 2)

Input: -10, Output: 161
161 = a(-10)^2 + b(-10) + c
161 = 100a - 10b + c   (Equation 3)

Solving this system of equations simultaneously will give us the values of a, b, and c:

Equation 1 - Equation 3:
17 - 161 = 4a - 2b + c - (100a - 10b + c)
-144 = -96a + 8b
12 = 8b - 96a
3 = 2b - 24a   (Equation 4)

Equation 1 - Equation 2:
17 - (-145) = 4a - 2b + c - (49a + 7b + c)
162 = -45a - 9b
18 = -5a - b
5a + b = -18   (Equation 5)

Solving Equations 4 and 5 simultaneously:
3 = 2b - 24a
5a + b = -18

Multiplying Equation 5 by 2 and subtracting it from Equation 4:
3 - 2(5a + b) = 2b - 24a - 2(-18)
3 - 10a - 2b = 2b - 24a + 36
3 - 34a = 4b - 24a + 36
10a + 24a = 4b + 36 - 3
34a = 4b + 33
34a - 4b = 33   (Equation 6)

Using Equation 5, isolate b:
5a + b = -18
b = -18 - 5a   (Equation 7)

Substituting Equation 7 into Equation 6:
34a - 4(-18 - 5a) = 33
34a + 72 + 20a = 33
54a + 72 = 33
54a = -39
a = -39/54
a = -13/18

Now substitute the value of a into Equation 7 to find b:
b = -18 - 5(-13/18)
b = -18 + 65/18
b = (65 - 18*18)/(18)
b = -283/18

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -13/18x^2 - 283/18x + c

To determine the value of c, we can substitute any of the given input-output pairs into the equation. Let's use the first pair (Input: -2, Output: 17):

17 = -13/18(-2)^2 - 283/18(-2) + c
17 = -52/18 + 566/18 + c
17 = 514/18 + c
c = 17 - 514/18
c = (18*17 - 514)/18
c = 306/18
c = 17

At first glance, it is not apparent what the exact form of the function is. However, we can observe that the outputs seem to decrease as the inputs increase, and vice versa. 

To capture this relationship, we can use a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x represents the input. In this case, as the outputs seem to decrease as the inputs increase, we can assume that the coefficient of x^1 should be negative.

Let's define the function using the provided inputs and outputs:

x = Input value

For the first input-output pair:
-2 = x, 17 = y

We can substitute the values into the function:

"The given data points cannot be fitted to a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, as the output values do not vary linearly with the input values. However, we can attempt to fit the data using a polynomial equation.

Let's assume the function in the form y = a + bx. We need to find the values of the coefficients a and b that best describe the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Using the given data points, we can form a system of equations:

-8 = a - b     (for input = -1, output = -8)

"Based on the given input and output values, we can identify that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the input and output values into the equation and solve for a and b. Let's denote the input values as x and the output values as y.

For the given input and output values:

When x = -1, y = -8
When x = 5, y = 76
When x = 3, y = 48
When x = 8, y = 118
When x = 13, y = 188

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

-8 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1
76 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
48 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1
118 = a(8)^0 + b(8)^1

Simplifying these equations, we get:

118 = a + 8b
188 = a + 13b

Next, let's look for the term involving x. By examining the different input and output pairs, we can see that the relationship between x and y is not linear. However, we can try to find a linear approximation using the given data.

Based on this observation, we can consider using the term bx^1 to approximate the relationship between x and y. The differences between successive outputs hint that the coefficient b should be negative to reflect the decreasing trend.

-105 = a(-6)^0 + b(-6)^1

Simplifying the equations, we have:

Solving this system of equations, we find a = -3 and b = 17.

Considering the given data, we can determine the values of ""a"" and ""b"" in the equation. By finding the slope, we can determine the value of ""b"", and by finding the y-intercept, we can determine the value of ""a"".

Using the first and last input-output pairs: (-17, -292) and (-18, -309), we can find the slope:

slope (b) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

230 = a(-12)^2 + b(-12) + c
-330 = a(16)^2 + b(16) + c

Simplifying the equations:

144a - 12b + c = 230
256a + 16b + c = -330
256a + 16b + c = -330

Rearranging the equations:

49a - 7b + c = 130
196a + 14b + c = -290
144a - 12b + c = 230

130 = a + (-7)b

-290 = a + 14b

Solving these two equations simultaneously will give us the values of a and b.

Adding the two equations:

130 - 290 = a + -7b + a + 14b

-160 = 2a + 7b

Rearranging this equation, we get:

7b = -160 - 2a

We can substitute this value of 7b in any of the two original equations to obtain the value of a.

Let's choose the first equation:

130 = a + (-7)b

Substituting 7b as -160 - 2a, we get:

130 = a + (-7)(-160 - 2a)

130 = a + 1120 + 14a

Combining like terms, we have:

0 = 15a + 1120 - 130

0 = 15a + 990

Subtracting 990 from both sides, we get:

-990 = 15a

Dividing both sides by 15, we find:

a = -66

Now, substituting this value of a into one of the original equations, we can find the value of b.

Using the first equation:

130 = a + (-7)b

Substituting a = -66, we have:

130 = -66 + (-7)b

Combining like terms, we get:

-290 = 130 + 21b
21b = -290 - 130
21b = -420
b = -420/21
b = -20

Substitute the value of b = -20 into the equation a = 130 + 7b:

(5, -26)
(1, -14)
(-14, 31)

By substituting the values, we get the following equations:

-26 = a(5^0) + b(5^1)  => -26 = a + 5b         (Equation 1)
-14 = a(1^0) + b(1^1)  => -14 = a + b           (Equation 2)

However, we can try to identify some patterns in the data. If we assume that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is nonlinear, we can try fitting a quadratic function of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are coefficients to be determined.

Let's try to find the coefficients by using the given inputs and outputs:

Simplifying the equations above, we can solve them simultaneously to find the coefficients a, b, and c.

We can use an equation solver to obtain the exact coefficients. But without the use of a solver, let's find an approximate solution:

From the 1st equation: 64 = 81a - 9b + c
From the 2nd equation: 22 = 9a - 3b + c
From the 3rd equation: -62 = 81a + 9b + c
From the 4th equation: 36 = 25a - 5b + c
From the 5th equation: 113 = 256a + 16b + c

By adding the 1st, 2nd, and 4th equations, we can eliminate c:

122 = 115a - 5b

Adding this result with the 3rd equation gives:

60 = 196a

a ≈ 0.30612244898

Substituting this value of a back into the equation we derived earlier:

122 = 115(0.30612244898) - 5b

b ≈ 231.324

64 = a + b + c           (Equation 1)

Similarly, for the inputs -3, 9, -5, and -16, we have:

22 = a - b + c            (Equation 2)
-62 = a + b + c          (Equation 3)
36 = a - b + c            (Equation 4)
113 = a + b + c          (Equation 5)

Next, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a, b, and c.

Adding equations (2) and (4), we eliminate b:

58 = 2a + 2c             (Equation 6)

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (3), we eliminate b again:

-40 = -2a                (Equation 7)

From equation (7), we can solve for a:

a = 20

Substituting the value of a back into equation (7), we find:

-40 = -2(20)

-40 = -40

This tells us that equation (7) is consistent. Now, substituting the value of a into equation (6), we have:

58 = 2(20) + 2c

58 = 40 + 2c

18 = 2c

c = 9

Finally, we can substitute the values of a and c into any of the equations (1), (2), (3), or (4) to solve for b. We will use equation (3):

-62 = 20 + b + 9

-62 = 29 + b

b = -91

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

For input 13, output 230:

176 = a + 10b             ---- (2)

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we can eliminate the 'a' term:

-486 = (-27b) - (-9b)
-486 = -18b
b = (-486) / (-18)

Looking at the given data points, we can observe that the output (y) is approximately equal to 14 times the input (x) plus a constant term. Therefore, the function y = 14x + a can be used to describe the data accurately.

Explanation:
Based on the given pairs of inputs and outputs, we can observe that the output is always the result of a combination of two terms: a constant term (x^0) and a linear term (x^1). 

The constant term seems to be consistently negative, with a value of -15 when the input is 0. This suggests that the coefficient of x^0 is -15.

The linear term, on the other hand, varies depending on the input. It appears to be a decreasing linear function, as the coefficient of x^1 decreases as the input decreases. Specifically, when the input is -5, the coefficient of x^1 is -35, and when the input is -4, the coefficient is -31.

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is given by:

"Based on the given data points, we can observe that the pattern between the inputs and outputs is not a linear relationship. Instead, it appears to be a polynomial relationship of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the coefficients a and b, let's substitute each data point into the equation:

For input 0, output -15:
-15 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-15 = a

For input -5, output -35:
-35 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
-35 = a - 5b

For input -4, output -31:
-31 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
-31 = a - 4b

For input 5, output 5:
5 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
5 = a + 5b

For input -12, output -63:
-63 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
-63 = a - 12b

Simplifying the equations, we have:

-15 = a                 --> Equation 1
-35 = a - 5b          --> Equation 2
-31 = a - 4b          --> Equation 3
5 = a + 5b            --> Equation 4
-63 = a - 12b         --> Equation 5

Let's solve the system of equations to find the values of a and b:

From Equations 1 and 2, we can eliminate a:
-35 + 15 = -5b
-20 = -5b
b = 4

Substituting the value of b into Equation 1:
-15 = a
a = -15

Therefore, the equation that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

So, the function can be written as:

For the input-output pair (0, -15):
-15 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1

Looking at the data, we can see that when the input is 9, the output is 133. This can be expressed as y = a(9^0) + b(9) = a + 9b = 133.

283 = a * 19^0 + b * 19^1
283 = a + 19b

Now we have a system of two equations:

a + 9b = 133
a + 19b = 283

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:

(a + 19b) - (a + 9b) = 283 - 133
10b = 150
b = 15

Substituting the value of b in the first equation:

a + 9 * 15 = 133
a + 135 = 133
a = -2

Input: 2, Output: 59
Input: -16, Output: -301
Input: -5, Output: -81
Input: 3, Output: 79
Input: -2, Output: -21

By substituting the input and output values into the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can set up a system of linear equations:

59 = a(2^0) + b(2^1)
-301 = a(-16^0) + b(-16^1)
-81 = a(-5^0) + b(-5^1)
79 = a(3^0) + b(3^1)
-21 = a(-2^0) + b(-2^1)

Simplifying the equations, we get:

59 = a + 2b
-301 = a - 16b
-81 = a - 5b
79 = a + 3b
-21 = a - 2b

We can solve this system of linear equations using any method of our choice, such as substitution or elimination.

Substituting the value of b back into any of the equations, let's say the 3rd equation, we get:

To determine the values of a and b, we can substitute the input-output pairs into the equation and solve for a and b. Let's do that using the first two data points:

For input 2, output 59:
59 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1 
59 = a + 2b

For input -16, output -301:
-301 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:
a + 2b = 59     ......(1)
a - 16b = -301   ......(2)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying equation (1) by 16 and equation (2) by 2, we get:

16a + 32b = 944    .......(3)
2a - 32b = -602    .......(4)

Adding equation (3) and equation (4), we eliminate the variable b:

a = 19

Substituting the value of a into equation (1):

b = 20

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs based on the given data points is:

Since x^0 is always equal to 1, the equation can be simplified to y = a + bx^1.

We can use two equations with two unknowns to solve for a and b.

Equation 1: 59 = a + 2b
Equation 2: -301 = a - 16b

Let's solve this system of equations:

Multiply Equation 1 by 16: 16(59) = 16a + 32b
Multiply Equation 2 by 2: 2(-301) = 2a - 32b

Now, add the two equations together:
944 = 18a

Divide both sides by 18:
a = 944/18
a ≈ 52.44

Substitute the value of a into Equation 1:
59 = 52.44 + 2b

Subtract 52.44 from both sides:

From the first example, we can see that when x = 13, y = 55. This gives us the following equation: 55 = a(13^0) + b(13^1).

Similarly, we can write equations for the other examples:
-44 = a(-20^0) + b(-20^1)
61 = a(15^0) + b(15^1)
13 = a(-1^0) + b(-1^1)

Input: -2, Output: 0
Input: 18, Output: -160
Input: -7, Output: 40

we can see that the function is not a simple linear relationship. Instead, it seems to be a quadratic relationship. Thus, we would need a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c.

We can use the method of finite differences to calculate the coefficients of the quadratic equation.

First, let's calculate the values of the second finite difference:

(-11, 72) -> (-3, 8) -> (-2, 0) -> (18, -160) -> (-7, 40)

1st finite difference: 72 - 8 = 64
2nd finite difference: 8 - 0 = 8
3rd finite difference: 0 - (-160) = 160
4th finite difference: (-160) - 40 = -200

Since the 4th finite difference is a constant (-200), it suggests a quadratic relationship.

Now, we substitute the values into the quadratic equation: y = ax^2 + bx + c

(-11, 72) -> 72 = a(-11)^2 + b(-11) + c
72 = 121a - 11b + c  ---- (1)

(-3, 8) -> 8 = a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c
8 = 9a - 3b + c  ---- (2)

(-2, 0) -> 0 = a(-2)^2 + b(-2) + c
0 = 4a - 2b + c  ---- (3)

(18, -160) -> -160 = a(18)^2 + b(18) + c
-160 = 324a + 18b + c  ---- (4)

(-7, 40) -> 40 = a(-7)^2 + b(-7) + c
40 = 49a + 7b + c  ---- (5)

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a, b, and c.

From (2) - (1):
8 - 72 = (9a - 3b + c) - (121a - 11b + c)
-64 = -112a + 8b  ---- (6)

From (3) - (2):
0 - 8 = (4a - 2b + c) - (9a - 3b + c)
-8 = -5a + b  ---- (7)

From (4) - (3):
-160 - 0 = (324a + 18b + c) - (4a - 2b + c)
-160 = 320a + 20b  ---- (8)

From (5) - (4):
40 - (-160) = (49a + 7b + c) - (324a + 18b + c)

Equations (6) and (7) are a system of linear equations that can be solved simultaneously:

Multiplying the equation (7) by 8 we have:
-64 = -40a + 8b  ---- (10)

Now, adding equation (6) and equation (10):
-64 + (-64) = -112a + 8b + (-40a + 8b)
-128 = -152a + 16b

Rearranging the terms:
-152a + 16b = -128
8b - 152a = -128  ---- (11)

Substituting equation (8) into equation (9):
200 = -275a - 11b  ---- (9)
200 + 11b = -275a
11b - 275a = 200  ---- (12)

Multiplying equation (11) by 11, and equation (12) by 8:
88b - 1672a = -1408  ---- (13)
88b - 2200a = 1600  ---- (14)

Subtracting equation (14) from equation (13):
88b - 2200a - (88b - 1672a) = -1408 - 1600
88b - 88b - 2200a + 1672a = -3008
-528a = -3008
a = -3008 / -528
a = 5.67

Substituting the value of a into equation (11):
8b - 152(5.67) = -128
8b - 860.84 = -128
8b = -128 + 860.84
8b = 732.84
b = 732.84 / 8
b = 91.605

Finally, substituting the values of a and b into equation (1):
72 = 5.67(-11)^2 + 91.605(-11) + c
72 = 5.67(121) - 1007.655 + c
72 = 685.07 - 1007.655 + c
72 = -322.585 + c
c = 322.585 + 72
c = 394.585

Therefore, the quadratic equation that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Substituting (-11, 72):

Substituting (-2, 0):

0 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1 + c(-2)^2
0 = a - 2b + 4c

Substituting (18, -160):

Input: -12, Output: 9

Input: 20, Output: -55

Input: -4, Output: -7

Input: 8, Output: -31

From the given examples, we can see that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear. It is clear that the function is quadratic since it cannot be represented by a linear function.

Based on the pattern, let's consider a quadratic function of the form:

Output: y = ax^2 + bx + c

To solve for the coefficients a, b, and c, we can substitute the given inputs and outputs into the equation and solve the resulting system of equations.

Given data point: (-12, 9)
9 = a*(-12)^2 + b*(-12) + c
9 = 144a - 12b + c               (1)

5 = a*(-10)^2 + b*(-10) + c
5 = 100a - 10b + c                 (4)

-31 = a*(8)^2 + b*(8) + c
-31 = 64a + 8b + c                   (5)

Now we have a system of linear equations. By solving this system, we can obtain the values of coefficients a, b, and c.

We can solve this system either algebraically or numerically. Solving algebraically, we can eliminate the variable c by subtracting equation (3) from equation (1) and equation (4) from equation (2):

From (1) - (3):
144a - 12b + c - (16a - 4b + c) = 9 - (-7)
128a - 8b = 16                  (6)

From (2) - (4):
400a + 20b + c - (100a - 10b + c) = -55 - 5
300a + 30b = -60                 (7)

Next, we can eliminate the variable b by multiplying equation (6) by 3 and equation (7) by 4:

3 * (128a - 8b) = 3 * 16
4 * (300a + 30b) = 4 * (-60)

384a - 24b = 48              (8)
1200a + 120b = -240           (9)

Now we can add equation (8) and equation (9) to eliminate b:

(384a - 24b) + (1200a + 120b) = 48 + (-240)
1584a = -192

Simplifying:
a = -192/1584 = -1/13

Now that we have the value of a, we can substitute it back into equation (8) to find the value of b:

384*(-1/13) - 24b = 48
-48/13 - 24b = 48
-24b = 48 + 48/13
-24b = 672/13
b = (672/13) / -24
b = -28/13

Finally, we can substitute the values of a and b back into equation (1) to find the value of c:

9 = 144*(-1/13)^2 + (-28/13)*(-12) + c
9 = 144/169 + 336/13 + c
9 = 144/169 + 2592/169 + c

"To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use the given inputs and outputs to solve for the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's analyze the given data:

Input: 9, Output: 29
Input: 2, Output: 8
Input: -1, Output: -1
Input: -6, Output: -16

From the first two pairs, we can write the following equations:

29 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
8 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1

Since any number raised to the 0th power is equal to 1, we can simplify the equations:

29 = a + 9b
8 = a + 2b

Now we have a system of linear equations that we can solve to find the values of a and b.

To do this, we can subtract the second equation from the first:

(29 - 8) = (a - a) + (9b - 2b)
21 = 7b
b = 3

Substituting the value of b into the second equation:

8 = a + 2(3)
8 = a + 6
a = 2

Using the second input and output:

For input 14:

Equation 2:  a + 14b = 191

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.
