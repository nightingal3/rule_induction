Adding the third equation to the second equation: 
-74 + (-218) = a + 5b + a + 17b

Multiplying this second equation by -1/11 in order to match the terms for a: 
7a + 77b = 22a + 242b

-444 = 52b
b = -444/52
b = - 27/ 26

Substituting the value of b back into a = 11b/3, we can solve for a:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is non-linear. A linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 would not fit the given data accurately.

Instead, let's try fitting a quadratic function of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c to the data. This will better capture the non-linear relationship between the inputs and outputs.

To find the quadratic function, we can use a system of equations by substituting the input-output pairs into the quadratic function and solve for the coefficients a, b, and c.

Using the given data, we have:

1) When x = -2, y = 17
17 = a(-2)^2 + b(-2) + c  =>  4a - 2b + c = 17

3) When x = -10, y = 161

"From the given data, we can observe that the relationship between the input and output values can be described by a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the coefficients a and b, we can substitute the input and output values from each pair of data points and solve the resulting system of equations.

Substituting the first data pair (13, -66):

-66 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
-66 = a + 13b

Substituting the second data pair (-20, 132):

132 = a(-20^0) + b(-20^1)
132 = a - 20b

Substituting the third data pair (18, -96):

-96 = a(18^0) + b(18^1)
-96 = a + 18b

Substituting the fourth data pair (0, 12):

12 = a(0^0) + b(0^1)
12 = a

Substituting the fifth data pair (11, -54):

-54 = a(11^0) + b(11^1)
-54 = a + 11b

From the above equations, we can solve for the values of a and b.

From the equation 12 = a, we can substitute a = 12 into the equation -54 = a + 11b:

-54 = 12 + 11b
-66 = 11b
b = -6

Substituting the value of b = -6 into the equation -66 = a + 13b:

-66 = a - 78
a = 12

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

"The given data points can be represented by a linear function. Let's call the input as x and the output as y. The function can be written as:

Now we can substitute the value of a (12) into the equations to find b.

-66 = 12 + 13b

Comparing the inputs and outputs, we can find the values of a and b as follows:

When x = 13, y = -66
-66 = a(13^0) + b(13^1) = a + 13b

When x = -20, y = 132
132 = a(-20^0) + b(-20^1) = a - 20b

When x = 18, y = -96
-96 = a(18^0) + b(18^1) = a + 18b

When x = 0, y = 12
12 = a(0^0) + b(0^1) = a

When x = 11, y = -54
-54 = a(11^0) + b(11^1) = a + 11b

Solving these equations, we can determine the values of a and b.

From the equation -66 = a + 13b, we get b = (-66 - a) / 13

Substituting this expression for b in the equations 132 = a - 20b and -96 = a + 18b, we can solve for a.

132 = a - 20((-66 - a) / 13)
132 = a + (1320 + 20a)/13
1716 = 13a + 1320 + 20a
396 = 33a
a = 12

Using this value of a, we can substitute in one of the original equations to solve for b:

For the first input-output pair (-17, -325), we have:

"Using multiple data points, there doesn't seem to be a clear relationship between the input and output based on an exponential function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1. Therefore, we can consider using a linear function in the form of y = mx + c to describe the data.

Based on the given data points, let's calculate the slope and y-intercept to build the linear function.

When input = -17, output = -325
-325 = m(-17) + c

When input = -5, output = -109

When input = 16, output = 269
269 = m(16) + c

When input = -15, output = -289
-289 = m(-15) + c

Solving the above system of equations will give us the values of m and c, which we can use in the linear function.

Let's solve these equations:

1) -325 = -17m + c
2) -109 = -5m + c
3) 269 = 16m + c
4) -289 = -15m + c

Rearranging equation 1) and 2) to obtain the values of m and c:
m = (c + 325) / 17
m = (c + 109) / 5

Equating these two expressions for m, we get:
(c + 325) / 17 = (c + 109) / 5

Simplifying and rearranging the equation for c:
5(c + 325) = 17(c + 109)

c = 218 / 12

From the first pair (10, 142):

142 = a(10)^0 + b(10)^1
142 = a + 10b

From the second pair (15, 217):

217 = a(15)^0 + b(15)^1

-292 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1

Simplifying:

-292 = a + (-17)b

Similarly, we can write equations with the remaining data pairs:

-105 = a(-6)^0 + b(-6)^1
-275 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
-309 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1

2688 + 2352 = 336b - 2352c + 336b - 4032c

5040 = 672b - 6384c

Dividing the equation by 168 to simplify:
5040/168 = (672b - 6384c)/168
30 = 4b - 38c

Now we can solve this equation for b in terms of c:

4b = 38c - 30
b = (38c - 30) / 4
b = 9.5c - 7.5

Substituting this value of b into equation (4) or (5), we can find the value of c. Let's use equation (4):

147 = 21b - 147c
147 = 21(9.5c - 7.5) - 147c
147 = 199.5c - 157.5 - 147c
147 = 199.5c - 147c - 157.5
147 + 157.5 = 199.5c - 147c
304.5 = 52.5c
c = 304.5/52.5
c = 5.8

Substituting the value of c back into the equation for b:
b = 9.5(5.8) - 7.5
b = 55.1 - 7.5
b = 47.6

Now that we have the values of b and c, we can substitute them back into one of the original equations to find a. Let's use equation (3):

15 = a + 2b + 4c
15 = a + 2(47.6) + 4(5.8)
15 = a + 95.2 + 23.2
15 = a + 118.4
15 - 118.4 = a
a = -103.4

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Using these equations, we can solve for a and b:

From -97 = a + (-14)b => a = -97 + 14b
Substitute a = -97 + 14b into the other equations:

147 = 21b
b = 7

3. When x = -14, y = 31

4. When x = -5, y = 4
   4 = a - 5b

5. When x = -8, y = 13
   13 = a - 8b

Solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

From equations 1 and 4,
-26 = a + 5b
4 = a - 5b

Adding these equations gives:

When the input is -9, the output is 64.
64 = a - 9b ----(1)

When the input is -3, the output is 22.
22 = a - 3b ----(2)

When the input is 9, the output is -62.
-62 = a + 9b ----(3)

When the input is -5, the output is 36.
36 = a - 5b ----(4)

When the input is -16, the output is 113.
113 = a - 16b ----(5)

To solve these equations, let's rearrange (1) and (3):

a = 64 + 9b
a = -62 - 9b

Since both equations equal to a, we can equate them:
64 + 9b = -62 - 9b
18b = -126
b = -7

Now substitute the value of b into equation (1) to find a:
64 = a - 9(-7)
64 = a + 63
a = 1

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

"Given the data points, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not a simple linear relationship. A linear relationship would be of the form y = ax + b, but this does not seem to capture the pattern in the data.

To find a function that better represents the data, let's try fitting a quadratic function of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants.

By substituting the given data points into the quadratic function, we can find the values of a, b, and c.

Using the first data point (-20, 265):
265 = a(-20)^2 + b(-20) + c
265 = 400a - 20b + c

Using the second data point (-15, 195):
195 = a(-15)^2 + b(-15) + c
195 = 225a - 15b + c

Using the third data point (-5, 55):
55 = a(-5)^2 + b(-5) + c
55 = 25a - 5b + c

Using the fourth data point (-10, 125):
125 = a(-10)^2 + b(-10) + c
125 = 100a - 10b + c

Using the fifth data point (6, -99):
-99 = a(6)^2 + b(6) + c
-99 = 36a + 6b + c

Solving these five equations simultaneously will give us the values of a, b, and c, which will define the quadratic function that best fits the data.",-1.065456414636,"[-14, -15]"

-20 = a + (-20)b
-15 = a + (-15)b

Solving this system of equations, we get:

"Looking at the given data points, we need to find the relationship between the input (x) and output (y) values. 

Let's take a look at the exponents of x:

For the first data point: x^0 = 1, x^1 = -20.
For the second data point: x^0 = 1, x^1 = -15.
For the third data point: x^0 = 1, x^1 = -5.
For the fourth data point: x^0 = 1, x^1 = -10.
For the fifth data point: x^0 = 1, x^1 = 6.

It is evident that the exponent of x is always 1. 

Now, let's consider the coefficients:

For the first data point: y = 265. Therefore, a + b(-20) = 265.
For the second data point: y = 195. Therefore, a + b(-15) = 195.
For the third data point: y = 55. Therefore, a + b(-5) = 55.
For the fourth data point: y = 125. Therefore, a + b(-10) = 125.
For the fifth data point: y = -99. Therefore, a + b(6) = -99.

Now, we have five linear equations with two variables (a and b). By solving this system of equations, we can determine the values of a and b.

Solving the system of equations:

Using the first two equations: a + -20b = 265 and a + -15b = 195,
we find that b = -2 and a = 65.

Using the third and fourth equations: a + -5b = 55 and a + -10b = 125,
we find that b = -10 and a = 105.

Using the fourth and fifth equations: a + -10b = 125 and a + 6b = -99,
we find that b = -24 and a = 281.

Since the values of a and b change for different pairs of equations, we can conclude that the relationship between x and y cannot be accurately described by a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. The given data points do not fit a simple linear relationship.",-0.970109239594,"[-14, -15]"

297 = a - 16b + 256c

Using the second input-output pair:
-315 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1 + c(18)^2
-315 = a + 18b + 324c

Using the third input-output pair:
297 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1 + c(-16)^2
297 = a - 16b + 256c

Using the fourth input-output pair:
99 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1 + c(-5)^2

Simplifying equations (1) and (3) yields:

-35 = a + (-5b)

-5a - b = -35     .................(2)

Using equation (1), we can rewrite equation (2) as:

-6a = -20

a = 20/6

"Based on the given input-output pairs, it is apparent that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be represented by a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's denote the input value as x and the output value as y.

From the provided data points, we can determine the coefficients a and b:

For the first input-output pair (11, -204),
-204 = a(11)^0 + b(11)^1
-204 = a + 11b    (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1)

For the second input-output pair (-4, 66),
66 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
66 = a - 4b

For the third input-output pair (-17, 300),
300 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1
300 = a - 17b

For the fourth input-output pair (-15, 264),
264 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)^1
264 = a - 15b

For the fifth input-output pair (20, -366),
-366 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
-366 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

Adding the second and fourth equations, we get:
66 + 264 = a - 4b + a - 15b
330 = 2a - 19b

Subtracting the third equation from this sum, we get:
330 - 300 = 2a - 19b - (a - 17b)
30 = a + 2b

Solving the new system of equations:
2a - 19b = 330
a + 2b = 30

Multiplying the second equation by 2, we get:
2a + 4b = 60

Subtracting this new equation from the first one, we get:
(2a - 19b) - (2a + 4b) = 330 - 60
-23b = 270
b = -270/23

Substituting the value of b into the equation a + 2b = 30, we get:
a + 2(-270/23) = 30
a - 540/23 = 30
a = 540/23 + 690/23
a = 1230/23

To solve this system of equations, we can use any method such as substitution or elimination. However, since there are only two variables (a and b), we can use a simpler approach called matrix inversion.

Writing the equations in matrix form:

| 1  -4  | | b | = | 66   |
| 1 -17 |             | 300 |
| 1 -15 |             | 264 |
| 1  20 |            | -366 |

Using matrix inversion, we get:

                        | 264 |
                        | -366 |

Evaluating the matrix inverse and multiplying it with the outputs, we get:

| a |   | -1/87  1/87 | | -204 |
| b | = | 1/174 -1/174 | | 66   |
                                    | 300 |

                                    | -366 |

Multiplying the matrices, we get:

| a |   | -1/87 * -204 + 1/87 * 66 |
| b | = | 1/174 * -204 - 1/174 * 66 |
                                            
Simplifying:

| a |   | 654/87 |
| b | = | -654/174 |

The simplified function is:

y = (654/87)x^0 + (-654/174)x^1

"To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use a linear equation of the form 'y = ax^0 + bx^1', where 'a' and 'b' are constants.

We can solve for 'a' and 'b' by substituting the given inputs and outputs into the equation.

From the given inputs and outputs:
1. When the input is 11, the output is -204.
2. When the input is -4, the output is 66.
3. When the input is -17, the output is 300.
4. When the input is -15, the output is 264.
5. When the input is 20, the output is -366.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get the following system of equations:

1. -204 = a(11)^0 + b(11)^1
2. 66 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
3. 300 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1
4. 264 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)^1
5. -366 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1

Simplifying the equations, we get:

1. -204 = a + 11b
2. 66 = a - 4b
3. 300 = a - 17b
4. 264 = a - 15b
5. -366 = a + 20b

Now, we have a system of linear equations that we can solve to find the values of 'a' and 'b':

By summing up equations (1) and (3), we get:
96 = 2a - 6b

By summing up equations (2) and (4), we get:
330 = 2a - 19b

Adding equation (5) to these two equations, we get:
-270 = 5a + b

Simplifying equation (6), we get:
b = -270 - 5a

Substituting this value of 'b' into equation (1), we get:
-204 = a + 11(-270 - 5a)

Simplifying equation (7), we get:
-204 = -54a - 2970

Solving equation (8) for 'a', we get:
a = (-204 + 2970) / -54
a = 52

Substituting the value of 'a' back into equation (6), we get:
b = -270 - 5(52)
b = -270 - 260
b = -530

Applying regression analysis, we can find the values of a and b that minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs.

Using the available data points, we can create the following system of equations:

300 = a(1)^0 + b(-17)^1

The given data points are:

For each data point, we can substitute the input values into the equation, y = ax^0 + bx^1, and solve the resulting equation system to find the values of a and b.

By substituting the first data point (-16, 82), we get:
82 = a * (-16)^0 + b * (-16)^1
82 = a + (-16)b

Similarly, for the remaining data points, we get the following equations:

52 = a * (-11)^0 + b * (-11)^1 -> 52 = a - 11b
-98 = a * 14^0 + b * 14^1 -> -98 = a + 14b
94 = a * (-18)^0 + b * (-18)^1 -> 94 = a - 18b
-32 = a * 3^0 + b * 3^1 -> -32 = a + 3b

This gives us a system of linear equations:

a + (-16)b = 82       (Equation 1)

14(177) = 14a + 182b

Simplifying:

2483 = 13a + 182b   --------(3)
2478 = 14a + 196b   --------(4)

Subtracting equation (4) from equation (3):

2483 - 2478 = 13a - 14a + 182b - 196b
5 = -a - 14b

Rearranging:

a + 14b = -5   --------(5)

With equation (5) and either equation (1) or equation (2), we can solve for the values of a and b.

Substituting equation (1) into equation (5):

(a + 13b) + 14b = -5
a + 27b = -5  --------(6)

Using equations (1) and (6), we now have a system of linear equations:

a + 13b = 177   --------(1)
a + 27b = -5    --------(6)

By solving this system of equations, we can determine the values of a and b.
