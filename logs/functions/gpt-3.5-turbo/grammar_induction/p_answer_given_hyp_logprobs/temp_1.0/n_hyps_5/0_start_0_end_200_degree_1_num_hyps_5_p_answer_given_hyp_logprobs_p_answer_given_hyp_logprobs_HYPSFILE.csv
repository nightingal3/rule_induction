To determine the values of a and b, let's set up a system of equations using the given input-output pairs:

For the first pair (-13, -197):
-197 = a(-13)^0 + b(-13)^1
-197 = a + (-13)b

For the second pair (-11, -169):
-169 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
-169 = a + (-11)b

For the third pair (20, 265):
265 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
265 = a + 20b

For the fourth pair (-10, -155):
-155 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-155 = a + (-10)b

For the fifth pair (7, 83):
83 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1
83 = a + 7b

Simplifying the equations:

-197 = a - 13b
-169 = a - 11b
265 = a + 20b
-155 = a - 10b
83 = a + 7b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

"Looking at the given inputs and outputs, it seems like the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 can be simplified to y = bx + c, where b and c are constants. 

To find the values of b and c, we can use any two input-output pairs.

Using the first pair of (-13, -197):

-197 = b*(-13) + c

Using the second pair of (-11, -169):

-169 = b*(-11) + c

Simplifying these equations, we can express c in terms of b:

-197 = -13b + c
-169 = -11b + c

Rearranging these equations, we get:

c = -197 + 13b
c = -169 + 11b

Equating the expressions for c, we have:

-197 + 13b = -169 + 11b

Simplifying the equation, we find:

2b = 28

So, b = 14. 

Substituting the value of b in one of the expressions for c, we find:

For (13, -66):
-66 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
-66 = a + 13b

"The function does not seem to follow a linear relationship y = ax^0 + bx^1. Instead, it seems to follow a quadratic relationship y = a(x - h)^2 + k. To find the values of a, h, and k, we can use the given input-output pairs as data points.

Using the first data point (10, 142) and the general form of a quadratic equation, we can substitute the values to find the equation:

142 = a(10 - h)^2 + k

Using the second data point (15, 217), we can substitute the values to find another equation:

We now have a system of two equations with two unknowns (a and h). We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and h. Once we have those values, we can substitute them into either equation to find the value of k.

Let's solve the system of equations:

142 = a(10 - h)^2 + k  --> Equation 1
217 = a(15 - h)^2 + k  --> Equation 2

To eliminate k, we can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

Expanding the squares:

125 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
125 = a - 10b

Input: 6, Output: -99
-99 = a(6)^0 + b(6)^1
-99 = a + 6b

Now, we have a system of equations:

a - 20b = 265     (Equation 1)
a - 15b = 195     (Equation 2)
a - 5b = 55       (Equation 3)
a - 10b = 125     (Equation 4)
a + 6b = -99      (Equation 5)

To solve the system of equations, we can subtract Equation 3 from Equation 2 to find the value of b:
(a - 15b) - (a - 5b) = 195 - 55
-10b = 140
b = -14

Substituting the value of b back into Equation 3, we find the value of a:

a = 125

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

-17 | -310

First, we need to calculate the mean of the x-values and the mean of the y-values:

mean x = (-17 + 17 + 10 + 12 + 13) / 5 = 7

mean y = (-310 + 302 + 176 + 212 + 230) / 5 = 122

Next, we calculate the differences between each x-value and the mean of x (x - mean x), and the differences between each y-value and the mean of y (y - mean y):

Σ[(x - mean x)^2] = (-24)^2 + 10^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 = 766

Now, we can calculate the slope (b) using the formula:

b = Σ[(x - mean x) * (y - mean y)] / Σ[(x - mean x)^2] = 34404 / 766 = 44.91

Finally, we can use the calculated slope (b) to find the intercept (a) using the mean values:

deviation_x3 = 10 - 7 = 3
deviation_x4 = 12 - 7 = 5
deviation_x5 = 13 - 7 = 6

deviation_y1 = -310 - 122 = -432
deviation_y2 = 302 - 122 = 180
deviation_y3 = 176 - 122 = 54
deviation_y4 = 212 - 122 = 90
deviation_y5 = 230 - 122 = 108

Now, let's calculate the sum of the product of the deviations:

sum_deviation_xy = (deviation_x1 * deviation_y1) + (deviation_x2 * deviation_y2) + (deviation_x3 * deviation_y3) + (deviation_x4 * deviation_y4) + (deviation_x5 * deviation_y5)

sum_deviation_xy = (-24 * -432) + (10 * 180) + (3 * 54) + (5 * 90) + (6 * 108) = 10332

Next, let's calculate the sum of the squared deviations of the inputs (x):

sum_deviation_x_squared = deviation_x1^2 + deviation_x2^2 + deviation_x3^2 + deviation_x4^2 + deviation_x5^2

sum_deviation_x_squared = (-24^2) + (10^2) + (3^2) + (5^2) + (6^2) = 766

"Upon examining the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the input and output values can be represented by a quadratic function. 

A quadratic function is of the form: y = ax^2 + bx + c 

Since we are requested to represent the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can equate the quadratic function to obtain the desired form:

y = ax^2 + bx + c 
   = ax^0 + bx^1 

In order to find the values of a, b, and c, we need to substitute the given input and output pairs into the equation and solve the resulting system of equations. However, since only two pairs are provided, we can only approximate the coefficients to fit these specific data points. 

Let's express the quadratic function in the given form: y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Substituting the first input and output values: 
297 = a + (-16)b

Substituting the second input and output values: 
-315 = a + 18b

We now have a system of two equations with two unknowns. Solving this system, we can approximate the values of a and b. 

297 = a - 16b --> (Eq.1)
-315 = a + 18b --> (Eq.2)

Multiplying Eq.2 by 16 and adding it to Eq.1, we can eliminate the 'a' term:

297 + (-315) = a - 16b + 288b
-18 = (272b)
-18/272 = b
-0.066 = b

Substituting the value of b back into Eq.1, we can solve for a:

297 = a - 16(-0.066)
297 = a + 1.056
297 - 1.056 = a
295.944 = a

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 295.944x^0 + (-0.066)x^1

Simplifying, we get:

"To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can assume that the function follows a quadratic form. Therefore, the function can be written as:

y = ax^2 + bx + c

To find the values of a, b, and c, we can use the given input-output pairs:

1) When input = -16, output = 297:
297 = a*(-16)^2 + b*(-16) + c
297 = 256a - 16b + c

2) When input = 18, output = -315:
-315 = a*(18)^2 + b*(18) + c
-315 = 324a + 18b + c

3) When input = -16, output = 297:
297 = a*(-16)^2 + b*(-16) + c
297 = 256a - 16b + c

4) When input = -5, output = 99:
99 = a*(-5)^2 + b*(-5) + c
99 = 25a - 5b + c

5) When input = 5, output = -81:
-81 = a*(5)^2 + b*(5) + c
-81 = 25a + 5b + c

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a, b, and c, which can then be used to write the exact form of the function.

"From the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the relationship between the input and output can be described by a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To determine the values of a and b, we can use the given input-output pairs to form a system of equations.

Plugging the first input-output pair (-16, 297) into the quadratic function, we get:
297 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
297 = a + (-16)b
297 = a - 16b               --- (1)

Similarly, plugging the second input-output pair (18, -315) into the quadratic function, we get:
-315 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1
-315 = a + 18b              --- (2)

We now have a system of two linear equations (equations 1 and 2) that we can solve to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying equation (1) by 18, and multiplying equation (2) by -16, we get:

Adding equations (3) and (4) together, we eliminate the b term:

5346 + 5040 = 18a - 16a - 288b - 288b
10386 = 2a - 576b

Rearranging the equation, we get:

2a - 576b = 10386            --- (5)

Now, multiplying equation (1) by -16, and multiplying equation (2) by 18, we get:

-4752 = -16a + 256b        --- (6)
-5670 = 18a + 324b         --- (7)

Adding equations (6) and (7) together, we again eliminate the b term:

-4752 + (-5670) = -16a + 18a + 256b + 324b
-10422 = 2a + 580b

Rearranging the equation, we get:

2a + 580b = -10422            --- (8)

Now, we have a system of two linear equations (equations 5 and 8) that we can solve to find the values of a and b.

Using a method like Gaussian elimination or substitution, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

Equation 5: 2a - 576b = 10386

"To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's analyze the pattern in the data:

Input: 0 ⇒ Output: -15
Input: -5 ⇒ Output: -35
Input: -4 ⇒ Output: -31
Input: 5 ⇒ Output: 5
Input: -12 ⇒ Output: -63

Looking at the outputs, we can observe that they are obtained by subtracting 5 from the input value and then multiplying the result by a factor. Let's call this factor ""a"".

Letting x be the input, we can write the equation as:

Output = a(x - 5)  ⇒  Output = ax - 5a

Comparing this equation with the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can rewrite it as:

Output = bx^1 + ax^0  ⇒  Output = b(x^1) + a(x^0)

By substituting x with (x - 5), we can determine the coefficients a and b:

Output = b(x - 5) + a(1)  ⇒  Output = bx - 5b + a

Now, we can determine the values of a and b by comparing the coefficients of x and x^0 in the equation with our data points:

Comparing coefficients of x:
-35 = -5b ⇒ b = 7

Comparing coefficients of x^0:
-15 = - 5b + a ⇒ -15 = -5(7) + a ⇒ a = -15 + 35 ⇒ a = 20

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

"To find the equation that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can observe that the output values decrease as the input values decrease. Also, the difference between consecutive output values seems to decrease as the input values decrease. Let's start by considering the pattern for the input values -5, -4, and -12. The output for input -5 is -35, and for input -4 is -31. The difference between these two output values is 4.

Similarly, the output for input -12 is -63. The difference between the output for input -12 and the output for input -5 is 28. Since the difference between consecutive output values decreases by 4 each time, we can assume a linear relationship and apply the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's calculate the value of a and b using the first two data points (-5, -35) and (-4, -31):

For (-5, -35):
-35 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
-35 = a - 5b

For (-4, -31):
-31 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
-31 = a - 4b

Solving these equations simultaneously:

-35 = a - 5b
-31 = a - 4b

Subtracting the second equation from the first:

-4 = -b

Therefore, b = 4. Substituting this value back into one of the equations:

-35 = a - 20

Multiplying equation (11) by 5, equation (12) by 16, equation (13) by 25, and adding them together will eliminate the variable b.

-128b - 400c = -56          ----(14)

Multiplying equation (10) by 2 and subtracting equation (14) from it will eliminate the variable c.

912c = 52                  ----(15)

Therefore, c = 52/912 = 13/228.

Substituting the value of c = 13/228 into equation (13) will give us the value of b.

2b - 4(13/228) = 4
2b - 52/57 = 4
2b = 4 + 52/57
2b = 248/57
b = (248/57)/2
b = 248/114
b = 124/57

Similarly, substituting the values of b = 124/57 and c = 13/228 into equation (1) will give us the value of a.

2 = a + 2(124/57) + 4(13/228)
2 = a + 248/57 + 52/57
2 = a + 300/57
2 = a + (300+57)/57
2 = a + 357/57
2 = a + 119/19
2 - 119/19 = a
38/19 - 119/19 = a
-81/19 = a

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output = -81/19 + (124/57) * input + (13/228) * input^2

"The given data points do not fit a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. However, we can try to come up with a function that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

One possible function that captures the relationship is a quadratic equation:

Output: y = ax^2 + bx + c

To find the coefficients a, b, and c, we can substitute the input-output pairs into the equation and solve for the coefficients.

Using the given data points:
1. (-16, 82):
82 = a(-16)^2 + b(-16) + c  =>  82 = 256a - 16b + c

94 = a + (-18)b

5. Input: 3, Output: -32
-32 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1
-32 = a + 3b

Now we have a system of linear equations:

a - 16b = 82   (Equation 1)
a - 11b = 52   (Equation 2)
a + 14b = -98  (Equation 3)
a - 18b = 94   (Equation 4)

To find the values of a, b, and c, we'll need to solve a system of equations using three of the input-output pairs. Let's use (0, 109), (-3, 18), and (5, -38).

Substituting the values into the function:

109 = 0a + 0b + c     (Equation 1)
18 = (-3)^2a + (-3)b + c     (Equation 2)
-38 = (5)^2a + (5)b + c     (Equation 3)

25a + 5b + 109 = -38     (Equation 5)

Simplifying Equations 4 and 5:

Solving the system of equations:

Multiplying Equation 4 by 5 and Equation 5 by 3 to eliminate b:

45a - 15b = -455     (Equation 6)

Solving for a:

a = -7.47

Substituting a = -7.47 into Equation 4:

9(-7.47) - 3b = -91
-67.23 - 3b = -91
-3b = -91 + 67.23
