"Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can see that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's denote the input as x and the output as y.

Using the given data points, we can create a system of equations:

For the first data point (-10, -213):
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1 = a - 10b

For the second data point (9, 167):
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1 = a + 9b

For the third data point (4, 67):
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1 = a + 4b

For the fourth data point (-3, -73):
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1 = a - 3b

For the fifth data point (20, 387):
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

By substituting the values of a and b back into the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can obtain the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs.

The calculated values of a and b are:
a = 50
b = -18

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Using the fifth pair (20, 387):
387 = a + b*20

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

After solving the equations, we find that a = -53 and b = 20/11.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be modeled by a linear function. 

In the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, since any number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1, the function can be simplified to:

y = a + bx

To find the values of a and b, we can use two data points from the given examples.

Using the inputs -10 and -3, and their respective outputs -213 and -73, we can form the following equations:

-213 = a + (-10)b
-73 = a + (-3)b

Simplifying these equations, we get:

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:

-213 + 73 = a - 10b - a + 3b
-140 = -7b
b = 20

Substituting b = 20 into Equation 2:

"After analyzing the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the input and output can be best described by a linear equation in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Upon further inspection, it seems that the coefficient 'a' represents a constant term or the y-intercept, while the coefficient 'b' represents the slope of the line.

To find the values of 'a' and 'b', we can choose any two points from the given dataset. Let's take (-10, -213) and (4, 67) as our two points.

Using these two points, we can calculate the value of 'b' using the formula:
b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Substituting the values, we get:
b = (67 - (-213)) / (4 - (-10))
b = 280 / 14
b = 20

Now that we have the value of 'b', we can substitute it back into the equation and use one of the points to solve for 'a'.

Using the point (-10, -213) and the value of 'b' derived before, we can substitute the values into the equation:
-213 = a * (-10)^0 + 20 * (-10)^1

Simplifying the equation further:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be approximated by a linear function. The function can be written in the form:

To determine the values of a and b, we can use any two pairs of inputs and outputs. Let's use the pairs (-10, -213) and (9, 167) to solve for a and b.

Using the first pair (-10, -213):
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b           (1)

Using the second pair (9, 167):
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1

1670 = 10a + 90b              (3)

-1883 = -9a - 100b
1883 = 9a + 100b               (4)

Now we have a new equation (4) that we can solve for a and b.

Simplifying equation (4):

Dividing by 1:
1883/1 = (9a + 100b)/1
1883 = 9a/1 + 100b/1
1883 = 9a + 100b              (5)

Using equation (5) and equation (3), we now have two equations that can be solved simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

-1883 = -9a - 100b          (4)
1670 = 10a + 90b           (3)

Multiplying equation (4) by 10:
-18830 = -90a - 1000b        (6)

Adding equation (3) and equation (6):
1670 - 18830 = 10a + 90b + (-90a - 1000b)
-17160 = -910b
b = (-17160)/(-910)
b = 18

Substituting the value of b into equation (3):

From equation 2, we can conclude that c = -3. Substituting this value in the remaining equations, we have:

5) 304 = 256a - 16b

Rearranging equation 3 to isolate b, we get:

0 = 1570 + 342 + 18b
0 = 1912 + 18b

"From the given input-output pairs, It can be observed that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be expressed as a quadratic equation. 

The equation can be written in the form: y = ax^2 + bx + c

To find the values of a, b, and c, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve for the coefficients.

Using the three input-output pairs (-18, 339), (0, -3), and (5, -98), we can create a system of three equations:

1) 339 = a(-18)^2 + b(-18) + c
2) -3 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c
3) -98 = a(5)^2 + b(5) + c

Simplifying the equations gives:

1) 339 = 324a - 18b + c
2) -3 = c
3) -98 = 25a + 5b + c

Substituting -3 for c in equations 1 and 3, we get:

1) 339 = 324a - 18b - 3
3) -98 = 25a + 5b - 3

Simplifying further gives:

1) 342 = 324a - 18b
3) -95 = 25a + 5b

Multiplying equation 3 by 6, we can eliminate b:

18) -570 = 150a + 30b

Adding equation 18 to equation 1 eliminates b as well:

360 = 474a

Solving for a gives:

a = 360/474 = 0.757

Substituting a = 0.757 into equation 3 and solving for b gives:

-95 = 0.757(25) + 5b
-95 = 18.925 + 5b
-113.925 = 5b
b = -22.785

Substituting a = 0.757 and b = -22.785 into equation 2 gives:

From equation (1):
a = -31 - 5b

Substituting this value of a in equations (2), (3), (4), and (5) we have:
-51 = (-31 - 5b) + 9b
49 = (-31 - 5b) + (-11)b
14 = (-31 - 5b) + (-4)b
54 = (-31 - 5b) + (-12)b

Simplifying each equation further:
-51 = -31 + 4b
49 = -31 - 16b
14 = -31 - 11b
54 = -31 - 17b

Rearranging these equations:
4b = -51 + 31
-16b = 49 + 31

-17b = 54 + 31

Solving these equations:

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Simplifying each equation:
-98 = a + 7b
-218 = a + 17b
-74 = a + 5b
-50 = a + 3b
58 = a - 6b

To solve this system of equations, we can use matrix operations. Let's define the matrix A and vector b as:

A = [1, 7;

However, since the problem statement specifically requested the function to be in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we know that a will be the coefficient for x^0 (which is equal to 1) and b will be the coefficient for x^1. 

Solving the system of equations gives us the following values for a and b:

-98 = a(7^0) + b(7^1)

Simplifying further:

-98 = a + 7b

Using the second pair, when the input is 17, the output is -218. This can be represented as:

-218 = a(17^0) + b(17^1)

Simplifying further:

Now we have a system of equations:

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b. Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2), we get:

Dividing both sides by 10, we find:

b = -12

Substituting this value of b back into equation (1), we can find a:

Solving Equation 3 for a:

a = (-741 + 3b)/7

Substituting this value of a in Equation 4:

"To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to determine the coefficients ""a"" and ""b"" in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To do this, we can use the given input-output pairs:

Input: 9, Output: 160
Input: 13, Output: 228
Input: -4, Output: -61
Input: 15, Output: 262
Input: -20, Output: -333

From the provided data, we can observe that the coefficient ""a"" represents the constant term in the output. The coefficient ""b"" represents the coefficient multiplying the input ""x"".

By plugging in the input and output values into the equation, we can set up a system of equations to solve for ""a"" and ""b"".

For the first input-output pair (9, 160):
160 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
160 = a + 9b

For the second input-output pair (13, 228):
228 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1
228 = a + 13b

For the third input-output pair (-4, -61):

For the second data point (13, 228):

262 = a + 15b

For the fifth data point (-20, -333):
-333 = a((-20)^0) + b((-20)^1)
-333 = a - 20b

We have a system of equations with two unknowns (a and b). Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b.

Adding the first and third equations, we get:
99 = 2a + 5b        (Equation 1)

Adding the fourth and fifth equations, we get:

Multiplying Equation 2 by 2, we get:

Plugging the value of a into Equation 1, we have:

155/36 = 5b

b = 31/36

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a quadratic function, rather than a linear one. Therefore, the function in the form Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 would not be appropriate.

To capture the relationship, it appears that a quadratic function in the form Output: y = ax^2 + bx + c might be a better fit. Let's try to find the coefficients a, b, and c.

Using the given data points:

Plugging these values into the quadratic function equation:

Solving this system of equations will give us the coefficients of the quadratic function:

From equations (1) and (2), we have:
(2) - (1) => 228 - 160 = (169a + 13b + c) - (81a + 9b + c)
68 = 88a + 4b      ....(6)

From equations (4) and (3), we have:
(4) - (3) => 262 - (-61) = (225a + 15b + c) - (16a - 4b + c)
323 = 209a + 19b   ....(7)

From equations (5), (3), and (7), we can eliminate the variable ""c"":
(7) - (6) => (209a + 19b) - (88a + 4b) = 323 - 68
121a + 15b = 255  ....(8)

From equations (3) and (6), we can eliminate the variable ""a"":
(6) - (3) => (88a + 4b) - (16a - 4b) = 68 - (-61)
72a + 8b = 129    ....(9)

Solving equations (8) and (9), we get:
a = 1
b = 3

Substituting these values back into equation (1), we can solve for ""c"":

160 = 81(1) + 9(3) + c
160 = 81 + 27 + c

Adding the fourth and fifth equations:

For the first data point (-2, 17):
17 = a + b(-2)

Simplifying the equation:
17 = a - 2b  ... Equation (1)

For the second data point (7, -145):
-145 = a + b(7)

Simplifying the equation:
-145 = a + 7b  ... Equation (2)

To solve this system of equations, we can use various methods such as substitution or elimination. Let's use the substitution method.

From Equation (1), we can rearrange it to solve for 'a':
a = 17 + 2b

Now, substitute this value of 'a' into Equation (2):
-145 = (17 + 2b) + 7b

Simplifying the equation:
-145 = 17 + 9b

Rearrange the equation:
9b = -145 - 17
9b = -162
b = -162/9
b = -18

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into Equation (1) to find 'a':
17 = a - 2(-18)
17 = a + 36
a = 17 - 36
a = -19

-325 = a - 17b

Using the second data point (-5, -109):
-109 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
-109 = a - 5b

Now we have two equations with two unknowns (a and b), which we can solve simultaneously.

Rearranging the first equation, we get:
a = 325 + 17b

Substituting this expression for a in the second equation:
-109 = (325 + 17b) - 5b
-109 = 325 + 12b
12b = -434
b = -434/12
b = -36.16666667 (approximately)

Substituting this value of b back into the expression for a:
a = 325 + 17(-36.16666667)
a = 325 - 615.83333335
a = -290.83333335 (approximately)

Input: -5, Output: -109
Input: 16, Output: 269
Input: -15, Output: -289
Input: -15, Output: -289

To write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify it as y = a + bx.

We can use any two pairs to solve for the values of a and b. Let's solve for a and b using the first and third pairs:

Using Input: -17, Output: -325:
-325 = a + (-17)b

Using Input: 16, Output: 269:
269 = a + (16)b

Now, we have a system of equations:

1) -325 = a - 17b
2) 269 = a + 16b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying equation 1) by 16:
-5200 = 16a - 272b

We can now subtract equation 2) from this new equation:
-5200 - 269 = 16a - 272b - a - 16b
-5470 = 15a - 288b

Simplifying further, we get:
15a - 288b = -5470

Dividing both sides by 3:
5a - 96b = -1823

If we let a = 5c and b = -96d, we can simplify the equation as:
c - 19d = -365

Now, let's substitute the values of a and b back into one of the original equations. Let's use equation 1):

-325 = a - 17b
-325 = 5c - 17(-96d)
-325 = 5c + 1632d

If we let c = e + 1 and d = f + 4, we can rewrite the equation as:
-325 = 5(e + 1) + 1632(f + 4)
-325 = 5e + 5 + 1632f + 6528
-325 = 5e + 1632f + 6533

Now, we have the equations:
c - 19d = -365
-325 = 5e + 1632f + 6533

By substituting the values of c and d back to their original variables:
a = 5c = 5(e + 1) = 5e + 5
b = -96d = -96(f + 4) = -96f - 384

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

To find the values of 'a' and 'b', we can solve these equations simultaneously.

By solving the system of equations (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5), we can find 'a' and 'b'.

Let's solve these equations:

From Equation 1 and Equation 2:

By subtracting Equation A from Equation B:
a + 15b - a - 10b = 217 - 142

"To find a function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the method of least squares regression. By fitting a linear equation to the data points, we can approximate the relationship.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can form a system of equations:

5^0 + 5^1 = 76             --> Equation 2
3^0 + 3^1 = 48             --> Equation 3
8^0 + 8^1 = 118            --> Equation 4
13^0 + 13^1 = 188          --> Equation 5

Simplifying the equations, we get:

1 - 1 = -8
1 + 5 = 76
1 + 3 = 48
1 + 8 = 118
1 + 13 = 188

"Based on the given data, let's try to find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Looking at the pattern in the inputs and outputs, it appears that the output value is approximately -15 times the input value squared.

Since the coefficient in front of x^1 is zero for all the data points, we can assume that the relationship is captured by the equation:

Output: y = -15x^2

Using this equation, we can calculate the outputs for the given inputs:

-17 -> y = -15 * (-17)^2 = -15 * 289 = -4335
-6 -> y = -15 * (-6)^2 = -15 * 36 = -540
-16 -> y = -15 * (-16)^2 = -15 * 256 = -3840
-18 -> y = -15 * (-18)^2 = -15 * 324 = -4860

"The given data points can be represented by a quadratic function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1. To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given input/output pairs into the equation and solve the resulting system of linear equations.

Substituting the points (-17, -292) and (-6, -105) into the equation, we get:
-292 = a + (-17)b       --(1)
-105 = a + (-6)b         --(2)

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:
-292 - (-105) = (a + (-17)b) - (a + (-6)b)
-187 = -17b + 6b
-187 = -11b

Solving for b, we get:
b = -187 / -11
b = 17

Substituting the value of b back into equation (2) to find a, we get:
-105 = a + (-6)(17)
-105 = a - 102
a = -105 + 102

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, the relationship can be approximated as follows:

Output = -20^0 * a + (-20)^1 * b = a - 20b = 265
Output = -15^0 * a + (-15)^1 * b = a - 15b = 195
Output = -5^0 * a + (-5)^1 * b = a - 5b = 55
Output = -10^0 * a + (-10)^1 * b = a - 10b = 125
Output = 6^0 * a + 6^1 * b = a + 6b = -99

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of 'a' and 'b':

From equation 1: a - 20b = 265
From equation 2: a - 15b = 195

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1, we get:

"To come up with a function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's look for a pattern in the data. 

By inspecting the data, we notice that the output values seem to decrease as the input values increase. Additionally, as the input values get closer to 0, the output values become smaller in magnitude. 

Based on these observations, we can write the function as follows:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

In this case, since we notice a decreasing relationship between input and output, let's assume that b < 0. 

Now let's try to calculate the values of a and b by using the provided data:

When input is -20, the output is 265:
265 = a - 20b

When input is -15, the output is 195:
195 = a - 15b

When input is -5, the output is 55:
55 = a - 5b

When input is -10, the output is 125:
125 = a - 10b

When input is 6, the output is -99:
-99 = a + 6b

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

Subtracting the equation for the input -10 from the equation for the input -15, we have:

195 - 125 = -15b + 10b
70 = -5b
b = -14

Now we can substitute b = -14 into one of the equations to solve for a.

55 = a - 5(-14)
55 = a + 70
a = -15

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

We can set up the following system of equations:

195 = a + b(-15)^1
55 = a + b(-5)^1
125 = a + b(-10)^1

Let's consider the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since x^0 = 1, we can simplify the equation to y = a + bx.

Let's plug in the values from the given data:

When input is -10 and output is -54:
-54 = a + b(-10)

When input is 4 and output is 2:
2 = a + b(4)

When input is -20 and output is -94:
-94 = a + b(-20)

When input is 4 and output is 2:
2 = a + b(4)

When input is -4 and output is -30:
-30 = a + b(-4)

By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b, which will give us the explicit representation of the function:

2 = a + 4b           (4)
-30 = a - 4b         (5)

From equations (2) and (4), we can deduce that a + 4b = 2. Therefore, the value of a must be 2 - 4b.

Substituting this value of a into equations (1), (3), and (5), we get:

-54 = (2 - 4b) - 10b
-94 = (2 - 4b) - 20b
-30 = (2 - 4b) - 4b

Simplifying these equations will give us values for b:

To come up with a more suitable function, we can examine the pattern in the data:

When the input (x) is -16, the output (y) is 109.

"Based on the given data, we can see that the relationship between the inputs and outputs cannot be accurately represented by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Instead, let's try to find a pattern that could describe the relationship. By examining the data, we can see that the output values are not directly related to the inputs. However, if we look at the differences between consecutive inputs and outputs, we can observe the following:

Input: -3, Output: 18
Difference: 18 - (-3) = 21

Input: 2, Output: -17
Difference: -17 - 2 = -19

Input: 5, Output: -38
Difference: -38 - 5 = -43

Input: 12, Output: -87
Difference: -87 - 12 = -99

Based on these differences, we can see that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a function that involves taking the difference between the input and a constant value, and then multiplying it by a factor.

Let's define the function as follows:

Output: y = k * (x - c)

Where:
y = Output
x = Input
k = Factor
c = Constant value

We can determine the values of k and c by using any two points from the given data. Let's choose the first set of points (-3, 18) and (-16, 109):

18 = k * (-3 - c)   ⇒   -3k - kc = 18    (Equation 1)
109 = k * (-16 - c)   ⇒   -16k - kc = 109    (Equation 2)

By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of k and c.

From Equation 1, we can rewrite it as -kc = 3k - 18. If we divide both sides by k (assuming k ≠ 0), we get:
-c = 3 - (18 / k)   (Equation 3)

Similarly, from Equation 2, we can rewrite it as -kc = 16k - 109. If we divide both sides by k (assuming k ≠ 0), we get:
-c = 16 - (109 / k)   (Equation 4)

Equating Equations 3 and 4, we have:
3 - (18 / k) = 16 - (109 / k)

Simplifying this equation, we get:
18 / k = 13

Solving for k, we find:
k = 18 / 13 = 1.3846 (approx.)

Substituting this value of k back into Equation 3, we can solve for c:
-c = 3 - (18 / 1.3846)
-c = 3 - 13
-c = -10

Thus, c = 10

When the input is 12 (x = 12), the output is -87 (y = -87):

"To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's examine the pattern in the data.

From the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the relationship is not linear. Instead, it appears to be quadratic or even higher-degree polynomial.

Let's denote the input as x and the output as y. By observing the patterns, we can write the function in the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2 + dx^3 + ...

However, since we are asked to write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to simplify it.

By considering the given data points, we observe that adding higher-degree terms does not significantly improve the accuracy of the function. So, we can assume that the relationship is captured well by a linear function, neglecting higher-degree terms.

Therefore, our function in the requested form is:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Now, let's find the values of a and b to complete the function.

For the given input-output pairs, we have:

Input: -9, Output: 162
162 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
162 = a - 9b          (equation 1)

Input: 17, Output: -254
-254 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
-254 = a + 17b         (equation 2)

Now, we need to solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying equation 1 by 17 and equation 2 by 9, we get:

2734 = 17a - 153b
-2286 = 9a + 153b

Adding these equations together, we obtain:

4474 = 26a
a = 4474/26 = 172

Substituting the value of a in equation 1, we find:

162 = 172 - 9b
-10 = -9b
b = -10/(-9) = 10/9

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 172x^0 + (10/9)x^1

Simplifying:

y = 172 + (10/9)x",-5.904550918828572,"[-16, 18]"

"Based on the given input-output pairs, we can see that the output values are related to the corresponding input values in a linear fashion. Therefore, the function that captures this relationship can be written as follows:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Substituting the given input-output pairs into this equation, we can find the values of a and b:

For the first pair (-9, 162):

162 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
162 = a + (-9b)

For the second pair (17, -254):

-254 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
-254 = a + 17b

For the third pair (-4, 82):

82 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
82 = a + (-4b)

For the fourth pair (-18, 306):

306 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
306 = a + (-18b)

For the fifth pair (-14, 242):

242 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1
242 = a + (-14b)

We now have a system of five equations with two variables (a and b), which can be solved to find their values. However, since the equations are linear, we can simplify the system by eliminating one variable. Subtracting the fourth equation from the fifth equation:

242 - 306 = a + (-14b) - (a + (-18b))
-64 = 4b
b = -16

Substituting b = -16 into the fourth equation:

306 = a + (-18)(-16)
306 = a + 288
18 = a

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

"To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of a and b that best fit the given data points.

Using linear regression, we can solve for the coefficients a and b that minimize the squared differences between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs.

The general equation for linear regression in this form is:

y = a + bx

To find the exact coefficients a and b, we can use the least squares method. We have the following data points:

(-9, 162)
(17, -254)
(-4, 82)
(-18, 306)

Using the least squares method, we can calculate the coefficients as follows:

Let N be the number of data points (N = 5 in this case)
Let Σx be the sum of all the input values (-9 + 17 - 4 - 18 - 14 = -28)
Let Σy be the sum of all the output values (162 - 254 + 82 + 306 + 242 = 538)
Let Σxy be the sum of the product of each input and output value (-9 * 162 + 17 * -254 + -4 * 82 + -18 * 306 + -14 * 242 = -10178)
Let Σx^2 be the sum of the squares of each input value (-9^2 + 17^2 + -4^2 + -18^2 + -14^2 = 714)

We can use these values in the following formulas to calculate the coefficients:

b = (N * Σxy - Σx * Σy) / (N * Σx^2 - Σx^2)
a = (Σy - b * Σx) / N

Plugging in the values, we have:

b = (5 * -10178 - (-28) * 538) / (5 * 714 - 28^2)
a = (538 - b * -28) / 5

Simplifying these equations, we find:

"Based on the given input-output pairs, the general form of the function appears to be quadratic. Let's write it in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

To determine the values of a, b, and c, we can use the given input-output pairs.

Solving for the coefficients:

For the first input-output pair, x = 13 and y = 177. Substituting these values into the function, we get:

177 = a(13^0) + b(13^1) + c(13^2)
177 = a + 13b + 169c

For the second input-output pair, x = 14 and y = 191:

191 = a(14^0) + b(14^1) + c(14^2)
191 = a + 14b + 196c

For the third input-output pair, x = -8 and y = -117:

-117 = a(-8^0) + b(-8^1) + c(-8^2)
-117 = a - 8b + 64c

For the fourth input-output pair, x = 3 and y = 37:

37 = a(3^0) + b(3^1) + c(3^2)
37 = a + 3b + 9c

For the fifth input-output pair, x = 7 and y = 93:

93 = a(7^0) + b(7^1) + c(7^2)

"To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can assume that the relationship is a linear function. 

Let's denote the inputs as x and the outputs as y.

Given the inputs and outputs, we can create a system of equations:

For the first data point (x = 13, y = 177):
177 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)

For the second data point (x = 14, y = 191):

-117 = a - 8b
37 = a + 3b
93 = a + 7b

We can solve this system of equations using any numerical method, such as substitution or elimination. However, since there are more variables than equations, an exact solution may not be possible.

Alternatively, if we assume that the relationship is approximately linear, we can use the method of least squares to estimate the values of a and b. This method minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed outputs and the predicted outputs according to the function.
