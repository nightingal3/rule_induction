"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can see that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's denote the input as x and the output as y.

Using the given data points, we can create a system of equations:

For the first data point (-10, -213):
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1 = a - 10b

For the second data point (9, 167):
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1 = a + 9b

For the third data point (4, 67):
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1 = a + 4b

For the fourth data point (-3, -73):
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1 = a - 3b

For the fifth data point (20, 387):
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

By substituting the values of a and b back into the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can obtain the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs.

The calculated values of a and b are:
a = 50
b = -18

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
Output: y = 50x^0 - 18x^1
Simplified: y = 50 - 18x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx.

By using the given input-output pairs, we can find the values of a and b.

Using the first pair (-10, -213):
-213 = a + b*(-10)

Using the second pair (9, 167):
167 = a + b*9

Using the third pair (4, 67):
67 = a + b*4

Using the fourth pair (-3, -73):
-73 = a + b*(-3)

Using the fifth pair (20, 387):
387 = a + b*20

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

After solving the equations, we find that a = -53 and b = 20/11.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can see that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear and does not follow a simple power law. Hence, we cannot accurately capture the relationship using a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find a more appropriate function, let's analyze the differences between the given outputs.

- The difference between -213 and 167 is 380.
- The difference between 167 and 67 is -100.
- The difference between 67 and -73 is -140.
- The difference between -73 and 387 is 460.

Notice that the differences between consecutive outputs do not follow a constant pattern. This suggests that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is more complex than a simple polynomial.

Therefore, we cannot determine a specific function that accurately captures the given data without additional information or structure.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be modeled by a linear function. 

In the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, since any number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1, the function can be simplified to:

y = a + bx

To find the values of a and b, we can use two data points from the given examples.

Using the inputs -10 and -3, and their respective outputs -213 and -73, we can form the following equations:

-213 = a + (-10)b
-73 = a + (-3)b

Simplifying these equations, we get:

-213 = a - 10b    (Equation 1)
-73 = a - 3b       (Equation 2)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:

-213 + 73 = a - 10b - a + 3b
-140 = -7b
b = 20

Substituting b = 20 into Equation 2:

-73 = a - 3(20)
-73 = a - 60
a = -13

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a quadratic function. The general form of a quadratic function is y = ax^2 + bx + c. However, since the given function has a maximum of two variables (x^0 and x^1), we can simplify the function to y = bx + c. 

Let's calculate the values of b and c using the given data points:

For (Input: 0, Output: -3):

    The relationship between the inputs and outputs does not appear to follow a linear or quadratic pattern. To capture the data as accurately as possible, we can use a polynomial function of higher order, such as a cubic function.

Given the inputs and outputs, let's assume the cubic function takes the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2 + dx^3

Substituting the given data points into the function, we get the following equations:

Equation 1: 339 = a - 18b + 324c - 5832d
Equation 2: -3 = a + 0b + 0c + 0d

To solve these equations, we can use any method of linear equations, such as matrix inversion or Gaussian elimination. Once the values of a, b, c, and d are determined, we can write the explicit form of the function as:

    From the given input-output pairs, It can be observed that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be expressed as a quadratic equation. 

The equation can be written in the form: y = ax^2 + bx + c

To find the values of a, b, and c, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve for the coefficients.

Using the three input-output pairs (-18, 339), (0, -3), and (5, -98), we can create a system of three equations:

1) 339 = a(-18)^2 + b(-18) + c
2) -3 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c
3) -98 = a(5)^2 + b(5) + c

Simplifying the equations gives:

1) 339 = 324a - 18b + c
2) -3 = c
3) -98 = 25a + 5b + c

Substituting -3 for c in equations 1 and 3, we get:

1) 339 = 324a - 18b - 3
3) -98 = 25a + 5b - 3

Simplifying further gives:

1) 342 = 324a - 18b
3) -95 = 25a + 5b

Multiplying equation 3 by 6, we can eliminate b:

18) -570 = 150a + 30b

Adding equation 18 to equation 1 eliminates b as well:

360 = 474a

Solving for a gives:

a = 360/474 = 0.757

Substituting a = 0.757 into equation 3 and solving for b gives:

-95 = 0.757(25) + 5b
-95 = 18.925 + 5b
-113.925 = 5b
b = -22.785

Substituting a = 0.757 and b = -22.785 into equation 2 gives:

-3 = 0(0)^2 - 22.785(0) - 3
-3 = -3

We have successfully solved for the coefficients a, b, and c. Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can try to find a pattern that represents the relationship between them. From the given data, it seems that the output is derived from the input through a quadratic function.

To represent this relationship in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can rewrite it as y = a + bx.

54 = a + (-12)b   ---(5)

From equation (1):
a = -31 - 5b

Substituting this value of a in equations (2), (3), (4), and (5) we have:
-51 = (-31 - 5b) + 9b
49 = (-31 - 5b) + (-11)b
14 = (-31 - 5b) + (-4)b
54 = (-31 - 5b) + (-12)b

Simplifying each equation further:
-51 = -31 + 4b
49 = -31 - 16b
14 = -31 - 11b
54 = -31 - 17b

Rearranging these equations:
4b = -51 + 31
-16b = 49 + 31
-11b = 14 + 31
-17b = 54 + 31

For the third pair of input-output values (5, -74), the equation becomes:
-74 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-74 = a + 5b

For the fourth pair of input-output values (3, -50), the equation becomes:

-50 = a + 3b

For the fifth pair of input-output values (-6, 58), the equation becomes:

    The pattern in the given data suggests a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. Therefore, the function can be written as:

For input -13 and output -197:

-197 = a - 13b

-155 = a - 10b

For input 7 and output 83:
83 = a * 7^0 + b * 7^1
83 = a + 7b

Solving the system of equations, we can find the values of a and b. However, since the equation is linear, we can also use any two data points to find the values of a and b.

Using the data points (-13, -197) and (7, 83), we can solve for a and b:

-197 = a - 13b   (Equation 1)
83 = a + 7b      (Equation 2)

Multiplying Equation 2 by 13 and adding it to Equation 1:

(-197) * 13 + 83 * 13 = a * 13 - 13b + a + 7b
-197 * 13 + 83 * 13 = 14a - 6b

Simplifying:

-2561 + 1079 = 14a - 6b
-1482 = 14a - 6b

Rearranging:

14a - 6b = -1482

Dividing the equation by 2:

7a - 3b = -741

Now we have two equations:

7a - 3b = -741   (Equation 3)
-197 = a - 13b   (Equation 4)

Using these equations, we can find the values of a and b.

Solving Equation 3 for a:

7a = -741 + 3b
a = (-741 + 3b)/7

Substituting this value of a in Equation 4:

-197 = (-741 + 3b)/7 - 13b
-197 = (-741 + 3b - 91b)/7
-1381 = -638b + 3b^2
3b^2 - 638b - 1381 = 0

Solving this quadratic equation, we find two possible values for b:

b = -8.437 or b = 56.571

Substituting these values of b into Equation 3, we can find the corresponding values of a:

a = (-741 + 3*(-8.437))/7 = -106.029
a = (-741 + 3*(56.571))/7 = 58.286

Therefore, the function capturing the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

-197 = a(-13)^0 + b(-13)^1

-197 = a - 13b

-169 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1

-169 = a - 11b

Adding the fourth and fifth equations, we get:

Adding Equation 1 and Equation 3, we get:

Simplifying Equation 4, we find:

Plugging the value of a into Equation 1, we have:

Based on the provided data, a possible function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs could be:

- When x = 7, y = -145
- When x = -10, y = 161
- When x = 9, y = -181
- When x = -20, y = 341

Looking at the pattern of the outputs, it seems that the (-1)^x component contributes to the alternating sign of the outputs. To capture this, we can take (-1) raised to the power of x.

The 4x component seems to vary linearly with respect to the inputs. So, we can include a term of bx^1 to capture this variation.

Adding these two components together, we get:

y = (-1)^x + 4x

    The given data points exhibit a relationship that does not follow a simple linear pattern. However, they seem to follow an exponential curve. Therefore, a better equation to capture this relationship could be a quadratic equation of the form:

    Based on the given data points, it seems that the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) can be represented by a quadratic function in the following form:

Output (y) = a + bx

where the coefficients a and b are yet to be determined.

To find the values of a and b, we can plug in the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve the resulting system of equations.

For the first data point (-2, 17):
17 = a + b(-2)

Simplifying the equation:
17 = a - 2b  ... Equation (1)

For the second data point (7, -145):
-145 = a + b(7)

Simplifying the equation:
-145 = a + 7b  ... Equation (2)

To solve this system of equations, we can use various methods such as substitution or elimination. Let's use the substitution method.

From Equation (1), we can rearrange it to solve for 'a':
a = 17 + 2b

Now, substitute this value of 'a' into Equation (2):
-145 = (17 + 2b) + 7b

Simplifying the equation:
-145 = 17 + 9b

Rearrange the equation:
9b = -145 - 17
9b = -162
b = -162/9
b = -18

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into Equation (1) to find 'a':
17 = a - 2(-18)
17 = a + 36
a = 17 - 36
a = -19

For the first data point (20, -307):
-307 = a(20^0) + b(20^1)
-307 = a + 20b   -- Equation 1

To solve this system of equations, we can use matrix algebra or substitution. Let's solve it using substitution:

From Equation 2, we can express a in terms of b: a = 8 + b
Substitute a = 8 + b into Equations 1, 3, 4, and 5.

-307 = (8 + b) + 20b       -- Equation 1
-307 = 8 + 21b

b = -15

From Equation 2, we can substitute b = -15 to find a:

-96 -> y = -96
12  -> y = 12

Now we can substitute the values into the function and solve for the coefficients a and b.

Substituting for the first input and output:
-66 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
-66 = a(1) + b(13)
-66 = a + 13b  [Equation 1]

Substituting for the third input and output:
-96 = a(18^0) + b(18^1)
-96 = a(1) + b(18)

-325 = a - 17b

Using the second data point (-5, -109):

-109 = a - 5b

Now we have two equations with two unknowns (a and b), which we can solve simultaneously.

Rearranging the first equation, we get:
a = 325 + 17b

Substituting this expression for a in the second equation:
-109 = (325 + 17b) - 5b
-109 = 325 + 12b
12b = -434
b = -434/12
b = -36.16666667 (approximately)

To write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify it as y = a + bx.

We can use any two pairs to solve for the values of a and b. Let's solve for a and b using the first and third pairs:

Using Input: -17, Output: -325:
-325 = a + (-17)b

Using Input: 16, Output: 269:
269 = a + (16)b

Now, we have a system of equations:

1) -325 = a - 17b
2) 269 = a + 16b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying equation 1) by 16:
-5200 = 16a - 272b

We can now subtract equation 2) from this new equation:
-5200 - 269 = 16a - 272b - a - 16b
-5470 = 15a - 288b

Simplifying further, we get:
15a - 288b = -5470

Dividing both sides by 3:
5a - 96b = -1823

If we let a = 5c and b = -96d, we can simplify the equation as:
c - 19d = -365

Now, let's substitute the values of a and b back into one of the original equations. Let's use equation 1):

-325 = a - 17b
-325 = 5c - 17(-96d)
-325 = 5c + 1632d

If we let c = e + 1 and d = f + 4, we can rewrite the equation as:
-325 = 5(e + 1) + 1632(f + 4)
-325 = 5e + 5 + 1632f + 6528
-325 = 5e + 1632f + 6533

Now, we have the equations:
c - 19d = -365
-325 = 5e + 1632f + 6533

By substituting the values of c and d back to their original variables:
a = 5c = 5(e + 1) = 5e + 5

From the given data, we can observe the following relationships:

For x = 10, y = 142:
142 = a(10^0) + b(10^1)
142 = a + 10b  ---- Equation 1

For x = 15, y = 217:
217 = a(15^0) + b(15^1)
217 = a + 15b  ---- Equation 2

For x = -10, y = -158:
-158 = a((-10)^0) + b((-10)^1)
-158 = a - 10b  ---- Equation 3

For x = -4, y = -68:
-68 = a((-4)^0) + b((-4)^1)
-68 = a - 4b  ---- Equation 4

For x = 13, y = 187:
187 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
187 = a + 13b  ---- Equation 5

To find the values of 'a' and 'b', we can solve these equations simultaneously.

By solving the system of equations (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5), we can find 'a' and 'b'.

Let's solve these equations:

From Equation 1 and Equation 2:
a + 10b = 142 ---- Equation A
a + 15b = 217 ---- Equation B

By subtracting Equation A from Equation B:
a + 15b - a - 10b = 217 - 142
5b = 75

Simplifying, we find:
b = 15

Substituting the value of 'b' into Equation 1:
a + 10(15) = 142
a + 150 = 142
a = -8

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -8x^0 + 15x^1
Or simplified:
Output: y = -8 + 15x

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we will use the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

By substituting the given input and output pairs into the equation, we can solve for the values of a and b.

Using the given input and output pairs:

(10, 142) : 142 = a(10)^0 + b(10)^1

(-10, -158) : -158 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
                    -158 = a - 10b           ----(3)

              187 = a + 13b              ----(5)

Equation (1) - Equation (3):
142 - (-158) = (a + 10b) - (a - 10b)
          142 + 158 = 20b
                 300 = 20b
                  b = 300/20
                  b = 15

Substituting b = 15 into Equation (1):
142 = a + 10(15)
142 = a + 150
      a = 142 - 150
         a = -8

The final equation is y = -8x^0 + 15x^1, which simplifies to:

From these equations, we can solve for a and b using any method of solving systems of equations. Solving this system, we find a = 6 and b = 2.

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's first look for a pattern in the data.

The outputs seem to increase as the inputs increase, and the increase doesn't seem to be linear. Let's calculate the differences between consecutive outputs:

Diff1 = 76 - (-8) = 84
Diff2 = 48 - 76 = -28
Diff3 = 118 - 48 = 70
Diff4 = 188 - 118 = 70

We can see that the differences between consecutive outputs are not constant and do not seem to follow a simple pattern. Therefore, it is unlikely that the function can be expressed in a simple form like y = ax^0 + bx^1.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can fit a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since x^0 = 1 for all values of x, we can simplify the equation to y = a + bx.

By looking at the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear, and therefore a simple linear equation may not capture it accurately. However, we can still approximate the relationship using a linear equation.

To find the coefficients a and b, we can use the method of least squares. We need to find the line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can form the following equations:

-8 = a - b  (for input -1 and output -8)

By substituting the given values, we have:

For the first pair (Input: -14, Output: -97):
-97 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1
-97 = a + (-14)b

For the second pair (Input: 7, Output: 50):

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the coefficients a and b, we can use the given data points:

1. (-14, -97)
2. (7, 50)
3. (2, 15)

For each data point, we can substitute the input value (x) and output value (y) into the equation to form a system of linear equations:

1. -97 = a(1) + b(-14)
2. 50 = a(1) + b(7)
3. 15 = a(1) + b(2)

Simplifying these equations, we have:

1. -14a - b = -97
2. 7a + b = 50
3. 2a + b = 15

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b that best describe the relationship:

Adding equations 2 and 3, we get:

(7a + b) + (2a + b) = 50 + 15
9a + 2b = 65   --> Equation 4

a = 129/19   ≈ 6.789

Plugging the value of a back into equation 1, we get:

b = -97 + 1836/19   ≈ 5.579

By solving these two equations, we can find the values of a and b:

265 = a + b(-20)^1
195 = a + b(-15)^1
55 = a + b(-5)^1
125 = a + b(-10)^1
-99 = a + b(6)^1

Simplifying these equations, we get:

195 = a - 15b
55 = a - 5b

Rearranging these equations, we get:

a = 265 - 280
a = -15

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can determine that the relationship between the input and output is not linear. 

Since the function is in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 represents the constant term and x^1 represents the linear term, we can rewrite it as y = a*1 + bx. 

By substituting the given coordinates into the equation, we can solve for the values of a and b.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

In this case, the data suggests that the dependent variable (output) is being determined by the independent variable (input) raised to the power of 1 (x^1). Therefore, our equation becomes:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Simplifying the equation:

Output: y = a + bx

Now, we can substitute the given data points into the equation to solve for the values of a and b.

Using the first data point (-20, 265):

265 = a + b(-20)

Using the second data point (-15, 195):

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To come up with a function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's look for a pattern in the data. 

By inspecting the data, we notice that the output values seem to decrease as the input values increase. Additionally, as the input values get closer to 0, the output values become smaller in magnitude. 

Based on these observations, we can write the function as follows:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

In this case, since we notice a decreasing relationship between input and output, let's assume that b < 0. 

Now let's try to calculate the values of a and b by using the provided data:

When input is -20, the output is 265:
265 = a - 20b

When input is -15, the output is 195:
195 = a - 15b

When input is -5, the output is 55:
55 = a - 5b

When input is -10, the output is 125:
125 = a - 10b

When input is 6, the output is -99:
-99 = a + 6b

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

Subtracting the equation for the input -10 from the equation for the input -15, we have:

195 - 125 = -15b + 10b
70 = -5b
b = -14

Now we can substitute b = -14 into one of the equations to solve for a.

55 = a - 5(-14)
55 = a + 70
a = -15

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems like the function is describing a linear relationship between the input and output values. 

Let's consider the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since x^0 = 1, we can simplify the equation to y = a + bx.

Let's plug in the values from the given data:

When input is -10 and output is -54:
-54 = a + b(-10)

When input is 4 and output is 2:
2 = a + b(4)

When input is -20 and output is -94:
-94 = a + b(-20)

When input is 4 and output is 2:
2 = a + b(4)

When input is -4 and output is -30:
-30 = a + b(-4)

By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b, which will give us the explicit representation of the function:

-54 = a - 10b        (1)
2 = a + 4b            (2)
-94 = a - 20b        (3)
2 = a + 4b           (4)
-30 = a - 4b         (5)

From equations (2) and (4), we can deduce that a + 4b = 2. Therefore, the value of a must be 2 - 4b.

Substituting this value of a into equations (1), (3), and (5), we get:

-54 = (2 - 4b) - 10b
-94 = (2 - 4b) - 20b
-30 = (2 - 4b) - 4b

Simplifying these equations will give us values for b:

-54 = 2 - 14b
-94 = 2 - 24b
-30 = 2 - 8b

Solving these equations will give us b = 4, a = -14.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs follows a linear pattern. We can express this relationship using the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, where a and b are constants.

To find the values of a and b, we can use any two input-output pairs. Let's choose the first and fourth pairs (-11, -20) and (-7, -12) respectively.

Using (-11, -20):
-20 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
-20 = a + (-11)b

Using (-7, -12):
-12 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7)^1
-12 = a + (-7)b

From these two equations, we can solve for a and b. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we obtain:

-20 - (-12) = (a + (-11)b) - (a + (-7)b)
-8 = 4b

Simplifying, we get:

b = -2

Substituting this value of b into the second equation gives us:

Let's denote the input as x and the output as y.

From the given pairs, we can form the following equations:

For the first pair (-17, -310):
-310 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1
-310 = a - 17b

For the second pair (17, 302):

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the pattern can be captured by a quadratic equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

To find the coefficients a and b, we can use the values of two points on the curve. Let's choose the first and second pairs of inputs and outputs:

First pair:
Input: -16
Output: 297

Second pair:
Input: 18
Output: -315

Now, let's substitute these values into the quadratic equation:

297 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1

-315 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1

Simplifying the equations:

297 = a + (-16)b

-315 = a + 18b

We have a system of two equations with two unknowns. By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

Adding the equations:

297 - 315 = a - a + (-16 + 18)b

-18 = 2b

Dividing by 2:
-9 = b

Substituting the value of b in one of the original equations:

297 = a + (-16)(-9)

297 = a + 144

Subtracting 144 from both sides:
a = 153

Using the first input-output pair (-18, -265), we have:

-15 = a + b

For the second data point (-5, -35):
-35 = a*(-5)^0 + b*(-5)^1
-35 = a - 5b

Simplifying both equations, we get:
a + b = -15                    ---(Equation 1)
a - 5b = -35                   ---(Equation 2)

To find the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to solve this system of equations.

Multiplying Equation 1 by 5, we get:
5a + 5b = -75                   ---(Equation 3)

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 3, we have:

Solving Equation 5 and Equation 1 simultaneously, we have:

2a + 5b = -20                   ---(Equation 5)

Multiplying Equation 1 by 2 and subtracting it from Equation 5, we get:

2a + 5b - 2a - 2b = -20 + 30

a = -45/3 - 10/3
a = -55/3

By substituting the given inputs and outputs into the general form equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can construct a system of equations:

59 = a + 2b
-301 = a - 16b
-81 = a - 5b
79 = a + 3b
-21 = a - 2b

Simplifying the equations:

a + 2b = 59
a - 16b = -301
a - 5b = -81
a + 3b = 79
a - 2b = -21

Next, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

By solving the equations, we get:
a = -16
b = 39

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -16x^0 + 39x^1

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    From the given data points, we can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear. Therefore, we will need to use a polynomial function to capture the pattern.

Let's assume the function that describes the data is y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2.

Using the given data points, we can form a system of equations:

1) When x = 2, y = 59:
59 = a(2^0) + b(2^1) + c(2^2)
59 = a + 2b + 4c

2) When x = -16, y = -301:
-301 = a(-16^0) + b(-16^1) + c(-16^2)
-301 = a - 16b + 256c

3) When x = -5, y = -81:
-81 = a(-5^0) + b(-5^1) + c(-5^2)
-81 = a - 5b + 25c

4) When x = 3, y = 79:
79 = a(3^0) + b(3^1) + c(3^2)
79 = a + 3b + 9c

5) When x = -2, y = -21:
-21 = a(-2^0) + b(-2^1) + c(-2^2)
-21 = a - 2b + 4c

Solving this system of equations will allow us to determine the constants a, b, and c, and ultimately express the function in the desired form.

Solving this system of equations using a matrix approach, we find:

a = -6
b = -3
c = 8

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = -6x^0 - 3x^1 + 8x^2

Input: 3    Output: 79
Input: -2   Output: -21

Looking at the outputs, it seems like there is a linear relationship with the inputs. Let's apply linear regression to find the coefficients of the linear function.

Using the formula y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can rewrite it as y = b + ax.

Using the given data points, we can set up a system of equations:

59 = b + 2a
-301 = b - 16a
-81 = b - 5a
79 = b + 3a
-21 = b - 2a

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b, which will be used to define the function:

Given the inputs and outputs, we can solve for the values of a and b. Let's use the first two data points (-11, 72) and (-3, 8) to find the values of a and b.

When x = -11, y = 72:

    Looking at the given inputs and outputs, we can conclude that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear. A linear relationship would be represented by a function of the form y = ax + b, where x is the input and y is the output.

To capture the non-linear relationship, let's consider a quadratic function instead. We can represent the relationship as a quadratic equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2.

Using the given input-output pairs, we can set up the following equations:

9 = a + b + c
-55 = 20a - 55b + 400c
-7 = -4a - 7b + 16c
5 = -10a + 5b + 100c
-31 = 8a - 31b + 64c

Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of a, b, and c, and we can then write the function explicitly.

After solving the equations, we find that a = -4, b = -3, and c = 2.

When Input = -16, Output = 82:

82 = a + (-16b)

When Input = -11, Output = 52:

When Input = 14, Output = -98:

-98 = a + 14b

When Input = -18, Output = 94:
94 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
94 = a + (-18b)

When Input = 3, Output = -32:
-32 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1
-32 = a + 3b

a - 11b = 52
a + 14b = -98
a - 18b = 94

    Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the function can be captured by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. However, since the coefficient for x^0 is always 1, we can simplify the equation to y = 1 + bx.

The given input-output pairs can be represented as:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems like a linear function will best capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs. The general form of a linear function is y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.

By considering the coordinates (-16, 109) and calculating the slope, we can determine the value of b. Similarly, by considering the coordinates (-3, 18), we can determine the value of c. The equation will take the form y = bx + c.

Calculating the slope:
m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
m = (109 - 18) / (-16 - (-3))
m = 91 / -13
m = -7

Calculating the y-intercept:
c = y - mx
c = 18 - (-7) * (-3)
c = 18 - 21
c = -3

    After analyzing the given data, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a quadratic function. Thus, the function can be written in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

To determine the values of a and b, let's substitute the inputs and outputs from the given data points.

When the input is -16 (x = -16), the output is 109 (y = 109):
109 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
109 = a - 16b

When the input is -3 (x = -3), the output is 18 (y = 18):
18 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
18 = a - 3b

When the input is 2 (x = 2), the output is -17 (y = -17):
-17 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1
-17 = a + 2b

When the input is 12 (x = 12), the output is -87 (y = -87):
-87 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1
-87 = a + 12b

When the input is 5 (x = 5), the output is -38 (y = -38):
-38 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-38 = a + 5b

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

From the equation 109 = a - 16b, we can rearrange it as a = 109 + 16b.

Substituting this value of a into the equation 18 = a - 3b, we have:
18 = (109 + 16b) - 3b
18 = 109 + 13b
13b = 18 - 109
13b = -91
b = -7

Substituting the value of b into the equation a = 109 + 16b, we have:
a = 109 + 16(-7)
a = 109 - 112
a = -3

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    After examining the given input-output pairs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

To find the coefficients a and b, we can use the given data points to form a system of equations. Let's plug in the given input-output pairs into the equation:

For the input -16 (x = -16) and output 109:
109 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
109 = a + (-16b)                     .....(1)

For the input -3 (x = -3) and output 18:
18 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
18 = a + (-3b)                         .....(2)

For the input 2 (x = 2) and output -17:
-17 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1
-17 = a + (2b)                           .....(3)

For the input 12 (x = 12) and output -87:
-87 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1
-87 = a + (12b)                          .....(4)

For the input 5 (x = 5) and output -38:
-38 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-38 = a + (5b)                           .....(5)

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Solving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously, we get:
a = 131
b = -12

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 131x^0 - 12x^1

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's examine the pattern in the data.

From the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the relationship is not linear. Instead, it appears to be quadratic or even higher-degree polynomial.

Let's denote the input as x and the output as y. By observing the patterns, we can write the function in the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2 + dx^3 + ...

However, since we are asked to write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to simplify it.

By considering the given data points, we observe that adding higher-degree terms does not significantly improve the accuracy of the function. So, we can assume that the relationship is captured well by a linear function, neglecting higher-degree terms.

Therefore, our function in the requested form is:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Now, let's find the values of a and b to complete the function.

For the given input-output pairs, we have:

Input: -9, Output: 162
162 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
162 = a - 9b          (equation 1)

Input: 17, Output: -254
-254 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
-254 = a + 17b         (equation 2)

Now, we need to solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying equation 1 by 17 and equation 2 by 9, we get:

2734 = 17a - 153b
-2286 = 9a + 153b

Adding these equations together, we obtain:

4474 = 26a
a = 4474/26 = 172

Substituting the value of a in equation 1, we find:

162 = 172 - 9b
-10 = -9b
b = -10/(-9) = 10/9

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 172x^0 + (10/9)x^1

Simplifying:

y = 172 + (10/9)x

    Based on the given input-output pairs, we can see that the output values are related to the corresponding input values in a linear fashion. Therefore, the function that captures this relationship can be written as follows:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Substituting the given input-output pairs into this equation, we can find the values of a and b:

For the first pair (-9, 162):

162 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
162 = a + (-9b)

For the second pair (17, -254):

-254 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
-254 = a + 17b

For the third pair (-4, 82):

82 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
82 = a + (-4b)

For the fourth pair (-18, 306):

306 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
306 = a + (-18b)

For the fifth pair (-14, 242):

242 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1
242 = a + (-14b)

We now have a system of five equations with two variables (a and b), which can be solved to find their values. However, since the equations are linear, we can simplify the system by eliminating one variable. Subtracting the fourth equation from the fifth equation:

242 - 306 = a + (-14b) - (a + (-18b))
-64 = 4b
b = -16

Substituting b = -16 into the fourth equation:

306 = a + (-18)(-16)
306 = a + 288
18 = a

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of a and b that best fit the given data points.

Using linear regression, we can solve for the coefficients a and b that minimize the squared differences between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs.

The general equation for linear regression in this form is:

y = a + bx

To find the exact coefficients a and b, we can use the least squares method. We have the following data points:

(-9, 162)
(17, -254)
(-4, 82)
(-18, 306)
(-14, 242)

Using the least squares method, we can calculate the coefficients as follows:

Let N be the number of data points (N = 5 in this case)
Let Σx be the sum of all the input values (-9 + 17 - 4 - 18 - 14 = -28)
Let Σy be the sum of all the output values (162 - 254 + 82 + 306 + 242 = 538)
Let Σxy be the sum of the product of each input and output value (-9 * 162 + 17 * -254 + -4 * 82 + -18 * 306 + -14 * 242 = -10178)
Let Σx^2 be the sum of the squares of each input value (-9^2 + 17^2 + -4^2 + -18^2 + -14^2 = 714)

We can use these values in the following formulas to calculate the coefficients:

b = (N * Σxy - Σx * Σy) / (N * Σx^2 - Σx^2)
a = (Σy - b * Σx) / N

Plugging in the values, we have:

b = (5 * -10178 - (-28) * 538) / (5 * 714 - 28^2)
a = (538 - b * -28) / 5

Simplifying these equations, we find:

b = -2
a = 30

So, let's write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2:

To find the values of a, b, and c, we can use three sets of input and output data points.

Subtracting (5) from (6), we get:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given input-output pairs, the general form of the function appears to be quadratic. Let's write it in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

To determine the values of a, b, and c, we can use the given input-output pairs.

Solving for the coefficients:

For the first input-output pair, x = 13 and y = 177. Substituting these values into the function, we get:

177 = a(13^0) + b(13^1) + c(13^2)
177 = a + 13b + 169c

For the second input-output pair, x = 14 and y = 191:

191 = a(14^0) + b(14^1) + c(14^2)
191 = a + 14b + 196c

For the third input-output pair, x = -8 and y = -117:

-117 = a(-8^0) + b(-8^1) + c(-8^2)
-117 = a - 8b + 64c

For the fourth input-output pair, x = 3 and y = 37:

37 = a(3^0) + b(3^1) + c(3^2)
37 = a + 3b + 9c

For the fifth input-output pair, x = 7 and y = 93:

93 = a(7^0) + b(7^1) + c(7^2)
93 = a + 7b + 49c

Now we have a system of five linear equations with three variables (a, b, c):

177 = a + 13b + 169c
191 = a + 14b + 196c
-117 = a - 8b + 64c
37 = a + 3b + 9c
93 = a + 7b + 49c

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a, b, and c, which will define the function that captures the given data.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Let's calculate the values of a and b using the given data:

For input 13, output 177:
177 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
177 = a + 13b

For input 14, output 191:
191 = a + 14b

For input -8, output -117:
-117 = a + (-8)b

For input 3, output 37:
37 = a + 3b

For input 7, output 93:
93 = a + 7b

We have a system of equations:

a + 13b = 177
a + 14b = 191
a - 8b = -117
a + 3b = 37
a + 7b = 93

Solving this system of equations, we find a = 15 and b = 12.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 15x^0 + 12x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can assume that the relationship is a linear function. 

Let's denote the inputs as x and the outputs as y.

Given the inputs and outputs, we can create a system of equations:

For the first data point (x = 13, y = 177):
177 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)

For the second data point (x = 14, y = 191):
191 = a(14^0) + b(14^1)

For the third data point (x = -8, y = -117):
-117 = a((-8)^0) + b((-8)^1)

For the fourth data point (x = 3, y = 37):
37 = a(3^0) + b(3^1)

For the fifth data point (x = 7, y = 93):
93 = a(7^0) + b(7^1)

Simplifying these equations:

177 = a + 13b
191 = a + 14b
-117 = a - 8b
37 = a + 3b
93 = a + 7b

We can solve this system of equations using any numerical method, such as substitution or elimination. However, since there are more variables than equations, an exact solution may not be possible.

Alternatively, if we assume that the relationship is approximately linear, we can use the method of least squares to estimate the values of a and b. This method minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed outputs and the predicted outputs according to the function.

Using the given values, we can calculate the estimates for a and b using a statistical software or programming language with linear regression capabilities.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: 13

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given data, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given data points. 

Considering the first data point (13, 177), we have:
177 = a * 13^0 + b * 13^1
Simplifying the above equation, we get: 
177 = a + 13b

Using a similar approach for the other data points, we can form a system of equations:

177 = a + 13b
191 = a + 14b
-117 = a + (-8b)
37 = a + 3b
93 = a + 7b

Solving this system of equations, we find a = -5 and b = 14.

Hence, the function y = -5x^0 + 14x^1 captures the given data.
