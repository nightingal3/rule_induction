"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the input and output can be described by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Considering the first example and solving for a, we have:

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

Considering the second example and solving for a, we have:

167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Considering the third example and solving for a, we have:

67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Considering the fourth example and solving for a, we have:

-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

Considering the fifth example and solving for a, we have:

387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Solving the system of equations above, we find that a = 25 and b = -4.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    After analyzing the given inputs and outputs, it can be observed that the relationship is not linear (with exponent 1). However, it seems to be a quadratic relationship (with exponent 0 for the constant term and exponent 1 for the linear term). 

Based on this observation, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Given that y = Output and x = Input, the equation becomes:

y = a + bx

Using the given input-output pairs, we can find the values of a and b through regression analysis:

-213 = a + (-10)b  (eq. 1)
167  = a + 9b     (eq. 2)
67   = a + 4b     (eq. 3)

    The given data points can be fit using a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. To find the values of coefficients a and b, we can create a system of linear equations using the given input-output pairs.

Using the coordinates (-10, -213):

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a -10b

Using the coordinates (9, 167):

167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Using the coordinates (4, 67):

67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Using the coordinates (20, 387):

    Let's call the input x and the output y. Based on the given data, we can assume that the function is a linear one. So, the function can be written as:

Output: y = a + bx

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given data points.

For the first data point (-10, -213):
-213 = a + b(-10)
-213 = a - 10b

For the second data point (9, 167):
167 = a + b(9)
167 = a + 9b

Solving these two equations simultaneously will give us the values of a and b.

Multiplying the first equation by 9 and the second equation by -10:

-9(213) = -9a + 90b
-10(167) = -10a - 90b

-1927 = -9a + 90b
-1670 = -10a - 90b

Adding the two equations together:

-3597 = -19a

Dividing by -19:

a = 189

Substituting the value of a into the second equation:

167 = 189 + 9b
-22 = 9b
b = -22/9

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is y = 189 - (22/9)x.

    After observing the data, it appears that the relationship between inputs and outputs can be captured using a linear function. The general form of a linear function is y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.

In this particular case, it seems that the y-intercept is not zero, so we will use the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where ax^0 represents the y-intercept and bx^1 represents the slope.

From the given data, we can find the values of a and b by substituting the input and output values.

By substituting (-10, -213) into the equation, we can solve for a:
-213 = a * (-10)^0 + b * (-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

By substituting (9, 167) into the equation, we can solve for b:
167 = a * (9)^0 + b * (9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Solving the system of equations results in a = 4 and b = -21.

    After analyzing the given data, it can be observed that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear, as the exponent values differ between the inputs. Therefore, a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 cannot accurately capture the relationship.

However, a quadratic function in the form of y = ax^2 + bx + c can be used to describe the relationship between the inputs and outputs more accurately. Let's try to find the coefficients for this quadratic function.

To find the coefficients, we can use the given input-output data points to create a system of equations. 

Using the first data point (-18, 339), we get:
339 = a(-18)^2 + b(-18) + c

Using the second data point (0, -3), we get:

58 = a(-6^0) + b(-6^1)
58 = a - 6b

Now we have a system of five equations and two unknowns (a and b). We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Solving the equations simultaneously, we find:

    The given data points do not follow a linear pattern, so it is not appropriate to model the relationship using the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1. Instead, it appears that there may be a quadratic relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Let's assume the function follows a quadratic form: y = ax^2 + bx + c.

To find the values of a, b, and c, we can use three out of the five given data points.

Using the point (7, -98):
-98 = a(7)^2 + b(7) + c               ... (1)

Using the point (17, -218):
-218 = a(17)^2 + b(17) + c            ... (2)

Using the point (5, -74):
-74 = a(5)^2 + b(5) + c               ... (3)

Solving equations (1), (2), and (3) simultaneously will give us the values of a, b, and c. After finding these values, we can write the equation y = ax^2 + bx + c.

58 = a - 6b     ...... (5)

Now, we can solve these equations to find the values of a and b.

Adding equations (1) and (2):
-98 + (-218) = a + a + 7b + 17b
-316 = 2a + 24b     ...... (6)

Adding equations (3) and (4):

Subtracting equation (6) from equation (7):

-155 = a + (-10)b

For the fifth pair (7, 83):

Simplifying the equations:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use a linear regression model. The linear regression model assumes that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be represented by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can solve for the coefficients a and b. Substituting the inputs and outputs into the equation, we get the following set of equations:

-307 = a(20^0) + b(20^1)
8 = a(-1^0) + b(-1^1)
-307 = a(20^0) + b(20^1)
-187 = a(12^0) + b(12^1)
-277 = a(18^0) + b(18^1)

y = a + bx

To determine the values of 'a' and 'b', we can use any two pairs of input and output values. Let's use the first two pairs to solve for 'a' and 'b':

For (input, output) = (20, -307):
-307 = a + (20)b

For (input, output) = (-1, 8):
8 = a - b

Now, we have a system of two equations and two unknowns. We can solve this system to find the values of 'a' and 'b'.

From the second equation, we can isolate 'a':
a = 8 + b

Substituting this value of 'a' into the first equation:
-307 = (8 + b) + (20)b

Simplifying:
-307 = 8 + 21b

Rearranging the equation:
21b = -315

    The given data does not follow a linear or exponential relationship. However, we can still try to find a best-fit line equation using the given inputs and outputs.

By observing the data points, it seems that the output values increase as the input values increase, but not at a constant rate. To capture this relationship, we can try a quadratic equation of the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

Let's substitute the given input and output values to solve for the coefficients a, b, and c:

When input = -1, output = -8:
-8 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1 + c(-1)^2
-8 = a - b + c

When input = 5, output = 76:
76 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1 + c(5)^2
76 = a + 5b + 25c

When input = 3, output = 48:
48 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1 + c(3)^2
48 = a + 3b + 9c

When input = 8, output = 118:
118 = a(8)^0 + b(8)^1 + c(8)^2
118 = a + 8b + 64c

When input = 13, output = 188:
188 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1 + c(13)^2
188 = a + 13b + 169c

Solving this system of equations will give us the coefficients:

From the first equation, we can solve for a:
a = -8 - (-b + c)
a = -8 + b - c

Substituting this value of a into the fourth equation:
118 = (-8 + b - c) + 8b + 64c
118 = -8 + 65b + 63c
126 = 65b + 63c

Similarly, substituting a into the third equation:
48 = (-8 + b - c) + 3b + 9c
48 = -8 + 4b + 8c
56 = 4b + 8c

And substituting a into the fifth equation:
188 = (-8 + b - c) + 13b + 169c
188 = -8 + 14b + 168c
196 = 14b + 168c

Now we have a system of three equations with two variables (b and c):

126 = 65b + 63c
56 = 4b + 8c
196 = 14b + 168c

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of b and c. Once we have the values of b and c, we can substitute them back into the first equation to find the value of a.

    Based on the given data points, we can observe that the output values are increasing as the input values increase. Therefore, a linear function seems appropriate to describe the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Let's assume the function as y = a + bx, where a and b are constants to be determined.

Using the given data points, we can form the following equations:

-8 = a + b(-1)   (from the first data point)
76 = a + b(5)    (from the second data point)

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the function can be described by a quadratic equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To determine the values of a and b, we can substitute the provided input-output pairs into the equation and solve for a and b.

Using the first input-output pair (-1, -8):
-8 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1
-8 = a - b

Using the second input-output pair (5, 76):
76 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
76 = a + 5b

Using the third input-output pair (3, 48):

48 = a + 3b

118 = a + 8b

Using the fifth input-output pair (13, 188):
188 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1
188 = a + 13b

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

From the first equation, we get:
a = -8 + b

Substituting this expression for a in the remaining equations:

76 = (-8 + b) + 5b
48 = (-8 + b) + 3b
118 = (-8 + b) + 8b
188 = (-8 + b) + 13b

Simplifying these equations:

76 = -8 + 6b
48 = -8 + 4b
118 = -8 + 9b
188 = -8 + 14b

Solving these equations, we find:
b = 4
a = -8 + b = -8 + 4 = -4

- For the second example, the output (76) can be obtained by multiplying the input (5) by 8 and adding 36. So, we have y = 8x + 36.

    Given the inputs and outputs, we can see that the relationship is not linear. Instead, it seems to have a quadratic relationship. The output values can be described by the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2.

To find the coefficients a, b, and c, we need to solve a system of equations using the given inputs and outputs:

For x = -20, y = 265:
265 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1 + c(-20)^2
265 = a + (-20)b + 400c

For x = -15, y = 195:
195 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)^1 + c(-15)^2
195 = a + (-15)b + 225c

For x = -5, y = 55:
55 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1 + c(-5)^2
55 = a + (-5)b + 25c

For x = -10, y = 125:
125 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1 + c(-10)^2
125 = a + (-10)b + 100c

For x = 6, y = -99:
-99 = a(6)^0 + b(6)^1 + c(6)^2

    The given data points can be represented by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Let's calculate the values of a and b using the given data:

Input: -20, Output: 265
265 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
265 = a - 20b

Input: -15, Output: 195
195 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)^1 
195 = a - 15b

Input: -5, Output: 55
55 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
55 = a - 5b

Input: -10, Output: 125
125 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
125 = a - 10b

Input: 6, Output: -99
-99 = a(6)^0 + b(6)^1
-99 = a + 6b

Now, we have a system of equations:

a - 20b = 265     (Equation 1)
a - 15b = 195     (Equation 2)
a - 5b = 55       (Equation 3)
a - 10b = 125     (Equation 4)
a + 6b = -99      (Equation 5)

To solve the system of equations, we can subtract Equation 3 from Equation 2 to find the value of b:
(a - 15b) - (a - 5b) = 195 - 55
-10b = 140
b = -14

Substituting the value of b back into Equation 3, we find the value of a:
a - 5(-14) = 55
a + 70 = 55
a = -15

Therefore, the function that best describes the relationship is:

Output: y = ax^2 + bx + c

By substituting the given values into the equation, we can solve for the coefficients.

Using the first two points (-20, 265) and (-15, 195):

265 = a(-20)^2 + b(-20) + c
195 = a(-15)^2 + b(-15) + c

This results in a system of two equations that can be solved simultaneously to find the coefficients a, b, and c.

Using the next two points (-5, 55) and (-10, 125):

55 = a(-5)^2 + b(-5) + c

    The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs can be written as follows:

Output: y = -4x^0 + 2x^1

Explanation:
In this function, the coefficient 'a' corresponds to the constant term and the coefficient 'b' corresponds to the coefficient of the linear term. 

For the given inputs and outputs:

1. When Input is -10, the Output is -54. Substituting these values into the function, we get:
-54 = -4(-10)^0 + 2(-10)^1
-54 = -4(1) + 2(-10)
-54 = -4 - 20
-54 = -24

2. When Input is 4, the Output is 2. Substituting these values into the function, we get:
2 = -4(4)^0 + 2(4)^1
2 = -4(1) + 2(4)
2 = -4 + 8
2 = 4

3. When Input is -20, the Output is -94. Substituting these values into the function, we get:
-94 = -4(-20)^0 + 2(-20)^1
-94 = -4(1) + 2(-20)
-94 = -4 - 40
-94 = -44

4. When Input is 4, the Output is 2 (again). Substituting these values into the function, we get:
2 = -4(4)^0 + 2(4)^1
2 = -4(1) + 2(4)
2 = -4 + 8
2 = 4

5. When Input is -4, the Output is -30. Substituting these values into the function, we get:
-30 = -4(-4)^0 + 2(-4)^1
-30 = -4(1) + 2(-4)
-30 = -4 - 8
-30 = -12

By observing the data points, we can see that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is a linear equation. The function can be represented as:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Since any number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Now, to determine the values of a and b, we can substitute the given data points into the equation and solve for a and b using any of the data points.

Using the first data point (-11, -20):

Using the second data point (-8, -14):

Let's assume the function to be in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2, where x^0 is equivalent to 1. 

To determine the values of a, b, and c, let's substitute the given inputs and outputs into the function:

For the input -16 and output 297:

For the input -5 and output 99:

99 = a - 5b + 25c

For the input 5 and output -81:

    The given data points can be modeled using a linear function. The general form of a linear function is y = mx + c, where m and c are constants.

Let's denote the constant term as a (a = c in this case) and the coefficient of x as b (b = m in this case).

By substituting the given input-output pairs into the linear function, we get the following equations:

-15 = a(0) + b(0)
-35 = a(-5) + b(-5)
-31 = a(-4) + b(-4)

-63 = a(-12) + b(-12)

From the first equation, we can see a(0) = -15, which gives us the value of a as -15.

By substituting -15 into the rest of the equations, we can solve for b:

-35 = -15(-5) + b(-5)
-31 = -15(-4) + b(-4)
5 = -15(5) + b(5)
-63 = -15(-12) + b(-12)

Simplifying these equations will give us:

Letting x be the input, we can write the equation as:

Output = a(x - 5)  ⇒  Output = ax - 5a

Comparing this equation with the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can rewrite it as:

Output = bx^1 + ax^0  ⇒  Output = b(x^1) + a(x^0)

By substituting x with (x - 5), we can determine the coefficients a and b:

Now, we can determine the values of a and b by comparing the coefficients of x and x^0 in the equation with our data points:

Also, the difference between consecutive output values seems to decrease as the input values decrease. Let's start by considering the pattern for the input values -5, -4, and -12. The output for input -5 is -35, and for input -4 is -31. The difference between these two output values is 4.

Similarly, the output for input -12 is -63. The difference between the output for input -12 and the output for input -5 is 28. Since the difference between consecutive output values decreases by 4 each time, we can assume a linear relationship and apply the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's calculate the value of a and b using the first two data points (-5, -35) and (-4, -31):

For (-5, -35):
-35 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
-35 = a - 5b

For (-4, -31):

    Given the data points, we can see that the output ""y"" can be represented as:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

By substituting the input values and their corresponding outputs into the equation, we can solve for the values of ""a"" and ""b"". Using the provided data points, we get the following system of equations:

133 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)
283 = a(19^0) + b(19^1)
238 = a(16^0) + b(16^1)
-212 = a((-14)^0) + b((-14)^1)
-242 = a((-16)^0) + b((-16)^1)

Simplifying the equations, we obtain the following system:

133 = a + 9b
283 = a + 19b
238 = a + 16b
-212 = a - 14b
-242 = a - 16b

Solving this system of equations, we find that:

a = 21

1. 133 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)
2. 283 = a(19^0) + b(19^1)
3. 238 = a(16^0) + b(16^1)

    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs, the function can be expressed as y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given input-output pairs to form a system of equations. Let's substitute the given values into the function:

1. For the first input: 2
   y = a(2^0) + b(2^1)
   59 = a + 2b

2. For the second input: -16
   y = a((-16)^0) + b((-16)^1)
   -301 = a - 16b

3. For the third input: -5

4. For the fourth input: 3
   y = a(3^0) + b(3^1)
   79 = a + 3b

5. For the fifth input: -2
   y = a((-2)^0) + b((-2)^1)
   -21 = a - 2b

We now have a system of equations:

a + 2b = 59       (Equation 1)
a - 16b = -301    (Equation 2)
a - 5b = -81      (Equation 3)
a + 3b = 79       (Equation 4)
a - 2b = -21      (Equation 5)

Using any method of solving systems of equations (e.g. substitution, elimination, etc.), we can find the values of a and b that satisfy all the equations.

Solving the system of equations, we get:
a = 40
b = 9

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

-2 = a(-2^0) + b(-2^1) + c(-2^2)
-2 = a - 2b + 4c         ----(5)

We have a system of equations (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) with three unknowns (a, b, c). Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of a, b, and c.

Substituting equation (1) into equations (2), (3), (4), and (5) will eliminate the variable a.

-16 = (2 - 16b + 256c)         ----(6)
-5 = (2 - 5b + 25c)            ----(7)
3 = (2 + 3b + 9c)              ----(8)
-2 = (2 - 2b + 4c)              ----(9)

Simplifying equations (6), (7), (8), and (9) further:

16b - 256c = 18             ----(10)
5b - 25c = -7               ----(11)
-3b - 9c = -1               ----(12)
2b - 4c = 4                 ----(13)

We can now solve equations (10), (11), (12), and (13) simultaneously to find the values of b and c.

Multiplying equation (11) by 5, equation (12) by 16, equation (13) by 25, and adding them together will eliminate the variable b.

-128b - 400c = -56          ----(14)

Multiplying equation (10) by 2 and subtracting equation (14) from it will eliminate the variable c.

912c = 52                  ----(15)

Therefore, c = 52/912 = 13/228.

Substituting the value of c = 13/228 into equation (13) will give us the value of b.

2b - 4(13/228) = 4
2b - 52/57 = 4
2b = 4 + 52/57
2b = 248/57
b = (248/57)/2
b = 248/114
b = 124/57

Similarly, substituting the values of b = 124/57 and c = 13/228 into equation (1) will give us the value of a.

2 = a + 2(124/57) + 4(13/228)
2 = a + 248/57 + 52/57
2 = a + 300/57
2 = a + (300+57)/57
2 = a + 357/57
2 = a + 119/19
2 - 119/19 = a
38/19 - 119/19 = a
-81/19 = a

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

The coefficient for x^1 can be found by comparing the other data points. Let's take the example of the first data point, where x = -11 and y = 72. We can write the equation as follows:

72 = b(-11)^1

Simplifying this equation, we get:

72 = -11b

Solving for b, we find that b = -6.545.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 0x^0 + (-6.545)x^1

Simplifying further, we have:

Output: y = -6.545x

    Looking at the given data points, it seems that the output (y) can be represented by a linear function of the input (x), where the constant term (a) is the coefficient of x^0 and the linear term (b) is the coefficient of x^1.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given data points in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship can be modeled by a quadratic equation rather than a linear equation. A quadratic equation is typically written in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants. However, since we're limited to the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can rewrite the quadratic equation in this form.

Let's assume the function is y = bx^1 + cx^0, where x^1 denotes x to the power of 1 and x^0 denotes x to the power of 0.

By substituting the given input-output pairs into this form, we can solve for b and c.

For Input -12 and Output 9:

9 = b(-12)^1 + c(-12)^0
9 = -12b + c

For Input 20 and Output -55:

-55 = b(20)^1 + c(20)^0

-75 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1 
-75 = a - 18b 

For the input -1 and output -7:
-7 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1 
-7 = a - b 

For the input 3 and output 9:
9 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1 
9 = a + 3b 

For the input 2 and output 5:
5 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1

Simplifying the equations:

8 = a + 6b  (Equation 1)
-25 = a - 5b  (Equation 2)
-19 = a - 3b  (Equation 3)
-40 = a - 10b  (Equation 4)
-52 = a - 14b  (Equation 5)

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of ""a"" and ""b"" that represent the function.

Solving Equation 1 and Equation 3 together, we eliminate ""a"":
8 - (-19) = 6b - (-3b)
27 = 9b
b = 3

Plugging the value of ""b"" in Equation 1, we can solve for ""a"":
8 = a + 6(3)
8 = a + 18
a = -10

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

For the input 2, the function gives us: 8 = a + 2b  --> Equation 1
For the input -1, the function gives us: -1 = a - b  --> Equation 2

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b:

From Equation 1, we obtain: a = 8 - 2b
Substituting a in Equation 2, we get: -1 = (8 - 2b) - b
Simplifying, we have: -1 = 8 - 3b

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the function can be described by a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. However, since the exponent of x^1 is always 1, we can simplify the equation to y = a + bx.

To find the values of a and b, we can use linear regression. Here are the steps to calculate the coefficients a and b:

1. Create two lists, x and y, to store the input and output values.
   x = [-9, 17, -4, -18, -14]
   y = [162, -254, 82, 306, 242]

2. Calculate the mean of x and y.
   mean_x = sum(x) / len(x)
   mean_y = sum(y) / len(y)

3. Calculate the differences between each x value and the mean_x, and each y value and the mean_y. Store them in two new lists, diff_x and diff_y.
   diff_x = [xi - mean_x for xi in x]
   diff_y = [yi - mean_y for yi in y]

4. Calculate the product of the differences of x and y, and store them in a new list, diff_prod.
   diff_prod = [dx * dy for dx, dy in zip(diff_x, diff_y)]

5. Calculate the square of the differences of x and store them in a new list, diff_x_squared.
   diff_x_squared = [dx**2 for dx in diff_x]

6. Calculate the sum of diff_prod and diff_x_squared.
   sum_diff_prod = sum(diff_prod)
   sum_diff_x_squared = sum(diff_x_squared)

7. Calculate the coefficient b using the formula
   b = sum_diff_prod / sum_diff_x_squared

8. Calculate the coefficient a using the formula
   a = mean_y - (b * mean_x)

Using the above calculations, we can find the values of a and b:

mean_x = (-9 + 17 - 4 - 18 - 14) / 5 = -5.6
mean_y = (162 - 254 + 82 + 306 + 242) / 5 = 107.6

diff_x = [-9 - -5.6, 17 - -5.6, -4 - -5.6, -18 - -5.6, -14 - -5.6] = [-3.4, 22.6, 1.6, -12.4, -8.4]
diff_y = [162 - 107.6, -254 - 107.6, 82 - 107.6, 306 - 107.6, 242 - 107.6] = [54.4, -361.6, -25.6, 198.4, 134.4]

diff_prod = [-3.4 * 54.4, 22.6 * -361.6, 1.6 * -25.6, -12.4 * 198.4, -8.4 * 134.4] = [-184.96, -8177.6, -40.96, -2454.56, -1128.96]
diff_x_squared = [-3.4^2, 22.6^2, 1.6^2, -12.4^2, -8.4^2] = [11.56, 510.76, 2.56, 153.76, 70.56]

sum_diff_prod = -184.96 + -8177.6 + -40.96 + -2454.56 + -1128.96 = -12016.04
sum_diff_x_squared = 11.56 + 510.76 + 2.56 + 153.76 + 70.56 = 749.2

b = -12016.04 / 749.2 = -16.05

a = 107.6 - (-16.05 * -5.6) = 174.76

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = 174.76 - 16.05x

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it is evident that the relationship follows a linear pattern. Therefore, we can write the function as:

Output = a(0) + b(1) = a + bx

Let's substitute the input and output values into the equation to find the values of a and b.

When Input is 18, Output is 350:
350 = a + 18b   -- (1)

When Input is 12, Output is 230:
230 = a + 12b   -- (2)

When Input is 16, Output is 310:

Now, we have a system of linear equations. By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

By solving equations (1) - (4), we find that a = 30 and b = 20.

-270 = a - 13b

For the fourth pair (4, 70):
70 = a(4^0) + b(4^1)
70 = a + 4b

For the fifth pair (16, 310):
310 = a(16^0) + b(16^1)
310 = a + 16b

Simplifying the equations, we have:

a + 12b = 230   ......... (2)
a - 13b = -270  ......... (3)

1. 350 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1
2. 230 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1
3. -270 = a(-13)^0 + b(-13)^1
