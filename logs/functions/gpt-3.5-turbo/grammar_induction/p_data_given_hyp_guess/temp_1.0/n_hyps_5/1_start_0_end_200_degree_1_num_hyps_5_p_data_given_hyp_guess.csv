    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs, the function can be written as:

Output (y) = a * x^0 + b * x^1

where x represents the input value and a, b represent the coefficients.

Using the given examples, we can solve for the coefficients a and b:

For the first example: 
-197 = a * (-13)^0 + b * (-13)^1
-197 = a - 13b     ----(1)

For the second example:
-169 = a * (-11)^0 + b * (-11)^1
-169 = a - 11b     ----(2)

For the third example:
265 = a * (20)^0 + b * (20)^1
265 = a + 20b       ----(3)

For the fourth example:
-155 = a * (-10)^0 + b * (-10)^1
-155 = a - 10b     ----(4)

For the fifth example:
83 = a * (7)^0 + b * (7)^1
83 = a + 7b         ----(5)

Solving equations (1) - (5) simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

Solving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously:
-197 - -169 = a - 13b - (a - 11b)
-28 = -2b
b = 14

Substituting b = 14 into equation (1):
-197 = a - 13(14)
-197 = a - 182
a = -197 + 182
a = -15

To determine the values of a, b, and c, we can use three input-output pairs to form a system of equations. Let's use the pairs (-13, -197), (-11, -169), and (20, 265):

-197 = a*(-13)^2 + b*(-13)^1 + c
-169 = a*(-11)^2 + b*(-11)^1 + c

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To capture the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Since the coefficient of x^0 is always 1 (the constant term), we have y = 1 + bx^1. 

From the given data points, we can calculate the coefficient b by plugging in the x and y values. Let's use the first and second points: 

17 = 1 + b(-2)

Simplifying the equation gives:

17 = 1 - 2b 
16 = -2b 
b = -8 

Therefore, our function is: 

y = 1 - 8x^1 

Simplifying further:
y = 1 - 8x

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is y = 1 - 8x.

    To derive the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of 'a' and 'b' in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

-109 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1      ----> Equation 2
269 = a(16)^0 + b(16)^1       ----> Equation 3
-289 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)^1    ----> Equation 4

Simplifying the equations, we get:

    To come up with a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs given, we can use the general form of a linear equation, which is:

Output (y) = ax^0 + bx^1

where x is the input and a and b are coefficients to be determined.

By substituting the input-output pairs into the equation, we can solve for the coefficients:

For (x=10, y=142):
142 = a(10^0) + b(10^1)
142 = a + 10b

For (x=15, y=217):
217 = a(15^0) + b(15^1)
217 = a + 15b

For (x=-10, y=-158):
-158 = a(-10^0) + b(-10^1)
-158 = a - 10b

For (x=-4, y=-68):
-68 = a(-4^0) + b(-4^1)
-68 = a - 4b

For (x=13, y=187):
187 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
187 = a + 13b

To solve this system of equations, we can subtract equation 3 from equation 1, and equation 4 from equation 2:

(142 - (-158)) = (a - a) + (10b - (-10b))
300 = 20b
b = 15

Substituting b = 15 back into equation 1, we can solve for a:

    Given the input-output pairs provided, we can try to identify a pattern in the data to determine the function that best describes the relationship.

Input: -19, Output: 122
Input: 17, Output: -94
Input: 15, Output: -82

Upon observing the data, it appears that the outputs are obtained by multiplying the input by a number and then subtracting or adding another number. Additionally, the values of the outputs do not seem to depend on the input being raised to any power other than 1. Therefore, the function that best captures this relationship is:

Output = a*(Input^0) + b*(Input^1)

Simplifying further:

Output = a + b*Input

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    From the given data points, we can observe that the output (y) is a linear function of the input (x). We can express it as y = ax + b, where a and b are the coefficients to be determined.

Using the data points provided, we can set up a system of equations:

-105 = -6a + b       (Equation 2)
-275 = -16a + b      (Equation 3)

    Based on the given data points, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear, as the increase in the input values does not result in a constant change in the output values. Therefore, a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 may not accurately capture the relationship in this case.

To find a more suitable function, we can attempt to fit a quadratic function to the data points. A quadratic function is in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c.

By substituting the given input-output pairs into the quadratic function, we can solve for the coefficients a, b, and c.

Using the given data:

Input: -20, Output: 265
265 = a(-20)^2 + b(-20) + c         --> (1)

Input: 6, Output: -99

Expanding the equations and rearranging terms:

1.  400a - 20b + c = 265
2.  225a - 15b + c = 195
3.  25a - 5b + c = 55
4.  100a - 10b + c = 125
5.  36a + 6b + c = -99

Solving this system of equations simultaneously will give us the values of a, b, and c that best fit the given data.

After solving this system, the coefficients are as follows:

a ≈ -0.12943
b ≈ -5.0531
c ≈ 157.774

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it is clear that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be represented by a linear equation of the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

where x is the input and y is the output.

To find the values of a and b, we can solve a system of linear equations using the given input-output pairs:

-310 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1  -->  -310 = a + (-17)b  -->  a - 17b = -310   (Equation 1)
302 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1  -->  302 = a + 17b  -->  a + 17b = 302   (Equation 2)

Solving these equations will give us the values of a and b, which will help us form the desired function.

To solve the equations:

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

(a - 17b) - (a + 17b) = (-310) - 302
-34b = -612
b = 18

Substitute the value of b back into Equation 2:

a + 17(18) = 302
a = 302 - (17)(18)
a = 302 - 306
a = -4

    Based on the given input-output pairs, we can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be represented by a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1. 
Let's try to find the values of a and b by solving a system of equations.

Using the first input-output pair:
-310 = a*(-17)^0 + b*(-17)^1
-310 = a - 17b   -------- (1)

Using the second input-output pair:
302 = a*(17)^0 + b*(17)^1
302 = a + 17b    -------- (2)

Solving the above system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

From equation (1), we can express a in terms of b:
a = 17b - 310   (3)

Substitute the value of a from equation (3) into equation (2):
302 = (17b - 310) + 17b
302 = 34b - 310
34b = 612
b = 18

Substitute the value of b into equation (3) to find a:
a = 17(18) - 310
a = 6

By substituting the input-output pairs (-12, 9), (20, -55), (-4, -7), (-10, 5), (8, -31) into the equation, we can solve for the values of a and b.

Using the first pair (-12, 9):

9 = a + (-12)b

Using the second pair (20, -55):

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use linear regression.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can form a system of equations in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1:

For the first data point (-16, 109):
109 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
109 = a - 16b

For the second data point (-3, 18):
18 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
18 = a - 3b

For the third data point (2, -17):
-17 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1
-17 = a + 2b

For the fourth data point (12, -87):
-87 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1
-87 = a + 12b

For the fifth data point (5, -38):
-38 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-38 = a + 5b

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = -8 and b = 5.

    The relationship between the inputs and outputs can be modeled using a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x represents the input and y represents the output.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given input-output pairs to form a system of equations:

1) When x = 18, y = 350:
350 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1
350 = a + 18b

2) When x = 12, y = 230:
230 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1
230 = a + 12b

3) When x = -13, y = -270:
-270 = a(-13)^0 + b(-13)^1
-270 = a - 13b

4) When x = 4, y = 70:
70 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
70 = a + 4b

5) When x = 16, y = 310:
310 = a(16)^0 + b(16)^1
310 = a + 16b

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = 30 and b = 20.

    Based on the given data points, it seems like the output (y) can be expressed as a function of the input (x) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Let's try to find the values of a and b using the given data.

Input: 13, Output: 177
177 = a * 13^0 + b * 13^1
177 = a + 13b

Input: 14, Output: 191
191 = a * 14^0 + b * 14^1
191 = a + 14b

Input: -8, Output: -117
-117 = a * (-8)^0 + b * (-8)^1
-117 = a - 8b

Input: 3, Output: 37
37 = a * 3^0 + b * 3^1
37 = a + 3b

Input: 7, Output: 93
93 = a * 7^0 + b * 7^1
93 = a + 7b

Solving the above system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

From equation 1 and equation 5:
a + 13b = a + 7b
6b = 0
b = 0

Substituting b = 0 into equation 1:
a + 13(0) = 0
a = 0

Therefore, the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 becomes y = 0x^0 + 0x^1, which simplifies to y = 0.

So, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is y = 0.
