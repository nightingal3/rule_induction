    The given data can be represented by a function in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Let's substitute the given inputs and outputs to solve for the coefficients a and b:

For input -18, output 339:

339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
339 = a + (-18b)

For input 0, output -3:

-3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-3 = a

For input 5, output -98:

-98 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-98 = a + 5b

For input -3, output 54:

54 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
54 = a + (-3b)

For input -16, output 301:

301 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
301 = a + (-16b)

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b:

339 = a + (-18b)   (1)
-3 = a  (2)
-98 = a + 5b   (3)
54 = a + (-3b)   (4)
301 = a + (-16b)   (5)

From equation (2), we find a = -3. Substituting this value back into equations (1), (3), (4), and (5) gives:

339 = -3 + (-18b)   ->   342 = -18b   ->   b = -19

Now we have the values of a = -3 and b = -19, which we can use to write the function capturing the relationship between inputs and outputs:

For input 0, output -3, the constant term (a) is -3, and the coefficient of x (b) is 0.

    Given the input-output pairs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs follows a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given data:

When input = -2, output = 17:
17 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1
17 = a - 2b

When input = 7, output = -145:
-145 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1
-145 = a + 7b

Solving the above equations simultaneously, we get:
a = -184
b = 101

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    The relationship between the inputs and outputs can be represented by the function:

Output: y = 3x^0 - 10x^1

Using this function, we can calculate the outputs for the given inputs as follows:

For Input -2:
y = 3(-2)^0 - 10(-2)^1
y = 3 - 10(-2)
y = 3 + 20
y = 23

For Input 7:
y = 3(7)^0 - 10(7)^1
y = 3 - 10(7)
y = 3 - 70
y = -67

For Input -10:
y = 3(-10)^0 - 10(-10)^1
y = 3 - 10(-10)
y = 3 + 100
y = 103

For Input 9:
y = 3(9)^0 - 10(9)^1
y = 3 - 10(9)
y = 3 - 90
y = -87

For Input -20:
y = 3(-20)^0 - 10(-20)^1
y = 3 - 10(-20)
y = 3 + 200
y = 203

    The given data points suggest that the function can be represented in the form of a quadratic equation, which is y = ax^2 + bx + c. However, because the given data only includes x^0 (which is 1) and x^1 terms, the quadratic term is not present in the function. Thus, the function can be simplified to y = bx + c.

By substituting the given inputs and outputs into the equation, we can find the values of b and c:

For the input 13, output -66:
-66 = 13b + c

For the input -20, output 132:

    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

By plugging in the given inputs and corresponding outputs, we can solve for a and b using a system of equations.

For the first data pair, when input = 13 and output = -66, we have:
-66 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
-66 = a + 13b

For the second data pair, when input = -20 and output = 132, we have:
132 = a(-20^0) + b(-20^1)
132 = a - 20b

For the third data pair, when input = 18 and output = -96, we have:
-96 = a(18^0) + b(18^1)
-96 = a + 18b

For the fourth data pair, when input = 0 and output = 12, we have:
12 = a(0^0) + b(0^1)
12 = a

For the fifth data pair, when input = 11 and output = -54, we have:
-54 = a(11^0) + b(11^1)
-54 = a + 11b

Simplifying the equations, we get:

-66 = a + 13b       (Equation 1)
132 = a - 20b       (Equation 2)
-96 = a + 18b       (Equation 3)
12 = a              (Equation 4)
-54 = a + 11b       (Equation 5)

From Equation 4, we found that a = 12.

Substituting a = 12 into Equation 5, we get:
-54 = 12 + 11b
-66 = 11b
b = -6

Substituting a = 12 and b = -6 into Equation 1, we get:
-66 = 12 + 13(-6)
-66 = 12 - 78
-66 = -66

Substituting a = 12 and b = -6 into Equation 2, we get:
132 = 12 - 20(-6)
132 = 12 + 120
132 = 132

Substituting a = 12 and b = -6 into Equation 3, we get:
-96 = 12 + 18(-6)
-96 = 12 - 108

    To capture the relationship between inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the values of a and b.

Let's denote the input as x and the output as y. We can write the relationship as follows:

For input -1, output -8:
-8 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1
-8 = a - b

For input 5, output 76:
76 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1

For input 13, output 188:
188 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1

Now we have a system of 5 equations with 2 unknowns (a and b). We can solve this system to find the values of a and b.

By subtracting Eqn 1 from Eqn 2, we get:

    Based on the given data, it seems that the output (y) can be described as a linear function of the input (x). 

To find the equation of the line, we can use the formula y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 = 1 and x^1 = x.

Let's substitute the values of the inputs (x) and outputs (y) from the given data points into the equation:

-292 = a(1) + b(-17)
-105 = a(1) + b(-6)
-275 = a(1) + b(-16)
-309 = a(1) + b(-18)
14 = a(1) + b(1)

From these equations, we can solve for the coefficients a and b. By rearranging and solving the equations simultaneously, we find that a = -12 and b = 20.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can see that the coefficient b is always -20. However, the coefficient a seems to be changing. Let's label the inputs as x and the outputs as y.

y = -20x + a

Now, we can substitute the given inputs and outputs to find the value of a.

For the first set of inputs and outputs (-7, 130):
130 = -20(-7) + a
130 = 140 + a
a = -10

For the second set (-12, 230):
230 = -20(-12) + a
230 = 240 + a
a = -10

For the third set (14, -290):
-290 = -20(14) + a
-290 = -280 + a
a = -10

For the fourth set (16, -330):

-330 = -320 + a
a = -10

For the fifth set (16, -330):

Input: 5, Output: -26
Input: 1, Output: -14
Input: -14, Output: 31
Input: -5, Output: 4
Input: -8, Output: 13

We can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs does not follow a linear pattern. However, there is a quadratic relationship between x and y. Therefore, we can describe the relationship using a quadratic function in the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

To find the values of a, b, and c, we can substitute each data point into the equation:

For the first data point, where Input = 5, and Output = -26:
-26 = a(5^0) + b(5^1) + c(5^2)
-26 = a + 5b + 25c -------------- (Equation 1)

Similarly, we can substitute the other data points into the equation to form additional equations:

-14 = a(1^0) + b(1^1) + c(1^2)
-14 = a + b + c -------------- (Equation 2)

31 = a(-14^0) + b(-14^1) + c(-14^2)
31 = a - 14b + 196c -------------- (Equation 3)

4 = a(-5^0) + b(-5^1) + c(-5^2)
4 = a - 5b + 25c -------------- (Equation 4)

13 = a(-8^0) + b(-8^1) + c(-8^2)
13 = a - 8b + 64c -------------- (Equation 5)

Now, we have five equations with three unknowns (a, b, and c). To solve for these unknowns, we can solve the system of equations simultaneously. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as substitution or matrix algebra.

Solving the equations, we find:
a = 0.5
b = 15
c = -0.5

-212 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1
-212 = a + (-14)b
Equation 1: -212 = a - 14b

Using Input: 9, Output: 133,
133 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
133 = a + 9b
Equation 2: 133 = a + 9b

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

From Equation 1: -212 = a - 14b,
Multiply by 9 to get: -1908 = 9a - 126b    (Equation 3)

From Equation 2: 133 = a + 9b

Multiply by 14 to get: 1862 = 14a + 126b    (Equation 4)

Adding Equations 3 and 4,

-46 = 23a

Dividing by 23, we get:

a = -2

Using this value of a in Equation 2:

133 = -2 + 9b
135 = 9b
b = 15

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -2x^0 + 15x^1
        y = -2 + 15x, where x is the input.

    The pattern appears to be a linear relationship between the input and output values. 

Given that the form is y = ax^0 + bx^1, where the variables a and b are the coefficients, we can determine the coefficients by using any two input-output pairs.

For example, using the pairs (9, 133) and (19, 283), we can solve the system of equations:

133 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)
283 = a(19^0) + b(19^1)

Simplifying the equations:
133 = a + 9b
283 = a + 19b

By subtracting the first equation from the second, we eliminate a:
150 = 10b
b = 15

Substituting this value into the first equation:
133 = a + 9(15)
133 = a + 135
a = -2

    Based on the given data, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs can be written as:

Output: y = 4 + 2x

Explanation:
By examining the given input-output pairs, we can observe that the value of b (coefficient of x) is consistently 2. The value of a (coefficient of x^0, which is essentially a constant term) seems to vary for each input-output pair. Using the expression y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can calculate the value of a for each pair as follows:

For input -11, output 72:
72 = a * 1 + 2*(-11)
72 = a - 22
a = 94

For input -3, output 8:
8 = a * 1 + 2*(-3)
8 = a - 6
a = 14

For input -2, output 0:
0 = a * 1 + 2*(-2)
0 = a - 4
a = 4

For input 18, output -160:
-160 = a * 1 + 2*18
-160 = a + 36
a = -196

For input -7, output 40:
40 = a * 1 + 2*(-7)
40 = a - 14
a = 54

Let's substitute the values for inputs and outputs one by one:

-204 = a(11^0) + b(11^1)
66 = a(-4^0) + b(-4^1)
300 = a(-17^0) + b(-17^1)
264 = a(-15^0) + b(-15^1)
-366 = a(20^0) + b(20^1)

Simplifying these equations, we get:

66 = a - 4b
300 = a - 17b
264 = a - 15b
-366 = a + 20b

Solving these equations simultaneously, we find:

9 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
9 = a + (-12)b

When input = 20, output = -55:
-55 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1

1. When input = -16, output = 82:
82 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1

2. When input = -11, output = 52:
52 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1

Simplifying the equations:

1. 82 = a + (-16)b
2. 52 = a + (-11)b

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of 'a' and 'b'.

    Based on the given data, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs cannot be accurately described by a polynomial function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. However, we can attempt to find a linear function that closely fits the data.

By using a linear regression approach, we can find the best-fitting line to describe the data. Using the given data points, we can calculate the coefficients for a linear equation of the form y = mx + b.

Using a programming language or statistical software, we can calculate the coefficients as follows:

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs given, we need to identify the values of 'a' and 'b' that satisfy the pattern. To do so, we can use the values of the inputs and outputs to construct a system of linear equations. Since we're given that the function is in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify the equation to y = a + bx.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can write the following equations:

Equation 1: 162 = a - 9b
Equation 2: -254 = a + 17b
Equation 3: 82 = a - 4b
Equation 4: 306 = a - 18b
Equation 5: 242 = a - 14b

To solve this system of equations, we can use methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrices. In this case, let's use the method of substitution:

From Equation 1, we can rearrange it to solve for a:
a = 162 + 9b

Substituting a into Equation 2:
-254 = (162 + 9b) + 17b
-254 = 162 + 26b
-416 = 26b
b = -16

Now, substituting b = -16 into Equation 1:

    The given data can be represented by the function:
Output = y = ax^0 + bx^1

Let's use the given input-output pairs to determine the values of a and b.

For the first pair (13, 177), we have:
177 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
177 = a + 13b             -- [1]

For the second pair (14, 191), we have:
191 = a(14^0) + b(14^1)
191 = a + 14b             -- [2]

For the third pair (-8, -117), we have:
-117 = a(-8^0) + b(-8^1)
-117 = a - 8b              -- [3]

For the fourth pair (3, 37), we have:
37 = a(3^0) + b(3^1)
37 = a + 3b                -- [4]

For the fifth pair (7, 93), we have:
93 = a(7^0) + b(7^1)
93 = a + 7b                -- [5]

Now, we have a system of 5 equations with 2 unknowns (a and b).

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b, which will give us the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs.

Solving equations [1] and [2], we get b = 6 and a = 99.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = 99x^0 + 6x^1

Simplifying it further, we have:
y = 99 + 6x
