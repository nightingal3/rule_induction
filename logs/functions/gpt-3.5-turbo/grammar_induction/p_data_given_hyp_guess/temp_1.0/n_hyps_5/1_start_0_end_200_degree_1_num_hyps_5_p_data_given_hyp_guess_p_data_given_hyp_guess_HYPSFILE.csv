Σy = -213 + 167 + 67 - 73 + 387 = 335
Σxy = (-10 * -213) + (9 * 167) + (4 * 67) + (-3 * -73) + (20 * 387) = 11288

We now have a system of two linear equations (1) and (2) with two unknowns (a and b). We can solve this system to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying equation (1) by 15 and equation (2) by 10, we get:

15(142) = 15a + 150b   ---(3)

Simplifying equations (3) and (4), we get:

Substituting the value of a into equation (5):

2130 = 15(8) + 150b

b = 2010 / 150

-68 = a - 4b

For Input = 13, Output = 187:
187 = a * 13^0 + b * 13^1

Subtract the equations:
217 - 142 = (a + 15b) - (a + 10b)
75 = 5b
b = 15

Replacing the value of b in the first equation:
142 = a + 10(15)
142 = a + 150
a = -8

Next, we need to find the coefficient of x^1 (the linear term). To find this, we can calculate the difference between the output value and the product of -10 and x^0 for each data point.

Let's break it down for the first data point:

In a quadratic relationship, the function can be written in the form:

Using the given data points, let's try to find the coefficients a, b, and c that best fit the data.

Using the method of least squares, we can find the best-fit quadratic equation.

Using the first two data points:

Expanding and rearranging the equations:

-290 = 196a + 14b + c

Using these two equations, we can solve for the values of a, b, and c.

Multiplying the first equation by 14 and the second equation by 7 and then subtracting the resulting equations, we get:

Using the given values (-14, -97), (-14, -97), (7, 50), (2, 15), and (7, 50), we can find the values of the coefficients a and b to make the function true for all the given pairs.

Let's solve for a and b using the given values:

For the first pair (-14, -97):
-97 = a + b(-14)
For the second pair (-14, -97):
-97 = a + b(-14)
For the third pair (7, 50):
50 = a + b(7)
For the fourth pair (2, 15):

50 = a + b(7)

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

"After analyzing the given data, it seems that the relationship between inputs and outputs can be approximated by a linear function.

Therefore, the function can be written in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx.

To find the values of a and b, we can use any two sets of input-output pairs. Let's consider the first and last pairs: (-14, -97) and (7, 50).

By substituting these values into the function, we get the following two equations:

-97 = a + b(-14)
50 = a + b(7)

Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of a and b.

Multiplying the second equation by 2 and adding it to the first equation, we eliminate a:

-97 + 100 = 2a

2a = 3

a = 3/2

Now, substituting the value of a back into the second equation:

50 = (3/2) + b(7)

50 - (3/2) = b(7)

97/2 = 7b

b = (97/2) / 7

b = 97/14

Assuming the function is of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which can be simplified to y = a + bx, we can find the values of a and b by using the input-output pairs.

Using the first pair (-14, -97), we can substitute these values into the equation:
-97 = a + b(-14)
Simplifying further:
-97 = a - 14b

Using the second pair (7, 50):

"To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's examine the inputs and outputs provided:

Input: -11 -> Output: -20
Input: -8 -> Output: -14
Input: -2 -> Output: -2
Input: -7 -> Output: -12
Input: -17 -> Output: -32

The exponent term, x^1, is always one since it is a linear function. The coefficient a represents the output when x is equal to 0 (as x^0 is 1 for any non-zero x).

By observing the outputs when x = 0, we can see that a is likely equal to -2. Thus, the equation becomes:

y = -2x^0 + bx^1

To find b, we can choose any input-output pair and solve for b using the equation:

Output = -2x^0 + bx^1

For example, let's use the first input-output pair (-11, -20):

-20 = -2(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
-20 = -2 + b(-11)
b(-11) = -18
b = -18 / -11
b ≈ 1.6364

Using the first pair (-17, -310), we have -310 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1. Simplifying this equation gives -310 = a - 17b.

Using the second pair (17, 302), we have 302 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1. Simplifying this equation gives 302 = a + 17b.

Using the third pair (10, 176), we have 176 = a(10)^0 + b(10)^1. Simplifying this equation gives 176 = a + 10b.

Using the fourth pair (12, 212), we have 212 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1. Simplifying this equation gives 212 = a + 12b.

Using the fifth pair (13, 230), we have 230 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1. Simplifying this equation gives 230 = a + 13b.

We have a system of 5 linear equations with 2 unknowns (a and b). Solving this system yields a = -10 and b = 20.

To simplify the equation, we can ignore the coefficient of x^0 since it equals 1. Therefore, the function can be written as:

Output: y = bx^1 + cx^2

To find the coefficients, let's substitute the inputs and outputs into the equation:

For Input: -17, Output: -310:
-310 = b(-17) + c(-17)^2

For Input: 17, Output: 302:
302 = b(17) + c(17)^2

212 = b(12) + c(12)^2

For Input: 13, Output: 230:
230 = b(13) + c(13)^2

Now we have a system of equations:
-310 = -17b + 289c
302 = 17b + 289c
176 = 10b + 100c
212 = 12b + 144c
230 = 13b + 169c

To find the values of a and b, we can solve a system of linear equations using the given input-output pairs:

-310 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1  -->  -310 = a + (-17)b  -->  a - 17b = -310   (Equation 1)
302 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1  -->  302 = a + 17b  -->  a + 17b = 302   (Equation 2)

Solving these equations will give us the values of a and b, which will help us form the desired function.

To solve the equations:

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

(a - 17b) - (a + 17b) = (-310) - 302
-34b = -612
b = 18

Substitute the value of b back into Equation 2:

a + 17(18) = 302
a = 302 - (17)(18)
a = 302 - 306
a = -4

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

"Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the relationship between the input and output can be described by a linear function. 

Therefore, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 can be written as:

Output = a(1) + bx

To find the values of a and b, let's consider one of the input-output pairs:

When the input is -17, the output is -310. Substituting these values into the function, we have:

-310 = a(1) + b(-17)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

-310 = a - 17b

Similarly, we can use another input-output pair to create another equation.

When the input is 17, the output is 302. Substituting these values into the function, we have:

302 = a(1) + b(17)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

To find a:
Sum of x^0 * y = (-17)^0 * (-310) + 17^0 * 302 + 10^0 * 176 + 12^0 * 212 + 13^0 * 230

               = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
               = 5

a = Sum of x^0 * y / Sum of (x^0)^2
  = 610 / 5

To find b:
Sum of x^1 * y = (-17)^1 * (-310) + 17^1 * 302 + 10^1 * 176 + 12^1 * 212 + 13^1 * 230
               = -17 * (-310) + 17 * 302 + 10 * 176 + 12 * 212 + 13 * 230
               = 5270

Sum of (x^1)^2 = (-17)^2 + 17^2 + 10^2 + 12^2 + 13^2
               = 289 + 289 + 100 + 144 + 169

212 = a(12^0) + b(12^1)

Simplifying the equations:
302 = a + 17b

We now have a system of equations to solve for a and b. Subtracting the second equation from the first:

302 - 212 = a + 17b - (a + 12b)

When input is 19, output is 253:
253 = a(19)^0 + b(19)^1

71 = a + 6b

For the fifth pair (17, 225):

By observing the data, we can see that the output is linearly related to the input, as the output increases or decreases by the same amount for each unit change in the input. Therefore, we can assume that the relationship between the input and output is linear.

To find the coefficients a and b, we can use any two of the provided data points. Let's use the first and third data points: (9, 133) and (16, 238).

Using these two points, we can set up a system of equations:
133 = a + 9b
238 = a + 16b

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = -295 and b = 38.

Now, we can solve Equations 1 and 2 simultaneously:

Multiplying Equation 1 by 19:  19(133) = 19a + 171b   (Equation 3)

The general form of a linear function is y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept. 

In this case, since we have inputs and outputs in the form ""x"" and ""y"" respectively, the equation can be written as y = ax^0 + bx^1, where ax^0 represents the y-intercept and bx^1 represents the slope.

From the given inputs and outputs, we can see that when x = 0, y = ax^0. Thus, the value of ax^0 is the y-intercept.

Using the first example, when x = 13, y = 55. From this, we can infer that ax^0 = 55. Therefore, the y-intercept is 55.

Now we can find the value of bx^1 (the slope) using the second example. When x = -20, y = -44. Using the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1 = 55 + bx^1 = -44. Solving for bx^1, we get bx^1 = -99. Therefore, the slope is -99.

b = -16

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be written as:

To determine the values of a and b, we can use the given data points.

Using the first data point (-9, 162), we have:
162 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
162 = a + (-9b)   (since any number to the power of 0 is 1)
Therefore, equation 1 is: a - 9b = 162

Using the second data point (17, -254), we have:
-254 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
-254 = a + 17b
Therefore, equation 2 is: a + 17b = -254

Using the third data point (-4, 82), we have:
82 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
82 = a - 4b
Therefore, equation 3 is: a - 4b = 82

Using the fourth data point (-18, 306), we have:

242 = a - 14b
Therefore, equation 5 is: a - 14b = 242

Now we have a system of linear equations with two unknowns (a and b). We can solve this system to find the values of a and b.

Substituting the fourth data point (-18, 306):
306 = a + b(-18)

Substituting the fifth data point (-14, 242):
242 = a + b(-14)

Now, we have a system of equations. Let's solve it to find the values of a and b.

Subtracting equation (3) from equation (1):
162 - 82 = a - 9b - a + 4b
80 = -5b
b = -16

Substituting b = -16 into equation (1):
162 = a - 9(-16)
162 = a + 144
a = 18

a + 13(0) = 0
a = 0

Therefore, the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 becomes y = 0x^0 + 0x^1, which simplifies to y = 0.

So, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is y = 0.",1.0,"[14, -5]"
"The function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = 6x^0 + 10x^1",1.0,"[14, -5]"
"Based on the given inputs and outputs, the relationship between the input and output values can be represented by the equation:

Output: y = 12x + 165",1.0,"[14, -5]"
"The given data doesn't seem to follow a linear or exponential relationship. However, we can try to fit a quadratic function to the data points. Let's assume the function to be of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2.

Using the five given data points, we can set up a system of equations:

at x = 13: a + 13b + 169c = 177
at x = 14: a + 14b + 196c = 191
at x = -8: a - 8b + 64c = -117
at x = 3:  a + 3b + 9c = 37
at x = 7:  a + 7b + 49c = 93

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a, b, and c, which will define the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs.",0.0,"[14, -5]"
"Given the input-output pairs provided, we can try to find a function that captures the relationship. Based on the pattern observed, it seems that the function can be expressed as:

Output = a + b * Input

In this case, a represents the y-intercept (when Input = 0) and b represents the slope of the line. To determine the values of a and b, we can substitute each given input-output pair into the equation and solve for the coefficients.

Plugging in the values for the first input-output pair (Input = 13, Output = 177):

177 = a + b * 13

Plugging in the values for the second input-output pair (Input = 14, Output = 191):

191 = a + b * 14

Similarly for the third, fourth, and fifth input-output pairs, we can form additional equations.

The system of equations can then be solved to find the values of a and b, which will provide the specific function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs.",0.0,"[14, -5]"
