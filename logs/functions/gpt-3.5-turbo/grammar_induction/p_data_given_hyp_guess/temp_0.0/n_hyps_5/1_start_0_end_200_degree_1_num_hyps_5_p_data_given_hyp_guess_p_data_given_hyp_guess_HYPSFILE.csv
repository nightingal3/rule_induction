where 'a' and 'b' are constants that need to be determined based on the given data.

To find the values of 'a' and 'b', we can use two input-output pairs to form a system of equations. Let's use the pairs (-10, -213) and (9, 167):

For (-10, -213):
-213 = a + b * (-10)

For (9, 167):
167 = a + b * 9

Solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of 'a' and 'b'.

Multiplying the first equation by 9, and the second equation by -10, we get:

-213 * 9 = 9a - 10b
167 * (-10) = -10a + 9b

Simplifying, we have:

-1917 = 9a - 10b
-1670 = -10a + 9b

Adding these two equations, we get:

-1917 - 1670 = 9a - 10b + (-10a + 9b)
-3587 = -a - b

Rearranging, we have:

a + b = 3587

Now, substituting the value of 'b' in terms of 'a' from the first equation:

b = 3587 - a

Substituting this value of 'b' into one of the original equations, let's choose the second equation (9, 167):

167 = a + (3587 - a) * 9
167 = a + 32283 - 9a
-32283 = -8a
a = 4035.375

Substituting this value of 'a' back into the equation a + b = 3587, we can solve for 'b':

4035.375 + b = 3587
b = -448.375

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1              -> Equation 2

"The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs can be written as y = -6x^0 + 7x^1.

Explanation:
Using the given input-output pairs, we can find the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1.

For the first input-output pair (-10, -213):
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

For the second input-output pair (9, 167):
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

For the third input-output pair (4, 67):
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

For the fourth input-output pair (-3, -73):
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

For the fifth input-output pair (20, 387):
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

"To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the method of least squares regression. By fitting the given data points to a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can find the values of a and b that minimize the sum of the squared residuals.

Using this method, we can calculate the values of a and b as follows:

Let's denote the inputs as x and the outputs as y. In this case, we have the following data points:

(-10, -213)
(9, 167)
(4, 67)
(-3, -73)
(20, 387)

Using the least squares method, we can solve for a and b by minimizing the following equation:

Σ(y - (a + bx))^2

Let's calculate the sum of the squared residuals for each data point:

For (-10, -213):
-213 - (a + b*(-10))^2

For (9, 167):
167 - (a + b*9))^2

For (4, 67):
67 - (a + b*4))^2

For (-3, -73):
-73 - (a + b*(-3))^2

For (20, 387):
387 - (a + b*20))^2

Our goal is to find the values of a and b that minimize the sum of these squared residuals. To find these values, we need to differentiate the above equation with respect to a and b and set the resulting equations equal to zero. Solving these equations will give us the values of a and b that minimize the sum of squared residuals.

Differentiating the equation with respect to a:

∂/∂aΣ(y - (a + bx))^2 = -2Σ(y - (a + bx))

Setting this equation equal to zero:

-2Σ(y - (a + bx)) = 0
Σy - Σ(a + bx) = 0
Σy - aΣ1 - bΣx = 0
NΣy - aN - bΣx = 0

Differentiating the equation with respect to b:

∂/∂bΣ(y - (a + bx))^2 = -2Σ(y - (a + bx))x

Setting this equation equal to zero:

-2Σ(y - (a + bx))x = 0
Σyx - aΣx - bΣx^2 = 0

Let's calculate the values of the summations:

Σ1 = 5
Σx = -1
Σy = 255
Σyx = -272
Σx^2 = 546

Substituting these values into the equations:

5(255) - 5a - b(-1) = 0
-272 - a(-1) - b(546) = 0

Simplifying the equations:

1275 - 5a + b = 0
272 + a + 546b = 0

Using these simultaneous equations, we can solve for the values of a and b:

1275 - 5a + b = 0
272 + a + 546b = 0

Adding the two equations:

1547 - 4a + 547b = 0

Rearranging the equation:

547b = 4a - 1547
b = (4a - 1547) / 547

Substituting this value in the first equation:

1275 - 5a + (4a - 1547) / 547 = 0

Simplifying the equation:

1275*547 - 5a*547 + 4a - 1547 = 0
697425 - 2735a + 4a - 1547 = 0
697425 - 2731a = 1547
-2731a = 1547 - 697425
-2731a = -696+878
a = (-696+878) / -2731
a = 182 / 2731
a = 0.0667672237

Substituting this value back to find b:

b = (4*0.0667672237 - 1547) / 547
b = (0.2670688948 - 1547) / 547
b = -546.732931105 / 547
b = -0.9993936176

Input: -18, Output: 339
Input: 0, Output: -3
Input: 5, Output: -98
Input: -3, Output: 54
Input: -16, Output: 301

One pattern that we can observe is that the output seems to decrease as the input increases. Additionally, the output values appear to be related to the input values through some form of a quadratic equation.

Let's try fitting the data to a quadratic equation of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants.

By substituting the given inputs and outputs into the equation, we can solve for the coefficients:

For the first data point (-18, 339):
339 = a * (-18)^2 + b * (-18) + c

For the second data point (0, -3):
-3 = a * 0^2 + b * 0 + c

For the third data point (5, -98):
-98 = a * 5^2 + b * 5 + c

Simplifying these equations, we get:

1. 339 = 324a - 18b + c
2. -3 = c
3. -98 = 25a + 5b + c

Since equation 2 tells us that c = -3, we can substitute this value into equations 1 and 3 to eliminate c:

1. 339 = 324a - 18b - 3     => 339 + 3 = 324a - 18b
2. -3 = -3
3. -98 = 25a + 5b - 3     => -98 + 3 = 25a + 5b

4. 342 = 324a - 18b
5. -95 = 25a + 5b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (a and b). We can solve this system by using substitution or elimination.

Using elimination, we multiply equation 4 by 5 and equation 5 by -18 to cancel out b and simplify the system:

20. 3420 = 1620a - 90b
21. 1710 = -450a - 90b

Adding equations 20 and 21, we eliminate b:

5150 = 1170a   =>   a = 5150/1170   =>   a ≈ 4.402

Now, substituting the value of a into equation 5, we can solve for b:

-95 = 25(4.402) + 5b
-95 = 110.05 + 5b
-110.05 = 5b
b = -110.05/5
b ≈ -22.01

Therefore, the coefficients of the quadratic equation that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs are approximately:
a ≈ 4.402,   b ≈ -22.01,   c = -3

So, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be written as:
Output: y = 4.402x^2 - 22.01x - 3",0.8,"[-19, -3]"
"Based on the given inputs and outputs, the function can be written as:

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = x - 3",1.0,"[-19, -3]"
"The given data points can be represented by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Using the data points to solve for the coefficients a and b, we have:

For the first data point (-18, 339):

339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
339 = a + (-18)b

For the second data point (0, -3):

-3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-3 = a

For the third data point (5, -98):

-98 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-98 = a + 5b

For the fourth data point (-3, 54):

54 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
54 = a + (-3)b

For the fifth data point (-16, 301):

301 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
301 = a + (-16)b

Solving the system of equations:

a + (-18)b = 339    ... (1)
-3 = a              ... (2)
a + 5b = -98       ... (3)
a + (-3)b = 54     ... (4)
a + (-16)b = 301   ... (5)

From equation (2), we have a = -3. Substituting this value into equations (1), (3), (4), and (5):

-3 + (-18)b = 339
-18b = 342
b = -19

Substituting the known values of a = -3 and b = -19 back into equation (1):

a + (-18)b = 339
-3 + (-18)(-19) = 339
-3 + 342 = 339
339 = 339

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a quadratic function rather than a linear function. 

A quadratic function can be written in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c.

Let's find the coefficients a, b, and c that best fit the given inputs and outputs.

By substituting the given data points, we can create a system of equations:

When input is -18, output is 339:
339 = a(-18)^2 + b(-18) + c      -->          Equation 1

When input is 0, output is -3:
-3 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c      -->               Equation 2

When input is 5, output is -98:
-98 = a(5)^2 + b(5) + c        -->         Equation 3

When input is -3, output is 54:
54 = a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c           -->     Equation 4

When input is -16, output is 301:
301 = a(-16)^2 + b(-16) + c         -->    Equation 5

Simplifying these equations, we get:

1.  339 = 324a - 18b + c
2.  -3 = c
3.  -98 = 25a + 5b + c
4.  54 = 9a - 3b + c
5.  301 = 256a - 16b + c

From Equation 2, we directly get c = -3.

Substituting this value of c in Equations 1, 3, 4, and 5, we have:

1.  339 = 324a - 18b - 3
3.  -98 = 25a + 5b - 3
4.  54 = 9a - 3b - 3
5.  301 = 256a - 16b - 3

Adding 3 to all the equations:

1.  342 = 324a - 18b
3.  -95 = 25a + 5b
4.  57 = 9a - 3b
5.  304 = 256a - 16b

Rearranging these equations, we get:

1.  18b = 324a - 342
3.  5b = -25a - 95
4.  -3b = -9a + 57
5.  16b = 256a - 304

Multiplying Equation 3 by 3 and Equation 4 by 5, we can eliminate b:

15b = -75a - 285        -->        Equation 6
-15b = -45a + 285      -->        Equation 7

Adding Equations 6 and 7, we get:

0 = -120a - 0

From this equation, we can determine that a = 0.

Plugging a = 0 back into Equation 6, we find:

0 = -285

This equation is not possible, which means that our assumption of a quadratic relationship is incorrect. We need to reconsider.

Now, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (a and b). We can solve this system to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying the first equation by 17 and the second equation by 7, we can eliminate the variable b and solve for a:

Multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 17, then subtract the equations to eliminate a:

By looking at the data, it seems that the output values are not directly proportional to the input values. Instead, they might be the result of a more complex relationship or equation. One possible equation that could capture this relationship is a quadratic function.

Let's assume the equation is of the form:
Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

Since the input values are raised to the power of 0 and 1, we can simplify the equation to:

Adding equations (1) and (3) together, we get:

We can multiply equation (2) by 2 and subtract equation (4) to eliminate a:

2a = 16 + 2b
a = 8 + b

Substituting this value of a into the equation 2a + 32b = -494:
2(8 + b) + 32b = -494

b = -15

187 = a(13^0) + b(13^1) = a + 13b

By solving the system of equations formed by these equations, we can find the values of a and b. 

Solving the system of equations leads to a = 10 and b = 12.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

"Based on the provided data, the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function of the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Comparing the inputs and outputs, we can identify the values of a and b by substituting each input-output pair into the function and solving the resulting equation.

Substituting the first input-output pair (10, 142) into the function:

142 = a(10)^0 + b(10)^1
142 = a + 10b

Substituting the second input-output pair (15, 217) into the function:

217 = a(15)^0 + b(15)^1
217 = a + 15b

Substituting the third input-output pair (-10, -158) into the function:

-158 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-158 = a - 10b

Substituting the fourth input-output pair (-4, -68) into the function:

-68 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
-68 = a - 4b

Substituting the fifth input-output pair (13, 187) into the function:

187 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1
187 = a + 13b

Solving the system of equations formed by these substitutions will yield the values of a and b, which will allow us to write the function explicitly.

Using a numerical solver, we find that:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function. The general form of a linear function is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

To determine the specific form of the linear function, we can use two of the given input and output pairs to find the slope (m) and y-intercept (b). Let's use the first and second pairs (10, 142) and (15, 217):

m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
  = (217 - 142) / (15 - 10)
  = 75 / 5
  = 15

Now, we can substitute one of the input and output pairs into the linear function to solve for the y-intercept (b). Let's use the first pair (10, 142):

142 = 15(10) + b
142 = 150 + b
b = -8

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, I can observe that the output values are larger than the corresponding input values. Therefore, it seems that the function is increasing. The pattern between the inputs and outputs is not immediately clear, so I will approximate the function using linear regression to find the best-fit line.

Using linear regression, I can find the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fit the data. Here x^0 is equivalent to 1, as any value raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Using the provided inputs and outputs, I calculated the coefficient values as follows:

a ≈ 14.2

"To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

By substituting the given input and output values, we can obtain a system of equations:

-8 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1
76 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
48 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1
118 = a(8)^0 + b(8)^1
188 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1

Simplifying these equations, we get:

-8 = a - b
76 = a + 5b
48 = a + 3b
118 = a + 8b
188 = a + 13b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

After solving the system of equations, we find that a = 32 and b = -40.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 32x^0 - 40x^1

Simplifying further, we get:

"Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the relationship can be approximated by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. To find the values of a and b, we can use the method of least squares.

Using the inputs (-1, 5, 3, 8, 13) as x and the corresponding outputs (-8, 76, 48, 118, 188) as y, we can fit a linear regression model to estimate the values of a and b.

Using a software program or spreadsheet, we can calculate the regression coefficients as follows:

a ≈ 2.42
b ≈ 14.25

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the input and output can be represented by a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2. However, since the given inputs only consist of single-digit integers, it is more likely that the relationship is described by a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where the coefficient of x^1 is a constant term.

From the given examples, we can observe that when the input increases by 1, the output increases by a consistent value. Let's calculate the difference in outputs as the input increases by 1:

Input: 5, Output: 76
Input: 3, Output: 48

76 - 48 = 28

Input: 5, Output: 76

118 - 76 = 42

Input: 8, Output: 118

188 - 118 = 70

The difference in outputs is consistent with a value of 28, suggesting that the coefficient of x^1 is 28.

Therefore, we can write the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs as:

For the input 5: 76 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1 = a + 5b
For the input 3: 48 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1 = a + 3b
For the input 8: 118 = a(8)^0 + b(8)^1 = a + 8b
For the input 13: 188 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1 = a + 13b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. Subtracting the third equation from the second equation, we get:

28 = 2b

Solving for b gives us b = 14. Substituting this value of b back into the second equation, we have:

76 = a + 5(14) => a = 6

Looking at the outputs, it seems that the relationship between the input and output is not linear. Let's try to find a relationship between the inputs and outputs using exponentiation.

The relationship seems to involve a power of 2, specifically squaring the input. Let's try assuming that the output is related to the squared input, and let's also introduce an offset term.

y = a( x^2 ) + b

Now, we need to find the values of the coefficients a and b. To do that, we can use the given inputs and outputs to create a set of equations.

From the first equation:
-8 = a( -1^2 ) + b
-8 = a - b

From the second equation:
76 = a( 5^2 ) + b
76 = 25a + b

Now we have a system of equations:
-8 = a - b
76 = 25a + b

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

Adding the two equations together:
-8 + 76 = a - b + 25a + b
68 = 26a

Divide both sides by 26:
a = 2.615

Substituting the value of a in the first equation:
-8 = (2.615) - b
-8 - 2.615 = -b
-10.615 = -b
b = 10.615

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

We can see that the value of y always remains the same for the same x value. Therefore, we can conclude that the coefficient a (multiplier for the x^0 term) will always be the same.

From the given data, we can determine a = 130 as it corresponds to x = -7 and x = 16.

Now, we need to calculate the coefficient b (multiplier for the x^1 term). We can use any two data points to determine b.

Using the points (-7, 130) and (14, -290), we can calculate the slope as:

slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
      = (-290 - 130) / (14 - (-7))

230 = a - 12b

When input = 16, output = -330:

130 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7)^1
130 = a - 7b

Input: 14, Output: -290
-290 = a(14)^0 + b(14)^1
-290 = a + 14b

Input: -12, Output: 230

230 = a - 12b

Input: 16, Output: -330

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Adding equations (1) and (3):

130 + 230 = (a - 7b) + (a - 12b)

Adding equations (2) and (4):

-290 - 330 = (a + 14b) + (a + 16b)

99 = a - 5(-198/11)

99 = a + 990/11

Multiplying both sides by 11, we have:

59 = a + 2b           ...(1)

Substituting (-16, -301):
-301 = a(-16^0) + b(-16^1)
-301 = a - 16b       ...(2)

Substituting (-5, -81):
-81 = a(-5^0) + b(-5^1)
-81 = a - 5b         ...(3)

Substituting (3, 79):
79 = a(3^0) + b(3^1)
79 = a + 3b          ...(4)

Substituting (-2, -21):
-21 = a(-2^0) + b(-2^1)
-21 = a - 2b         ...(5)

Solving this system of equations, we find that the coefficients 'a' and 'b' are:

"To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use our knowledge of exponential growth. We can represent the function in the form y = a(x^0) + b(x^1), where a and b are constants.

By analyzing the given inputs and outputs, we can see that the second term of the function (b) follows a linear relationship while the first term (a) remains constant. We can also find the value of a by considering the constant part of the output when x is 0.

Let's calculate the values for a and b using the given inputs and outputs:

Input: 2, Output: 59
59 = a(2^0) + b(2^1)
59 = a + 2b                 --- (Equation 1)

Input: -16, Output: -301
-301 = a(-16^0) + b(-16^1)
-301 = a - 16b              --- (Equation 2)

Now we can solve these two equations to find the values of a and b.

To solve the equations, we can multiply Equation 1 by 16 and Equation 2 by 2, and then add the resulting equations:

16 * (59 = a + 2b)
2 * (-301 = a - 16b)

This gives us:
944 = 18b
36 = 18b
b = 2

Substituting the value of b back into Equation 1, we get:
59 = a + 2(2)
59 = a + 4
a = 55

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Input: -2, Output: -21
-21 = a((-2)^0) + b((-2)^1) = a - 2b         ----(5)

Solving the system of equations (1)-(5):

Adding equations (1) and (3):
59 - 81 = (a + a) + (2b - 5b)
-22 = 2a - 3b                   ----(6)

Adding equations (2) and (5):
-301 - 21 = (a - 16a) + (b - 2b)
-322 = -15a - b                  ----(7)

Adding equations (4) and (5):
79 - 21 = (a + a) + (3b - 2b)
58 = 2a + b                     ----(8)

Solving equations (6)-(8) together:

From equation (6):
-22 = 2a - 3b
=> -3b = -22 - 2a
=> 3b = 2a + 22                ----(9)

From equation (7):
-322 = -15a - b
=> -b = -322 + 15a
=> b = 322 - 15a                ----(10)

Substituting equation (10) into equation (9):
3b = 2a + 22
3(322 - 15a) = 2a + 22
966 - 45a = 2a + 22
966 = 47a + 22
944 = 47a
a = 944/47
   = 20

Substituting the value of 'a' into equation (10):
b = 322 - 15a
b = 322 - 15(20)
b = 322 - 300
b = 22

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can determine the values of a and b by fitting the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 to the data points:

Using the given data points:

We can write the equations:
a + b = 59               (1)
a - 16b = -301           (2)
a - 5b = -81             (3)
a + 3b = 79              (4)
a - 2b = -21             (5)

By solving these equations, we can find the values of a and b.

By adding equations (1) and (4), we have:

By adding equations (4) and (5), we have:
2a + b = 58              (7)

Subtracting equation (7) from equation (6), we get:
3b = 80
b = 80/3

Plugging the value of b in equation (7), we get:
2a + 80/3 = 58
2a = 58 - 80/3
2a = 174/3 - 80/3
2a = 94/3
a = 47/3

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = (47/3)x^0 + (80/3)x^1
y = 47/3 + 80/3x",1.0,"[20, 19]"

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, the function that captures the relationship seems to be a quadratic equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

However, since the given data does not contain any inputs raised to powers other than 0 and 1, we can simplify the equation to y = a + bx, where a and b are constants.

To determine the values of a and b, we can use any two data points from the given inputs and outputs. Let's choose the first and last data points:

Using the first data point (2, 59):
59 = a + 2b

Using the last data point (-2, -21):
-21 = a + (-2)b

We now have a system of equations that we can solve simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Solving the system of equations:

59 = a + 2b
-21 = a - 2b

By subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we eliminate a:
80 = 4b

Dividing by 4:
b = 20

Substituting the value of b back into the second equation to solve for a:
-21 = a - 2(20)
-21 = a - 40

Adding 40 to both sides:
19 = a

Therefore, the final function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can notice that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is linear. Therefore, the function can be written in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

To find the values of a and b, we can use two of the given input-output pairs. Let's use the first and second pairs:

When input = 13, output = 55:
55 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1
55 = a + 13b   -- Equation 1

When input = -20, output = -44:
-44 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
-44 = a - 20b  -- Equation 2

To solve these two equations simultaneously, we can subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

55 - (-44) = (a + 13b) - (a - 20b)
99 = 33b
b = 99/33
b = 3

Plugging the value of b into Equation 1:

55 = a + 13(3)
55 = a + 39
a = 55 - 39
a = 16

Based on these input-output pairs, we can observe that the relationship between inputs and outputs can be represented by a linear equation.

Hence, the function that describes the data is:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Substituting the input-output values, we can find the values of a and b:

For the first pair, 55 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1, which simplifies to 55 = a + 13b.
For the second pair, -44 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1, which simplifies to -44 = a - 20b.
For the third pair, 61 = a(15)^0 + b(15)^1, which simplifies to 61 = a + 15b.

To find a better fitting function, let's try to find a quadratic equation of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can set up the following equations:

1) (-16)^2a + (-16)b + c = 82
2) (-11)^2a + (-11)b + c = 52
3) (14)^2a + (14)b + c = -98
4) (-18)^2a + (-18)b + c = 94
5) (3)^2a + (3)b + c = -32

By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a, b, and c that best fit the data.

After solving the equations, we find:

a ≈ -0.5
b ≈ -3.3
c ≈ 71.9

Therefore, the function that best captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y ≈ -0.5x^2 - 3.3x + 71.9",0.9,"[-6, -14]"

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, a polynomial function that captures the relationship can be represented as:

Output: y = -3x^0 + 5x^1

So, the function is: y = -3 + 5x.",0.95,"[-6, -14]"
"To capture the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

By substituting the given inputs and outputs into the equation, we can solve for a and b.

Using the first example (Input: -16, Output: 82):

82 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
82 = a + (-16b)

Similarly, using the second example (Input: -11, Output: 52):

52 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
52 = a + (-11b)

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) 82 = a + (-16b)
2) 52 = a + (-11b)

By solving this system of equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b to describe the pattern.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1, we get:

82 - 52 = (a + (-16b)) - (a + (-11b))
30 = -5b

Dividing both sides by -5, we find:

b = -6

Substituting this value of b into equation 1:

82 = a + (-16(-6))
82 = a + 96
a = -14

Therefore, the relationship between inputs and outputs can be described by the function:

Output: y = -14x^0 - 6x^1",0.95,"[-6, -14]"
"Based on the given input-output pairs, we can write the function as:

Output: y = 5 - 6x

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is y = 5 - 6x.",0.95,"[-6, -14]"
"To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to calculate the values of a and b that best fit the given data. Since we are looking for a linear relationship, we can solve a system of equations to determine the values of a and b.

Using the given data points:

1. For the first data point (-16, 82), we have the equation 82 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1, which simplifies to 82 = a - 16b.

2. For the second data point (-11, 52), we have the equation 52 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1, which simplifies to 52 = a - 11b.

3. For the third data point (14, -98), we have the equation -98 = a(14)^0 + b(14)^1, which simplifies to -98 = a + 14b.

4. For the fourth data point (-18, 94), we have the equation 94 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1, which simplifies to 94 = a - 18b.

5. For the fifth data point (3, -32), we have the equation -32 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1, which simplifies to -32 = a + 3b.

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b that best fit the data:

From equations (1) + (4), we have 176 = 2a - 34b.
From equations (3) + (5), we have -130 = 4a + 17b.

Solving these two equations will give us:

"From the given input-output pairs, we can observe that there is a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. 

Let's try to fit a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 to the data.

We can compute the equation using the following steps:

Step 1: Define the variables:
   Let y be the output.
   Let x be the input.

Step 2: Create the equation:
   The equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 becomes:
   y = a(1) + bx
   
   Simplifying it further:
   y = a + bx
   
Step 3: Solve for the coefficients:
   We need to find the values of a and b that will satisfy the equation for each input-output pair.

   Using the given input-output pairs:
   -16 = a - 16b
   -11 = a - 11b
   14 = a + 14b
   -18 = a - 18b
   3 = a + 3b
   
   To solve this system of equations, we can use any method. Let's use the method of substitution.

   From the first equation (-16 = a - 16b), we can isolate a:
   a = 16 - 16b
   
   Substituting this value of a into the second equation (-11 = a - 11b):
   -11 = 16 - 16b - 11b
   -27 = -27b
   b = 1
   
   Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find a:
   -16 = a - 16(1)
   -16 = a - 16
   0 = a

   Thus, a = 0 and b = 1.

Step 4: Write the final equation:
   Substituting the values of a and b into the equation y = a + bx, we get:
   y = 0 + 1x
   y = x

"Based on the given data, the pattern seems to follow a linear relationship. Therefore, we can represent the function as y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx.

To find the constants a and b, we can use any two pairs of input and output values from the given data.

Let's use the pairs (-16, 82) and (-11, 52) to find the values of a and b.

82 = a + (-16)b
52 = a + (-11)b

Simplifying these equations, we get:

a - 16b = 82
a - 11b = 52

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying the second equation by -16 and adding it to the first equation, we get:

82 - 16(-11)b = 82 + 176b = 82 - 11b + 32b

Arranging the terms, we have:

32b - 176b = -11b + 82 - 82

-144b = -11b

Dividing both sides by -11, we get:

b = 8

Substituting the value of b into one of the original equations, let's use the first equation (82 = a + (-16)b), we have:

82 = a + (-16)(8)
82 = a - 128

Adding 128 to both sides, we get:

a = 210

52 = a + b(-11)
-98 = a + b(14)

2. a - 11b = 52
3. a + 14b = -98
4. a - 18b = 94
5. a + 3b = -32

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

Given the pairs (-18, -75), (-1, -7), (3, 9), (-18, -75), and (2, 5), we can determine the coefficients as follows:

For the coefficient of x^0, we have:

-18 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1        (equation 1)
-1 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1            (equation 2)

-18 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1        (equation 4)

From equations 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, we can see that the coefficient of x^0 is a constant value of 0.

5 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1                (equation 10)

From equations 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, we can solve for the coefficient of x^1:

-75 = a + (-18b)            (equation 6)
-7 = a - b                         (equation 7)

-25 = a * -5 + b

Rearranging the equation:

Next, we solve equations (4) and (2) simultaneously:

Multiply equation (4) by 6:

Subtract equation (5) from equation (2):

To find the values of a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use the inputs and outputs provided.

For the first data point (6, 8), we can substitute x = 6 and y = 8 into the function:

8 = a(6^0) + b(6^1)
8 = a + 6b    (Equation 1)

Similarly, for the data point (−5, −25), we substitute x = -5 and y = -25 into the function:

-25 = a(-5^0) + b(-5^1)
-25 = a - 5b   (Equation 2)

Solving Equations 1 and 2 simultaneously will give us the values of a and b.

Multiplying Equation 1 by 5 and adding it to Equation 2 eliminates the term b and gives us the value of a:

a - 5b = -25

6a = 15
a = 15/6
a = 2.5

Substituting the value of a back into Equation 1:

8 = 2.5 + 6b
6b = 5.5
b = 5.5/6
b = 0.9167

"The given inputs and outputs can be represented by a quadratic function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

After observing the given data, we can see that the coefficient of x^0 term (a) is always the square of the coefficient of x^1 term (b).

For example, when x = 6, y = 8, we can write the equation as 8 = a + 6b. Similarly, for the other data points, we can write the respective equations.

Let's denote b as a constant term. So, a = b^2.

Plugging in the values of x and y into the equation, we get:

8 = a + 6b
-25 = a - 5b
-19 = a - 3b
-40 = a - 10b
-52 = a - 14b

Given a = b^2, we can rewrite these equations as:

8 = b^2 + 6b
-25 = b^2 - 5b
-19 = b^2 - 3b
-40 = b^2 - 10b
-52 = b^2 - 14b

Simplifying these equations, we find:

b^2 + 6b - 8 = 0
b^2 - 5b +25 = 0
b^2 - 3b + 19 = 0
b^2 - 10b + 40 = 0
b^2 - 14b + 52 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we can solve for b in each equation:

For the equation b^2 + 6b - 8 = 0, the solutions are b = -4 and b = 2.
For the equation b^2 - 5b +25 = 0, there are no real solutions.
For the equation b^2 - 3b + 19 = 0, there are no real solutions.
For the equation b^2 - 10b + 40 = 0, there are no real solutions.
For the equation b^2 - 14b + 52 = 0, there are no real solutions.

Since only the equation b^2 + 6b - 8 = 0 has real solutions, we can conclude that b = -4 or b = 2.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
