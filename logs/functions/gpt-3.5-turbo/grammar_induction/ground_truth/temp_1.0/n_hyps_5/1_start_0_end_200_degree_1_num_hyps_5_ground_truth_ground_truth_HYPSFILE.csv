"To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use linear regression. Linear regression fits a straight line to the data points, minimizing the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual values. 

The general form of the linear regression equation is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can calculate the slope and y-intercept using linear regression.

Input: -10, Output: -213

b = (Σy - m * Σx) / n

where n is the number of data points, Σ is the summation symbol, and x and y represent the inputs and outputs.

Calculating:

n = 5
Σ(x * y) = -10 * -213 + 9 * 167 + 4 * 67 + -3 * -73 + 20 * 387 = -2130 + 1503 + 268 + 219 + 7740 = 9910
Σx = -10 + 9 + 4 + -3 + 20 = 20
Σy = -213 + 167 + 67 + -73 + 387 = 335
Σ(x^2) = (-10)^2 + 9^2 + 4^2 + (-3)^2 + 20^2 = 100 + 81 + 16 + 9 + 400 = 606

It is possible that there is a non-linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. Therefore, a more complex function or additional data points would be needed to accurately capture the relationship.",-34939.0,"[-18, -19]"
"To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to identify the patterns in the data. Let's start by writing down the inputs and outputs:

Input: -2, 7, -10, 9, -20
Output: 17, -145, 161, -181, 341

By examining the data, we can see that the coefficient ""a"" in the function seems to be alternating between positive and negative values. Additionally, the coefficient ""b"" appears to be changing by a constant factor of -2 each time. 

Based on these observations, we can write the function as follows:

Output: y = a + bx

We can now substitute the input values and output values from the given data to find the values of ""a"" and ""b"" that best fit the data:

When x = -2, y = 17:
17 = a - 2b

When x = 7, y = -145:
-145 = a + 14b

When x = -10, y = 161:
161 = a - 20b

When x = 9, y = -181:
-181 = a + 18b

When x = -20, y = 341:
341 = a - 40b

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations to find the values of ""a"" and ""b"".

Adding the first and third equation, we have:
17 + 161 = 2a - 22b
178 = 2a - 22b    - (Eq. 4)

Adding the second and fourth equation, we have:
-145 + (-181) = 2a + 32b
-326 = 2a + 32b    - (Eq. 5)

Multiplying Eq. 4 by 16, we have:
16(178) = 16(2a - 22b)
2848 = 32a - 352b    - (Eq. 6)

Subtracting Eq. 5 from Eq. 6, we have:
2848 - (-326) = 32a - 352b - (2a + 32b)
3174 = 30a - 384b
1063 = 10a - 128b    - (Eq. 7)

Adding Eq. 7 and Eq. 5, we have:
1063 + (-326) = 10a - 128b + (2a + 32b)
737 = 12a - 96b
737/12 = a - 8b    - (Eq. 8)

Now, we have two equations (Eq. 7 and Eq. 8) in two variables ""a"" and ""b"". Solving these equations will give us the values of ""a"" and ""b"".

From Eq. 7:
1063 = 10a - 128b
=> 10a = 1063 + 128b
=> a = (1063 + 128b)/10

Substituting this value of ""a"" in Eq. 8, we get:
737/12 = (1063 + 128b)/10 - 8b
=> 737/12 = (1063 + 128b - 80b)/10
=> 7370 = 10630 + 480b - 800b
=> 7370 = 10630 - 320b
=> 320b = 10630 - 7370
=> 320b = 3260
=> b = 3260/320
=> b = 10.1875

Substituting this value of ""b"" in Eq. 7, we have:
1063 = 10a - 128(10.1875)
1063 = 10a - 1306
=> 10a = 1063 + 1306
=> 10a = 2369
=> a = 2369/10
=> a = 236.9

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be written as:

To determine the value of b, we can substitute one of the input-output pairs into the equation. Let's use the first pair (-2, 17):

Using the second pair of data points (-1, 8):

8 = a + b * -1

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b, which will allow us to write the function explicitly.

Let's solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

From the second equation, we have:

Substituting this value into the first equation, we get:

Multiplying the second equation by 20 and adding it to the first equation:

Now, we can solve this equation for either a or b and substitute into one of the other equations to find the remaining variable.

Let's solve for a in terms of b:
a = (-21 - 19b) / 21

Substituting this value of a into the first equation:
20 = (-21 - 19b) / 21 + b(20)

Simplifying further:
20 = (-21 - 19b) / 21 + 20b

Multiplying every term by 21 to eliminate the denominator:

Combining like terms:
420 = 401b - 21

Adding 21 to both sides:

Now we have a system of equations that we can solve using any method (e.g., substitution, elimination, matrices). However, solving this system of equations may be cumbersome due to the presence of fractional coefficients.

Alternatively, we can observe that the difference between subsequent output values is increasing by a constant factor.

The differences between the outputs can be calculated as follows:
-8 - 0 = -8
76 - (-8) = 84
48 - 76 = -28
118 - 48 = 70
188 - 118 = 70

The differences between the inputs are constant:
5 - (-1) = 6

8 - 3 = 5

Simplifying the equation, we find that b = 4.

Substituting the value of b into equation (2), we get:

The best-fit line equation is given by:

Let's use the linear regression method to find the values of a and b.

Input: -9  Output: 64
Input: -3  Output: 22

Using the method of linear regression, we can calculate the coefficients a and b that minimize the sum of squared residuals.

Calculating a and b using linear regression:

The sum of x^0 (constant) and x^1 is:
Σx^0 = 5 (since x^0 = 1 for all data points)
Σx^1 = -9 + -3 + 9 + -5 + -16 = -24

The sum of y, x^0*y, and x^1*y is:
Σy = 64 + 22 - 62 + 36 + 113 = 173
Σx^0*y = 5*173 = 865
Σx^1*y = (-9)*64 + (-3)*22 + 9*(-62) + (-5)*36 + (-16)*113 = -1319

Using the formulas for a and b in linear regression:

a = (Σx^1 * Σx^0*y - Σy * Σx^1*y) / (Σx^0 * Σx^0 - Σx^1 * Σx^1)
b = (Σx^0 * Σx^1*y - Σx^1 * Σx^0*y) / (Σx^0 * Σx^0 - Σx^1 * Σx^1)

Plugging in the values:

a = (-24 * 865 - 173 * -1319) / (5 * 5 - (-24 * -24))
b = (5 * -1319 - (-24) * 865) / (5 * 5 - (-24 * -24))

Simplifying the calculations:

a ≈ 6.121
b ≈ -6.367

Therefore, the best-fit line equation that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is approximately:
y ≈ 6.121 * x^0 + (-6.367) * x^1

We can represent this data in the form of equations:

265 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
195 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)^1

As we observe the inputs and outputs, it seems that the output is obtained by multiplying the input by a certain factor (a) and then adding a constant term (b). 

Let's represent the input as x and the output as y. We can write the function as:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Since x^0 is equal to 1, the function simplifies to:

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation. Let's use the first pair (input: -17, output: -310):

-310 = a + b(-17)

Solving for a and b, we obtain:

Input: 16, Output: 238

To find a and b, we can set up a system of equations using the data points:

9 = a + 9b     (Equation 1)
133 = a + 19b   (Equation 2)
238 = a + 16b   (Equation 3)
-212 = a - 14b  (Equation 4)
-242 = a - 16b  (Equation 5)

Solving this system of equations:

Adding Equation 5 to Equation 4, we get:
(-212) + (-242) = (a - 14b) + (a - 16b)
-454 = 2a - 30b          (Equation 6)

Adding Equation 6 to Equation 3, we get:
-454 + 238 = (2a - 30b) + (a + 16b)
-216 = 3a - 14b           (Equation 7)

Multiplying Equation 1 by 3, we get:
27 = 3a + 27b            (Equation 8)

Subtracting Equation 7 from Equation 8, we get:
27 - (-216) = (3a + 27b) - (3a - 14b)
243 = 41b                  (Equation 9)

Solving Equation 9, we find:
b = 243/41
b = 5.926

Substituting the value of b into Equation 1, we get:
9 = a + 9(5.926)
9 = a + 53.337

To find the values of a and b, we can use the equation of a line, y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.

Let's calculate the slope, m, using two pairs of inputs and outputs:

For inputs 9 and 16:
Output for 9 (y1) = 133
Output for 16 (y2) = 238

Slope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (238 - 133) / (16 - 9) = 105 / 7 = 15

Next, we can calculate the y-intercept, c, using one of the input-output pairs:

Using the equation y = mx + c, we can rearrange it to solve for c:

c = y - mx

c = -212 - (-14) * 15 = -212 + 210 = -2

Let's first identify the values of a and b by substituting the input-output pairs into the equation:

Input: 13, Output: 55
55 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)

-44 = a - 20b

Input: 15, Output: 61
61 = a(15^0) + b(15^1)
61 = a + 15b

13 = a(-1^0) + b(-1^1)
13 = a - b

Input: -14, Output: -26

c = 23.31

Substituting the value of c back into our expression for b, we get:

Output = 12 + 13x",-189.2,"[14, -5]"
Output: y = 14x^0 + 13x^1,-238.0,"[14, -5]"
"Based on the given inputs and outputs, let's try to find a pattern that best describes the relationship between them.

Input: 13 --> Output: 177
Input: 14 --> Output: 191
Input: -8 --> Output: -117
Input: 3 --> Output: 37
Input: 7 --> Output: 93

By inspecting the outputs, we notice that they are all greater than the inputs. Additionally, there is a consistent difference between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. 

To formulate a function that captures this relationship, let's assume the function is of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

In this case, y = ax^0 accounts for the consistent difference between the inputs and outputs, while bx^1 addresses the fact that the outputs are consistently greater than the inputs.

To determine the coefficients a and b, we can use the following approach:

1. For the constant term (ax^0), we can select any of the outputs corresponding to an input of 3 or 7. Let's use the output for an input of 3: 37 = a * 3^0 + b * 3^1.
   Simplifying this equation gives us: 37 = a + 3b.

2. For the coefficient of x (bx^1), we can use the outputs for inputs of 13 and 14. Let's use the output for an input of 14: 191 = a * 14^0 + b * 14^1.
   Simplifying this equation gives us: 191 = a + 14b.

Now, we have a system of two linear equations:

1. 37 = a + 3b
2. 191 = a + 14b

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b, which can be used to define the function.

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we get:

191 - 37 = a + 14b - a - 3b
154 = 11b

Solving for b:

b = 154/11 = 14

Substituting the value of b back into equation 1:

37 = a + 3(14)
37 = a + 42
a = -5

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -5x^0 + 14x^1

Simplifying the function, we have:

Output: y = -5 + 14x",-0.0,"[14, -5]"

"Given the data, we can assume that the function is of the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

To determine the values of a and b, we can use two data points from the given input-output pairs:

When input is 13, output is 177:
177 = a(13^0) + b(13^1) = a + 13b     ----(1)

When input is 14, output is 191:
191 = a(14^0) + b(14^1) = a + 14b     ----(2)

Solving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously will give us the values of a and b.",-inf,"[14, -5]"
"Based on the given data points, it seems like there is a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. The function can be written as y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

By substituting the input-output pairs into this equation, we can solve for the values of a and b.

Input: 13, Output: 177
177 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1
177 = a + 13b

Input: 14, Output: 191
191 = a(14)^0 + b(14)^1
191 = a + 14b

Input: -8, Output: -117
-117 = a(-8)^0 + b(-8)^1
-117 = a - 8b

Input: 3, Output: 37
37 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1
37 = a + 3b

Input: 7, Output: 93
93 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1
93 = a + 7b

To solve this system of equations, we can use various methods such as substitution or elimination. However, since there are only two unknowns (a and b), we can also use matrix notation to solve it.

Rewriting the system of equations in matrix form:

[ 1   13 ] [ a ]   [ 177 ]
[ 1   14 ] [ b ] = [ 191 ]
[ 1   -8 ]          [ -117 ]
[ 1   3 ]           [ 37 ]
[ 1   7 ]           [ 93 ]

Using matrix notation, the equation can be written as:

Ax = b

where A = [ 1   13 ; 1   14 ; 1   -8 ; 1   3 ; 1   7 ], x = [ a ; b ], and b = [ 177 ; 191 ; -117 ; 37 ; 93 ].

Solving for x, we have:

x = (A^T * A)^-1 * A^T * b
