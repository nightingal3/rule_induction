"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the input (x) and output (y) follows a linear function. Therefore, the function can be written as:

Output: y = a * x^0 + b * x^1

Let's substitute the given inputs and outputs into this equation to find the values of 'a' and 'b':

For the first example:
Input: -10
Output: -213

-213 = a * (-10)^0 + b * (-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10b)

For the second example:
Input: 9
Output: 167

167 = a * 9^0 + b * 9^1
167 = a + 9b

For the third example:
Input: 4
Output: 67

67 = a * 4^0 + b * 4^1
67 = a + 4b

For the fourth example:
Input: -3
Output: -73

-73 = a * (-3)^0 + b * (-3)^1
-73 = a + (-3b)

For the fifth example:
Input: 20
Output: 387

387 = a * 20^0 + b * 20^1
387 = a + 20b

Now we have a system of equations. By solving this system, we can find the values of 'a' and 'b' that satisfy all the given inputs and outputs.

Solving the system of equations using any method, we find:
a = -7
b = 20

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
Output: y = -7 * x^0 + 20 * x^1

Simplifying this expression, we get:
Output: y = -7 + 20x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1. Let's solve for the values of a and b using the given inputs and outputs.

Input: -10, Output: -213

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10b)

Input: 9, Output: 167

167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Input: 4, Output: 67

67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Input: -3, Output: -73

-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

Input: 20, Output: 387

387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Now we have a system of equations:

-213 = a + (-10b)
167 = a + 9b
67 = a + 4b
-73 = a - 3b
387 = a + 20b

To solve the system of equations, we can subtract the last equation from each of the first four equations:

-600 = -30b  --> b = 20

Substituting b=20 into the second equation:
167 = a + 9(20)
167 = a + 180
a = -13

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship is:

    The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs can be written as:

Output: y = -3x^0 - 19x^1

Explanation:
- For the coefficient of x^0, we find that when x = 0, the output is -3. Hence, the coefficient is -3.
- For the coefficient of x^1, we observe that when x = -18, the output is 339. By substituting these values into the function equation, we find that -3(-18)^0 - 19(-18)^1 = 339, which holds true.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given data points to determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the given data:
Input: -18, Output: 339
339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
339 = a + (-18)b

Input: 0, Output: -3
-3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-3 = a

Input: 5, Output: -98
-98 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-98 = a + 5b

Input: -3, Output: 54
54 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
54 = a - 3b

Input: -16, Output: 301
301 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
301 = a - 16b

From the second equation, we know that a = -3. Substituting this value in the remaining equations, we get:
339 = -3 + (-18)b
-98 = -3 + 5b
54 = -3 - 3b
301 = -3 - 16b

Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that b = -15 and a = -3.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
Output: y = -3x^0 + (-15)x^1

    The given data points can be represented by a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, where a and b are unknown coefficients.

We can express the relationship as follows:

For the first data point (5, -31): -31 = a(5^0) + b(5^1) => -31 = a + 5b

For the second data point (9, -51): -51 = a(9^0) + b(9^1) => -51 = a + 9b

For the third data point (-11, 49): 49 = a((-11)^0) + b((-11)^1) => 49 =  a - 11b

For the fourth data point (-4, 14): 14 = a((-4)^0) + b((-4)^1) => 14 = a - 4b

For the fifth data point (-12, 54):  54 = a((-12)^0) + b((-12)^1) => 54 = a - 12b

Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of a and b, and we can derive the specific function.

By solving these equations, we find that a = -3 and b = -6.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can first observe that the output seems to be related to the input through linear terms. We will use a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 represents the constant term and x^1 represents the linear term.

From the given inputs and outputs, we can construct the following equations:

For the input-output pair (5, -31):
-31 = a(5^0) + b(5^1)
-31 = a + 5b     (Equation 1)

For the input-output pair (9, -51):
-51 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)
-51 = a + 9b     (Equation 2)

For the input-output pair (-11, 49):
49 = a((-11)^0) + b((-11)^1)
49 = a - 11b     (Equation 3)

For the input-output pair (-4, 14):
14 = a((-4)^0) + b((-4)^1)
14 = a - 4b       (Equation 4)

For the input-output pair (-12, 54):
54 = a((-12)^0) + b((-12)^1)
54 = a - 12b     (Equation 5)

To solve this system of linear equations, we can use any method, such as substitution or matrix algebra. Let's use substitution to solve for a and b:

From Equation 1, we can express a in terms of b:
a = -31 - 5b

Substituting this expression for a back into Equation 2:
-51 = (-31 - 5b) + 9b

Simplifying, we get:
-51 = -31 + 4b
-20 = 4b
b = -5

Substituting the value of b into Equation 1:
a = -31 - 5(-5)
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

Therefore, we have found the values of a and b to be a = -6 and b = -5.

    In order to find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's first determine the values of a and b by substituting the given inputs and outputs.

Substituting the input-output pairs (-13, -197), (-11, -169), (-10, -155), and (7, 83), we get the following equations:

-197 = a * (-13)^0 + b * (-13)^1
-169 = a * (-11)^0 + b * (-11)^1
-155 = a * (-10)^0 + b * (-10)^1
83 = a * 7^0 + b * 7^1

Simplifying these equations, we get:

-197 = a + (-13)b
-169 = a + (-11)b
-155 = a + (-10)b
83 = a + 7b

We have a system of four equations with two unknowns (a and b). Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b.

To solve these equations, let's use the substitution method. Starting with the first equation, we can isolate a in terms of b:

a = -197 - (-13)b
a = -197 + 13b

Substituting this expression of a into the other equations, we get:

-169 = (-197 + 13b) + (-11)b
-155 = (-197 + 13b) + (-10)b
83 = (-197 + 13b) + 7b

Simplifying these equations further, we have:

-169 = -197 + 13b - 11b
-155 = -197 + 13b - 10b
83 = -197 + 13b + 7b

-169 = -197 + 2b
-155 = -197 + 3b
83 = -197 + 20b

Solving these equations, we find b = 14 and a = -9.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the input and output can be describe by a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x represents the input and y represents the output. 

Let's try to find the values of a and b using the given data points:

For input x = 9, output y = 160:
160 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)
160 = a + 9b

For input x = 13, output y = 228:
228 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
228 = a + 13b

For input x = -4, output y = -61:
-61 = a(-4^0) + b(-4^1)
-61 = a - 4b

For input x = 15, output y = 262:
262 = a(15^0) + b(15^1)
262 = a + 15b

For input x = -20, output y = -333:
-333 = a(-20^0) + b(-20^1)
-333 = a - 20b

We now have a system of equations:

a + 9b = 160
a + 13b = 228
a - 4b = -61
a + 15b = 262
a - 20b = -333

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = 16 and b = 17.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems like the data follows a linear relationship. We can represent this relationship using the equation y = ax^1 + bx^0. Let's compute the values of a and b using the provided data and try to fit this equation to the data.

Given data:
Input: 9, Output: 160
Input: 13, Output: 228
Input: -4, Output: -61
Input: 15, Output: 262
Input: -20, Output: -333

Substituting the input and output values:

160 = a(9) + b
228 = a(13) + b
-61 = a(-4) + b
262 = a(15) + b
-333 = a(-20) + b

Let's solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

From the first equation: a(9) + b = 160
From the second equation: a(13) + b = 228

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation:
a(9) + b - (a(13) + b) = 160 - 228
9a - 13a = -68
-4a = -68
a = 17

Substitute the value of a in the first equation:
17(9) + b = 160
153 + b = 160
b = 7

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) follows a quadratic form. Thus, the function can be written in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can determine the values of a and b by solving a system of equations.

Using input -2 (x = -2) and output 17 (y = 17):

17 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1
17 = a + (-2b)     ...(1)

Using input 7 (x = 7) and output -145 (y = -145):

-145 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1
-145 = a + 7b          ...(2)

We can solve this system of equations by subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):

17 - (-145) = a - a + (-2b - 7b)
162 = -9b

Dividing both sides by -9:

b = -18

Substituting the value of b into equation (1):

17 = a + (-2)(-18)
17 = a + 36
a = -19

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

From the data, we can observe that the quadratic equation seems to be symmetric about the x-axis, so the x-coordinate must be squared to obtain the output. By trying to fit the data, the equation that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs could be:

Output: y = -0.5x^2 - 1.5x + 8

Using this equation, let's check if it fits the given data:

(1) when x = 20:

y = -0.5(400) - 30 + 8

(2) when x = -1:
y = -0.5(-1)^2 - 1.5(-1) + 8
y = -0.5(1) + 1.5 + 8
y = -0.5 + 1.5 + 8
y = 8

(3) when x = 20:
y = -0.5(20)^2 - 1.5(20) + 8
y = -0.5(400) - 30 + 8
y = -200 - 30 + 8
y = -222

(4) when x = 12:
y = -0.5(12)^2 - 1.5(12) + 8
y = -0.5(144) - 18 + 8
y = -72 - 18 + 8
y = -82

(5) when x = 18:
y = -0.5(18)^2 - 1.5(18) + 8
y = -0.5(324) - 27 + 8

    The given data can be represented by a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x is the input and y is the output. In this case, the data points indicate that the coefficient of x^0 (a) is the same for all data points, while the coefficient of x^1 (b) varies.

Using the provided input and output values, we can form the following equations:

When input (x) is 10, the output (y) is 142:
142 = a(10^0) + b(10^1)   ----(1)

When input (x) is 15, the output (y) is 217:
217 = a(15^0) + b(15^1)   ----(2)

When input (x) is -10, the output (y) is -158:
-158 = a(-10^0) + b(-10^1)   ----(3)

When input (x) is -4, the output (y) is -68:
-68 = a(-4^0) + b(-4^1)   ----(4)

When input (x) is 13, the output (y) is 187:
187 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)   ----(5)

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of coefficients a and b.

-158 = a - 10b  ----(7)

Adding equations (6) and (7), we get:

Simplifying equation (8), we get:
a = -8

Substituting the value of a into equation (6), we have:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Input: 10, Output: 142
Input: 15, Output: 217
Input: -10, Output: -158
Input: -4, Output: -68
Input: 13, Output: 187

We can see that for each input x, the output y can be represented as a linear combination of two terms: a constant term (x^0) and a linear term (x^1). 

To solve for a and b, we can use the given data. By substituting the input-output pairs into the equation, we get:

142 = a(10^0) + b(10^1)
217 = a(15^0) + b(15^1)
-158 = a((-10)^0) + b((-10)^1)
-68 = a((-4)^0) + b((-4)^1)
187 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)

Simplifying the expressions:

142 = a + 10b           (1)
217 = a + 15b           (2)
-158 = a - 10b          (3)
-68 = a - 4b            (4)
187 = a + 13b           (5)

Let's solve this system of linear equations to find the values of a and b.

First, let's subtract equation 3 from equation 1 to eliminate a:

142 - (-158) = a + 10b - (a - 10b)
300 = 20b
b = 15

Now, substitute the value of b in equation 2 to solve for a:

217 = a + 15(15)
217 = a + 225
a = -8

We can rewrite these equations as:

a = 142 - 10b
a = 217 - 15b

Setting the two expressions for a equal to each other, we get:

142 - 10b = 217 - 15b

Simplifying further:

5b = 75

b = 15

Substituting b = 15 into either of the original equations, we can find the value of a:

a = 142 - 10(15)
a = -8

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -8 + 15x

    Since the function is in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify it to y = a + bx.

To find the coefficients a and b, we can use the given input-output pairs.

Let's substitute the first input-output pair (10, 142) into the equation:

142 = a + 10b ... (1)

Substituting the second input-output pair (15, 217):

217 = a + 15b ... (2)

Solving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2), we get:

217 - 142 = (a + 15b) - (a + 10b)

Simplifying:

75 = 5b

Dividing by 5, we find:

b = 15

Substituting this value of b into equation (1), we get:

142 = a + 10(15)

142 = a + 150

Subtracting 150 from both sides:

-8 = a

    Since we are given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 represents the constant term and x^1 represents the linear term, we can rewrite the function as y = a + b*x.

Looking at the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not a direct mathematical relationship, such as a linear or quadratic relationship. Therefore, we need to use a more complex function to capture the relationship.

By looking at the input and output values, it seems like the output is approximately twice the input value, with an additional constant term subtracted.

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs can be written as:

Output: y = -2 + 10*x

This equation represents a linear function, where the constant term is -2 and the coefficient of the linear term is 10.

    The given data points do not seem to follow a linear relationship. However, we can still try to fit a linear function to the data by assuming y = ax^0 + bx^1.

By directly comparing the inputs and outputs, we can see that x^0 will always be 1. Hence, the function can be simplified to:

Output: y = a + bx^1

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given data points into the equation and solve for a and b using a system of linear equations. Let's do that:

For input 1 and output 2:
2 = a + b(1)

For input -19 and output 122:
122 = a + b(-19)

We now have a system of two equations. Solving this system will give us the values of a and b.

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:
120 = b(-19) - b(1)
120 = -20b
b = -6

Substituting the value of b into equation 1:
2 = a - 6(1)
2 = a - 6
a = 8

    From the given input-output pairs, we can observe that the output (y) can be represented as a linear function of the input (x). Let's denote the constant coefficient as a and the coefficient of x as b. We can write the function as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

By substituting the given input-output pairs, we can solve for the values of a and b. Let's solve for a and b using the first and second input-output pair:

For Input: -17, Output: -292:
-292 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1
-292 = a - 17b

For Input: -6, Output: -105:
-105 = a(-6)^0 + b(-6)^1
-105 = a - 6b

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b:

From the first equation, a = -292 + 17b
Substituting the value of a in the second equation, we get -105 = (-292 + 17b) - 6b
-105 = -292 + 11b
11b = -105 + 292
11b = 187
b = 17

Substituting the value of b in the first equation, we get a = -292 + 17(17)
a = -292 + 289
a = -3

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the input and output can be represented by a linear equation:

Output (y) = a + bx

Where a is the coefficient for x^0 and b is the coefficient for x^1 (i.e., the slope).

To determine the specific values of a and b, we need to find their respective values that satisfy the given input-output pairs.

By substituting the input and output values of each pair into the equation, we get:

-292 = a - 17b     (Equation 1)
-105 = a - 6b       (Equation 2)
-275 = a - 16b     (Equation 3)
-309 = a - 18b     (Equation 4)
14 = a + b           (Equation 5)

We now have a system of equations that we can solve simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

By rearranging Equation 5, we get:
a = 14 - b

Substituting this value of a into Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, and Equation 4, we can solve the resulting equations to find the value of b.

Solving the system of equations (Equation 1 - Equation 4), we find that b ≈ 15.75.

Substituting this value of b back into Equation 5, we find that a = -1.75.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output (y) ≈ -1.75 + 15.75x

So in the form Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1, the function would be:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use the given input-output pairs to determine the values of a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Looking at the given pairs, we can see that for a given input x, the output y is related to x through a particular formula.

For the first pair (input: -10, output: -54), we can substitute the values into the function:
-54 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-54 = a + (-10)b               Equation 1

For the second pair (input: 4, output: 2), we can substitute the values into the function:

For the third pair (input: -20, output: -94), we can substitute the values into the function:

For the fourth pair (input: 4, output: 2), we can substitute the values into the function:

2 = a + 4b                         Equation 4

For the fifth pair (input: -4, output: -30), we can substitute the values into the function:
-30 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
-30 = a + (-4)b               Equation 5

We now have a system of equations:
-54 = a + (-10)b       (Equation 1)
2 = a + 4b             (Equation 2)
-94 = a + (-20)b       (Equation 3)
2 = a + 4b             (Equation 4)

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function with the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

1. input = -10, output = -54:
   -54 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
   -54 = a + (-10)b

2. input = 4, output = 2:
   2 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
   2 = a + 4b

3. input = -20, output = -94:
   -94 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
   -94 = a + (-20)b

4. input = 4, output = 2:

5. input = -4, output = -30:

   -30 = a + (-4)b

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b. Solving these equations gives a = -3 and b = 1.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the input and output would be:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, let's use the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 to describe the relationship.

For the first pair of values (-11, -20), substituting them into the formula we have -20 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1. Simplifying this equation we get -20 = a - 11b.

For the second pair of values (-8, -14), we have -14 = a(-8)^0 + b(-8)^1. Simplifying this equation we get -14 = a - 8b.

For the third pair of values (-2, -2), we have -2 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1, which simplifies to -2 = a - 2b.

For the fourth pair of values (-7, -12), we have -12 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7)^1. Simplifying this equation we get -12 = a - 7b.

For the fifth pair of values (-17, -32), we have -32 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1. Simplifying this equation we get -32 = a - 17b.

-32 = a(1) + (-17)b

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

Adding all the equations together, we get:
-80 = 5a + (-45)b

Subtracting the third equation from the sum, we have:
-78 = 3a + (-43)b

From this equation, we can find the value of a:
a = (-78 + 43b) / 3

Substituting this into the second equation:
-14 = ((-78 + 43b) / 3) + (-8)b

Simplifying this equation, we get:
-42 = -78 + 43b - 24b

Combining like terms, we have:
-42 = -78 + 19b

Solving for b:
56 = 19b
b = 56 / 19
b = 2.947

Now we can substitute the value of b back into the expression for a:

a = (-78 + 126.521) / 3

-11 = a - 11b

Using the third pair of (input, output):

To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of a and b.

We can start by forming a system of equations using the given data points:

For the input -17, the function evaluates to -310:
-310 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1

For the input 17, the function evaluates to 302:
302 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1

Simplifying the equations, we have:

-310 = a - 17b  (Equation 1)
302 = a + 17b   (Equation 2)

We can solve this system of equations to determine the values of a and b.

Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2, we have:
-8 = 2a   →   a = -4

Substituting the value of a into Equation 1, we have:
-310 = -4 - 17b
-306 = -17b
b = 18

Now, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into this equation and solve for the values of a and b.

For the first pair (input = -17, output = -310):
-310 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1
-310 = a - 17b

For the second pair (input = 17, output = 302):
302 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
302 = a + 17b

Using these two equations, we can solve for a and b. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

302 - (-310) = a - a + 17b + 17b
612 = 34b
b = 612/34 = 18

Substituting this value of b back into the first equation, we get:

-310 = a - 306
a = -310 + 306 = -4

    Based on the given data, it seems like the relationship between the input and output can be approximated using a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

By substituting the given input-output pairs into this equation, we can find the values of the coefficients a and b.

Substituting the first input-output pair (-17, -310):
-310 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1 = a - 17b

Substituting the second input-output pair (17, 302):
302 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1 = a + 17b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Adding the two equations together, we get:
-8 = 2a
a = -4

Substituting the value of a into the second equation, we get:
302 = -4 + 17b

    The pattern observed in the given data appears to be linear. To write the function that captures this relationship, we can assume it is of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 equals 1 for all inputs. 

Looking at the data, we can see that when x = 0, y = -15. Substituting these values into the equation, we have:

-15 = a(1) + b(0)
-15 = a

Now, we can substitute this value of a into any of the other data points to solve for b.

Using the data point (-5, -35), we have:

    The given data suggests that the function can be represented as:

By substituting the provided inputs and outputs, we can solve for the coefficients a and b. 

Using the equation for the first set of inputs and outputs:

-15 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-15 = a

Using the equation for the second set of inputs and outputs:

-35 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
-35 = a - 5b

Using the equation for the third set of inputs and outputs:

-31 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1

Using the equation for the fourth set of inputs and outputs:

Using the equation for the fifth set of inputs and outputs:

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b:

From the first equation, a = -15

The function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 can be written as:
Output: y = mx + c

To find the values of m and c, we can use any two pairs of inputs and outputs.

Using the pairs (9, 133) and (19, 283):

Using the point (9, 133):
133 = 9m + c   ----(1)

Using the point (19, 283):
283 = 19m + c  ----(2)

We have a system of two linear equations (1) and (2) with two variables m and c. Solving the system, we can find the values of m and c, which represents the gradient and y-intercept of the linear function.

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):

(283 - 133) = (19m + c) - (9m + c)
150 = 10m

Dividing both sides by 10:
m = 15

Substituting the value of m into equation (1):

c = -2

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can try to fit a polynomial function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 to the given data. 

From the given data points, we can write the following equations:

When x = 9, y = 133:
133 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)   -- Equation 1

When x = 19, y = 283:
283 = a(19^0) + b(19^1) -- Equation 2

When x = 16, y = 238:
238 = a(16^0) + b(16^1) -- Equation 3

When x = -14, y = -212:
-212 = a((-14)^0) + b((-14)^1) -- Equation 4

When x = -16, y = -242:
-242 = a((-16)^0) + b((-16)^1) -- Equation 5

Let's solve these equations to find the values of a and b:

From Equation 1 and Equation 2, we can eliminate a and solve for b:
133 = a + 9b   -- Equation 6
283 = a + 19b  -- Equation 7

Subtract Equation 6 from Equation 7:
150 = 10b
b = 15

Substitute b = 15 into Equation 6:
133 = a + 9(15)
133 = a + 135
a = -2

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given data points to identify the values of a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's substitute the given input and output values into the function:

When Input = 2, Output = 59:
59 = a(2^0) + b(2^1)
59 = a + 2b   (Equation 1)

When Input = -16, Output = -301:
-301 = a(-16^0) + b(-16^1)
-301 = a - 16b   (Equation 2)

When Input = -5, Output = -81:

-81 = a - 5b   (Equation 3)

When Input = 3, Output = 79:

79 = a + 3b   (Equation 4)

When Input = -2, Output = -21:
-21 = a(-2^0) + b(-2^1)
-21 = a - 2b   (Equation 5)

Now, we have a system of equations (Equations 1 to 5) that we can solve to find the values of a and b.

Solving Equation 1 and Equation 4 simultaneously:
a + 2b = 59
a + 3b = 79

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 4:
(4b - 3b) = 79 - 59
b = 20

Substituting the value of b back into Equation 1:

    Based on the provided input-output pairs, we can observe that the output values can be represented as y = ax^0 + bx^1. Let's find the values of a and b.

Input: -11, Output: 72
72 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
72 = a + (-11)b

Input: -3, Output: 8
8 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
8 = a + (-3)b

Input: -2, Output: 0
0 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1

Input: 18, Output: -160
-160 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1
-160 = a + 18b

Input: -7, Output: 40
40 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7)^1
40 = a + (-7)b

Solving the above system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.
Adding the first, third, and fifth equations together: a + (-11)b + a + (-2)b + a + (-7)b = 72 + 0 + 40
3a + (-20)b = 112

Adding the second, third, and fifth equations together: a + (-3)b + a + (-2)b + a + (-7)b = 8 + 0 + 40
3a + (-12)b = 48

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation: (3a + (-20)b) - (3a + (-12)b) = 112 - 48
(-20)b - (-12)b = 64
(-20 + 12)b = 64
-8b = 64
b = -8

Substituting b = -8 into the second equation: a + (-3)(-8) = 8
a + 24 = 8
a = -16

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the method of least squares to fit a linear regression model. The linear regression model will be of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 represents the constant 1 and x^1 represents the input value x.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations to find the values of a and b:

Equation 1: 72 = a*1^0 + b*(-11)^1 => 72 = a - 11b
Equation 2: 8 = a*1^0 + b*(-3)^1 => 8 = a - 3b
Equation 3: 0 = a*1^0 + b*(-2)^1 => 0 = a - 2b
Equation 4: -160 = a*1^0 + b*(18)^1 => -160 = a + 18b
Equation 5: 40 = a*1^0 + b*(-7)^1 => 40 = a - 7b

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b, which we can then use in the final function.

Solving the system of equations, we find that a = -12 and b = -5.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can find the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's consider the five pairs of inputs and outputs:

1. When input = 11, output = -204
2. When input = -4, output = 66
3. When input = -17, output = 300
4. When input = -15, output = 264
5. When input = 20, output = -366

By substituting these input-output values into the equation, we get the following equations:

1. -204 = a(11)^0 + b(11)^1  --> -204 = a + 11b
2. 66 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1  --> 66 = a - 4b
3. 300 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1  --> 300 = a - 17b
4. 264 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)^1  --> 264 = a - 15b
5. -366 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1  --> -366 = a + 20b

Simplifying these equations, we get:

-204 = a + 11b   --> Equation 1
  66 = a - 4b     --> Equation 2
 300 = a - 17b    --> Equation 3
 264 = a - 15b    --> Equation 4
-366 = a + 20b    --> Equation 5

Now we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

By subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1, we eliminate the 'a' term and solve for 'b':
(-204) - 66 = (a + 11b) - (a - 4b)
-270 = 15b
b = -18

Substituting the value of b = -18 into Equation 1 to solve for 'a':
-204 = a + 11(-18)
-204 = a - 198
a = -6

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y), we need to determine the values of coefficients 'a' and 'b' in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Given the input-output pairs:

(-12, 9)
(20, -55)
(-4, -7)
(-10, 5)
(8, -31)

We can solve for 'a' and 'b' using these pairs.

For the first pair (-12, 9), we have:
9 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
9 = a + (-12)b     (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1)
9 = a - 12b

For the second pair (20, -55), we have:
-55 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
-55 = a + 20b

For the third pair (-4, -7), we have:
-7 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
-7 = a - 4b

For the fourth pair (-10, 5), we have:
5 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
5 = a - 10b

For the fifth pair (8, -31), we have:
-31 = a(8)^0 + b(8)^1
-31 = a + 8b

We now have a system of five linear equations:

a - 12b = 9
a + 20b = -55
a - 4b = -7
a - 10b = 5
a + 8b = -31

Solving this system of equations, we find:
a = -3
b = -2

82 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
82 = a + (-16)b

Substituting the second set of data points (-11, 52):

Now, we have a system of two equations:

We can solve the system of equations to find the values of a and b. Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

Solving the system of equations:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the input (x) and output (y) can be described by a linear function. In this case, we can write the function in the form y = a + bx, where a and b are constants.

Given the inputs and outputs:
Input: -18, Output: -75
Input: -1, Output: -7
Input: 3, Output: 9
Input: -18, Output: -75
Input: 2, Output: 5

We can see from these examples that when x = -18, y = -75, which gives us the equation: -75 = a + (-18)b
Similarly, when x = -1, y = -7, which gives us the equation: -7 = a + (-1)b
When x = 3, y = 9, which gives us the equation: 9 = a + (3)b
So we have three equations with two unknowns (a and b). By solving these equations simultaneously, we can determine the values of a and b.

From the first equation (-75 = a + (-18)b), we can isolate a: a = -75 - (-18)b
Substituting this into the second equation (-7 = a + (-1)b), we get: -7 = (-75 - (-18)b) + (-1)b
Simplifying: -7 = -75 + 18b - b
Combining like terms: -7 = -75 + 17b
Isolating b: 17b = -7 + 75
Simplifying: 17b = 68
Solving for b: b = 68 / 17 = 4

Substituting the value of b = 4 into the equation -75 = a + (-18)b), we can solve for a:
-75 = a + (-18)*4
-75 = a - 72
a = -75 + 72
a = -3

For the provided inputs and corresponding outputs, we can observe that the output is always 3 times the input plus 2 times 1. This can be expressed mathematically as y = 2x^0 + 3x^1, where x^0 represents the coefficient 2 and x^1 represents the coefficient 3.

    We can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is a linear relationship, which means the output can be represented by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x is the input and y is the output.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given input-output pairs and solve for a and b simultaneously.

From the given input-output pairs:

When x = 9, y = 29
29 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)
29 = a + 9b   ... (1)

When x = 2, y = 8
8 = a(2^0) + b(2^1)
8 = a + 2b   ... (2)

When x = -1, y = -1
-1 = a(-1^0) + b(-1^1)
-1 = a - b   ... (3)

When x = -6, y = -16
-16 = a(-6^0) + b(-6^1)
-16 = a - 6b   ... (4)

To solve these equations, we can start by subtracting equation (3) from equation (1):

b = 3

Substituting b = 3 into equation (1):

29 = a + 9(3)
29 = a + 27

    The given data suggests that the relationship between the input and the output follows a linear equation in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

To determine the values of a and b, we can use the given data points to solve a system of equations.

Using the first data point (input: 9, output: 29):
29 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)
29 = a + 9b ... equation (1)

Using the second data point (input: 2, output: 8):
8 = a(2^0) + b(2^1)
8 = a + 2b ... equation (2)

We have a system of linear equations:

a + 9b = 29 ... equation (1)
a + 2b = 8 ... equation (2)

To solve this system, we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:

(a + 9b) - (a + 2b) = (29) - (8)
9b - 2b = 21
7b = 21
b = 21/7
b = 3

Substituting b = 3 into equation (2) to solve for a:

a + 6 = 8
a = 2

Simplifying the equations:

109 = a - 16b
18 = a - 3b
-17 = a + 2b
-87 = a + 12b
-38 = a + 5b

To solve this system of equations, we can use any preferred method (e.g., substitution, elimination, matrices).

Let's solve it using the substitution method:

From the second equation, we get a = 3b + 18.
Substituting this value of a in the first equation:

109 = (3b + 18) - 16b
109 = 18 - 13b
13b = 18 - 109
13b = -91
b = -91/13
b = -7

Substituting the value of b in the second equation:

(-16, 109)
(-3, 18)
(2, -17)
(12, -87)
(5, -38)

Now we can find the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the first pair (-16, 109):
109 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
109 = a - 16b

Using the second pair (-3, 18):
18 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1

To solve this system, we can either use substitution or elimination method. For simplicity, let's use the elimination method:

From equations (1) and (2), we can eliminate a by subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):

109 - 18 = (a - 16b) - (a - 3b)
91 = -13b

Therefore, b = -7.

82 = a + (-4)b

Simplifying, we get:

82 = a - 4b   ...(3)

For the fourth input-output pair (-18, 306), we have:

306 = a + (-18)b

Simplifying, we get:

306 = a - 18b  ...(4)

For the fifth input-output pair (-14, 242), we have:

242 = a + (-14)b

Simplifying, we get:

242 = a - 14b  ...(5)

Now we have a system of 5 linear equations. We can solve this system using any method (for example, substitution or elimination) to find the values of a and b that satisfy all the equations.

By solving this system of equations, we find that a = 170 and b = -18.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    Good question. Let's start by fitting the data into the given form:

For the first pair, 18 and 350, we have:
350 = a(18^0) + b(18^1)
350 = a + 18b

For the second pair, 12 and 230, we have:
230 = a(12^0) + b(12^1)
230 = a + 12b

For the third pair, -13 and -270, we have:
-270 = a(-13^0) + b(-13^1)
-270 = a - 13b

For the fourth pair, 4 and 70, we have:
70 = a(4^0) + b(4^1)
70 = a + 4b

For the fifth pair, 16 and 310, we have:
310 = a(16^0) + b(16^1)
310 = a + 16b

Now we have a system of linear equations. We can solve it to find the values of a and b. Applying an appropriate method like substitution or elimination, we can determine the values:

From the first equation, 350 = a + 18b, we can rewrite it as a = 350 - 18b.

Now let's substitute a in the second equation:
230 = (350 - 18b) + 12b
230 = 350 - 6b
6b = 350 - 230
6b = 120
b = 20

Substituting b = 20 back into the first equation, we get:
a = 350 - 18(20)
a = 350 - 360
a = -10

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = -10x^0 + 20x^1
or
y = -10 + 20x

This function approximates the given data as well as possible.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    From the given inputs and outputs, we can create a equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

For Input: 18, Output: 350
We have 350 = a*1 + b*18 -> 350 = a + 18b

For Input: 12, Output: 230 
We have 230 = a*1 + b*12 -> 230 = a + 12b

For Input: -13, Output: -270
We have -270 = a*1 + b*(-13) -> -270 = a - 13b

For Input: 4, Output: 70
We have 70 = a*1 + b*4 -> 70 = a + 4b

For Input: 16, Output: 310
We have 310 = a*1 + b*16 -> 310 = a + 16b

Solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

Adding the equations (1) and (3):
350 + (-270) = a + 18b + a - 13b
80 = 2a + 5b                   (4)

Subtracting the equations (5) and (3):
70 - (-270) = a + 4b - (a - 13b)
340 = 17b                      (5)

From equation (5), we get b = 20. 

Substituting the value of b in equation (4), we get:
80 = 2a + 5(20)
80 = 2a + 100
2a = -20
a = -10

Therefore, the equation that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    The given data can be represented using a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's find the coefficients a and b using the given input-output pairs:

For (13, 177):
177 = a * 1^0 + b * 13^1
177 = a + 13b                .....[1]

For (14, 191):
191 = a * 1^0 + b * 14^1
191 = a + 14b                .....[2]

For solving equations [1] and [2], we can use any method like substitution or elimination.

Using substitution method, we can rearrange equation [1] as:
a = 177 - 13b                 .....[3]

Substitute equation [3] into equation [2]:
191 = (177 - 13b) + 14b
191 = 177 + b
b = 191 - 177
b = 14

Substitute the value of b into equation [3]:
a = 177 - 13(14)
a = 177 - 182
a = -5

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = -5 * x^0 + 14 * x^1

To solve this system of equations, we can use a method like matrix inversion or least squares. However, for simplicity, we can solve it by substitution. 

From equation (4):
a = 37 - 3b     ------(6)

Substituting equation (6) into equation (5):
93 = 37 - 3b + 7b
93 = 37 + 4b
4b = 93 - 37
4b = 56
b = 56/4
