"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the input (x) and output (y) follows a linear function. Therefore, the function can be written as:

Output: y = a * x^0 + b * x^1

Let's substitute the given inputs and outputs into this equation to find the values of 'a' and 'b':

For the first example:
Input: -10
Output: -213

-213 = a * (-10)^0 + b * (-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10b)

For the second example:
Input: 9
Output: 167

167 = a * 9^0 + b * 9^1
167 = a + 9b

For the third example:
Input: 4
Output: 67

67 = a * 4^0 + b * 4^1
67 = a + 4b

For the fourth example:
Input: -3
Output: -73

-73 = a * (-3)^0 + b * (-3)^1
-73 = a + (-3b)

For the fifth example:

"To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use the method of least squares regression. This method involves finding the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual output values.

First, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b:

Let's denote the input values as x and the output values as y.

Using the least squares regression, we have the following equations:

∑y = Na + b∑x

∑xy = a∑x + b∑x^2

where N is the number of data points.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Using the given data, we can compute the following:

∑x = -10 + 9 + 4 - 3 + 20 = 20

∑y = -213 + 167 + 67 - 73 + 387 = 335

∑xy = (-10 * -213) + (9 * 167) + (4 * 67) + (-3 * -73) + (20 * 387) = 7751

∑x^2 = (-10)^2 + 9^2 + 4^2 + (-3)^2 + 20^2 = 646

Solving the equations:

335 = 5a + 20b  (equation 1)
7751 = 20a + 646b (equation 2)

Multiplying equation 1 by 20:

6700 = 100a + 400b  (equation 3)

Subtracting equation 3 from equation 2:

7751 - 6700 = 20a + 646b - 100a - 400b
1051 = -80a + 246b

Dividing equation 4 by 2:

From the given inputs and outputs, we can construct the following equations:

For the input-output pair (5, -31):
-31 = a(5^0) + b(5^1)
-31 = a + 5b     (Equation 1)

For the input-output pair (9, -51):
-51 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)
-51 = a + 9b     (Equation 2)

For the input-output pair (-11, 49):
49 = a((-11)^0) + b((-11)^1)
49 = a - 11b     (Equation 3)

For the input-output pair (-4, 14):

For the input-output pair (-12, 54):

To solve this system of linear equations, we can use any method, such as substitution or matrix algebra. Let's use substitution to solve for a and b:

From Equation 1, we can express a in terms of b:
a = -31 - 5b

Substituting this expression for a back into Equation 2:
-51 = (-31 - 5b) + 9b

Simplifying, we get:

b = -5

Substituting the value of b into Equation 1:
a = -31 - 5(-5)
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

For the second pair of input-output:

For the fourth pair of input-output:

For the fifth pair of input-output:
18 = a(1) + b(18)

Now let's solve the system of equations:

From the first and third equations, we can see that a must be 0. Therefore, we have:

20 = 0 + b(20)

-1 = 0 + b(-1)

12 = 0 + b(12)

18 = 0 + b(18)

b = -1

12b = 12
b = 1

18b = 18
b = 1

So we have found that b is 1 for all the equations. Now let's substitute this value of b in any of the equations to find a:

Simplifying each equation:

289a - 17b + c = -325           ...(6)

25a - 5b + c= -109               ...(7)

225a - 15b + c = -289            ...(10)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a, b, and c.

Solving the system using a suitable method, we find:

When input (x) is 13, the output (y) is 187:

If we assume a quadratic relationship, we can use the given data points to calculate the coefficients a, b, and c. However, keep in mind that this assumption may not accurately capture the underlying pattern, so it's important to note the uncertainty in this approach.

Assuming a quadratic relationship, we can rewrite the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2. Solving the system of equations using the given data points:

Substituting x = 15 into equation 1:

Subtracting equation 3 from equation 4:

Substituting x = 13 into equation 6:
187 = a + 13b + 169c  -> 8

Substituting x = -4 into equation 7:

Subtracting equation 9 from equation 8:
187 - (-68) = a + 13b + 169c - (a - 4b + 16c)
255 = 17b + 153c
5 = b + 9c  -> 10

Now we have two equations (5 and 10), and we can solve them simultaneously to find the values of b and c.

Using equation 5 and 10:

Subtracting equation 10 from equation 5:
15 - 5 = b + 25c - (b + 9c)
10 = 16c
c = 10/16 = 5/8

Substituting c = 5/8 into equation 5:
15 = b + 25(5/8)
15 = b + 125/8
120/8 - 125/8 = b
b = -5/8

Now that we have the values of b and c, we can use equation 3 to solve for a:

Using the first two sets of inputs and outputs:
-14: -97  -->  -97 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1  -->  -97 = a - 14b

Using the next two sets of inputs and outputs:

Using the last set of inputs and outputs:

(265 + 20b) + (-5b) = 55   ->  265 + 20b - 5b = 55   ->  15b = -210  ->  b = -14

(265 + 20b) + (-10b) = 125 ->  265 + 20b - 10b = 125 ->  10b = -140  ->  b = -14

(265 + 20b) + (6b) = -99   ->  265 + 20b + 6b = -99  ->  26b = -364  ->  b = -14

Therefore, the value of b is consistently equal to -14.

Now, substituting b = -14 back into any of the equations, let's choose equation 1:

a + (-20 * -14) = 265
a + 280 = 265
a = 265 - 280
a = -15

Thus, the values of a and b are -15 and -14, respectively.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) is:

Output (y) = -15(x^0) - 14(x^1)

Simplifying further, we have:

"To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the method of least squares regression to fit a linear function to the data. 

First, let's assign the variables:
- Input: x

Using the given data points, we can form a system of equations:

1. a + b = 265   (when x = -20, y = 265)
2. a + b = 195   (when x = -15, y = 195)
3. a + b = 55    (when x = -5, y = 55)
4. a + b = 125   (when x = -10, y = 125)
5. a + b = -99   (when x = 6, y = -99)

We can see that the value of 'a' is constant in all the equations, and the value of 'b' is also constant in all the equations.

Since all the equations are the same, we can solve any one of them. Let's solve equation 1:

a + b = 265

Given that a = 265 - b, we substitute this into the equation:

(265 - b) + b = 265

Simplifying:

265 - b + b = 265
265 = 265

Since this equation is always true, it means that 'a' can take any value. We can represent this as 'a = k', where 'k' is any constant.

Now we can write the function explicitly in the form Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1:

y = kx^0 + bx^1
   = k + bx

In this case, 'a' can be represented as 'k', and 'b' can be represented as 'b'.

To find the values of ""a"" and ""b"", we need to solve a system of equations using the given input-output pairs. Let's take the first pair (x = -16, y = 297):

Using the least squares method, we can calculate the coefficients a and b by minimizing the sum of the squared vertical differences between the observed outputs and the predicted outputs. Once we obtain the values of a and b, we can write the function in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

To calculate the values of a and b, we will use the input-output pairs provided:

Input: 18    Output: -315
Input: -16   Output: 297
Input: -5    Output: 99
Input: 5     Output: -81

Step 1: Calculate the mean of the inputs and outputs:

Mean of inputs (X):
X_mean = (-16 + 18 + -16 + -5 + 5) / 5 = -5.6

Mean of outputs (Y):
Y_mean = (297 - 315 + 297 + 99 - 81) / 5 = 83.4

Step 2: Calculate the differences from the mean for both inputs and outputs:

Difference from the mean for inputs (X):
x1 = -16 - (-5.6) = -10.4
x2 = 18 - (-5.6) = 23.6
x3 = -16 - (-5.6) = -10.4
x4 = -5 - (-5.6) = 0.6
x5 = 5 - (-5.6) = 10.6

Difference from the mean for outputs (Y):
y1 = 297 - (83.4) = 213.6
y2 = -315 - (83.4) = -398.4
y3 = 297 - (83.4) = 213.6
y4 = 99 - (83.4) = 15.6
y5 = -81 - (83.4) = -164.4

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the products of the differences from the mean for inputs and outputs:

Sum of (xi * yi):
sum_xiyi = (x1 * y1) + (x2 * y2) + (x3 * y3) + (x4 * y4) + (x5 * y5)
         = (-10.4 * 213.6) + (23.6 * -398.4) + (-10.4 * 213.6) + (0.6 * 15.6) + (10.6 * -164.4)
         = -2217.44 - 9423.04 + 2217.44 + 9.36 - 1736.64
         = -115.32

Step 4: Calculate the sum of the squared differences from the mean for inputs:

Sum of (xi^2):
sum_xi2 = (x1^2) + (x2^2) + (x3^2) + (x4^2) + (x5^2)
        = (-10.4^2) + (23.6^2) + (-10.4^2) + (0.6^2) + (10.6^2)
        = 108.16 + 556.96 + 108.16 + 0.36 + 112.36
        = 885.00

Step 5: Calculate the slope (b):

b = sum_xiyi / sum_xi2
  = -115.32 / 885.00
  = -0.13 (approximately)

Step 6: Calculate the y-intercept (a):

a = Y_mean - (b * X_mean)
  = 83.4 - (-0.13 * -5.6)
  = 83.4 - 0.728
  = 82.67 (approximately)

Rearranging the equation:

230 = 110 + 6b
120 = 18b
b = 120 / 18
b = 20/3

Substituting the value of b into equation (4), we can solve for a:

a = 110 - 6(20/3)
a = 110 - 120/3
a = 110 - 40
a = 70
