    The given function can be written as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

For the given data points, we can write the equations as follows:

Input: -18, Output: 339

We have 5 equations with 2 unknowns (a and b). To solve this system of equations, we can use simultaneous equation solving techniques, such as substitution or elimination.

Solving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously:
a + (-18)b = 339 ......... (1)
a + 0*b = -3 ............ (2)

From equation (2), we can infer that a = -3.

Substituting a = -3 in equation (1):
-3 + (-18)b = 339
-18b = 342
b = -19

    The pattern in the given data can be captured using a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's calculate the values for a and b using the given data points:

1. Input: -18, Output: 339
   339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
   339 = a - 18b

2. Input: 0, Output: -3
   -3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
   -3 = a

3. Input: 5, Output: -98
   -98 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
   -98 = a + 5b

4. Input: -3, Output: 54
   54 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
   54 = a - 3b

5. Input: -16, Output: 301
   301 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
   301 = a + 16b

From equations 1 and 4, we can solve for a and b:
a - 18b = 339
a - 3b = 54

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:
-15b = 285
b = -19

Substituting b = -19 into equation 1, we get:
a - 18(-19) = 339
a + 342 = 339
a = -3

    After examining the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, where a and b are coefficients.

From the data provided, we can observe that when x is an even number, the output is a positive value. On the other hand, when x is an odd number, the output is a negative value.

To determine the values of a and b, we need to find the values of the function at two different points. Let's use the points (7, -98) and (17, -218).

Using the first point (7, -98), we can substitute the values into the function:

-98 = a + 7b    -- Equation 1

Using the second point (17, -218), we can substitute the values into the function:

-218 = a + 17b  -- Equation 2

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables (a and b). We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

By rearranging Equation 1 and Equation 2, we can express a in terms of b:

a = -98 - 7b     -- Equation 3
a = -218 - 17b   -- Equation 4

Setting Equation 3 equal to Equation 4:

-98 - 7b = -218 - 17b

Simplifying:

-7b + 17b = -218 - (-98)
10b = -218 + 98
10b = -120
b = -12

Substituting the value of b into Equation 3:

a = -98 - 7(-12)
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

Therefore, the linear function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -14x^0 - 12x^1

    Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear equation. 

The general form of a linear equation is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. 

To find the equation that best fits the given input-output pairs, we need to find the values of m and b that minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and the given outputs. 

Using the provided input-output pairs, we can generate a table to solve for the coefficients a and b:

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| -13   | -197   |
| -11   | -169   |
| 20    | 265    |
| -10   | -155   |
| 7     | 83     |

By observing the table, it seems that the coefficient a is constant and equal to -12. The coefficient b is different for each pair, but it increases by 14 with every increase in the input by 1.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be written as:

Output: y = -12x + 14(abs(x) + 1) + c

Where c is a constant term that needs to be determined. Since it is not mentioned in the given input-output pairs, we cannot determine the exact value of c.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the function follows a linear relationship of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x represents the input and y represents the output. 

Using the method of least squares, we can determine the values of a and b that best fit the data.

Since the constant term (x^0) is always 1, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

To find a and b, we can use the given data points and form a system of equations:

1. For the first data point (9, 160):
160 = a + 9b

2. For the second data point (13, 228):
228 = a + 13b

3. For the third data point (-4, -61):
-61 = a - 4b

4. For the fourth data point (15, 262):
262 = a + 15b

5. For the fifth data point (-20, -333):
-333 = a - 20b

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b.

Solving equations 1 and 2 simultaneously, we get:
160 = a + 9b
228 = a + 13b

By subtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we eliminate a and solve for b:
68 = 4b
b = 68/4
b = 17

Plugging the value of b into equation 1, we can solve for a:
160 = a + 9 * 17
160 = a + 153
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

By fitting a linear regression line, we can determine the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a) of the line.

Using the given data points, we can calculate the slope (b) as:

b = (Output2 - Output1) / (Input2 - Input1)

160 = a + 153
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To capture the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can write the function as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

By analyzing the given data points:

- When input is -2, the output is 17
- When input is 7, the output is -145
- When input is -10, the output is 161
- When input is 9, the output is -181
- When input is -20, the output is 341

We can now substitute the values of inputs and outputs into the equation to find the values of a and b:

17 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1  -> 17 = a - 2b
-145 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1 -> -145 = a + 7b
161 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1 -> 161 = a - 10b
-181 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1 -> -181 = a + 9b
341 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1 -> 341 = a - 20b

From these equations, we can solve for a and b as follows:

17 = a - 2b             ->  a = 2b + 17
-145 = a + 7b           ->  a = -7b - 145
161 = a - 10b           ->  a = 10b + 161
-181 = a + 9b           ->  a = -9b - 181
341 = a - 20b           ->  a = 20b + 341

Setting the values of a equal to each other, we can solve for b: 

2b + 17 = -7b - 145    -> 9b = -162   -> b = -18

Substituting the value of b into any of the equations above, we can solve for a:

a = 2(-18) + 17   -> a = -19

Using two data points (-17,-325) and (-5,-109), we can solve the system of equations to find the values of a and b.

-325 = b*(-17)^1 + a
-109 = b*(-5)^1 + a

Simplifying,
-325 = -17b + a
-109 = -5b + a

Rearranging and subtracting the two equations,
-325 - (-109) = -17b - (-5b)
-325 + 109 = -17b + 5b
-216 = -12b

    From the given data, we can observe that the output (y) is related to the input (x) through a linear function. In this case, the constant term (a) represents the y-intercept, and the coefficient of x (b) represents the slope of the line.

To find the function that captures this relationship, we can use the formula:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

From the data, we can match the values of x and y to the corresponding powers:

For the input x = 10, the output y = 142
142 = a(10^0) + b(10^1)
142 = a + 10b

For the input x = 15, the output y = 217

For the input x = -10, the output y = -158

-158 = a - 10b

For the input x = -4, the output y = -68
-68 = a(-4^0) + b(-4^1)

For the input x = 13, the output y = 187
187 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)

Now we have a system of equations that we can solve simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

    To come up with a function that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we can perform a regression analysis to find the coefficients of the polynomial function.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can create the following table:

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| -1    | -8     |
| 5     | 76     |
| 3     | 48     |
| 8     | 118    |
| 13    | 188    |

To find the coefficients a and b in the polynomial function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use linear regression.

We can rewrite the function as y = a + bx, where x represents the input value. Now we can create a system of equations:

-8 = a - b
76 = a + 5b
48 = a + 3b
118 = a + 8b
188 = a + 13b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

First, subtract the first equation from the second to get:
84 = 6b
Solving for b, we find b = 14.

Substituting this value of b into the first equation, we get:
-8 = a - 14
Solving for a, we find a = 6.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs (denoted as x) and outputs (denoted as y) can be described by a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 represents the constant term (1) and x^1 represents the linear term (x).

By substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation, we can solve for the values of a and b:

1. For the input of -14 and output of -97:
   -97 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1
   -97 = a - 14b

2. For the input of 7 and output of 50:
   50 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1
   50 = a + 7b

3. For the input of 2 and output of 15:
   15 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1
   15 = a + 2b

Combining these equations, we can solve for the values of a and b:

From equation 1: -97 = a - 14b
From equation 2:  50 = a + 7b
From equation 3:  15 = a + 2b

To solve this system of equations, we can use any appropriate method (e.g., substitution, elimination, matrix). Solving this system of equations gives us the values:

a = -1

Input: -14

Substituting the values into the equation, we get:
-97 = a - 14b

Input: 7
Output: 50

Substituting the values into the equation, we get:
50 = a + 7b

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. Solving this system will give us the values of a and b, which will allow us to write the function.

Solving the system of equations:
-97 = a - 14b
50 = a + 7b

Rearranging the equations to isolate a:
a = 14b - 97
a = -7b + 50

Setting the two equations equal to each other:
14b - 97 = -7b + 50

Combining like terms:
21b = 147

Solving for b:
b = 7

Substituting the value of b into one of the original equations to find a:

    Based on the given data points, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be best described by a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the specific values of a and b, we can substitute each input and output into the equation and solve for the coefficients.

Using the given data:

Equation 1: 64 = a + b(-9)
Equation 2: 22 = a + b(-3)
Equation 3: -62 = a + b(9)
Equation 4: 36 = a + b(-5)

Simplifying the equations:

Equation 1: 64 = a - 9b
Equation 2: 22 = a - 3b
Equation 3: -62 = a + 9b
Equation 4: 36 = a - 5b

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the input and output can be captured using a quadratic equation. Therefore, the function can be written as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

However, since the function form provided is y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify the quadratic equation by setting c to zero. Therefore, the function can be written as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

To determine the values of a and b, we can substitute the given inputs and outputs into the equation:

When Input = -9, Output = 64
64 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
64 = a - 9b

When Input = -3, Output = 22
22 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
22 = a - 3b

When Input = 9, Output = -62
-62 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
-62 = a + 9b

When Input = -5, Output = 36
36 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
36 = a - 5b

When Input = -16, Output = 113
113 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
113 = a + 16b

From these equations, we can solve for a and b.
Combining the first and third equations, we get:

64 = a - 9b
-62 = a + 9b

Solving these equations simultaneously, we find a = 1 and b = -5.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can assume a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the given data and solving the equations, we can find the values of a and b.

For the given (Input, Output) pairs:

( -9, 64)
( -3, 22)
( 9, -62)
( -5, 36)
(-16, 113)

We can write a system of equations:

64 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
22 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-62 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
36 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
113 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1

Simplifying the system of equations, we get:

64 = a + b(-9)
22 = a + b(-3)
-62 = a + b(9)
36 = a + b(-5)
113 = a + b(-16)

Now, we can solve these equations to find the values of a and b.

Adding equations (1) and (2), we get:

86 = 2a - (9b + 3b)
86 = 2a - 12b

Adding equations (1) and (3), we get:

2 = 2a + 9b

Multiplying equation (2) by 9, we get:

198 = 9a + 3b

Adding equations (4) and (5), we get:

149 = 2a - (5b + 16b)
149 = 2a - 21b

Now, we can solve this system of equations:

86 = 2a - 12b
2 = 2a + 9b
198 = 9a + 3b
149 = 2a - 21b

Solving these equations, we find:

a = 9
b = -3

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 9x^0 - 3x^1

Simplifying,

y = 9(1) - 3x
y = 9 - 3x

Thus, the function that describes the data is y = 9 - 3x.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a quadratic function in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

However, since the problem specifies that the function should be in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify the quadratic function by ignoring the coefficient of the x^2 term (c) and considering the remaining terms:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

By substituting the given inputs and outputs, we can solve for the coefficients a and b:

For Input: -9 -> Output: 64
64 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
64 = a + (-9b)

For Input: -3 -> Output: 22
22 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
22 = a + (-3b)

For Input: 9 -> Output: -62
-62 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
-62 = a + 9b

For Input: -5 -> Output: 36
36 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
36 = a + (-5b)

For Input: -16 -> Output: 113
113 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
113 = a + (-16b)

Now we have a system of linear equations with two unknowns (a and b):

a - 9b = 64   (1)
a - 3b = 22   (2)
a + 9b = -62  (3)
a - 5b = 36   (4)
a - 16b = 113 (5)

Solving this system gives:

a = -55
b = -7

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to identify the values of a and b.

Considering the given data:

Input: -20, Output: 265
Input: -15, Output: 195
Input: -5, Output: 55
Input: -10, Output: 125
Input: 6, Output: -99

We can represent this data in the form of equations:

265 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
195 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)^1
55 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
125 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-99 = a(6)^0 + b(6)^1

Simplifying the equations, we get:

265 = a + (-20)b
195 = a + (-15)b
55 = a + (-5)b
125 = a + (-10)b
-99 = a + 6b

Now, we have a system of equations that we can solve simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Using any suitable method to solve the system of equations, the values of a and b can be obtained:

a = 30, b = -11

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 30x^0 + (-11)x^1

Simplifying further:

Output: y = 30 + (-11)x

Thus, the function is y = 30 - 11x.

    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can write the function in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Given the input-output pairs, we can substitute the inputs and corresponding outputs to solve for the coefficients a and b.

Substituting the first pair (-20, 265):

265 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
265 = a - 20b

Substituting the second pair (-15, 195):

195 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)^1
195 = a - 15b

Substituting the third pair (-5, 55):

55 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
55 = a - 5b

Substituting the fourth pair (-10, 125):

125 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
125 = a - 10b

Substituting the fifth pair (6, -99):

-99 = a(6)^0 + b(6)^1
-99 = a + 6b

Now, we have a system of linear equations that we can solve to find the values of a and b.

Solving the system of equations:

Equation 1: 265 = a - 20b
Equation 2: 195 = a - 15b
Equation 3: 55 = a - 5b
Equation 4: 125 = a - 10b
Equation 5: -99 = a + 6b

From Equation 2, we can write a in terms of b:

a = 195 + 15b

Substituting this expression for a in the other equations:

265 = (195 + 15b) - 20b
55 = (195 + 15b) - 5b
125 = (195 + 15b) - 10b
-99 = (195 + 15b) + 6b

Simplifying each equation:

-20b + 15b = -70
-5b = -140
10b = 70
21b = -294

Solving for b:

b = -14

Using input -20, we have:
265 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1

Using input -10, we have:

We can now solve equations (1) and (2) simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

    To capture the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

From the given data, we can see that when the input is -11, the output is -20. This gives us the equation -20 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1.

Similarly, for the other data points:
-14 = a(-8)^0 + b(-8)^1
-2 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1

As we observe the inputs and outputs, it seems that the output is obtained by multiplying the input by a certain factor (a) and then adding a constant term (b). 

Let's represent the input as x and the output as y. We can write the function as:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Since x^0 is equal to 1, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

-310 = a + b(-17)

Solving for a and b, we obtain:

a = -310 + 17b    (equation 1)

Now, let's substitute the second pair (input: 17, output: 302) into the equation:

302 = a + b(17)

Substituting the expression for a from equation 1, we have:

302 = (-310 + 17b) + b(17)

Simplifying the equation:

302 = -310 + 17b + 17b

302 = -310 + 34b

612 = 34b

b = 612/34

b = 18

Substituting the value of b back into equation 1, we find:

a = -310 + 17(18)

    The data points suggest a linear relationship between the input and output values. By analyzing the data, we can derive the function as follows:

Input: 0
Output: -15

Therefore, when x = 0, y = -15. This leads us to the first term of the function.

Output: y = ax^0 + ...

Input: -5
Output: -35

Input: -4
Output: -31

Input: 5
Output: 5

From these data points, we can see that when x = -5, y = -35, when x = -4, y = -31, and when x = 5, y = 5. These points can be used to determine the second term of the function.

Since the second term includes x to the power of 1, we can express it as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Now, let's find the coefficients a and b that best fit the data.

When x = 0, y = -15
-15 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-15 = a

When x = 5, y = 5
5 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
5 = a + 5b

From our previous calculation, we know that a = -15.

Substituting this value back into our second equation:

5 = -15 + 5b
5b = 20
b = 4

    The given function can be represented as y = ax^0 + bx^1.

From the given inputs and outputs, we can observe the following pattern:

When x = 0, y = -15
When x = -5, y = -35
When x = -4, y = -31
When x = 5, y = 5
When x = -12, y = -63

Let's solve for the values of a and b:

For x = 0: -15 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1 = a
For x = -5: -35 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1 = a - 5b
For x = -4: -31 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1 = a - 4b
For x = 5: 5 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1 = a + 5b
For x = -12: -63 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1 = a - 12b

Now, we have a system of equations:

a = -15
a - 5b = -35
a - 4b = -31
a + 5b = 5
a - 12b = -63

Using these equations, we can solve for a and b.

From equation 1, we get a = -15.
Substituting a = -15 in equation 2, we get -15 - 5b = -35, which simplifies to -5b = -20 and b = 4.
Substituting a = -15 and b = 4 in equation 4, we get -15 + 5(4) = 5, which is true.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems like the function follows a linear relationship. The form of the function would be y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x represents the input and y represents the output.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the equation of a line, y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.

Let's calculate the slope, m, using two pairs of inputs and outputs:

For inputs 9 and 16:
Output for 9 (y1) = 133
Output for 16 (y2) = 238

Slope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (238 - 133) / (16 - 9) = 105 / 7 = 15

Next, we can calculate the y-intercept, c, using one of the input-output pairs:

For input -14:
Output (y) = -212

Using the equation y = mx + c, we can rearrange it to solve for c:

c = y - mx

c = -212 - (-14) * 15 = -212 + 210 = -2

So, the function that describes the data is:

Substituting (-11, 72) into the function:
72 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
72 = a - 11b

Substituting (-3, 8) into the function:
8 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
8 = a - 3b

Substituting (-2, 0) into the function:
0 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1
0 = a - 2b

Substituting (18, -160) into the function:
-160 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1
-160 = a + 18b

Substituting (-7, 40) into the function:

(-3, 8)
(-2, 0)
(18, -160)
(-7, 40)

Let's denote the inputs as x and the outputs as y.

Based on the given data points, we can deduce that the function can be written in the form:

y = a + bx

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the inputs and outputs from the data points into the equation:

72 = a + (-11)b
8 = a + (-3)b
0 = a + (-2)b
-160 = a + 18b
40 = a + (-7)b

We now have a system of linear equations. Solving this system will give us the values of a and b.

Solving this system of equations, we find:
a = 8
b = -6

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 8 - 6x

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, let's try to find the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Input: -11, Output: 72
72 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
72 = a + b(-11)

-160 = a + b(18)

Input: -7, Output: 40
40 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7)^1
40 = a + b(-7)

Let's solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b:

Using the first equation (72 = a + b(-11)):
72 = a - 11b

Using the second equation (8 = a + b(-3)):
8 = a - 3b

Using the third equation (0 = a + b(-2)):
0 = a - 2b

Using the fourth equation (-160 = a + b(18)):
-160 = a + 18b

Using the fifth equation (40 = a + b(-7)):
40 = a - 7b

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

a = 6.4
b = -6

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can create a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can create a system of linear equations as follows:

-11a + (-11)b = 72   (equation 1)
-3a + (-3)b = 8     (equation 2)
-2a + (-2)b = 0     (equation 3)
18a + 18b = -160    (equation 4)
-7a + (-7)b = 40    (equation 5)

Simplifying the equations, we get:

-11a - 11b = 72     (equation 1)
-3a - 3b = 8       (equation 2)
-2a - 2b = 0       (equation 3)
18a + 18b = -160    (equation 4)
-7a - 7b = 40      (equation 5)

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = 4 and b = -8.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    From the given inputs and outputs, we can assume the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be represented as a linear function. Therefore, the function will have the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

To find the values of a and b, we can use the input-output pairs:

For the first pair (11, -204):
-204 = a(11^0) + b(11^1)
-204 = a + 11b   ------> Equation 1

For the second pair (-4, 66):
66 = a(-4^0) + b(-4^1)
66 = a - 4b   ------> Equation 2

Solving Equation 1 and Equation 2 simultaneously will give us values for a and b.

First, let's rearrange Equation 1 to solve for a:
-204 = a + 11b
a = -204 - 11b

We can substitute this value of a in Equation 2:
66 = (-204 - 11b) - 4b
66 = -204 - 15b

Rearranging this equation, we get:
15b = -204 - 66
15b = -270
b = -18

Now substituting this value of b in Equation 1:
a = -204 - 11(-18)
a = -204 + 198
a = -6

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we will use polynomial regression. 

By fitting a polynomial equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can find the values of a and b that give the best approximation to the data.

Here are the calculations for finding the function:

1. Plug in the given inputs and outputs into the equation:
   -16 = a + (-16)b
   82 = a + (-11)b
   -98 = a + (14)b
   94 = a + (-18)b
   -32 = a + (3)b

2. Simplify the equations:
   -16 = a - 16b
   82 = a - 11b
   -98 = a + 14b
   94 = a - 18b
   -32 = a + 3b

3. Rearrange the equations to isolate a and b:
   a = 16b - 16 (equation 1)
   a = 11b + 82 (equation 2)
   a = -14b - 98 (equation 3)
   a = 18b + 94 (equation 4)
   a = -3b - 32 (equation 5)

4. Substitute the value of a from equation 1 into equations 2, 3, 4, and 5:
   16b - 16 = 11b + 82
   16b - 16 = -14b - 98
   16b - 16 = 18b + 94
   16b - 16 = -3b - 32

5. Solve the equations to find the value of b:
   b = -3

6. Substitute the value of b into equation 1 to find the value of a:
   a = 16b - 16
   a = 16(-3) - 16
   a = -64

    The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs can be written as y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

To find the values of a and b, we can use any two input-output pairs and solve the resulting system of equations. Let's use the first and second pairs:
Input -16:
82 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
82 = a + (-16)b

Input -11:
52 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
52 = a + (-11)b

Simplifying these equations, we have:
82 = a - 16b
52 = a - 11b

To solve this system of equations, we can subtract the second equation from the first:
30 = -5b

Solving for b, we find:
b = -6

Substituting this value of b into any of the two equations, we can find the value of a. Let's use the first equation:

    Given the provided inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function. In general, a linear function can be represented as y = mx + b, where m represents the slope and b represents the y-intercept.

-7 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1  => -7 = a - b
9 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1  => 9 = a + 3b
-75 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1  => -75 = a - 18b
5 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1  => 5 = a + 2b

Simplifying these equations, we have:
 a - 18b = -75
 a - b = -7
 a + 3b = 9
 a - 18b = -75
 a + 2b = 5

To solve this system of equations, we can use any method like substitution or elimination. Using elimination, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the 'a' term:
( a - 18b ) - ( a - b ) = -75 - (-7)
-18b + b = -75 + 7

    To determine the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given data to form a system of equations and solve for the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1.

We have the following data points:

Input: -16  --> Output: 109
Input: -3   --> Output: 18
Input: 2    --> Output: -17
Input: 12   --> Output: -87
Input: 5    --> Output: -38

Using the form of the function, we can substitute the inputs and outputs into the equation to form the system of equations:

109 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
18 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-17 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1
-87 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1
-38 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1

Simplifying the equations, we get:

109 = a + (-16)b
18 = a + (-3)b
-17 = a + 2b
-87 = a + 12b
-38 = a + 5b

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

From equation 2, we have:
a = 18 - (-3)b
a = 18 + 3b  --> Equation 6

Substituting equation 6 into equations 1, 3, 4, and 5, we get:

109 = (18 + 3b) + (-16)b
109 = 18 + 3b - 16b
91 = -13b
b = -7

Substituting b = -7 into equation 6, we get:

Using the first data point:
When input = 18, output = 350
y = a(18^0) + b(18^1)
350 = a(1) + 18b
a + 18b = 350

Using the second data point:
When input = 12, output = 230
y = a(12^0) + b(12^1)
230 = a(1) + 12b
a + 12b = 230

We now have a system of linear equations:
a + 18b = 350   ----(1)
a + 12b = 230   ----(2)

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

Substituting b = 20 into equation (2):
a + 12(20) = 230

    Based on the given data points, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To determine the coefficients a and b, we can use any two data points to form a system of equations and solve for a and b.

Using the points (x1=18, y1=350) and (x2=12, y2=230), we can set up the following equations:

350 = a(18^0) + b(18^1)
230 = a(12^0) + b(12^1)

Simplifying the equations, we get:

350 = a + 18b
230 = a + 12b

Now we can solve this system of linear equations to find the values of a and b.

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

Simplifying further, we find:

b = 20

Substituting this value of b back into either of the original equations, we can solve for a:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given data points to fit a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the method of least squares, we can determine the values of a and b that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs.

For the given data points:
(18, 350), (12, 230), (-13, -270), (4, 70), (16, 310)

We can write the system of equations:

a(18^0) + b(18^1) = 350
a(12^0) + b(12^1) = 230
a(-13^0) + b(-13^1) = -270
a(4^0) + b(4^1) = 70
a(16^0) + b(16^1) = 310

Simplifying the equations, we get:

a + 12b = 230
a - 13b = -270
a + 4b = 70
a + 16b = 310

    From the given data, we can observe that the relationship between the input and output follows an exponential pattern. To capture this relationship, we can rewrite the function as y = a0 + a1x^1, where a0 and a1 are the constants to be determined.

By substituting the input and output values from the data into the equation, we can form a system of equations:

When x = 13, y = 177:
177 = a0 + a1(13)

When x = 14, y = 191:
191 = a0 + a1(14)

Solving this system of linear equations will give us the values of a0 and a1, which will define the function.

Let's calculate the values of a0 and a1.

177 = a0 + a1(13)   ...(1)
191 = a0 + a1(14)   ...(2)

To eliminate a0, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

191 - 177 = (a0 + a1(14)) - (a0 + a1(13))
14 = a1(14) - a1(13)
14 = a1(14 - 13)
14 = a1

Now, we can substitute the value of a1 into equation (1) to find the value of a0:

177 = a0 + a1(13)
177 = a0 + 14(13)
177 = a0 + 182
a0 = 177 - 182
a0 = -5

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, let's try to find a pattern that best describes the relationship between them.

Input: 13 --> Output: 177
Input: 14 --> Output: 191
Input: -8 --> Output: -117
Input: 3 --> Output: 37
Input: 7 --> Output: 93

By inspecting the outputs, we notice that they are all greater than the inputs. Additionally, there is a consistent difference between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. 

To formulate a function that captures this relationship, let's assume the function is of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

In this case, y = ax^0 accounts for the consistent difference between the inputs and outputs, while bx^1 addresses the fact that the outputs are consistently greater than the inputs.

To determine the coefficients a and b, we can use the following approach:

1. For the constant term (ax^0), we can select any of the outputs corresponding to an input of 3 or 7. Let's use the output for an input of 3: 37 = a * 3^0 + b * 3^1.
   Simplifying this equation gives us: 37 = a + 3b.

2. For the coefficient of x (bx^1), we can use the outputs for inputs of 13 and 14. Let's use the output for an input of 14: 191 = a * 14^0 + b * 14^1.
   Simplifying this equation gives us: 191 = a + 14b.

Now, we have a system of two linear equations:

1. 37 = a + 3b
2. 191 = a + 14b

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b, which can be used to define the function.

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we get:

191 - 37 = a + 14b - a - 3b
154 = 11b

Solving for b:

b = 154/11 = 14

Substituting the value of b back into equation 1:

37 = a + 3(14)
37 = a + 42
a = -5

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -5x^0 + 14x^1
