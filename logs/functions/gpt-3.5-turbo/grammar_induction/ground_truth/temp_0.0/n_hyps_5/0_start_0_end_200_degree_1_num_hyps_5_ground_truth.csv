"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can fit a linear equation in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 to the given data points. 

Let's denote x as the input value and y as the output value. The data points can be denoted as (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4), and (x5, y5).

From the given data points, we can form the following equations:

Equation 1: y1 = a + bx1
Equation 2: y2 = a + bx2
Equation 3: y3 = a + bx3
Equation 4: y4 = a + bx4
Equation 5: y5 = a + bx5

Rewriting these equations, we have:

Equation 1: (x1, y1): -213 = a - 10b
Equation 2: (x2, y2): 167 = a + 9b
Equation 3: (x3, y3): 67 = a + 4b
Equation 4: (x4, y4): -73 = a - 3b
Equation 5: (x5, y5): 387 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations, we can obtain the values of a and b.

Let's solve the system of equations using a matrix method:

The coefficient matrix:

| 1  -10|
| 1   9 |
| 1   4 |
| 1  -3 |
| 1  20 |

The constant matrix:

|-213 |
| 167 |
|  67 |
| -73 |
| 387 |

We seek a solution in the form of [a, b] as our variable matrix.

The equation Ax = b can be written as:

Coefficient matrix * Variable matrix = Constant matrix

We can use matrix inversion to solve for the variable matrix:

Variable matrix = Inverse(Coefficient matrix) * Constant matrix

Calculating the inverse of the coefficient matrix:

Inverse(Coefficient matrix) = 1/(1 * 20 - (-10 * 9)) * |  9   10 |
                                                   | -9   1  |

Calculating the inverse of the coefficient matrix:

Inverse(Coefficient matrix) = 1/170 * |   9   10 |
                                      |  -9    1  |

Evaluating the inverse:

Inverse(Coefficient matrix) = | 0.053   0.059 |
                            | -0.053  0.006 |

Calculating the variable matrix:

Variable matrix = Inverse(Coefficient matrix) * Constant matrix

Evaluating the calculations:

Variable matrix = | 0.053   0.059 | * |-213 |
                 | -0.053  0.006 | * | 167 |
                                  |  67 |
                                  | -73 |
                                  | 387 |

Variable matrix = |-1.383 |
                 | 16.707 |

From these calculations, we find that a ≈ -1.383 and b ≈ 16.707.

    Using the given input-output pairs, we can form the equations:

167 = a + b(9)^1
67 = a + b(4)^1
-73 = a + b(-3)^1
387 = a + b(20)^1

Simplifying these equations, we get:

a - 10b = -213
a + 9b = 167
a + 4b = 67
a - 3b = -73
a + 20b = 387

Solving this system of equations using any method (e.g., substitution or elimination), we find:

a = 5

Let's verify if this function satisfies all the given input-output pairs:

- For the input -18, the function becomes y = -3(-18)^0 - 6(-18)^1 = 339, which matches the output.
- For the input 0, the function becomes y = -3(0)^0 - 6(0)^1 = -3, which matches the output.

    Based on the given data points, we can observe that the relationship between the input (x) and the output (y) can be described by a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Taking a closer look at the data, we can see that when x increases by 4, y decreases by 20. This indicates that the coefficient (b) of x follows a pattern of -5. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as y = a - 5x.

To determine the value of a, we can substitute any of the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve for a. Let's use the first pair (x = 5, y = -31):

-31 = a - 5(5)
-31 = a - 25
a = -6

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we will assume a linear relationship in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Given the inputs and outputs, we can create a system of equations to solve for the values of a and b.

When the input is 5, the output is -31:
-31 = a(5^0) + b(5^1) = a + 5b   ----(1)

When the input is 9, the output is -51:
-51 = a(9^0) + b(9^1) = a + 9b   ----(2)

Solving the system of equations (1) and (2) will give us the values of a and b.

From equation (1): a = -31 - 5b 
Substituting this into equation (2):
-51 = (-31 - 5b) + 9b
-51 = -31 + 4b
-20 = 4b
b = -5

Substituting the value of b into equation (1):
a = -31 - 5(-5)
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

    From the given data, we can observe that the output (y) is dependent on the input (x). So, we can assume that the relationship can be described by a linear equation.

Based on the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 is equal to 1, we can rewrite the equation as:

y = a(1) + bx

Now let's find the values of a and b by substituting the given inputs and outputs into the equation:

For input x = 5, output y = -31:
-31 = a(1) + 5b    ---- (1)

For input x = 9, output y = -51:
-51 = a(1) + 9b    ---- (2)

Solving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

Multiplying equation (1) by 9 and equation (2) by 5, we get:

-279 = 9a + 45b    ---- (3)
-255 = 5a + 45b    ---- (4)

Subtracting equation (4) from equation (3), we get:

-24 = 4a   ---- (5)

Dividing equation (5) by 4, we find:

Substituting the value of a into equation (1), we get:

Substituting the value of b back into equation (1):

From the given input-output pairs, we can create a system of linear equations to solve for the coefficients a and b.

Using the first pair (7, -98), we have -98 = a(1) + b(7).
Using the second pair (17, -218), we have -218 = a(1) + b(17).
Using the third pair (5, -74), we have -74 = a(1) + b(5).
Using the fourth pair (3, -50), we have -50 = a(1) + b(3).
Using the fifth pair (-6, 58), we have 58 = a(1) + b(-6).

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b, which will define our function.

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we get -120 = 0 + b(10) -> b = -12.
Substituting b = -12 into equation 1, we get -98 = a + (-12)(7) -> a = -14.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, the function can be written as:

To find the values of a and b, we can use the simultaneous equations formed by substituting the given inputs and outputs:

For the first data point (9, 160):
160 = a*(9^0) + b*(9^1)
160 = a + 9b

For the second data point (13, 228):
228 = a*(13^0) + b*(13^1)
228 = a + 13b

To solve simultaneous equations, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:

(228 - 160) = (a + 13b) - (a + 9b)
68 = 4b

Simplifying, we find that b = 17.

Substituting the value of b into either of the equations, we can solve for a:

For the input -1, output 8:

    The relationship between the inputs and outputs seems to follow a linear pattern. Let's assume the function is of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Based on the given data points, we can identify the following equations:

When input x = 13, output y = -66
-66 = a + 13b  ------ (Equation 1)

When input x = -20, output y = 132
132 = a + (-20)b  ------ (Equation 2)

When input x = 18, output y = -96
-96 = a + 18b  ------ (Equation 3)

When input x = 0, output y = 12
12 = a + 0b  ------ (Equation 4)

When input x = 11, output y = -54
-54 = a + 11b  ------ (Equation 5)

We have a system of equations. Solving these equations simultaneously will help us determine the values of a and b.

From Equation 4, we can deduce that a = 12.

Now, let's subtract Equation 4 from the remaining equations:

(Equation 1 - Equation 4):
-66 - 12 = a + 13b - (a + 0b)
-78 = 13b
b = -6

(Equation 2 - Equation 4):
132 - 12 = a + (-20)b - (a + 0b)
120 = -20b
b = -6

(Equation 3 - Equation 4):
-96 - 12 = a + 18b - (a + 0b)
-108 = 18b
b = -6

(Equation 5 - Equation 4):
-54 - 12 = a + 11b - (a + 0b)
-66 = 11b
b = -6

From all four equations, we find that b = -6.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the method of least squares regression. This method helps us determine the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the provided data pairs, we can set up a system of equations:

-8 = a + b(-1)^1
76 = a + b(5)^1
48 = a + b(3)^1
118 = a + b(8)^1
188 = a + b(13)^1

Simplifying these equations, we get:

-8 = a - b
76 = a + 5b
48 = a + 3b
118 = a + 8b
188 = a + 13b

To solve this system of equations, we can use methods like substitution or matrix inversion. Let's use substitution:

Rearranging the first equation, we have:

a = -8 + b

Substituting this value of a into the second equation:

76 = (-8 + b) + 5b
76 = -8 + 6b
6b = 84
b = 14

Substituting the value of b back into the first equation:

a = -8 + 14
a = 6

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 6x^0 + 14x^1

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

By observing the given input-output pairs, we can determine the coefficients a and b.

- For the first pair (-17, -292):
    - y = ax^0 + bx^1
    - -292 = a(1) + b(-17)
    - -292 = a - 17b

- For the second pair (-6, -105):
    - y = ax^0 + bx^1
    - -105 = a(1) + b(-6)
    - -105 = a - 6b

- For the third pair (-16, -275):
    - y = ax^0 + bx^1
    - -275 = a(1) + b(-16)
    - -275 = a - 16b

- For the fourth pair (-18, -309):
    - y = ax^0 + bx^1
    - -309 = a(1) + b(-18)
    - -309 = a - 18b

- For the fifth pair (1, 14):
    - y = ax^0 + bx^1
    - 14 = a(1) + b(1)
    - 14 = a + b

Now we have a system of equations that we can solve to find the values of a and b:

-292 = a - 17b
-105 = a - 6b
-275 = a - 16b
-309 = a - 18b
14 = a + b

Solving this system of equations, we find:
a = -13
b = 27

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Knowing that any number raised to the power of zero is 1, we can simplify the equation to:

Output: y = a + bx

To find the values of a and b, we can use two of the given data points and solve for the coefficients.

Using the first two data points (-17, -292) and (-6, -105), we can set up the following equations:

-292 = a + (-17)b   (Equation 1)
-105 = a + (-6)b    (Equation 2)

Solving Equations 1 and 2 simultaneously will give us the values of a and b.

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1, we get:

-292 - (-105) = a - a + (-17)b - (-6)b
-292 + 105 = -11b
-187 = -11b

Dividing both sides by -11, we find:

b = 17

Substituting this value of b into Equation 2, we can solve for a:

-105 = a + (-6)(17)
-105 = a - 102
a = -3

Using the given data, we can find the values of a and b by substituting the input and output values into the equation:

a ≈ -6.144

-26 + 14 = 4b
-12 = 4b
b = -3

Substitute the value of b into either of the previous equations to solve for a:
-14 = a + (-3)
-14 = a - 3
a = -11

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

3) a + (9)b = -62
4) a + (-5)b = 36

    Based on the given input-output pairs, we can notice that the relationship between the input and output involves both the constant term and the linear term. 

Let's consider the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

For the constant term, when x^0 = 1 (since any number raised to the power of zero is 1), the corresponding output is given as follows:
    Input: -20  ->  Output: 265
    Input: -15  ->  Output: 195
    Input: -5   ->  Output: 55
    Input: -10  ->  Output: 125
    Input: 6    ->  Output: -99

To find the constant term (a), we can take any of the input-output pairs, for example, (-20, 265):
    265 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
    265 = a - 20b   (since x^0 = 1)
    a - 20b = 265    ----(1)

Now, for the linear term, when x^1 = x, the corresponding output is given as follows:
    Input: -20  ->  Output: 265
    Input: -15  ->  Output: 195
    Input: -5   ->  Output: 55
    Input: -10  ->  Output: 125
    Input: 6    ->  Output: -99

To find the linear term (b), we can take any of the input-output pairs, for example, (-20, 265):
    265 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
    265 = a - 20b   (since x^0 = 1)
    -20b = 265 - a    ----(2)

Now, we have the equations (1) and (2) that represent the relationship between the input and output. We can solve them simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Given that equations (1) and (2) are:
    a - 20b = 265   ----(1)
    -20b = 265 - a  ----(2)

To eliminate b, we can multiply equation (2) by -1 and add it to equation (1):
    a - 20b + 20b = 265 - (265 - a)
    a = a
    0 = a

From this result, we can see that a = 0. 

Substituting a = 0 into equation (1):
    0 - 20b = 265
    -20b = 265
    b = 265/(-20)
    b = -13.25

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
    Output: y = 0x^0 - 13.25x^1
    Output: y = -13.25x

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of the coefficients ""a"" and ""b"" in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1.

For the first point (-20, 265):
265 = a(-20^0) + b(-20^1)
265 = a + (-20b)       --> Equation 1

For the second point (-15, 195):
195 = a(-15^0) + b(-15^1)
195 = a + (-15b)       --> Equation 2

For the third point (-5, 55):
55 = a(-5^0) + b(-5^1)
55 = a + (-5b)         --> Equation 3

For the fourth point (-10, 125):
125 = a(-10^0) + b(-10^1)
125 = a + (-10b)       --> Equation 4

For the fifth point (6, -99):
-99 = a(6^0) + b(6^1)
-99 = a + 6b            --> Equation 5

We now have a system of 5 equations with 2 unknowns (a and b). We can solve this system to find the values of a and b.

From Equation 1:
a = 265 + 20b        --> Equation 6

Substitute Equation 6 into Equation 2:
195 = (265 + 20b) + (-15b)
195 = 265 + 20b - 15b
195 = 265 + 5b
5b = 195 - 265
5b = -70
b = -14

Substitute the value of b into Equation 6:
a = 265 + 20(-14)
a = 265 - 280
a = -15

    The general form of the function is y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since x^0 equals 1, we can rewrite the equation as y = a + bx.

Now, let's plug in the given input/output pairs to find the values of a and b.

When x = -20, y = 265.
265 = a + b(-20)

When x = -15, y = 195.
195 = a + b(-15)

When x = -5, y = 55.
55 = a + b(-5)

When x = -10, y = 125.
125 = a + b(-10)

When x = 6, y = -99.
-99 = a + b(6)

We have a system of linear equations. By solving this system, we can find the values of a and b.

From the first equation, we have:
a - 20b = 265

From the second equation, we have:
a - 15b = 195

From the third equation, we have:
a - 5b = 55

From the fourth equation, we have:
a - 10b = 125

From the fifth equation, we have:
a + 6b = -99

-310 = a - 17b

Using the second pair (17, 302):

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use the given data points to determine the values of the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the given data points:

Input: -17, Output: -310
Input: 17, Output: 302
Input: 10, Output: 176
Input: 12, Output: 212
Input: 13, Output: 230

We can observe that the outputs are increasing linearly with the inputs. Let's solve for the coefficients a and b.

When Input = -17:

-310 = a*(-17)^0 + b*(-17)^1
-310 = a - 17b

When Input = 17:

302 = a*(17)^0 + b*(17)^1
302 = a + 17b

When Input = 10:

176 = a*(10)^0 + b*(10)^1
176 = a + 10b

When Input = 12:

212 = a*(12)^0 + b*(12)^1
212 = a + 12b

When Input = 13:

230 = a*(13)^0 + b*(13)^1
230 = a + 13b

By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

Adding the equations (1) and (2):

-310 + 302 = a + 17b + a - 17b
-8 = 2a

Dividing by 2:

-4 = a

Substituting the value of a in equations (3) to (5):

for (3): 176 = -4 + 10b
for (4): 212 = -4 + 12b
for (5): 230 = -4 + 13b

Simplifying these equations:

for (3): 180 = 10b
for (4): 216 = 12b
for (5): 234 = 13b

By solving these equations, we find that b = 18.

Substituting the value of b in equation (3):

180 = 10 * 18b
18 = 18b
b = 1

Therefore, the equation that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = -4x^0 + 18x^1
y = -4 + 18x

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems like there is a linear relationship between the input (x) and the output (y) values. The function can be written in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Since any number raised to the power of zero is always 1, we can simplify the function to y = a + bx.

To find the values of a and b, we can use two different inputs and outputs to form a system of equations. Let's use the first and second input-output pair:

When x = -16, y = 297:

297 = a + (-16)b

And when x = 18, y = -315:

-315 = a + 18b

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b, and we can utilize those to determine the function that captures the relationship.

Let's solve the system of equations:

297 = a - 16b   [equation 1]
-315 = a + 18b   [equation 2]

To eliminate a, let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(297 - (-315)) = (a - 16b) - (a + 18b)
612 = -34b

Dividing both sides by -34 will give us the value of b:

b = 612 / -34
b = -18

Substituting the value of b back into equation 1 or equation 2 will give us the value of a. Let's use equation 1:

297 = a - 16(-18)
297 = a + 288
a = 297 - 288
a = 9

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 9 + (-18)x

y = -18x + 9

Using the inputs (9 and 16) and their corresponding outputs (133 and 238), we can set up a system of two equations:

133 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
238 = a(16)^0 + b(16)^1

Simplifying these equations:
133 = a + 9b
238 = a + 16b

Rearranging the equations to isolate 'a':
a = 133 - 9b
a = 238 - 16b

Setting the right-hand sides of the equations equal to each other:
133 - 9b = 238 - 16b

Solving for b:
7b = 105
b = 105/7
b = 15

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use linear regression to determine the coefficients ""a"" and ""b"" in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the given inputs and outputs:

Input: -11, Output: 72
Input: -3, Output: 8
Input: -2, Output: 0
Input: 18, Output: -160
Input: -7, Output: 40

We can solve for the coefficients ""a"" and ""b"" by fitting a linear model to the data points. 

The general equation for a linear regression model is:

y = mx + b

Where ""m"" is the slope and ""b"" is the y-intercept. In our case, since we want to find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can rewrite the equation as:

y = a + bx

To find the coefficients ""a"" and ""b"", we can solve the system of equations formed by substituting the input-output pairs into the equation.

For the first input: -11, we have:

72 = a + b(-11)

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

72 = a - 11b

For the second input: -3, we have:

8 = a + b(-3)

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

8 = a - 3b

For the third input: -2, we have:

0 = a + b(-2)

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

0 = a - 2b

For the fourth input: 18, we have:

-160 = a + b(18)

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

-160 = a + 18b

For the fifth input: -7, we have:

40 = a + b(-7)

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

40 = a - 7b

We now have a system of equations in the form:

72 = a - 11b
8 = a - 3b
0 = a - 2b
-160 = a + 18b
40 = a - 7b

a = -7
b = -5

    From the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the first term (x^0) in the function does not affect the output. Thus, the function can be simplified to y = bx^1.

By substituting the inputs and outputs into the form y = bx^1, we can find the relationship between them.

For the first example:
-204 = b(11^1)
-204 = 11b
b = -204/11
b = -18.545

For the second example:
66 = b(-4^1)
66 = -4b
b = -66/-4
b = 16.5

For the third example:
300 = b(-17^1)
300 = -17b
b = -300/-17
b = 17.647

For the fourth example:
264 = b(-15^1)

b = -264/-15
b = 17.6

For the fifth example:

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given data points (-12, 9), (20, -55), (-4, -7), (-10, 5), and (8, -31).

The function can be written as:
y = ax^0 + bx^1

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the x and y values from one of the data points into the equation:

For the first data point (-12, 9):
9 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
9 = a + (-12)b

Simplifying the equation, we get:
9 = a - 12b

Using this equation, we can find the values of a and b for the remaining data points:

For (20, -55):
-55 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
-55 = a + 20b

For (-4, -7):
-7 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
-7 = a - 4b

For (-10, 5):
5 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
5 = a - 10b

For (8, -31):
-31 = a(8)^0 + b(8)^1
-31 = a + 8b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Solving the first and second equations, we get:
9 = a - 12b
-55 = a + 20b

By subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
64 = -32b
b = -2

Substituting the value of b into the first equation, we get:
9 = a - 12(-2)
9 = a + 24
a = -15

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -15x^0 - 2x^1

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's assume the function has the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since x^0 is always equal to 1, we can simplify the function to y = a + bx^1.

Now, let's find the values of a and b using the given inputs and outputs:

For the first pair of input (-12) and output (9), we have 9 = a + (-12)b.

For the second pair of input (20) and output (-55), we have -55 = a + (20)b.

For the third pair of input (-4) and output (-7), we have -7 = a + (-4)b.

For the fourth pair of input (-10) and output (5), we have 5 = a + (-10)b.

For the fifth pair of input (8) and output (-31), we have -31 = a + (8)b.

We now have a system of five equations with two unknowns (a and b). Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b.

By solving these equations, we find that a = -2 and b = -1.

Input: -1   =>  Output: -7
Input: 3    =>  Output: 9
Input: -18  =>  Output: -75
Input: 2    =>  Output: 5

We can see that for each given input, the output is obtained by multiplying the input by a specific factor and subtracting a constant value. So, let's try to find the values of the factor and the constant that capture this relationship.

For the input -18, we can write the equation:
-75 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
-75 = a + (-18b)

For the input -1:
-7 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1
-7 = a - b

For the input 3:
9 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1
9 = a + 3b

For the input -18 again:
-75 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
-75 = a + (-18b)

For the input 2:
5 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1
5 = a + 2b

We now have a system of linear equations. By solving this system, we can find the values of the factor 'b' and the constant 'a' that capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

When x = 6, y = 74 -> 74 = a + 6b    (Equation 1)
When x = 19, y = 191 -> 191 = a + 19b  (Equation 2)
When x = -11, y = -79 -> -79 = a - 11b (Equation 3)
When x = -5, y = -25 -> -25 = a - 5b   (Equation 4)
When x = -10, y = -70 -> -70 = a - 10b (Equation 5)

Solving Equations 1-5 simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

Adding Equation 4 to Equation 5:
(-25) + (-70) = (a - 5b) + (a - 10b)
-95 = 2a - 15b     (Equation 6)

Adding Equation 3 to Equation 5:
(-79) + (-70) = (a - 11b) + (a - 10b)
-149 = 2a - 21b    (Equation 7)

Adding Equation 3 to Equation 4:
(-79) + (-25) = (a - 11b) + (a - 5b)
-104 = 2a - 16b    (Equation 8)

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 3:
(-79) - 191 = (a - 11b) - (a + 19b)
-270 = -30b
b = 9

Substitute b = 9 into Equation 6:
-95 = 2a - 15(9)
-95 = 2a - 135
2a = 40
a = 20

    The function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Explanation:
Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the output is determined by multiplying the input by -4 and then subtracting 4 from the result. This can be represented using the equation y = -4x - 4.

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs provided, we need to identify the pattern in the data.

Analyzing the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the output is related to the input in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, where:
- The coefficient of x^0 (a) represents a constant term.
- The coefficient of x^1 (b) represents the linear term.

By substituting the given inputs and outputs into the equation, we can solve for the values of a and b.

Using the first input and output (6 and 8):
8 = a(6^0) + b(6^1) = a + 6b

Using the second input and output (-5 and -25):
-25 = a(-5^0) + b(-5^1) = a - 5b

We now have two equations with two variables:
a + 6b = 8
a - 5b = -25

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = -2 and b = 5.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -2x^0 + 5x^1

    The relationship between inputs and outputs appears to be a linear relationship, as the pattern follows the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

    Input: 9, Output: 29
    Input: 2, Output: 8
    Input: -1, Output: -1
    Input: -6, Output: -16

From the given examples, we can derive the following equations:

    29 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)      -> (1)
    8 = a(2^0) + b(2^1)        -> (2)
    -1 = a((-1)^0) + b((-1)^1) -> (3)
    -16 = a((-6)^0) + b((-6)^1) -> (4)

Simplifying equations (1) to (4):

    29 = a + 9b      -> (5)
    8 = a + 2b        -> (6)
    -1 = a - b        -> (7)
    -16 = a - 6b      -> (8)

Solving equations (6) and (7) for a and b, we get:

    a = 3
    b = -4

Substituting the values of a and b into equation (5) to verify:

    29 = 3 + 9(-4)
    29 = 3 - 36
    29 = -33

The values are not matching which means there might be an error. Let's solve the remaining two equations (7) and (8):

    a = -1 + b        -> (7)
    -16 = a - 6b      -> (8)

Substituting equation (7) into equation (8):

    -16 = (-1 + b) - 6b
    -16 = -1 + b - 6b
    -16 = -1 - 5b
    -16 + 1 = -5b
    -15 = -5b

Solving for b:

    b = -15/-5
    b = 3

Substituting the value of b into equation (7):

    a = -1 + 3
    a = 2

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's now match the given inputs and outputs to solve for a and b.

Input: -9, Output: 162
162 = a(1) + b(-9)

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to identify the pattern and the corresponding coefficients.

Looking at the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the output values decrease as the inputs become more positive. This suggests that there is a negative linear relationship between the inputs and outputs.

To find the function, let's write the outputs as a linear combination of two terms: a constant term (a) and a linear term (b * x).

Let's write the function in the form:
Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Comparing the inputs and outputs, we can write the function as follows:

For Input: -9, Output: 162:

For Input: -14, Output: 242:
242 = a + (-14)b ... (5)

We can solve this system of linear equations to find the values of a and b.

By subtracting equation (1) from equation (3), we get:
82 - 162 = a + (-4)b - (a + (-9)b)

b = -16

Substituting the value of b into equation (1), we get:

Using the first data point (18, 350):
350 = a(18^0) + b(18^1)
350 = a + 18b

Using the second data point (12, 230):
230 = a(12^0) + b(12^1)
230 = a + 12b

Solving the system of equations:

a + 18b = 350
a + 12b = 230

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation:

(a + 18b) - (a + 12b) = 350 - 230
6b = 120
b = 20

By substituting the values from the input-output pairs into the equation, we can solve for the coefficients a and b. 

For example, when input x = 13, the output y = 177. Substituting these values into the equation, we get 177 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1. Simplifying this equation gives us:

    Using the given data points, we can form the following equations:

177 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
191 = a(14^0) + b(14^1)
-117 = a(-8^0) + b(-8^1)
37 = a(3^0) + b(3^1)
93 = a(7^0) + b(7^1)

Simplifying these equations, we get:

177 = a + 13b
191 = a + 14b
-117 = a - 8b
37 = a + 3b
93 = a + 7b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Adding the first and fourth equations:
177 + 37 = 2a + 16b
214 = 2a + 16b

Adding the second and fifth equations:
191 + 93 = 2a + 21b
284 = 2a + 21b

Subtracting the fourth equation from the fifth equation:
93 - 37 = a + 7b - (a + 3b)
56 = 4b
b = 14

Plugging in the value of b into the third equation:
-117 = a - 8(14)
-117 = a - 112
a = -117 + 112
a = -5

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -5x^0 + 14x^1
        y = -5 + 14x
