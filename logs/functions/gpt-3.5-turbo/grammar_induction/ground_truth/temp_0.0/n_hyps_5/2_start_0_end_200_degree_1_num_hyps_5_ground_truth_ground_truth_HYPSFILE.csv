"To write the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find the coefficients a and b. Let's assume that the function is a linear combination of the inputs raised to the power of 0 and 1, respectively.

Given that the form of the function is y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can equate the function to each input and output pair to find the values of a and b.

For the first pair:
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

For the second pair:
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

For the fourth pair:
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

For the fifth pair:
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b, and then we can write the function.

Putting the value of b in equation 1: a = -213 + 10(20) ⟶ a = -13

From the given data points, we can observe that the constant term (a) is the same for all inputs, while the coefficient of x (b) changes depending on the input value. 

By analyzing the data, we can determine that the constant term (a) is -155 and the coefficient of x (b) is 12. Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

"To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

From the given inputs and outputs, we can observe the following pattern:

Input: -13  Output: -197
Input: -11  Output: -169
Input: 20   Output: 265
Input: -10  Output: -155
Input: 7    Output: 83

For x = -13, we have -197 = a(1) + b(-13)^1 => -197 = a - 13b.
For x = -11, we have -169 = a(1) + b(-11)^1 => -169 = a - 11b.
For x = 20, we have 265 = a(1) + b(20)^1 => 265 = a + 20b.
For x = -10, we have -155 = a(1) + b(-10)^1 => -155 = a - 10b.
For x = 7, we have 83 = a(1) + b(7)^1 => 83 = a + 7b.

We now have a system of equations:

-197 = a - 13b
-169 = a - 11b
265 = a + 20b
-155 = a - 10b

"To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given data points to determine the values of a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's solve for a and b using two of the given data points:

Using the first data point (-13, -197):
-197 = a(-13)^0 + b(-13)^1
-197 = a - 13b        --> Equation 1

Using the second data point (-11, -169):
-169 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
-169 = a - 11b        --> Equation 2

Now we will solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b:

Multiply Equation 1 by 11: -197a + 143b = -2170  --> Equation 3
Multiply Equation 2 by 13: -169a + 143b = -2197  --> Equation 4

Subtract Equation 4 from Equation 3:
(-197a + 143b) - (-169a + 143b) = -2170 - (-2197)
-197a + 143b + 169a - 143b = -2170 + 2197
-28a = 27

Divide both sides by -28:
a = -27/28

Substitute the value of a back into Equation 1:
-197 = (-27/28) - 13b

Multiply both sides by 28 to get rid of the fraction:
-197(28) = -27 - 364b
-5516 = -27 - 364b

Rearrange to solve for b:
364b = 5516 + 27
364b = 5543
b = 5543/364

A quadratic function (y = ax^2 + bx + c) seems to be a better fit for the given data. Let's try to find the quadratic equation that captures the relationship.

Using the given data points (-2, 17), (7, -145), (-10, 161), (9, -181), and (-20, 341), we can set up a system of equations:

17 = a(-2)^2 + b(-2) + c
-145 = a(7)^2 + b(7) + c
161 = a(-10)^2 + b(-10) + c
-181 = a(9)^2 + b(9) + c

Calculating the mean of inputs (x̅) and outputs (y̅):
x̅ = (20 + (-1) + 20 + 12 + 18) / 5 = 69 / 5 = 13.8
y̅ = (-307 + 8 + (-307) + (-187) + (-277)) / 5 = -1070 / 5 = -214

Calculating the differences between inputs (x) and the mean of inputs:
Δx = [20 - 13.8, -1 - 13.8, 20 - 13.8, 12 - 13.8, 18 - 13.8] = [6.2, -14.8, 6.2, -1.8, 4.2]

Calculating the squared differences between inputs (x) and the mean of inputs:

   Equation 2: -5a - 5b = -109   --> a = (109 + 5b) / (-5)

   Equation 4: -15a - 15b = -289 --> a = (289 + 15b) / (-15)

3. Set the equivalent expressions for a to be equal to each other and solve for b:
   (325 + 17b) / (-17) = (109 + 5b) / (-5)
   Cross-multiply and simplify:

From the first equation -8 = a - b, we can rewrite it as a = b - 8.

Substituting this value of 'a' into the second equation 76 = a + 5b, we get:
76 = (b - 8) + 5b

By assuming that the quadratic term is zero, the function can be simplified to:

Adding the two equations:

To solve this system of equations, we can eliminate the constant term (a) by subtracting equations 2, 3, 4, and 5 from equation 1:

Eq. 1 - Eq. 2: -5b + 175c = 70
Eq. 1 - Eq. 3: -15b + 375c = 210
Eq. 1 - Eq. 4: -10b + 300c = 140
Eq. 1 - Eq. 5: -16b + 364c = 364

Now we can solve these equations to find the values of b and c:

-5b + 175c = 70      (Eq. 6)
-15b + 375c = 210     (Eq. 7)
-10b + 300c = 140     (Eq. 8)
-16b + 364c = 364     (Eq. 9)

Solving equations 6 and 7, we get:

3b + 15c = -5         (Eq. 10)

Solving equations 8 and 9, we get:

3b - 64c = -224       (Eq. 11)

Now we can solve equations 10 and 11 simultaneously to find the values of b and c:

3b + 15c = -5         (Eq. 10)
3b - 64c = -224       (Eq. 11)

Multiplying equation 10 by 2 and subtracting equation 11, we get:

30c +  6b = -10
-3b + 64c = 224

36c = 214
c ≈ 5.944

Substituting the value of c into equation 10, we get:

3b + 15(5.944) = -5
3b = -105.16
b ≈ -35.053

Now, we can substitute the values of b and c back into any of the original equations to find the value of a. Let's use equation 1:

a - 20(-35.053) + 400(5.944) = 265
a + 701.06 + 2377.6 = 265

"Based on the given data points and the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can assume that the relationship between inputs and outputs is a linear relationship. Therefore, let's assume that the function can be represented as y = a + bx.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given data points:

Input: -11, Output: -20
-20 = a + (-11)b

Input: -8, Output: -14 
-14 = a + (-8)b

Input: -2, Output: -2
-2 = a + (-2)b

Input: -7, Output: -12 
-12 = a + (-7)b

Input: -17, Output: -32
-32 = a + (-17)b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

First, let's rewrite the equations:

-11b + a = -20   ... (1)
-8b + a = -14    ... (2)
-2b + a = -2     ... (3)
-7b + a = -12    ... (4)
-17b + a = -32   ... (5)

From equation (3), we can find a in terms of b:
a = -2 + 2b

Substituting this expression for a in equations (1), (2), (4), and (5), we get:

-11b + (-2 + 2b) = -20
→ -11b - 2 + 2b = -20
→ -9b = -18
→ b = 2

Substituting b = 2 into the equation a = -2 + 2b, we get:
a = -2 + 2(2) = 2

a = -12 + 7b              (9)
a = -32 + 17b             (10)

By substituting equation (6) into equations (7) to (10), we can solve for b:

-20 + 11b = -14 + 8b
-20 + 11b = -2 + 2b
-20 + 11b = -12 + 7b

a + b*(-3) = 18
a + b*2 = -17
a + b*12 = -87
a + b*5 = -38

Solving this system, we find a = -10.5 and b = -7.5.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

"Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be approximated by a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's use the method of least squares to find the values of a and b that minimize the overall error. We can solve this using matrix equations.

Let X be the matrix containing the input values, with the first column representing x^0 and the second column representing x^1. Let Y be the matrix containing the corresponding output values.

Then, we can write the matrix equation as:
Y = X * Coefficients

where Coefficients is a column vector [a, b].

By solving the matrix equation, we can find the values of a and b.

Using the given input-output pairs, we have:
X = [[1, -16], [1, -3], [1, 2], [1, 12], [1, 5]]
Y = [[109], [18], [-17], [-87], [-38]]

To find the Coefficients, we can use the equation:
Coefficients = (Xᵀ * X)^(-1) * Xᵀ * Y

Calculating the values of Coefficients using the above equation, we get:
Coefficients = [[-14],[-8]]

Therefore, the function that best captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, the function that captures the relationship can be represented as follows:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs follows a linear equation.

The general equation for a linear relationship is y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.

To find the specific equation for this relationship, we need to find the values of m and c.

Using the given input and output values:
-16 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
109 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-17 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1
-87 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1
-38 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1

Since any number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1, the equations above simplify to:
-16 = a + (-16)b
109 = a + (-3)b
-17 = a + 2b
-87 = a + 12b
-38 = a + 5b

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

Subtracting the 2nd equation from the 1st gives:
(-16) - (109) = a + (-16)b - a - (-3)b
-125 = (-19)b
b = 125/19

Substituting b into any of the equations above, we can solve for a. Let's use the 1st equation:
-16 = a + (-16)(125/19)
a = -16 + (16)(125/19)
a = -16 + (2000/19)
a = -16 + 105.263
a = 89.263

Therefore, the equation that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs is:

"After examining the data provided, we need to find the values of coefficients a and b that best describe the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

To get a better understanding, let's consider the inputs as x values and the outputs as y values.

Input x: -16, Output y: 109
Input x: -3, Output y: 18
Input x: 2, Output y: -17
Input x: 12, Output y: -87
Input x: 5, Output y: -38

From the given form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can rewrite it as y = a + bx. Now, we need to find the values of coefficients a and b.

Let's substitute the input-output pairs into our equation:

109 = a + (-16)b      (Equation 1)
18 = a + (-3)b        (Equation 2)
-17 = a + 2b          (Equation 3)
-87 = a + 12b         (Equation 4)
-38 = a + 5b          (Equation 5)

We now have a system of linear equations with two unknowns (a and b). We can solve this system using various methods, such as substitution or elimination.

Using the elimination method, we can eliminate a by subtracting Equation 3 from Equation 1 and Equation 5 from Equation 4:

109 - (-17) = a + (-16)b - (a + 2b)       (Equation 6)
-87 - (-38) = a + 12b - (a + 5b)           (Equation 7)

Simplifying Equation 6 and Equation 7:

126 = -14b
-49 = 7b

Solving for b:

b = -126/14
b = -9

Substituting b = -9 into Equation 3:

-17 = a + 2(-9)
-17 = a - 18
a = 1

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 1 + (-9)x

"The given data cannot be accurately represented by a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 since the outputs do not seem to follow a simple pattern based solely on the power of x. However, if we assume a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can approximate it using the equation y = mx + c, where m and c are constants.

By analyzing the given data points, we can estimate the values of m and c:

For the first data point: (-16, 109)
109 = m * -16 + c
Let's assume m = -7 and solve for c:
109 = -7 * -16 + c
109 = 112 + c
c = 109 - 112
c = -3

For the second data point: (-3, 18)
18 = -7 * -3 + (-3)
18 = 21 + (-3)
18 = 18

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can calculate the values of a and b.

When Input = -16, Output = 109:
109 = a(1) + b(-16)^1
109 = a - 16b

When Input = -3, Output = 18:
18 = a(1) + b(-3)^1
18 = a - 3b

When Input = 2, Output = -17:
-17 = a(1) + b(2)^1
-17 = a + 2b

Using these two equations, we can solve for 'a' and 'b'.

109 = a - 16b  (1)
18 = a - 3b      (2)

Multiplying equation (2) by 16, we get:

288 = 16a - 48b   (3)

Subtracting equation (3) from equation (1), we get:

-179 = -15a + 32b

Simplifying, we have:

15a - 32b = 179

Now we can solve this system of linear equations to find the values of 'a' and 'b'.

Solving the system of equations (15a - 32b = 179, 15a + 48b = 109) yields:
a = -4
b = -5

Substituting the first two pairs of inputs and outputs (-16, 109) and (-3, 18):

109 = a(1)^0 + b(-16)^1 + c(-16)^2
18 = a(1)^0 + b(-3)^1 + c(-3)^2

Simplifying the equations:

109 = a - 16b + 256c
18 = a - 3b + 9c

Similarly, substituting the last three pairs of inputs and outputs (2, -17), (12, -87), (5, -38), we can obtain three more equations:

"To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given data points:

Input: -9, Output: 162
Input: 17, Output: -254
Input: -4, Output: 82
Input: -18, Output: 306
Input: -14, Output: 242

We can see that the outputs are not directly related to the inputs in a linear manner. However, by observing the pattern, we can deduce that the relationship can be described by a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's calculate the values of a and b:

For the first data point (-9, 162):
162 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
162 = a + (-9b)

For the second data point (17, -254):
-254 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
-254 = a + 17b

For the third data point (-4, 82):
82 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
82 = a + (-4b)

For the fourth data point (-18, 306):
306 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
306 = a + (-18b)

For the fifth data point (-14, 242):
242 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1
242 = a + (-14b)

We now have five equations:

162 = a + (-9b)
-254 = a + 17b
82 = a + (-4b)
306 = a + (-18b)
242 = a + (-14b)

Let's solve these equations to find the values of a and b.

Adding equations (1) and (3) gives:
162 + 82 = 2a + (-13b)
244 = 2a - 13b (Equation 6)

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) gives:
162 - (-254) = a + (-9b) - (a + 17b)
416 = -26b
b = -416/26
b ≈ -16

Substituting the value of b into equation (1):
162 = a + 9(16)
162 = a + 144
a = 162 - 144
a = 18

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 18x^0 - 16x^1

Simplified:
Output: y = 18 - 16x",-0.0,"[-16, 18]"
"The pattern in the outputs seems to follow a linear relationship. Let's assume that the function can be represented as y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x is the input and y is the output.

By inspecting the data, we can assume that the exponent of x is always 1. This implies that the coefficient of x^1 is always nonzero.

Based on the given input and output values, we can write the following equations:

1) 162 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
2) -254 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
3) 82 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
4) 306 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
4) 242 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1

Simplifying these equations, we get:

1) a + 9b = 162
2) a + 17b = -254
3) a - 4b = 82
4) a - 18b = 306
5) a - 14b = 242

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

After solving the equations, we find that a = -5 and b = -17.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -5x^0 - 17x^1

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Output: y = -5 - 17x",-452.6,"[-16, 18]"
"To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's examine the pattern in the data.

We can see that the exponent of x remains constant in all cases, which suggests that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear equation.

Given that the general form of a linear equation is y = mx + b, where m is the coefficient of x and b is the y-intercept, we can attempt to fit the equation to the data.

Let's assume the equation has the form y = a(x^0) + b(x^1), where a is the coefficient of x^0 and b is the coefficient of x^1.

By examining the provided data, we can assign the values as follows:

Input: -9, Output: 162
162 = a(-9^0) + b(-9^1)
162 = a(1) - 9b

Input: 17, Output: -254
-254 = a(17^0) + b(17^1)
-254 = a(1) + 17b

Input: -4, Output: 82
82 = a(-4^0) + b(-4^1)
82 = a(1) - 4b

Input: -18, Output: 306
306 = a(-18^0) + b(-18^1)
306 = a(1) - 18b

Input: -14, Output: 242
242 = a(-14^0) + b(-14^1)
242 = a(1) - 14b

By solving the system of equations:

162 = a - 9b
-254 = a + 17b
82 = a - 4b
306 = a - 18b
242 = a - 14b

We can find the values of a and b.

After solving the system, we find that a = -10 and b = 12. Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -10(x^0) + 12(x^1)

"The given outputs for the various inputs cannot be accurately described by a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where the exponents are 0 and 1 respectively. To determine the most appropriate function, we need to recognize any pattern or relationship among the inputs and outputs.

By observing the given examples, it looks like a quadratic function might be a better fit to the data. Thus, a function of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c could better describe the relationship between inputs and outputs.

Let's try to find the appropriate coefficients a, b, and c for the quadratic equation.

Given inputs and outputs:
(-9, 162)
(17, -254)
(-4, 82)

Let's plug in these values into the equation y = ax^2 + bx + c:

-254 = a(17)^2 + b(17) + c --------- (2)
82 = a(-4)^2 + b(-4) + c ------------ (3)
306 = a(-18)^2 + b(-18) + c -------- (4)
242 = a(-14)^2 + b(-14) + c -------- (5)

Let's solve this system of equations to find the values of a, b, and c.

From (1): 162 = 81a - 9b + c
From (2): -254 = 289a + 17b + c
From (3): 82 = 16a - 4b + c
From (4): 306 = 324a - 18b + c
From (5): 242 = 196a - 14b + c

By solving these equations, we find that:
a ≈ -1.206
b ≈ -3.056
c ≈ 52.768

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given inputs and outputs.

Using the first set of data (18, 350), we have the equation 350 = a + 18b.
Using the second set of data (12, 230), we have the equation 230 = a + 12b.

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation gives us:

By looking at the data, we can see that the output values are decreasing as the input values increase. Therefore, we can assume that the coefficient of the x^1 term (b) is negative. Also, it looks like the output values are larger for larger input values. So, let's assume that the coefficient of the x^0 term (a) is positive.

177 = a*13^0 + b*13^1 + c*13^2

For input 14 and output 191:
191 = a*14^0 + b*14^1 + c*14^2

For input -8 and output -117:
-117 = a*(-8)^0 + b*(-8)^1 + c*(-8)^2

For input 3 and output 37:
37 = a*3^0 + b*3^1 + c*3^2

For input 7 and output 93:
93 = a*7^0 + b*7^1 + c*7^2

These equations form a system of linear equations that can be solved simultaneously to find the values of a, b, and c.",-inf,"[14, -5]"
"The function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the given data can be written as:

Output: y = 6x^0 + 13x^1

So, the function is y = 6 + 13x.",-90.8,"[14, -5]"
"Based on the given inputs and outputs, the function can be described as:

Output (y) = 10x^0 + 13x^1

So the function can be written as:

"The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs in the given form is:

y = 11x^0 + 14x^1",-256.0,"[14, -5]"
"Based on the given input-output pairs, we can assume a quadratic relationship between the inputs and outputs. Therefore, the function can be expressed as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

However, since the powers of x^0 and x^1 are always 1, we can simplify the equation as:

Output: y = a + bx + cx^2

To determine the values of a, b, and c, we need to substitute the input-output pairs into the equation:

1. Substituting (13, 177) into the equation, we get:
177 = a + 13b + 169c

2. Substituting (14, 191) into the equation, we get:
191 = a + 14b + 196c

3. Substituting (-8, -117) into the equation, we get:
-117 = a - 8b + 64c

4. Substituting (3, 37) into the equation, we get:
37 = a + 3b + 9c

5. Substituting (7, 93) into the equation, we get:
93 = a + 7b + 49c

By solving this system of equations, we can determine the values of a, b, and c.",-inf,"[14, -5]"

"The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs can be written as:

Output: y = 10x^0 + 14x^1

Where ""x"" represents the input value.",-225.0,"[14, -5]"
"To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's write the function explicitly:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

From the given data points, we can write the following equations:

177 = a * 13^0 + b * 13^1
191 = a * 14^0 + b * 14^1
-117 = a * (-8)^0 + b * (-8)^1
37 = a * 3^0 + b * 3^1
93 = a * 7^0 + b * 7^1

Simplifying each equation:

177 = a + 13b
191 = a + 14b
-117 = a - 8b
37 = a + 3b
93 = a + 7b

Solving the system of equations, we find a = 20 and b = 13.

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 20x^0 + 13x^1

Simplified, it becomes:
