Instead, we will attempt to capture the relationship using a different form. Let's assume the relationship can be represented by a quadratic equation of the form:

Output: y = ax^2 + bx + c

By fitting the given data points to this quadratic equation, we can find the values of the coefficients a, b, and c.

For the point (-10, -213):
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

For the point (9, 167):

By solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b:

-213 = a + 25.556
-213 - 25.556 = a

2. For Input 13 and Output 228:
   228 = a + 13b

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b. Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we get:

"The given data points don't seem to follow a linear relationship, so a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 might not accurately capture the pattern. However, we can try fitting a linear function to see if it provides a reasonable approximation.

By treating the given data as (x, y) coordinates, we can calculate the slope and y-intercept of a line that fits the data points using the least squares method.

Let's denote the input as x and the output as y:

Output: 2

Input: -19
Output: 122

Input: 17
Output: -94

Input: 15

Using the least squares method, we can calculate the slope (b) and y-intercept (a) of the line that best fits the data points. The linear function can be written as:

y = a + bx

To calculate the slope and y-intercept, we use the following formulas:

b = (nΣ(xy) - ΣxΣy) / (nΣ(x^2) - (Σx)^2)
a = (Σy - bΣx) / n

where n is the number of data points.

Calculating the values:

n = 5
Σx = 8
Σy = -8
Σxy = -1867
Σ(x^2) = 651

Using these values, we can calculate the slope (b) and y-intercept (a):

b = (5*(-1867) - 8*(-8)) / (5*651 - 8^2)
  ≈ -1774 / 1705
  ≈ -1.0396

a = (-8 - (-1.0396 * 8)) / 5

For input 14: -290 = a + 14b
For input -12: 230 = a - 12b
For input 16 (first occurrence): -330 = a + 16b
For input 16 (second occurrence): -330 = a + 16b

Simplifying the equations:

130 = a - 7b     ...(1)
-290 = a + 14b    ...(2)
230 = a - 12b     ...(3)
-330 = a + 16b    ...(4)
-330 = a + 16b    ...(5)

Equations (4) and (5) are redundant, so we can discard one of them. Let's use equation (4).

From equations (1) and (3), we can eliminate a by adding them:

130 + 230 = (a - 7b) + (a - 12b)
360 = 2a - 19b

Now, we can substitute the value of 2a - 19b from this equation into equation (2):

-290 = a + 14b
-290 = (360 + 19b) + 14b
-290 = 360 + 33b
33b = -650
b = -650/33
b = -20

Now, we can substitute the value of b into equation (1):

130 = a - 7(-20)
130 = a + 140
a = 130 - 140
a = -10

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the input and output values can be represented by a linear function. Therefore, the function that captures the relationship can be written as:

After analyzing the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the relationship is not linear. However, we can calculate the values of a and b using the given data points.

Let's plug in the first data point (-14, -97):

-97 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1
-97 = a + -14b

Next, let's plug in the second data point (7, 50):

50 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1
50 = a + 7b

Now, we have a system of two equations:

-97 = a + -14b
50 = a + 7b

Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of a and b.

Adding both equations together:

-47 = 2a - 7b

Rearranging the equation:

7b = 2a + 47
b = (2a + 47)/7

Substituting the value of b in the first equation:

-97 = a + -14((2a + 47)/7)
-97 = a - 2a - 14(47/7)
-97 = -a - 98
a = 1

Substituting the value of a back into b:

b = (2(1) + 47)/7
b = 49/7
b = 7

For the first pair (-9, 64):

64 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
64 = a - 9b

For the second pair (-3, 22):

22 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
22 = a - 3b

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

Multiplying the second equation by 3 and subtracting it from the first equation:

64 - 3(22) = a - 9b - 3a + 9b
64 - 66 = -2a
-2 = -2a
a = 1

Substituting the value of a into the second equation:

22 = 1 - 3b
21 = -3b
b = -7

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can write the function as:

Output = y = ax^0 + bx^1

Substituting the inputs and outputs, we have:

64 = a - 9b         (Equation 1)
22 = a - 3b         (Equation 2)
-62 = a + 9b        (Equation 3)
36 = a + 5b          (Equation 4)
113 = a + 16b        (Equation 5)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of 'a' and 'b'.

Rearranging and adding Equation 1 and Equation 2:

86 = 2a - 12b        (Equation 6)

Rearranging and adding Equation 3 and Equation 4:

-26 = 2a + 14b       (Equation 7)

Multiplying Equation 6 by 7 and Equation 7 by 3:

602 = 14a - 84b     (Equation 8)
-78 = 6a + 42b        (Equation 9)

Adding Equation 8 and Equation 9:

524 = 20a - 42b     (Equation 10)

Solving Equation 10 for 'a':

20a = 42b + 524
a = (42b + 524) / 20
a = (21b + 262) / 10

Substituting the value of 'a' back into Equation 1:

64 = (21b + 262) / 10 - 9b
640 = 21b + 262 - 90b
640 - 262 = -69b
378 = -69b
b = -378 / 69
b ≈ -5.478

Substituting the value of 'b' back into Equation 1:

64 = a - 9(-5.478)
64 = a + 49.303
14.697 = a

Plugging in the given inputs and outputs into the equation, we get the following equations:

22 = a + b(-3)^1
-62 = a + b(9)^1
36 = a + b(-5)^1
113 = a + b(-16)^1

Rearranging these equations, we get:

a - 9b = 64    --- (1)
a - 3b = 22    --- (2)
a + 9b = -62   --- (3)
a - 5b = 36    --- (4)

We can solve for a and b by substituting the inputs and outputs into the equation:

265 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1    - Equation 1
195 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)^1    - Equation 2

125 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1    - Equation 4
-99 = a(6)^0 + b(6)^1       - Equation 5

Since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, and any number raised to the power of 1 is itself, the equations simplify to:

265 = a + -20b               - Equation 1

Looking at the data, it seems that the relationship between the input and output is not a simple linear or quadratic relationship. However, we can try to fit the data to a linear function (y = a + bx).

Using a linear regression model, we can estimate the coefficients a and b that best fit the data.

The linear regression model for this data is:

Output = a + b * Input

Let's calculate the values of a and b using this model:

Sum of Inputs: -20 + (-15) + (-5) + (-10) + 6 = -44
Sum of Outputs: 265 + 195 + 55 + 125 + (-99) = 541
Sum of Input * Output: (-20 * 265) + (-15 * 195) + (-5 * 55) + (-10 * 125) + (6 * -99) = -5175

a = (541 * 826 - (-44 * -5175)) / (5 * 826 - (-44)^2)
a = (446166 - 226200) / (4130 - 1936)
a = 219966 / 2194
a = 100.32

b = (n * Sum of Input * Outputs - Sum of Inputs * Sum of Outputs) / (n * Sum of Inputs Squared - (Sum of Inputs)^2)

b = (5 * -5175 - (-44 * 541)) / (5 * 826 - (-44)^2)

Let's denote the input as x and the output as y. To find the coefficients a and b, we can use the given data points and solve a system of linear equations.

Using the first data point (x=11, y=-204), we have:

-204 = a + 11b         (Equation 1)

Using the second data point (x=-4, y=66), we have:

-55 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
-7 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
5 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1

Output: 350

Input: 12

Substituting these values into the function, we have:

350 = a + 18b
230 = a + 12b

Solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

First, let's multiply the second equation by -3 to eliminate a:

-690 = -3a - 36b

Now, add this equation to the first equation:

350 + (-690) = a + 18b + (-3a - 36b)

-340 = -2a - 18b

Simplifying further:

-340 = -2(a + 9b)

Dividing by -2:

170 = a + 9b

We have one equation involving a and b. Now, we can substitute this equation back into any of the original equations to solve for the other variable. Let's use the second equation:

230 = a + 12b

Substituting a = 170 - 9b:

230 = (170 - 9b) + 12b

Combine like terms:

Using the first data point (Input: 18, Output: 350), we can substitute these values into the equation:

Using the second data point (Input: 12, Output: 230), we can substitute these values into the equation:

230 = a + b * 12 -> Equation 2

Simultaneously solving Equation 1 and Equation 2 will give us the values of a and b.

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:

350 - 230 = a + b * 18 - (a + b * 12)
120 = a + 6b

Using the third data point (Input: -13, Output: -270), we can substitute these values into the equation:

-270 = a + b * -13

Rearranging this equation:

a = -270 - b * -13

Substituting this into the equation 120 = a + 6b:

120 = (-270 - b * -13) + 6b
120 = -270 + 13b + 6b
120 = -270 + 19b
390 = 19b
b = 390 / 19 ≈ 20.526

-270 = a - 267.798
a ≈ -2.202

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be written as:

Since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, the equation simplifies to:
350 = a + 18b

Using the second example:
Input: 12
Output: 230

Substituting these values into the equation:
230 = a(12^0) + b(12^1)

Again, simplifying the equation:
230 = a + 12b

We can now solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

350 = a + 18b
230 = a + 12b

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation:
350 - 230 = (a + 18b) - (a + 12b)

120 = 6b

Dividing both sides by 6:
20 = b
