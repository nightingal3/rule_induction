    (Output1 - Output2) / (Input1 - Input2) = (Output2 - Output3) / (Input2 - Input3) = (Output3 - Output4) / (Input3 - Input4)

Plugging in the corresponding values:

    (-98 - (-218)) / (7 - 17) = (-218 - (-74)) / (17 - 5) = (-74 - (-50)) / (5 - 3)

Simplifying:

    120 / (-10) = -144 / 12 = -24

Therefore, we can conclude that the slope (b) is -24.

Now, we can find the y-intercept (a) by plugging in the slope (b) and any given point (input, output) into the equation y = mx + c and solving for c. Let's choose the point (7, -98):

    -98 = -24 * 7 + c

Simplifying:

    -98 = -168 + c

Therefore, c = 70.

Knowing that any number raised to the power of zero is 1, we can simplify the equation to:

To find the values of a and b, we can use two of the given data points and solve for the coefficients.

Using the first two data points (-17, -292) and (-6, -105), we can set up the following equations:

-292 = a + (-17)b   (Equation 1)
-105 = a + (-6)b    (Equation 2)

Solving Equations 1 and 2 simultaneously will give us the values of a and b.

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1, we get:

-292 - (-105) = a - a + (-17)b - (-6)b
-292 + 105 = -11b
-187 = -11b

Dividing both sides by -11, we find:

b = 17

Substituting this value of b into Equation 2, we can solve for a:

Similarly, we can form equations using the other input and output pairs:

"The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, y = ax^0 + bx^1, can be written as follows:

Output = -5 + 12x",-inf,"[7, 1]"
"Based on the given data points, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function:

Output (y) = a * x^0 + b * x^1

Where a and b are constants that need to be determined.

Now, let's calculate the values of a and b using the given data points.

For the first data point (-14, -97):

-97 = a * (-14)^0 + b * (-14)^1
-97 = a + (-14)b

For the second data point (7, 50):

50 = a * 7^0 + b * 7^1
50 = a + 7b

Now, we have a system of equations:

-97 = a + (-14)b
50 = a + 7b

Solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

Multiply the second equation by 2:

100 = 2a + 14b

Now, subtract the first equation from this:

100 - (-97) = (2a + 14b) - (a + (-14)b)
197 = a + 28b

Solving for b:

197 - a = 28b
b = (197 - a) / 28

Substituting this value of b into the first equation:

-97 = a + (-14)((197 - a)/28)
-97 = a + (-14)(197 - a)/28

-97 = 28a + 14(197 - a)
-97 = 28a + 14 * 197 - 14a
-97 = 14a + 2746 - 14a
-97 = 2746

This seems to be an inconsistent equation, and there is no solution.

Simplifying this expression, we have:

Output: y = a + bx

Now, let's find the values of a and b using the given input-output pairs.

Using the first pair (Input: 5, Output: -26):
-26 = a + 5b

Using the second pair (Input: 1, Output: -14):

"Based on the given data, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be approximated with a linear equation, which can be written in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

To find the values of a and b, we can use any two pairs of inputs and outputs provided. Let's take (-15, 195) and (-10, 125) as they are close to the origin and will give us a good approximation.

First, let's find the value of b:

125 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
125 = a - 10b                   ........(1)

195 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)^1
195 = a - 15b                    ........(2)

Multiplying equation (1) by 3, we get:

375 = 3a - 30b                  ........(3)

Now, let's solve equations (2) and (3) simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Subtracting equation (3) from equation (2):

(195 - 375) = (a - 3a) + (15b - 30b)
-180 = -2a - 15b
180 = 2a + 15b

Dividing both sides by 5:

36 = 2a + 3b                  ........(4)

Now, we have two equations (3) and (4) in terms of a and b. We can solve these equations to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying equation (4) by 3 and subtracting it from equation (3):

375 - 108 = 3a - 9a - 30b - 9b
267 = -6a - 39b

Dividing both sides by -3:

-89 = 2a + 13b            ........(5)

We now have two equations (5) and (4) in terms of a and b. We can solve these equations to find the values of a and b.

From equation (5):
2a = -89 - 13b
a = (-89 - 13b)/2

Substituting this value of a into equation (4):

36 = [(-89 - 13b)/2] + 3b
72 = -89 - 13b + 6b
161 = -7b
b = -161/7

Now, substituting this value of b into equation (5):

-89 = 2a + 13(-161/7)
-89 = 2a - 13*23
-89 = 2a - 299
2a = 299 - 89
2a = 210
a = 210/2

2 = -4(1) - 10(4)
2 = -4 - 40

-35 = a(-5^0) + b(-5^1)
-31 = a(-4^0) + b(-4^1)
5 = a(5^0) + b(5^1)
-63 = a(-12^0) + b(-12^1)

Simplifying these equations:

-15 = a + 0
-35 = a - 5b
-31 = a - 4b
5 = a + 5b
-63 = a - 12b

Solving these equations, we find that a = -5 and b = 2.

To determine the values of a and b, we can use the given inputs and outputs. Let's take the first input/output pair:

Input: 0
Output: -15

Substituting these values into the function equation:

-15 = a + b(0)

Since any number multiplied by 0 is 0, we can simplify the equation as:

-15 = a

So, we have found the value of a. Now let's find the value of b using another input/output pair, such as the second one:

Input: -5
Output: -35

Substituting these values into the function equation:

-35 = a + b(-5)

Using the previously found value of a (-15):

-35 = -15 + b(-5)

Simplifying the equation:

-35 = -15 - 5b

Rearranging the terms:

a = 283 - 19b
a = 238 - 16b
a = -212 + 14b
a = -242 + 16b

Simplifying these equations:

Rearranging the equations to isolate 'a':

To find the quadratic equation that best captures the relationship, we can use the given inputs and outputs to solve for the coefficients a, b, and c.

Using the method of least squares, we can solve for a, b, and c by substituting the given inputs and outputs into the equation:

For the first data point (-12, 9):
9 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
9 = a + (-12)b

Simplifying the equation, we get:
9 = a - 12b

Using this equation, we can find the values of a and b for the remaining data points:

For (20, -55):
-55 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
-55 = a + 20b

For (-4, -7):
-7 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
-7 = a - 4b

For (-10, 5):

For (8, -31):

9 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
This simplifies to:
9 = a + (-12)b

For the second data point (20, -55), we have:

For the third data point (-4, -7), we have:

We have a system of two equations with two variables. Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b.

Simplifying the first equation:
-75 = a - 18b

-75 - 9 = a - 18b - a - 3b
-84 = -21b
b = 4

[  1   14 ] [ b ] = [ 191 ]
[  1   -8 ]         [ -117 ]
[  1    3 ]         [  37 ]
[  1    7 ]         [  93 ]

Solving the above matrix equation, we find:
a ≈ -11.4
b ≈ 16.68

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -11.4x^0 + 16.68x^1

Simplifying further:
Output: y = -11.4 + 16.68x",-541.5625599999996,"[14, -5]"
"The function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 2x^1 + 15x^0",-11641.6,"[14, -5]"
"Given the data points, it appears that the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) can be captured by the function:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Replacing the coefficients with the specific values from the data points:

When x = 13, y = 177:
177 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)  ->  177 = a + 13b

When x = 14, y = 191:
191 = a(14^0) + b(14^1)  ->  191 = a + 14b

When x = -8, y = -117:
-117 = a((-8)^0) + b((-8)^1)  ->  -117 = a - 8b

When x = 3, y = 37:
37 = a(3^0) + b(3^1)  ->  37 = a + 3b

When x = 7, y = 93:
93 = a(7^0) + b(7^1)  ->  93 = a + 7b

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

a + 13b = 177   (Equation 1)
a + 14b = 191   (Equation 2)
a - 8b = -117   (Equation 3)
a + 3b = 37     (Equation 4)
a + 7b = 93     (Equation 5)

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b, which will define the function.",-12779.2,"[14, -5]"
