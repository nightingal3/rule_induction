"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To write the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find the coefficients a and b. Let's assume that the function is a linear combination of the inputs raised to the power of 0 and 1, respectively.

Given that the form of the function is y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can equate the function to each input and output pair to find the values of a and b.

For the first pair:
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

For the second pair:
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

For the third pair:
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

For the fourth pair:
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

For the fifth pair:
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b, and then we can write the function.

Let's solve the system of equations:

From equation 1: -213 = a - 10b ⟶ a = -213 + 10b
Substituting the value of a in equation 2: 167 = (-213 + 10b) + 9b ⟶ 167 = -213 + 19b ⟶ 19b = 380 ⟶ b = 20
Putting the value of b in equation 1: a = -213 + 10(20) ⟶ a = -13

So, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -13x^0 + 20x^1

Simplifying it further, the function can be written as:

Output: y = -13 + 20x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a pattern in the data, let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Looking at the outputs, it seems that each output is related to the input by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

We can calculate the coefficients by substituting the given inputs and outputs into the equation:

When input is -10, output is -213.
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

When input is 9, output is 167.
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

When input is 4, output is 67.
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

When input is -3, output is -73.
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

When input is 20, output is 387.
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

We now have a system of linear equations:

-213 = a - 10b  -- Equation 1
167 = a + 9b    -- Equation 2
67 = a + 4b     -- Equation 3
-73 = a - 3b    -- Equation 4
387 = a + 20b   -- Equation 5

Solving this system of equations, we find a = -5 and b = 17.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -5x^0 + 17x^1
Simplified: y = -5 + 17x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given data points, let's try to find the best fit line using the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since x^0 is always 1, we can rewrite the equation as y = a + bx.

Using the two points (-10, -213) and (9, 167), we can calculate the values of a and b by solving the following equations:

-213 = a - 10b  --> Equation 1
167 = a + 9b  --> Equation 2

Solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2, we get:
-213 + 167 = 2a - b
-46 = 2a - b

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1, we get:
-213 - 167 = -19b
-380 = -19b
b = 380 / 19
b = 20

Substituting the value of b into Equation 1, we get:
-213 = a - 10 * 20
-213 = a - 200
a = -213 + 200
a = -13

So the derived equation that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = -13 + 20x

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can infer that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is a polynomial function of degree 1.

The function that captures the relationship can be written as:

Output = y = ax^0 + bx^1

Substituting the given inputs and outputs into this equation, we can form a system of equations to solve for the unknown coefficients a and b:

Equation 1: -3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1

Equation 2: -98 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1

Equation 3: 54 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1

Equation 4: 301 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1

Simplifying each equation, we get:

Equation 1: -3 = a + 0

Equation 2: -98 = a + 5b

Equation 3: 54 = a - 3b

Equation 4: 301 = a - 16b

From Equation 1 we find a = -3.

Substituting a = -3 into Equation 2 and Equation 3, we get:

-98 = -3 + 5b
54 = -3 - 3b

Simplifying these equations:

Equation 5: -95 = 5b
Equation 6: 57 = -3b

From Equation 5, we find b = -19.

Substituting b = -19 into Equation 6, we find a = -3.

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output = y = -3 * x^0 - 19 * x^1

Simplifying further,

Output = y = -3 - 19x

    Using the given inputs and outputs, we can create a system of equations and solve for the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the input and output values can be described using a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To determine the values of a and b, we can substitute the given inputs and outputs into the equation:

For the input 9, the output is 160:

            68 = 13b - 9b
            68 = 4b
            b = 68/4
            b = 17

Substituting this value of b in equation (1):

160 = a + 9(17)
160 = a + 153
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

Therefore, the function representing the given data is: y = 7 + 17x.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of the coefficients a and b in the general form equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

By substituting the given input-output pairs, we can create a system of equations to solve for a and b.

For the first input-output pair (10, 142):
142 = a(10^0) + b(10^1)
142 = a + 10b

For the second input-output pair (15, 217):
217 = a(15^0) + b(15^1)
217 = a + 15b

For the third input-output pair (-10, -158):
-158 = a(-10^0) + b(-10^1)
-158 = a - 10b

For the fourth input-output pair (-4, -68):
-68 = a(-4^0) + b(-4^1)
-68 = a - 4b

For the fifth input-output pair (13, 187):
187 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
187 = a + 13b

We now have a system of five equations. Simplifying them, we get:

142 = a + 10b
217 = a + 15b
-158 = a - 10b
-68 = a - 4b

    The given data can be represented by the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Using the provided inputs and outputs, we can calculate the values of 'a' and 'b' to define the relationship.

When the input is -1, the output is -8:
-8 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1
-8 = a - b

When the input is 5, the output is 76:
76 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
76 = a + 5b

When the input is 3, the output is 48:
48 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1
48 = a + 3b

When the input is 8, the output is 118:
118 = a(8)^0 + b(8)^1
118 = a + 8b

When the input is 13, the output is 188:
188 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1
188 = a + 13b

Now we can solve these equations to find the values of 'a' and 'b':

From the first equation -8 = a - b, we can rewrite it as a = b - 8.

Substituting this value of 'a' into the second equation 76 = a + 5b, we get:
76 = (b - 8) + 5b
76 = 6b - 8
6b = 84
b = 14

Substituting b = 14 into the equation a = b - 8, we get:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be best captured by a quadratic equation. The function:

Output = y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

can be used to describe the relationship. However, since the given data only provides two terms, we can simplify the equation.

By assuming that the quadratic term is zero, the function can be simplified to:

Output = y = ax^0 + bx^1

Substituting the given input and output values into the equation, we can solve for the coefficients a and b.

Using the first two data points (-1, -8) and (5, 76):

-8 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1
76 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1

Simplifying these equations, we get:

-8 = a - b
76 = a + 5b

Now, solving for the coefficients a and b:

Adding the two equations:

-8 + 76 = a - b + a + 5b
68 = 2a + 4b

Dividing both sides by 2:

34 = a + 2b

Subtracting the second equation from the first:

(-8) - 76 = a - b - a - 5b
-84 = -6b

Dividing both sides by -6:

14 = b

Substituting the value of b into the equation to solve for a:

34 = a + 2(14)
34 = a + 28
a = 6

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output = y = 6x^0 + 14x^1

Output = y = 6 + 14x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The output y can be represented as a linear combination of two terms: a constant term (a) and a term with a coefficient (b) multiplied by the input x.

Thus, the function can be written as:

Output: y = a + bx

Now, to find the values of a and b, we can use any two pairs of input and output values from the given data.

Let's use the first and second pairs:

When Input = 1, and Output = 2,
2 = a + b(1)

When Input = -19, and Output = 122,
122 = a + b(-19)

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

From equation (1):
2 = a + b

From equation (2):
122 = a - 19b

Rearranging equation (1):
a = 2 - b

Substituting the value of a in equation (2):
122 = (2 - b) - 19b
122 = 2 - 20b
20b = 2 - 122
20b = -120
b = -6

Substituting the value of b in equation (1):
2 = a + (-6)
2 = a - 6
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, let's assume the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 accurately describes the relationship. 

To solve for a and b, we can set up a system of two equations using the provided input-output pairs:

-17 = a(1^0) + b(1^1)
-292 = a(-17^0) + b(-17^1)

Simplifying the equations:

-17 = a + b
-292 = a - 17b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

From the first equation, we have a = -17 - b.

Substituting this value into the second equation, we get:

-292 = (-17 - b) - 17b
-292 = -17 - b - 17b
275 = -18b
b = -275/18 ≈ 15.2778

Substituting the value of b into the first equation, we get:

-17 = a + (-275/18)
-306/18 = a
a = -17 - (-275/18) ≈ -2.7222

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Let's denote the coefficient of x^0 as a and the coefficient of x^1 as b.

For the first input-output pair, -14 and -97, we have -97 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1. This simplifies to -97 = a - 14b.

For the second input-output pair, 7 and 50, we have 50 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1. This simplifies to 50 = a + 7b.

For the third input-output pair, 2 and 15, we have 15 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1. This simplifies to 15 = a + 2b.

By substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation, we can find the values of a and b that best fit the data.

When input = 5, output = -26:

4 = a(1) - 5b

When input = -8, output = 13:

By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b:

From the equations:

-14 = a + b            ......(2)

For the first pair of input (-9) and output (64), we have x = -9, y = 64. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

64 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
64 = a + (-9)b

Simplifying the equation, we have:

64 = a - 9b          -----(1)

We can repeat the above process for the other four pairs of inputs and outputs, and we'll end up with four equations. By solving the system of equations, we can find the values of coefficients a and b.

Using the second pair of input (-3) and output (22), we have x = -3, y = 22:

22 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
22 = a + (-3)b

Simplifying the equation, we have:

Using the third pair of input (9) and output (-62), we have x = 9, y = -62:

-62 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
-62 = a + 9b

Simplifying the equation, we have:

-62 = a + 9b         -----(3)

Using the fourth pair of input (-5) and output (36), we have x = -5, y = 36:

36 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
36 = a + (-5)b

Simplifying the equation, we have:

36 = a - 5b         -----(4)

Using the fifth pair of input (-16) and output (113), we have x = -16, y = 113:

113 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
113 = a + (-16)b

Simplifying the equation, we have:

113 = a - 16b         -----(5)

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can use the general form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 to fit the data points.

Let's substitute the input values into the general form and solve for a and b:

For Input: -20, Output: 265
265 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
265 = a - 20b

For Input: -15, Output: 195
195 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)^1
195 = a - 15b

For Input: -5, Output: 55
55 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
55 = a - 5b

For Input: -10, Output: 125
125 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
125 = a - 10b

For Input: 6, Output: -99
-99 = a(6)^0 + b(6)^1
-99 = a + 6b

We now have a system of linear equations. Solving this system will give us the values of a and b:

From the first equation: a = 265 + 20b
Substituting into the second equation: 195 = (265 + 20b) - 15b
195 = 265 + 5b
-70 = 5b
b = -14

Substituting the value of b into the first equation: a = 265 + 20(-14)
a = 265 + (-280)
a = -15

Explanation:
From the given data, we can observe that the output (y) can be expressed as a linear relationship with the input (x). The general form of this relationship is y = ax^0 + bx^1, where ax^0 represents the constant term and bx^1 represents the linear term.

By analyzing the data, we can deduce that the constant term (ax^0) is -6, and the coefficient of the linear term (bx^1) is 8. Therefore, the function that accurately describes the given data is:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, let's examine the pattern in the given data.

Input: -10, Output: -54
Input: 4, Output: 2
Input: -20, Output: -94
Input: 4, Output: 2
Input: -4, Output: -30

From the given examples, it appears that the output (y) can be expressed as a linear combination of powers of x. We can write the function in the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Now, let's find the values of a and b.

For the first example, -10^0 is 1, so the equation becomes:
-54 = a(1) + b(-10)

Simplifying further:
-54 = a - 10b

For the second example, 4^1 is 4, so we have:
2 = a(1) + b(4)

Simplifying further:
2 = a + 4b

Let's now solve the simultaneous equations:

-54 = a - 10b   (Equation 1)
2 = a + 4b       (Equation 2)

Multiplying Equation 2 by 5, we have:
10 = 5a + 20b   (Equation 3)

Subtracting Equation 3 from Equation 1, we get:
-64 = -5a - 30b

Simplifying further, we have:
5a + 30b = 64     (Equation 4)

Using Equation 2, we can express a in terms of b:
a = 2 - 4b     (Equation 5)

Substituting Equation 5 into Equation 4, we get:
5(2 - 4b) + 30b = 64

Expanding and simplifying, we have:
10 - 20b + 30b = 64
10 + 10b = 64
10b = 54
b = 5.4

Substituting b = 5.4 into Equation 5, we have:
a = 2 - 4(5.4)
a = 2 - 21.6
a = -19.6

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = -19.6x^0 + 5.4x^1

y = -19.6 + 5.4x

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship can be described using a linear equation. The general form of a linear equation is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the provided data points: (-11, -20), (-8, -14), (-2, -2), (-7, -12), and (-17, -32), we can calculate the values of a and b.

Using the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, we have:

-20 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
-14 = a(-8)^0 + b(-8)^1
-2 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1
-12 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7)^1
-32 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1

Since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is always 1, the equations simplify to:

-20 = a + b(-11)
-14 = a + b(-8)
-2 = a + b(-2)
-12 = a + b(-7)
-32 = a + b(-17)

Solving this system of equations, we find:

a = -2
b = 2

From the given examples, we can observe that when the input increases by 1, the output decreases by 2. Therefore, we can conclude that the constant term (a) is -2 and the linear term (b) is 2.

    Based on the given data points and the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can assume that the relationship between inputs and outputs is a linear relationship. Therefore, let's assume that the function can be represented as y = a + bx.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given data points:

Input: -11, Output: -20
-20 = a + (-11)b

Input: -8, Output: -14 
-14 = a + (-8)b

-12 = a + (-7)b

-32 = a + (-17)b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

First, let's rewrite the equations:

-11b + a = -20   ... (1)
-8b + a = -14    ... (2)
-2b + a = -2     ... (3)
-7b + a = -12    ... (4)
-17b + a = -32   ... (5)

From equation (3), we can find a in terms of b:
a = -2 + 2b

Substituting this expression for a in equations (1), (2), (4), and (5), we get:

-11b + (-2 + 2b) = -20
→ -11b - 2 + 2b = -20
→ -9b = -18
→ b = 2

Substituting b = 2 into the equation a = -2 + 2b, we get:

From the given data, we can derive the following equations:

-20 = a - 11b            (1)
-14 = a - 8b              (2)
-2 = a - 2b                (3)
-12 = a - 7b              (4)
-32 = a - 17b             (5)

Simplifying equations (1) to (5), we get:

a = -20 + 11b             (6)
a = -14 + 8b               (7)
a = -2 + 2b                 (8)
a = -12 + 7b              (9)
a = -32 + 17b             (10)

By substituting equation (6) into equations (7) to (10), we can solve for b:

-20 + 11b = -14 + 8b
-20 + 11b = -2 + 2b
-20 + 11b = -12 + 7b

302 = a + (17)b
176 = a + (10)b
212 = a + (12)b
230 = a + (13)b

Rearranging the equation to solve for a:

a = 302 - 17b

    Based on the given data points, we can see that the function is a linear one, in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Let's find the values of a and b by substituting the given input and output values into the function.

When the input is 0, the output is -15:
-15 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-15 = a

When the input is -5, the output is -35:
-35 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
-35 = a - 5b

When the input is -4, the output is -31:
-31 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
-31 = a - 4b

When the input is 5, the output is 5:
5 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
5 = a + 5b

When the input is -12, the output is -63:
-63 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
-63 = a - 12b

Simplifying these equations, we have:

-15 = a
-35 = a - 5b
-31 = a - 4b
5 = a + 5b
-63 = a - 12b

From the first equation, we get a = -15.

Substituting this value of a into the second equation:

b = 4

    The given data can be approximated with a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x is the input and y is the output.

From the given data:

Input: 19, Output: 283
Input: 16, Output: 238
Input: -14, Output: -212
Input: -16, Output: -242

We can calculate the values of a and b by solving a system of linear equations using the given input and output pairs.

Using the first pair (9, 133), we have:

133 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
133 = a + 9b   (equation 1)

Using the second pair (19, 283), we have:

283 = a(19)^0 + b(19)^1
283 = a + 19b   (equation 2)

Using the third pair (16, 238), we have:

238 = a(16)^0 + b(16)^1
238 = a + 16b   (equation 3)

Using the fourth pair (-14, -212), we have:

-212 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1
-212 = a - 14b   (equation 4)

Using the fifth pair (-16, -242), we have:

-242 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
-242 = a - 16b   (equation 5)

We can now solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

From equation 4, we have:
a = -212 + 14b

Substituting this value of a into equations 2 and 3:

283 = (-212 + 14b) + 19b
283 = -212 + 33b
33b = 283 + 212
33b = 495
b = 15

Substituting the value of b into the expression for a:

a = -212 + 14(15)

When input is 2, output is 59:
59 = a(2^0) + b(2^1)
59 = a + 2b    ---(1)

When input is -16, output is -301:

Solving the system of equations (1)-(5), we can find the values of a and b:

From (1) and (4), we have:
a = 59 - 2b
a = 79 - 3b    ---(6)

Substituting the value of a from (6) into (2):

-301 = (59 - 2b) + (-16)b

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, let's assume the function to be:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Simplifying further, we get:

Output: y = a + bx

Now, to find the values of the coefficients a and b, we can use two different input-output pairs. Let's use the first and second pair:

For the first pair,
Input: 13
Output: 55

Substituting the values in the equation, we get:

55 = a + 13b ----(1)

For the second pair,
Input: -20
Output: -44

Substituting the values in the equation, we get:

-44 = a + (-20)b
-44 = a - 20b ----(2)

Solving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously will give us the values of coefficients a and b.

Multiplying equation (1) by 20 and equation (2) by 13, we get:

(20)(55) = (20)a + (20)(13)b
(13)(-44) = (13)a + (13)(-20)b

Simplifying further, we get:

1100 = 20a + 260b ----(3)
-572 = 13a - 260b ----(4)

Adding equations (3) and (4) to eliminate the b term, we get:

528 = 33a

Dividing by 33,

16 = a

Substituting this value back into equation (1), we get:

55 = 16 + 13b

    In order to determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given data points to find the values of 'a' and 'b' in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the first data point (-11, 72), we have the equation:
72 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
72 = a + (-11b)

Using the second data point (-3, 8), we have the equation:
8 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
8 = a + (-3b)

Using the third data point (-2, 0), we have the equation:
0 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1
0 = a + (-2b)

Using the fourth data point (18, -160), we have the equation:
-160 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1
-160 = a + (18b)

Using the fifth data point (-7, 40), we have the equation:
40 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7)^1
40 = a + (-7b)

Now we have a system of linear equations:

a - 11b = 72
a - 3b = 8
a - 2b = 0
a + 18b = -160
a - 7b = 40

By observing the inputs and outputs, it is noticed that the output is dependent on both the input values and their position in the sequence. Additionally, it seems that the relationship is not linear.

A possible function that captures the data in a general form is:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Let's substitute the given inputs and outputs into the equation and solve for a and b:

For the first pair, when input = 11 and output = -204:
-204 = a(11^0) + b(11^1)
-204 = a + 11b

For the second pair, when input = -4 and output = 66:
66 = a(-4^0) + b(-4^1)
66 = a - 4b

For the third pair, when input = -17 and output = 300:
300 = a(-17^0) + b(-17^1)
300 = a - 17b

For the fourth pair, when input = -15 and output = 264:
264 = a(-15^0) + b(-15^1)
264 = a - 15b

For the fifth pair, when input = 20 and output = -366:
-366 = a(20^0) + b(20^1)
-366 = a + 20b

We now have a system of five equations with two variables, a and b. Solving this system will give us the values of a and b and thus the function that describes the relationship.

Using any suitable method to solve this system of equations (e.g., substitution, elimination, matrix methods), the values of a and b are found to be:

a = 6
b = -10

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
Output: y = 6x^0 - 10x^1

Simplifying the equation, we have:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that there is a linear relationship between the input and output values. We can write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 as follows:

y = a + bx

To find the values of a and b, we can use any two pairs of input-output values and solve a system of equations.

Using the first and fourth pair:

-204 = a + b*11   ----(1)
264 = a + b*(-15)   ----(2)

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

-468 = b*26
b = -468/26
b = -18

Substituting the value of b into equation (1):

-204 = a + (-18)*11
-204 = a - 198
a = -6

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the function can be described by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the given data points, we can solve for the constants a and b:

When input is 11, output is -204:
-204 = a(11^0) + b(11^1)
-204 = a + 11b    (Equation 1)

When input is -4, output is 66:
66 = a(-4^0) + b(-4^1)
66 = a - 4b       (Equation 2)

When input is -17, output is 300:

300 = a - 17b     (Equation 3)

When input is -15, output is 264:

When input is 20, output is -366:

-366 = a + 20b    (Equation 5)

By solving the system of linear equations (Equations 1-5), we can find the values of a and b.

Solving Equations 2-4 simultaneously:
66 = a - 4b
300 = a - 17b
264 = a - 15b

From Equations 2 and 4, we get:
66 - 264 = (-4b) - (-15b)
-198 = 11b
b = -198/11
b = -18

Substituting b = -18 into Equation 2:

66 = a + 72

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to identify a pattern in the given data points. 

By inspecting the given data, we notice that the exponent of x remains constant at 0, indicating that it is a constant term. Therefore, the function can be written as y = a + bx^1, where ""a"" represents the constant term, and ""b"" represents the coefficient of x.

Let's now proceed to calculate the values of ""a"" and ""b"" using the provided data points.

Using Input: -16 and Output: 82:
82 = a - 16b

Using Input: -11 and Output: 52:

Using Input: 14 and Output: -98:

Using Input: -18 and Output: 94:
94 = a - 18b

Using Input: 3 and Output: -32:
-32 = a + 3b

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

a - 16b = 82        (Equation 1)
a - 11b = 52        (Equation 2)
a + 14b = -98       (Equation 3)
a - 18b = 94        (Equation 4)
a + 3b = -32        (Equation 5)

Solving the system of equations, we get a = -4 and b = -6.

    The given data points suggest a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. The function can be written in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

By plugging in the input and output values provided, we can determine the values of a and b.

For the first data point (-18, -75):
-75 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
-75 = a + (-18b)

For the second data point (-1, -7):
-7 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1
-7 = a + (-b)

For the third data point (3, 9):
9 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1
9 = a + 3b

For the fourth data point (-18, -75):
-75 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
-75 = a + (-18b)

For the fifth data point (2, 5):
5 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1
5 = a + 2b

Simplifying these equations, we get:

-75 = a - 18b  (equation 1)
-7 = a - b  (equation 2)
9 = a + 3b  (equation 3)
-75 = a - 18b  (equation 4)
5 = a + 2b  (equation 5)

From equation 2, we can determine a = -7 + b.
Substituting this value of a in equations 1, 3, 4, and 5, we get:

-75 = (-7 + b) - 18b
9 = (-7 + b) + 3b
-75 = (-7 + b) - 18b
5 = (-7 + b) + 2b

Simplifying further:

-75 = -7 - 17b
9 = -7 + 4b
-75 = -7 - 17b
5 = -7 + 3b

Solving these equations, we find b = 4 and a = -11.

c = 109 - 112

Input: -4, Output: 82
Input: -18, Output: 306

We can see that the outputs are not directly related to the inputs in a linear manner. However, by observing the pattern, we can deduce that the relationship can be described by a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's calculate the values of a and b:

For the first data point (-9, 162):
162 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
162 = a + (-9b)

For the second data point (17, -254):
-254 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
-254 = a + 17b

For the third data point (-4, 82):

82 = a + (-4b)

For the fourth data point (-18, 306):

306 = a + (-18b)

For the fifth data point (-14, 242):
242 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1
242 = a + (-14b)

We now have five equations:

162 = a + (-9b)
-254 = a + 17b
82 = a + (-4b)
306 = a + (-18b)
242 = a + (-14b)

Let's solve these equations to find the values of a and b.

Adding equations (1) and (3) gives:
162 + 82 = 2a + (-13b)
244 = 2a - 13b (Equation 6)

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) gives:
162 - (-254) = a + (-9b) - (a + 17b)
416 = -26b
b = -416/26
b ≈ -16

Substituting the value of b into equation (1):

a = 162 - 144

    Since we are given the form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can rewrite it as y = a + bx. 

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given inputs and outputs.

Using the first set of data (18, 350), we have the equation 350 = a + 18b.
Using the second set of data (12, 230), we have the equation 230 = a + 12b.

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation gives us:
350 - 230 = (a + 18b) - (a + 12b)
120 = 6b

Solving for b, we get:
b = 120/6 = 20

Substituting the value of b back into one of the equations, let's use the second equation (230 = a + 12b):
230 = a + 12 * 20

Explanation:
In this function, the coefficient of x^0 (a constant) is -10, and the coefficient of x^1 is 20. This means that for every unit increase in the input (x), the output (y) increases by 20. Additionally, the y-intercept (when x is 0), is -10, which can be seen as an offset or base value for the output.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we first need to calculate the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

For the given inputs and outputs, let's set up two equations using the provided data points:

1. When the input is 18, the output is 350:
350 = a(18^0) + b(18^1)
350 = a + 18b

2. When the input is 12, the output is 230:
230 = a(12^0) + b(12^1)
230 = a + 12b

Now, we have a system of two equations:

350 = a + 18b
230 = a + 12b

To solve these equations simultaneously, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation:

120 = 6b

Solving for b, we get:

b = 20

Substituting the value of b back into any of the original equations, we find:

350 = a + 18(20)
350 = a + 360
a = -10

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to analyze the pattern in the data.

From the given input-output pairs, we can observe that the outputs are influenced by the inputs in a linear fashion, with a constant rate of change or slope.

Let's use the general form of a linear function:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Since x^0 simplifies to 1, our function can be written as:

Output: y = a + bx

Now, let's substitute the inputs and outputs into our equation to find the values of a and b.

177 = a + 13b           ...(1)

For Input: 14, Output: 191

For Input: 7, Output: 93
93 = a + 7b             ...(5)

To solve this system of equations, we can either use substitution or elimination method. Here, let's use the elimination method.

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

(2) - (1): 191 - 177 = (a + 14b) - (a + 13b)
14 = b

Substitute b = 14 into equation (1):

177 = a + 13(14)

a = -5

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve for a and b. Let's use the first two pairs:

When x = 13, the output y = 177
177 = a * 13^0 + b * 13^1
177 = a + 13b → equation 1

When x = 14, the output y = 191
191 = a * 14^0 + b * 14^1
191 = a + 14b → equation 2

We now have a system of equations:

a + 13b = 177   → equation 1
a + 14b = 191   → equation 2

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

a + 14b - (a + 13b) = 191 - 177
14b - 13b = 14
b = 14

Now we know the value of b, let's substitute it into equation 1:

a + 13(14) = 177
a + 182 = 177
a = -5

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -5x^0 + 14x^1

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Output: y = -5 + 14x
