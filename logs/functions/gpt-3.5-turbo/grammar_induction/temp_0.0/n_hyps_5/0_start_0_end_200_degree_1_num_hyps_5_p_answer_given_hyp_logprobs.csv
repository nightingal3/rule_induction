"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, let's assume the relationship between inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

For the given inputs and outputs, the function can be written as:

Output = y = (-10, -213)
y = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10)b

Output = y = (9, 167)
y = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Output = y = (4, 67)
y = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Output = y = (-3, -73)
y = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a + (-3)b

Output = y = (20, 387)
y = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1) -213 = a - 10b
2) 167 = a + 9b
3) 67 = a + 4b
4) -73 = a - 3b
5) 387 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b that describe the relationship between inputs and outputs.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    From the given inputs and outputs, we can see that the relationship between the input (x) and output (y) can be represented by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's calculate the value of a and b using the given data points:

For the first data point (-10, -213):
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

For the second data point (9, 167):
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

For the third data point (4, 67):
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

For the fourth data point (-3, -73):
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

For the fifth data point (20, 387):
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

We have a system of linear equations. Solving this system, we find:
a = 67
b = 16

So, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
Output: y = 67x^0 + 16x^1

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

By substituting the given inputs and outputs into the equation, we can solve for a and b:

For the first data point (Input: -10, Output: -213):
-213 = a*(-10)^0 + b*(-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10)b

For the second data point (Input: 9, Output: 167):
167 = a*9^0 + b*9^1
167 = a + 9b

For the third data point (Input: 4, Output: 67):
67 = a*4^0 + b*4^1
67 = a + 4b

For the fourth data point (Input: -3, Output: -73):
-73 = a*(-3)^0 + b*(-3)^1

    From the given data, we can assume that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is linear, as the output values increase or decrease at a roughly constant rate with the increase or decrease in the input values.

To find the function, we need to determine the values of coefficients a and b.

Using the first pair of input and output (-10, -213):
-213 = a + (-10)b

Using the second pair of input and output (9, 167):

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. Solving these equations, we find:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be represented by a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the values of a and b, we can use a system of equations.

Let's denote the input as x and the output as y.

From the first given point (-18, 339), we have the equation:
339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
339 = a - 18b

From the second given point (0, -3), we have the equation:
-3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-3 = a

From the third given point (5, -98), we have the equation:
-98 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-98 = a + 5b

From the fourth given point (-3, 54), we have the equation:

54 = a - 3b

From the fifth given point (-16, 301), we have the equation:
301 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
301 = a + 16b

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = -3 and b = -6.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = -3x^0 - 6x^1

    Based on the given data, it is clear that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear. A linear relationship would be captured by a function of the form y = ax + b.

To better capture the data, it seems that a quadratic function would be more appropriate. The general form of a quadratic function is y = ax^2 + bx + c. However, in this case, we can simplify the function by assuming that the coefficient of x^2 (a) is zero, since none of the given inputs are squared.

Therefore, based on the given data, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be written as:

Output: y = bx + c

To find the specific values of b and c, we can substitute the input-output pairs into the equation and solve the resulting system of linear equations. Doing so, we get:

When input = -18, output = 339:
339 = -18b + c     -------- (1)

When input = 0, output = -3:
-3 = 0b + c      -------- (2)

When input = 5, output = -98:
-98 = 5b + c      -------- (3)

    Based on the given data points, it is clear that the function has two independent variables. Therefore, it cannot be accurately represented by a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

However, we can still try to find a relationship between the inputs and outputs. Let's try to fit a quadratic function of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c to the given data points.

Using the method of least squares, we can find the coefficients a, b, and c that best fit the data. Solving the system of equations formed by substituting the input-output pairs into the quadratic function, we get:

Equation 1: 0 = a(-18)^2 + b(-18) + c + 339
Equation 2: -3 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c
Equation 3: -98 = a(5)^2 + b(5) + c

Output: y = ax^2 + bx + c

To find the coefficients a, b, and c, we can use the given inputs and outputs to create a system of equations.

Using the first data point (-13, -197):
-197 = a(-13)^2 + b(-13) + c            (Equation 1)

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to observe the pattern in the given data points.

From the given data points, we can see that the output is calculated by subtracting a constant value from the square of the input.

Let's define the function as y = ax^0 + bx^1.

By substituting the inputs and outputs from the given data points, we can determine the values of a and b.

Substituting (-13, -197):
-197 = a(1) + b(-13)

Substituting (-11, -169):
-169 = a(1) + b(-11)

Substituting (20, 265):
265 = a(1) + b(20)

Substituting (-10, -155):
-155 = a(1) + b(-10)

Substituting (7, 83):
83 = a(1) + b(7)

Simplifying the equations, we get:
-197 = a - 13b
-169 = a - 11b
265 = a + 20b
-155 = a - 10b
83 = a + 7b

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

Adding the first and third equations: 68 = 2a + 7b
Adding the second and fourth equations: -324 = 2a - 21b

Subtracting the second equation from the first: 392 = 28b
b = 392/28 = 14

Substituting the value of b into the third equation: 265 = a + 20(14)
a = 265 - 280 = -15

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it looks like the function follows a linear relationship.

Let's rewrite the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x is the input and y is the output:

y = a + bx

To find the values of a and b, we can use the pairs of inputs and outputs from the given data points.

Let's substitute the first pair (-13, -197) into the equation:

-197 = a - 13b

Substituting the second pair (-11, -169):

-169 = a - 11b

Substituting the third pair (20, 265):

265 = a + 20b

Substituting the fourth pair (-10, -155):

Substituting the fifth pair (7, 83):

We now have a system of five equations with two unknowns (a and b). Solving this system will give us the values of a and b.

Using a solver or an algebraic method, we obtain:

Input: -13, -11, 20, -10, 7
Output: -197, -169, 265, -155, 83

By looking at the data, we can see that the output seems to be decreasing as the input becomes more negative, and increasing as the input becomes more positive. It also appears that the output is proportional to the input.

Let's assume the function has the form: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Since any number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1, the function can be simplified to:
y = a + bx

We can then rearrange the equation to find the values of a and b.

Using the first data point (-13, -197), we substitute the values into the equation:
-197 = a + (-13)b

Using the second data point (-11, -169):
-169 = a + (-11)b

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns (a and b). We can solve these equations to find the values of a and b.

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
-197 - (-169) = a + (-13)b - (a + (-11)b)
-28 = -2b

Dividing both sides by -2, we find that b = 14.

Substituting the value of b into the first equation, we get:
-197 = a + (-13)(14)
-197 = a - 182
a = -197 + 182 = -15

Let's denote the inputs as x and the outputs as y:

For the input x = 9, the output y = 160:

    Based on the given data, it seems that the function can be represented as a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where the coefficient of x^0 is constant and the coefficient of x^1 is changing. Let's call the coefficient of x^0 as a and the coefficient of x^1 as b.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can set up the following equations:

When Input = 20, Output = -307:
-307 = a(20^0) + b(20^1)

When Input = -1, Output = 8:
8 = a(-1^0) + b(-1^1)

When Input = 12, Output = -187:
-187 = a(12^0) + b(12^1)

When Input = 18, Output = -277:
-277 = a(18^0) + b(18^1)

Simplifying these equations, we get:

-307 = a + 20b

8 = a - b

-187 = a + 12b

-277 = a + 18b

To solve these equations for a and b, we can use any method such as substitution or elimination. Solving these equations, we find:

a ≈ -320.607

b ≈ 23.214

    The given data does not seem to follow a simple linear relationship of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. To find a more appropriate function, we can use a polynomial regression model.

Let's assume the function can be described by a polynomial of degree 2, i.e., y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2.

Using the provided data points, we can solve for the unknown coefficients a, b, and c using polynomial regression.

(x3, y3): (20, -307)
(x4, y4): (12, -187)
(x5, y5): (18, -277)

Now, we can solve for a, b, and c using polynomial regression:

We have the following equations:
1. y1 = a + b*x1 + c*x1^2
2. y2 = a + b*x2 + c*x2^2
3. y3 = a + b*x3 + c*x3^2
4. y4 = a + b*x4 + c*x4^2
5. y5 = a + b*x5 + c*x5^2

1. -307 = a + 20b + 400c

    The given data points do not follow a simple linear relationship in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, as the output values do not change linearly with the input values. Instead, it seems that a quadratic function might better describe the data. The general form of a quadratic function is y = ax^2 + bx + c. Let's try to find the coefficients a, b, and c that fit the data:

To solve for the coefficients, we can plug in the input-output pairs into the quadratic equation and solve the resulting equations:

For the input 13 and output -66:
-66 = a(13)^2 + b(13) + c                     ...(Equation 1)

For the input -20 and output 132:
132 = a(-20)^2 + b(-20) + c                   ...(Equation 2)

For the input 18 and output -96:
-96 = a(18)^2 + b(18) + c                     ...(Equation 3)

For the input 0 and output 12:
12 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c                          ...(Equation 4)

For the input 11 and output -54:
-54 = a(11)^2 + b(11) + c                      ...(Equation 5)

Simplifying Equation 4, we can see that c = 12 since a(0)^2 and b(0) would both be 0.

Now we can substitute c = 12 into Equations 1, 2, 3, and 5:

-66 = a(13)^2 + b(13) + 12                     ...(Equation 1)
132 = a(-20)^2 + b(-20) + 12                   ...(Equation 2)
-96 = a(18)^2 + b(18) + 12                     ...(Equation 3)
-54 = a(11)^2 + b(11) + 12                     ...(Equation 5)

By substituting these values, we have a system of four equations with two unknowns (a and b). Solving this system of equations will give us the specific quadratic function that describes the data.

    The given data suggests a linear relationship between the input (x) and output (y) values. We can fit the data using the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 is equal to 1.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the method of least squares regression. By calculating the average of the product of each input-output pair, we can find the values of a and b that minimize the sum of squared errors.

Using the five given input-output pairs, we have:

Input: 13, Output: -66
Input: -20, Output: 132
Input: 18, Output: -96

Calculating the average of the product for each pair:

(-66 * 1) + (-20 * 1) + (-96 * 1) + (0 * 1) + (-54 * 1) / 5 = -56.4

Next, we calculate the average of the squared inputs:

(13^2) + (-20^2) + (18^2) + (0^2) + (11^2) / 5 = 265.8

Now, we can calculate the slope (b):

b = -56.4 / 265.8 = -0.212

To find the intercept (a), we can use the fact that y - bx = a:

-66 - (-0.212 * 13) = a
-66 + 2.756 = a
-63.244 = a

-66 = a + 13b

Using the second pair (-20, 132):
132 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1

Simplifying the equations, we get:

Rewriting these equations:

    Based on the given input-output pairs, we can conclude that the output (y) is a linear function of the input (x) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. The constant term ax^0 represents the initial value of the output when the input is zero, and the coefficient bx^1 represents the constant rate of change of the output with respect to the input.

By plugging in the given input-output pairs into the equation, we can determine the values of coefficients a and b. Let's calculate:

When input (x) is 1, output (y) is 2, so we have:
2 = a(1)^0 + b(1)^1
2 = a + b

When input (x) is -19, output (y) is 122, so we have:
122 = a(-19)^0 + b(-19)^1
122 = a - 19b

When input (x) is 17, output (y) is -94, so we have:
-94 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
-94 = a + 17b

When input (x) is 15, output (y) is -82, so we have:
-82 = a(15)^0 + b(15)^1
-82 = a + 15b

When input (x) is -6, output (y) is 44, so we have:
44 = a(-6)^0 + b(-6)^1
44 = a - 6b

Now we have a system of linear equations that can be solved to determine the values of coefficients a and b.

Solving the system:

Equation 1: 2 = a + b

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship can be described by a linear equation in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's try to find the values of a and b:

For the first input and output (-14, -97):
-97 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1
-97 = a - 14b

For the second input and output (7, 50):
50 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1
50 = a + 7b

For the third input and output (2, 15):
15 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1
15 = a + 2b

We now have a system of equations:
a - 14b = -97
a + 7b = 50
a + 2b = 15

Solving this system of equations, we find a = 13 and b = -6.

    Based on the given data points, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear equation of the form:

Output = a + b * Input

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve for a and b.

Using the first pair (-14, -97):
-97 = a + b * (-14)

Using the second pair (7, 50):
50 = a + b * 7

From these two equations, we can solve for a and b.

Multiplying the first equation by 7:
-679 = 7a - 14b

Subtracting the second equation from the above equation:
-729 = 0a + 21b

Therefore, b = -729/21 = -34.71 (approx)

Substituting the value of b into the second equation:
50 = a + (-34.71) * 7
50 = a - 242.97
a = 50 + 242.97 = 292.97 (approx)

So, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Since all the given inputs have an output of -97, we can conclude that the constant term a is -97. Therefore, the equation becomes y = -97x^0 + bx^1.

Next, we can find the coefficient b by using any of the remaining input-output pairs. Let's use the pair (7, 50):

One potential relationship between the inputs and outputs that fits the given data could be a quadratic function of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c. 

Taking the given inputs and outputs, we can solve a system of equations to find the values of a, b, and c:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can see that the function relating them is a linear function of the form y = bx^1 + a, where x is the input and y is the output. 

Using the given data points, we can calculate the values of a and b:

For input -20 and output 265:
265 = b(-20)^1 + a
265 = -20b + a

For input -15 and output 195:
195 = b(-15)^1 + a
195 = -15b  + a

For input -5 and output 55:
55 = b(-5)^1 + a
55 = -5b + a

For input -10 and output 125:
125 = b(-10)^1 + a
125 = -10b + a

For input 6 and output -99:
-99 = b(6)^1 + a
-99 = 6b + a

Now we have a system of equations:

265 = -20b + a
195 = -15b + a
55 = -5b + a
125 = -10b + a
-99 = 6b + a

Solving this system of equations, we find:
a = 250
b = -5

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To create a function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of 'a' and 'b' in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1. One way to do this is by using the given input-output pairs and solving a system of linear equations.

Using the given input-output pairs:

-10 = a*1 + b*(-10)^1
-54 = a*1 + b*(-54)^1

4 = a*1 + b*(4)^1
2 = a*1 + b*(2)^1

-20 = a*1 + b*(-20)^1
-94 = a*1 + b*(-94)^1

4 = a*1 + b*(4)^1
2 = a*1 + b*(2)^1

-4 = a*1 + b*(-4)^1
-30 = a*1 + b*(-30)^1

Simplifying the equations:

-10 = a - 10b
-54 = a - 54b

4 = a + 4b
2 = a + 2b

-20 = a - 20b
-94 = a - 94b

4 = a + 4b
2 = a + 2b

-4 = a - 4b
-30 = a - 30b

Solving the system of linear equations can help us find the values of 'a' and 'b'. However, upon analyzing the given input-output pairs, there seems to be inconsistency in the data. For example, the same input-output pair (4, 2) is repeated twice but with different values for 'a' and 'b'.

-315 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1

-315 = a + 18b

For the third data point, when the input is -16 and the output is 297, the function becomes:

297 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1

297 = a + (-16b)

For the fourth data point, when the input is -5 and the output is 99, the function becomes:

99 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1

99 = a + (-5b)

For the fifth data point, when the input is 5 and the output is -81, the function becomes:

-81 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1

-81 = a + 5b

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

297 = a - 16b
-315 = a + 18b
297 = a - 16b
99 = a - 5b

    The relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by the function y = ax^0 + bx^1. The values of a and b need to be determined.

By substituting the provided input-output pairs into the function, we can form a system of equations to solve for a and b.

From the first input-output pair (-16, 297):

    Based on the given data, we can observe that the relationship is not consistent with a simple linear function (y = ax^0 + bx^1), where a and b are constants. Instead, it appears that there is a quadratic relationship between the inputs and outputs. Therefore, we need to consider a quadratic function of the form:

Output: y = ax^2 + bx + c

To determine the values of a, b, and c, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve the resulting system of equations. However, since we only have five data points, our solution may not be exact and will only provide an approximation.

Using the provided input-output pairs, we get the following equations:

-265 = a(-18)^2 + b(-18) + c
253 = a(19)^2 + b(19) + c
-223 = a(-15)^2 + b(-15) + c

    Based on the given input-output pairs, we can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a quadratic function. Let's assume that the function has the form:

However, since the exponent of x^2 is not given in any of the inputs, we can exclude it from our assumption. Therefore, the simplified form of the function can be written as follows:

To find the values of a and b, we can plug in the given input-output pairs into the function and solve for a and b.

For the first data point (13, 55), we can substitute the values into the equation: 55 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1.
Since any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1, this reduces to: 55 = a + 13b.

In the same way, we can substitute the values for the other data points into the equation:

For (-20, -44): -44 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
-44 = a - 20b

For (15, 61): 61 = a(15)^0 + b(15)^1

66 = a - 4b

To solve these two equations simultaneously, we can either use substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply Equation 1 by 4:

-816 = 4a + 44b

Multiply Equation 2 by 11:

726 = 11a - 44b

Adding the two equations:

-816 + 726 = 4a + 11a
-90 = 15a
a = -6

Substitute a = -6 back into Equation 1:

-204 = -6 + 11b
b = -18

    The given data points represent a relationship between input and output values. By observing the inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship is not linear, as the outputs do not increase or decrease at a constant rate.

To capture the relationship, I will attempt to fit a quadratic function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2, where x is the input and y is the output. Since the data only provides one input and one output value, I cannot directly solve for the coefficients a, b, and c.

    Function: y = -2x + 5

Explanation:
Given the input-output pairs, we can observe that the relationship between the input and output follows a linear pattern. We can represent this pattern using a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

For example, for the first input-output pair (-12, 9), if we substitute the values into the function, we get:
9 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
9 = a + (-12)b

Similarly, for the other input-output pairs, we get the following equations:

(-12, 9): 9 = a + (-12)b
(20, -55): -55 = a + 20b
(-4, -7): -7 = a + (-4)b
(-10, 5): 5 = a + (-10)b
(8, -31): -31 = a + 8b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

Subtracting the third equation from the first equation, we get:
9 - (-7) = a - a + (-12)b - (-4)b
16 = -8b
b = -2

Substituting the value of b into any of the equations, we can solve for a:

9 = a + (-12)(-2)
9 = a + 24
a = -15

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = -15x^0 + (-2)x^1
Simplifying,
y = -15 + (-2)x
y = -2x - 15

    The given inputs and outputs do not follow a linear pattern, so it is unlikely that a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 can accurately capture the relationship. However, let's still try to find the best fit by assuming that the relationship is linear.

We can represent the given data points as (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4), and (x5, y5), respectively.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can set up the following equations:
-12a + b = 9     (1)
20a + b = -55    (2)
-4a + b = -7     (3)
-10a + b = 5     (4)
8a + b = -31     (5)

To solve this system of linear equations, we can use any method of solving simultaneous equations.

Solving equations (1) and (3) simultaneously, we get:
-12a + b = 9
-4a + b = -7

By subtracting equation (3) from equation (1), we eliminate b:
-8a = 16
a = -2

Substituting a=-2 into equation (1), we get:
-12(-2) + b = 9
24 + b = 9
b = -15

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
Output: y = -2x^0 - 15x^1

Please note that this linear function might not accurately represent the given data points, but it is the best we can come up with using a linear model.

Input: -4,   Output: -7
Input: -10,  Output: 5
Input: 8,    Output: -31

To find the pattern, let's look at how the outputs change relative to the inputs.

When the input changes from -12 to 20, the output changes from 9 to -55. This suggests that the coefficient of x^1 is negative.

When the input changes from -4 to -10, the output changes from -7 to 5. This implies that the coefficient of x^1 is positive.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that the coefficient of x^1 alternates between positive and negative.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's create a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since x^0 is always equal to 1, we can rewrite the function as y = a + bx.

Now, let's find the values of a and b that best fit the given data points:

Using the first pair of data points (-16, 82):

82 = a + b*(-16)

- For the first input-output pair (-16, 82):
  - y = 2(-16)^0 - 10(-16)^1 = 2(1) + 10(16) = 2 + 160 = 162

  - y = 2(-11)^0 - 10(-11)^1 = 2(1) + 10(-11) = 2 - 110 = 108

- For the third input-output pair (14, -98):

  - y = 2(-18)^0 - 10(-18)^1 = 2(1) + 10(18) = 2 + 180 = 182

- For the fifth input-output pair (3, -32):

Substituting (x, y) = (-16, 82) into the function:
82 = a * (-16)^0 + b * (-16)^1

    The pattern in the given data can be described by a quadratic function, in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1. However, this form does not capture the relationship between inputs and outputs accurately. 

Upon observing the given data, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be better described by a linear function, in the form y = mx + c, where m and c are constants to be determined.

To find the exact form of y = mx + c, let's work through the given data:

Input: 6

8 = 6m + c   ---- (1)

Input: -5
Output: -25

-25 = -5m + c   --- (2)

Now, we have a system of linear equations (1) to (5) with two unknowns m and c. We can solve this system to find the values of m and c.

From equations (1), (2), and (3), we can eliminate c:

8 - (-25) = 6m - (-5m)
33 = 11m
m = 3

Now, substituting m = 3 into equation (1):

However, in this case, the y-intercept (b) is not present in the provided input-output pairs. Hence, the equation can be simplified to y = bx^1.

By substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation, we can find the values of b:

When Input = 6, Output = 8:
8 = 6b
b = 8/6 = 4/3

When Input = -5, Output = -25:

242 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1
242 = a + (-14b)          [Equation 5]

Now, we have a system of equations:

162 = a - 9b         [Equation 1]
-254 = a + 17b       [Equation 2]
82 = a - 4b          [Equation 3]
306 = a - 18b        [Equation 4]
242 = a - 14b        [Equation 5]

Solving this system, we find that a = -12 and b = 14.

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -12x^0 + 14x^1

Simplifying, we get:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, let's first assume a relationship of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Using the provided data, we can create the following system of equations:

162 = a + (-9)b
-254 = a + 17b
82 = a + (-4)b
306 = a + (-18)b
242 = a + (-14)b
 
This is a system of equations where we need to find the values of a and b that satisfy all the equations simultaneously. We can solve this system using various methods like substitution or matrix inversion.

Using matrix inversion, the system can be written in the matrix form X = A^-1 * B, where X = [a, b], A = [[1, -9], [1, 17], [1, -4], [1, -18], [1, -14]], and B = [162, -254, 82, 306, 242]. 

To find X, we first need to find the inverse of matrix A.

A =  [[1, -9], 
      [1, 17], 
      [1, -4], 
      [1, -18], 
      [1, -14]]

Using matrix inversion, we can calculate A^-1 to be:

A^-1 = [[0.0636, -0.0448, -0.2224, 0.2906, 0.2682], 
         [-0.0008, 0.0077, 0.0508, 0.0159, 0.0247]]

Now, we can calculate X = A^-1 * B:

X = [[0.0636, -0.0448, -0.2224, 0.2906, 0.2682], 
     [-0.0008, 0.0077, 0.0508, 0.0159, 0.0247]] * [162, -254, 82, 306, 242]

Solving this matrix multiplication, we find:

X = [a, b] = [18.0056, -12.1077]

Therefore, based on the give data, the relationship can be described as:

Output: y = 18.0056 + (-12.1077)x

Using the given data points, we can solve for the values of a and b:

For the first data point (-9, 162):
162 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)^1
162 = a + (-9)b

For the second data point (17, -254):
-254 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1
-254 = a + 17b

For the third data point (-4, 82):
82 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)^1
82 = a + (-4)b

For the fourth data point (-18, 306):
306 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
306 = a + (-18)b

For the fifth data point (-14, 242):
242 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1
242 = a + (-14)b

    Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the method of least squares regression, we can determine the values of a and b that minimize the sum of squared differences between the predicted values and the observed values.

Let's calculate the values of a and b:

Number of input-output pairs, N = 5

Let X be the matrix of inputs and Y be the matrix of outputs:

   X   |   Y
----------------
   1   |  350
   1   |  230
   1   | -270
   1   |   70
   1   |  310

Let's calculate X'X and X'Y:

X'X =   5   (sum of 1s squared)
X'Y =  640  (sum of all Y values)

Now, let's solve the system of equations:

X'X * [a; b] = X'Y

5 * [a; b] = [640]

Dividing each side by 5:

[a; b] = [128]

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 128 * x^0 + 0 * x^1
         y = 128

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function. Therefore, the function can be represented as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1  

Substituting the given input-output pairs, we can solve for the coefficients a and b:

For the first input-output pair (18, 350): 350 = a(18^0) + b(18^1) = a + 18b
For the second input-output pair (12, 230): 230 = a(12^0) + b(12^1) = a + 12b
For the third input-output pair (-13, -270): -270 = a((-13)^0) + b((-13)^1) = a - 13b
For the fourth input-output pair (4, 70): 70 = a(4^0) + b(4^1) = a + 4b
For the fifth input-output pair (16, 310): 310 = a(16^0) + b(16^1) = a + 16b

Simplifying each equation gives us a system of linear equations:

350 = a + 18b  (Equation 1)
230 = a + 12b  (Equation 2)
-270 = a - 13b  (Equation 3)
70 = a + 4b  (Equation 4)
310 = a + 16b  (Equation 5)

Solving this system of linear equations will give us the coefficients a and b, which will represent our function.

Using the given data pairs, we can form a system of equations:

1. For the first data pair (13, 177):
