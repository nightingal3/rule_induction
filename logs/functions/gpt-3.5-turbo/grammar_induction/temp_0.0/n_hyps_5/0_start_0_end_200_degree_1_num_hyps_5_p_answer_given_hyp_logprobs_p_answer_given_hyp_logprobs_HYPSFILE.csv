"Based on the given inputs and outputs, let's assume the relationship between inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

For the given inputs and outputs, the function can be written as:

Output = y = (-10, -213)
y = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10)b

Output = y = (9, 167)
y = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Output = y = (4, 67)
y = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Output = y = (-3, -73)
y = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a + (-3)b

Output = y = (20, 387)
y = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1) -213 = a - 10b
2) 167 = a + 9b
3) 67 = a + 4b
4) -73 = a - 3b

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can see that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a linear equation in the form:

By substituting the given inputs and outputs into this equation, we can solve for the values of a and b.

Using the given data points:

For Input: -10, we have Output: -213

For Input: 20, we have Output: 387
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b        (Equation 5)

To solve for a and b, we can solve this system of equations simultaneously.

Solving Equations 1 and 2, we get:
-213 = a - 10b
167 = a + 9b

Adding these equations, we get:

Therefore, b = 46.

Substituting the value of b into Equation 1, we get:

a = 247

Therefore, a = 247 and b = 46.

By substituting the inputs and outputs from the given data points, we can determine the values of a and b.

Substituting (-13, -197):
-197 = a(1) + b(-13)

Substituting (-11, -169):
-169 = a(1) + b(-11)

Substituting (20, 265):
265 = a(1) + b(20)

Substituting (-10, -155):
-155 = a(1) + b(-10)

Substituting (7, 83):

Simplifying the equations, we get:

-169 = a - 11b
265 = a + 20b

By looking at the data, we can see that the output seems to be decreasing as the input becomes more negative, and increasing as the input becomes more positive. It also appears that the output is proportional to the input.

Let's assume the function has the form: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Since any number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1, the function can be simplified to:
y = a + bx

We can then rearrange the equation to find the values of a and b.

Using the first data point (-13, -197), we substitute the values into the equation:
-197 = a + (-13)b

Using the second data point (-11, -169):
-169 = a + (-11)b

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns (a and b). We can solve these equations to find the values of a and b.

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

Dividing both sides by -2, we find that b = 14.

Explanation:
By observing the given inputs and outputs, we can notice that the coefficient of x remains constant at -8, while the constant term varies. The constant term follows a pattern where it is equal to -299 minus 8 times the input. Thus, we can write the function as y = -299 - 8x.",-6.10430661246,"[-15, -7]"

Hence, the function can be written as:

"To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given data points.

We have:

Input: 13, Output: -66
Input: -20, Output: 132
Input: 18, Output: -96
Input: 0, Output: 12
Input: 11, Output: -54

The given outputs can be represented as a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 represents the constant term (1) and x^1 represents the input value.

Based on the given data, we can represent this equation as:

y = 12 + bx

To find the value of b, we can choose any two points from the given data and solve for b.

Using the points (13, -66) and (18, -96), we can solve for b:

-66 = 12 + 13b

"The given data points do not follow a simple linear relationship in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, as the output values do not change linearly with the input values. Instead, it seems that a quadratic function might better describe the data. The general form of a quadratic function is y = ax^2 + bx + c. Let's try to find the coefficients a, b, and c that fit the data:

To solve for the coefficients, we can plug in the input-output pairs into the quadratic equation and solve the resulting equations:

For the input 13 and output -66:
-66 = a(13)^2 + b(13) + c                     ...(Equation 1)

For the input -20 and output 132:
132 = a(-20)^2 + b(-20) + c                   ...(Equation 2)

For the input 18 and output -96:
-96 = a(18)^2 + b(18) + c                     ...(Equation 3)

For the input 0 and output 12:
12 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c                          ...(Equation 4)

For the input 11 and output -54:
-54 = a(11)^2 + b(11) + c                      ...(Equation 5)

Simplifying Equation 4, we can see that c = 12 since a(0)^2 and b(0) would both be 0.

Now we can substitute c = 12 into Equations 1, 2, 3, and 5:

-66 = a(13)^2 + b(13) + 12                     ...(Equation 1)
132 = a(-20)^2 + b(-20) + 12                   ...(Equation 2)
-96 = a(18)^2 + b(18) + 12                     ...(Equation 3)
-54 = a(11)^2 + b(11) + 12                     ...(Equation 5)

To find the values of a and b, we can use the method of least squares regression. By calculating the average of the product of each input-output pair, we can find the values of a and b that minimize the sum of squared errors.

Using the five given input-output pairs, we have:

Input: 13, Output: -66
Input: -20, Output: 132
Input: 18, Output: -96

Calculating the average of the product for each pair:

(-66 * 1) + (-20 * 1) + (-96 * 1) + (0 * 1) + (-54 * 1) / 5 = -56.4

Next, we calculate the average of the squared inputs:

(13^2) + (-20^2) + (18^2) + (0^2) + (11^2) / 5 = 265.8

Now, we can calculate the slope (b):

b = -56.4 / 265.8 = -0.212

To find the intercept (a), we can use the fact that y - bx = a:

"Based on the given data, it appears that the function has a linear relationship between the input and output values.

Let's denote the input as x and the output as y. The general equation for a linear relationship is y = mx + b, where m is the gradient (coefficient of x) and b is the y-intercept (coefficient of x^0).

Given the provided data, let's calculate the values of m and b:

Using the inputs -14 and -97:
-97 = m*(-14) + b

Using the inputs 7 and 50:
50 = m*7 + b

Using the inputs 2 and 15:
15 = m*2 + b

We can solve this system of linear equations to find the values of m and b. Let's solve these equations:

Taking the first two equations:
-97 + 14m = 50 - 7m

Rearranging the equation:
21m = 147

Simplifying:
m = 7

Substituting the value of m in the equation 50 = m*7 + b:
50 = 7*7 + b

Simplifying:
b = -9

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

"Based on the given data points, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear equation of the form:

Output = a + b * Input

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve for a and b.

Using the first pair (-14, -97):
-97 = a + b * (-14)

Using the second pair (7, 50):
50 = a + b * 7

From these two equations, we can solve for a and b.

Multiplying the first equation by 7:
-679 = 7a - 14b

Subtracting the second equation from the above equation:
-729 = 0a + 21b

Therefore, b = -729/21 = -34.71 (approx)

Substituting the value of b into the second equation:
50 = a + (-34.71) * 7
50 = a - 242.97
a = 50 + 242.97 = 292.97 (approx)

So, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

For (-10, 125):

Subtract the fourth equation from the third equation:

110 - 125 = (2a - 10b) - (a + b(-10))

Subtract the fourth equation from the fifth equation:

-1980 - 125 = (20a + 120b) - (a + b(-10))

195 = b(-15)^1 + a
195 = -15b  + a

For input -5 and output 55:
55 = b(-5)^1 + a

"After observing the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured using a quadratic function. The given form y = ax^0 + bx^1 can be rewritten as y = a + bx, which represents a linear equation.

"To create a function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of 'a' and 'b' in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1. One way to do this is by using the given input-output pairs and solving a system of linear equations.

Using the given input-output pairs:

-10 = a*1 + b*(-10)^1
-54 = a*1 + b*(-54)^1

4 = a*1 + b*(4)^1
2 = a*1 + b*(2)^1

-20 = a*1 + b*(-20)^1
-94 = a*1 + b*(-94)^1

4 = a*1 + b*(4)^1
2 = a*1 + b*(2)^1

-4 = a*1 + b*(-4)^1
-30 = a*1 + b*(-30)^1

Simplifying the equations:

-10 = a - 10b
-54 = a - 54b

4 = a + 4b
2 = a + 2b

-20 = a - 20b
-94 = a - 94b

4 = a + 4b
2 = a + 2b

-4 = a - 4b
-30 = a - 30b

Solving the system of linear equations can help us find the values of 'a' and 'b'. However, upon analyzing the given input-output pairs, there seems to be inconsistency in the data. For example, the same input-output pair (4, 2) is repeated twice but with different values for 'a' and 'b'. Therefore, it is not possible to find a single function that can accurately describe the relationship between the inputs and outputs in this case.",-1.3900375559140001,"[4, -14]"
"Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the function can be approximated by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given pairs (-10, -54) and (4, 2). 

Using (-10, -54):
-54 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-54 = a + (-10b) 
-54 = a - 10b

Using (4, 2):
2 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
2 = a + 4b

Solving these two equations simultaneously will give us the values of a and b. 

From -54 = a - 10b, we can express a in terms of b:
a = 54 + 10b

Substituting a in the second equation, we get:
2 = 54 + 10b + 4b
2 = 54 + 14b
14b = 2 - 54
14b = -52
b = -52/14
b = -26/7

Substituting b value back in a = 54 + 10b, we get:
a = 54 + 10(-26/7)
a = 54 - 260/7
a = 222/7

For the fifth pair (-7, 40), we have 40 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7)^1, which simplifies to 40 = a - 7b.

By solving this system of linear equations, we can find the values of a and b:

Adding the second and third equations gives 8 = a - 3b + 0 = a - 3b.
Adding the fourth and fifth equations gives -120 = a + 18b - 7b = a + 11b.

We can solve these equations simultaneously by eliminating a:

From the first equation, we have a = 3b + 8.
Substituting this value of a into the second equation, we get -120 = (3b + 8) + 11b, which simplifies to -120 = 14b + 8.
Moving terms around, we get 14b = -120 - 8 = -128.
Dividing both sides by 14, we obtain b = -128/14 = -64/7.

Substituting this value of b back into the first equation, we get a = 3(-64/7) + 8 = -192/7 + 56/7 = -136/7.

Explanation:
Given the input-output pairs, we can observe that the relationship between the input and output follows a linear pattern. We can represent this pattern using a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

For example, for the first input-output pair (-12, 9), if we substitute the values into the function, we get:
9 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
9 = a + (-12)b

Similarly, for the other input-output pairs, we get the following equations:

(-12, 9): 9 = a + (-12)b
(20, -55): -55 = a + 20b
(-4, -7): -7 = a + (-4)b
(-10, 5): 5 = a + (-10)b
(8, -31): -31 = a + 8b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b:

Subtracting the third equation from the first equation, we get:
9 - (-7) = a - a + (-12)b - (-4)b
16 = -8b

Substituting the value of b into any of the equations, we can solve for a:

"The given inputs and outputs do not follow a linear pattern, so it is unlikely that a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 can accurately capture the relationship. However, let's still try to find the best fit by assuming that the relationship is linear.

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can set up the following equations:
-12a + b = 9     (1)

-4a + b = -7     (3)
-10a + b = 5     (4)

To solve this system of linear equations, we can use any method of solving simultaneous equations.

Solving equations (1) and (3) simultaneously, we get:

By substituting the provided input-output pairs into the equation, we can solve for the values of a and b. Let's denote the input as x and the output as y:

For the first input-output pair (-18, -75):
-75 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
-75 = a - 18b
Equation 1: a - 18b = -75

For the second input-output pair (-1, -7):
-7 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1
-7 = a - b
Equation 2: a - b = -7

For the third input-output pair (3, 9):
9 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1
9 = a + 3b
Equation 3: a + 3b = 9

For the fourth input-output pair (-18, -75):
-75 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
-75 = a - 18b
Equation 4: a - 18b = -75

For the fifth input-output pair (2, 5):
5 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1
5 = a + 2b
Equation 5: a + 2b = 5

From Equations 1 and 4, we have:
a - 18b = -75
a = 18b - 75

Upon observing the given data, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be better described by a linear function, in the form y = mx + c, where m and c are constants to be determined.

To find the exact form of y = mx + c, let's work through the given data:

Input: 6
Output: 8

8 = 6m + c   ---- (1)

Input: -5
Output: -25

-52 = -14m + c  --- (5)

Now, we have a system of linear equations (1) to (5) with two unknowns m and c. We can solve this system to find the values of m and c.

From equations (1), (2), and (3), we can eliminate c:

8 - (-25) = 6m - (-5m)
33 = 11m
m = 3

Now, substituting m = 3 into equation (1):

"From the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the relationship between the input and output can be described by the equation:

Output = a + b * Input

To find the values of a and b, we can use any two pairs of inputs and outputs and solve for a and b simultaneously. Let's use the first and fourth pairs of inputs and outputs:

When Input = 6, Output = 8:
8 = a + b * 6

When Input = -10, Output = -40:
-40 = a + b * (-10)

Solving these two equations, we can find the values of a and b.

First equation:
a + 6b = 8 (equation 1)

Second equation:
a - 10b = -40 (equation 2)

We can multiply equation 2 by 6 and add it to equation 1 to eliminate a:

6a - 60b = -240
a + 6b = 8

7a - 54b = -232 (equation 3)

Now we can solve equations 1 and 3 to find the values of a and b.

7a - 54b = -232 (equation 3)
6a + 36b = 48 (equation 1)

Multiplying equation 1 by -7 and adding it to equation 3:

7a - 54b = -232

-35a - 306b = -568 (equation 4)

Assuming a = 1, we can solve for b:

b = -533 / -306
b ≈ 1.741

The coefficient of x^0 is 177, and the coefficient of x^1 is the ratio between 177 and 13, which is approximately 13.615.

So, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = 13.615x^1 + 177.

Using the same logic, we can calculate the functions for the other samples:

For the second sample: 
Input: 14
Output: 191

The coefficient of x^0 is 191, and the coefficient of x^1 is (191 / 14) ≈ 13.642857.

So, the function that describes the relationship is:
y = 13.642857x^1 + 191.

For the third sample:
Input: -8
Output: -117

The coefficient of x^0 is -117, and the coefficient of x^1 is (-117 / -8) = 14.625.

So, the function is:
y = 14.625x^1 - 117.

For the fourth sample:
Input: 3
Output: 37

The coefficient of x^0 is 37, and the coefficient of x^1 is (37 / 3) ≈ 12.333333.

So, the function is:
y = 12.333333x^1 + 37.

For the fifth sample:
Input: 7
Output: 93

The coefficient of x^0 is 93, and the coefficient of x^1 is (93 / 7) ≈ 13.285714.

So, the function is:
y = 13.285714x^1 + 93.
