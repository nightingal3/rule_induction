Input: 11
","Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the function takes an input number and performs some mathematical operations on it to produce the output. Let's try to find a pattern in the given pairs.

For the first pair, when the input is -18, the output is 339. It seems that the output is obtained by multiplying the input by -19 and subtracting 3. So, we can write the function as:

Output = (Input * -19) - 3

Now, let's test this function with the remaining input-output pairs to see if it holds true.

For the second pair, when the input is 0, the output is -3. Plugging in the values into the function:

Output = (0 * -19) - 3
Output = -3

The function holds true for this pair.

For the third pair, when the input is 5, the output is -98. Plugging in the values into the function:

Output = (5 * -19) - 3
Output = -98

The function holds true for this pair as well.

For the fourth pair, when the input is -3, the output is 54. Plugging in the values into the function:

Output = (-3 * -19) - 3
Output = 54

The function holds true for this pair too.

For the fifth pair, when the input is -16, the output is 301. Plugging in the values into the function:

Output = (-16 * -19) - 3
Output = 301

The function holds true for this pair as well.

Now, let's use the function to find the output for the given input of 11:

Output = (11 * -19) - 3
Output = -212

Therefore, the final output is: -212",-212,False,"[-19, -3]"

","To find the pattern in the given input-output pairs, let's analyze the relationship between the input and output values:

Input: -1, Output: -8
Input: 5, Output: 76
Input: 3, Output: 48
Input: 8, Output: 118
Input: 13, Output: 188

By observing the pattern, it seems that the output is obtained by multiplying the input by a certain number and then adding another number. Let's try to find these numbers.

For the first pair, -1 * ? + ? = -8. We can see that -1 * 8 + 0 = -8, so the first number to multiply by is 8 and the second number to add is 0.

For the second pair, 5 * ? + ? = 76. We can see that 5 * 15 + 1 = 76, so the first number to multiply by is 15 and the second number to add is 1.

For the third pair, 3 * ? + ? = 48. We can see that 3 * 15 + 3 = 48, so the first number to multiply by is 15 and the second number to add is 3.

For the fourth pair, 8 * ? + ? = 118. We can see that 8 * 15 + 8 = 118, so the first number to multiply by is 15 and the second number to add is 8.

For the fifth pair, 13 * ? + ? = 188. We can see that 13 * 15 + 13 = 188, so the first number to multiply by is 15 and the second number to add is 13.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the given input of 8:

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the function takes an input number and multiplies it by a certain factor, and then subtracts a certain value. To find the factor and the value to subtract, we can look for patterns in the input-output pairs.

Let's start by looking at the first pair:
Input: -16
Output: -275

If we divide the output (-275) by the input (-16), we get approximately 17.1875. This suggests that the factor is around 17.

Now let's look at the second pair:
Input: -17
Output: -292

If we divide the output (-292) by the input (-17), we get approximately 17.1765. This is very close to the factor we found in the first pair.

We can repeat this process for the remaining pairs and calculate the average factor. By doing so, we find that the average factor is approximately 17.18.

Now let's find the value to subtract. We can subtract the input multiplied by the factor from the output to get this value.

For example, for the first pair:
Output (-275) - Input (-16) * Factor (17.18) = -275 - (-16) * 17.18 = -275 + 275.68 = 0.68

We can repeat this process for the remaining pairs and calculate the average value to subtract. By doing so, we find that the average value to subtract is approximately 0.68.

Therefore, the function can be defined as follows:
Output = Input * 17.18 - 0.68

Now, let's test this function with the given input:
Input: -16
Output = -16 * 17.18 - 0.68 = -275.48

So, the final output is:

","Output: 209

The function seems to be multiplying the input by a negative number and then subtracting a constant value. Let's try to find the values of these parameters.

From the given input-output pairs, we can observe that the constant value is 105. This means that the function subtracts 105 from the product of the input and the unknown negative number.

Let's calculate the negative number by using one of the input-output pairs. For example, when the input is -6, the output is -105. We can set up the equation as follows:

-6 * x - 105 = -105

Simplifying the equation, we get:

-6 * x = 0

Dividing both sides by -6, we find that x = 0.

Therefore, the function can be defined as:

f(x) = -6x - 105

Now, let's test this function with the given input of 12:

f(12) = -6 * 12 - 105 = -72 - 105 = -177

For the second pair, when the input is -3, the output is 22. It seems like the output is obtained by multiplying the input by 5 and then subtracting 7.

For the third pair, when the input is 9, the output is -62. It seems like the output is obtained by multiplying the input by -7 and then subtracting 5.

For the fourth pair, when the input is -5, the output is 36. It seems like the output is obtained by squaring the input and then adding 11.

For the fifth pair, when the input is -16, the output is 113. It seems like the output is obtained by squaring the input, adding 7, and then subtracting 2.

Based on these patterns, let's try to come up with a general formula for the function:

1. If the input is negative, square the input and then subtract a constant value.
2. If the input is positive, multiply the input by a negative constant value and then subtract another constant value.
3. If the input is zero, the output is not specified in the given pairs.

Now, let's apply this formula to the given input of 15:

1. Since the input is positive, we multiply it by a negative constant value. Let's say the constant value is -3.
2. Then, we subtract another constant value. Let's say the constant value is 10.

Applying these steps to the input of 15, we get:

Similarly, for the remaining pairs, the output is obtained by squaring the absolute value of the input and then subtracting 1.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the given input of -14:

Input: 11
","Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the function takes an input number and performs some mathematical operations on it to produce the output. Let's analyze the pattern:

Input: -20
Output: 265

The output is 265 more than 20 squared, so the function could be something like:
Output = (Input^2) + 265

Input: -15
Output: 195

The output is 195 more than 15 squared, so the function could be:
Output = (Input^2) + 195

Input: -5
Output: 55

The output is 55 more than 5 squared, so the function could be:
Output = (Input^2) + 55

Input: -10
Output: 125

The output is 125 more than 10 squared, so the function could be:
Output = (Input^2) + 125

Input: 6
Output: -99

The output is 99 less than 6 squared, so the function could be:
Output = (Input^2) - 99

Based on these patterns, we can generalize the function as:
Output = (Input^2) + C

To find the value of C, we can use any of the input-output pairs. Let's use the first one:

Input: -20
Output: 265

Substituting these values into the generalized function:
265 = (-20^2) + C
265 = 400 + C
C = -135

Therefore, the final function is:
Output = (Input^2) - 135

Now, let's calculate the output for the given input of 11:
Output = (11^2) - 135
Output = 121 - 135
Output = -14

","Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the function takes an input number and performs some mathematical operations on it to produce the output. Let's analyze the given pairs to try to identify the pattern:

Input: -15
Output: 195

Input: -5
Output: 55

Input: -10
Output: 125

Input: 6
Output: -99

From the given pairs, it appears that the function is multiplying the input number by itself, subtracting a constant value, and then multiplying by another constant value. Let's try to find the values of these constants:

For the first pair (-20, 265):
-20 * -20 = 400
400 - X = 265
X = 400 - 265 = 135

For the second pair (-15, 195):
-15 * -15 = 225
225 - X = 195
X = 225 - 195 = 30

For the third pair (-5, 55):
-5 * -5 = 25
25 - X = 55
X = 25 - 55 = -30

For the fourth pair (-10, 125):
-10 * -10 = 100
100 - X = 125
X = 100 - 125 = -25

For the fifth pair (6, -99):
6 * 6 = 36
36 - X = -99
X = 36 - (-99) = 135

Based on these calculations, it seems that the function can be described as follows:

1. Multiply the input number by itself.
2. Subtract a constant value (X).
3. Multiply the result by another constant value (Y).

Let's use this function to find the output for the given input of -7:

For the first pair (0, -15), it seems that the output is obtained by multiplying the input by -3 and subtracting 15. This pattern holds true for the second pair (-5, -35) and the third pair (-4, -31).

For the fourth pair (5, 5), the output is the same as the input. This suggests that the function might return the input number itself for positive input numbers.

For the fifth pair (-12, -63), the output is obtained by multiplying the input by -5 and subtracting 3. This pattern is different from the previous pattern for negative input numbers.

The function seems to be subtracting a certain number from the input to get the output. Let's try to find the pattern.

From the first example, we can see that -12 - 21 = 9. So, it seems like the function is subtracting 21 from the input.

Let's test this pattern with the other examples:

20 - 21 = -1
-4 - 21 = -25
-10 - 21 = -31
8 - 21 = -13

It seems like the pattern holds true for all the examples. Therefore, the function could be:

The number being subtracted seems to be increasing by 12 each time. Let's test this pattern with the input -20.

To get from -20 to ? , we subtract ? and then negate the result.

The number being subtracted should be 39 + 12 = 51.

Input: 7
","Output: -62

Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the function takes an input number and returns the output number by performing some mathematical operations on the input. To find the pattern, let's analyze the given pairs:

Input: -16, Output: 82
Input: -11, Output: 52
Input: 14, Output: -98
Input: -18, Output: 94
Input: 3, Output: -32

Looking at the outputs, we can see that they are all negative numbers. This suggests that the function might involve multiplying the input by a negative factor. Additionally, the outputs seem to be decreasing as the inputs increase, indicating that the function might involve subtracting a value from the product of the input and the negative factor.

Let's try to find the negative factor by comparing the outputs of two consecutive input-output pairs:

82 - 52 = 30
52 - (-98) = 150
(-98) - 94 = -192
94 - (-32) = 126

From these differences, we can see that the negative factor is likely -30. Now, let's find the value being subtracted from the product of the input and the negative factor:

-16 * (-30) + x = 82
-11 * (-30) + x = 52
14 * (-30) + x = -98
-18 * (-30) + x = 94
3 * (-30) + x = -32

Solving these equations, we find that x is equal to -542, -322, -602, -454, and -92, respectively.

Now, let's test our findings with the given input of 7:

","The given input-output pairs suggest that the function takes an input number, multiplies it by -4, and then subtracts 2 from the result. 

So, for the input -18, the function would calculate:
-18 * -4 = 72
72 - 2 = 70

Therefore, the final output for the input -18 would be:

Let's think step by step about what the function could be. Remember to write down 'Final Output:' before your final answer.
Input: 14
","Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the function takes an input number and produces an output number by performing some mathematical operations. Let's analyze the given pairs to identify the pattern.

Input: -16
Output: 109

Input: -3
Output: 18

Input: 2
Output: -17

Input: 12
Output: -87

Input: 5
Output: -38

From the given pairs, it appears that the output is obtained by multiplying the input by a factor and then subtracting a constant value. Let's calculate the factor and constant for each pair:

For the first pair (-16, 109):
Factor = Output / Input = 109 / -16 = -6.8125
Constant = Output - (Factor * Input) = 109 - (-6.8125 * -16) = 109 - 109 = 0

For the second pair (-3, 18):
Factor = Output / Input = 18 / -3 = -6
Constant = Output - (Factor * Input) = 18 - (-6 * -3) = 18 - 18 = 0

For the third pair (2, -17):
Factor = Output / Input = -17 / 2 = -8.5
Constant = Output - (Factor * Input) = -17 - (-8.5 * 2) = -17 - (-17) = 0

For the fourth pair (12, -87):
Factor = Output / Input = -87 / 12 = -7.25
Constant = Output - (Factor * Input) = -87 - (-7.25 * 12) = -87 - (-87) = 0

For the fifth pair (5, -38):
Factor = Output / Input = -38 / 5 = -7.6
Constant = Output - (Factor * Input) = -38 - (-7.6 * 5) = -38 - (-38) = 0

Based on the calculations, it seems that the factor is consistent across all pairs, but the constant is always 0. Therefore, the function can be represented as:

Output = (Factor * Input) + Constant

Since the constant is always 0, the function simplifies to:

Output = Factor * Input

Now, let's calculate the factor for the given pairs:

Factor = (Output / Input)

For the first pair (-16, 109):
Factor = 109 / -16 = -6.8125

For the second pair (-3, 18):
Factor = 18 / -3 = -6

For the third pair (2, -17):
Factor = -17 / 2 = -8.5

For the fourth pair (12, -87):
Factor = -87 / 12 = -7.25

For the fifth pair (5, -38):
Factor = -38 / 5 = -7.6

Now, let's use the calculated factor to find the output for the given input of 14:

Output = Factor * Input
Output = -6.8125 * 14 = -95.375

Therefore, the final output is -95.375.",-101,False,"[-7, -3]"
