"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the method of least squares to fit a linear equation to the given data points. The linear equation can be written in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 represents the constant term and x^1 represents the coefficient of x.

Using the given data points, we can set up a system of equations:

(-19, -393): -393 = a(1) + b(-19)
(-3, -73): -73 = a(1) + b(-3)
(-5, -113): -113 = a(1) + b(-5)
(-6, -133): -133 = a(1) + b(-6)
(-12, -253): -253 = a(1) + b(-12)

Simplifying these equations, we get:

-393 = a - 19b
-73 = a - 3b
-113 = a - 5b
-133 = a - 6b
-253 = a - 12b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Using a calculator or a system of equations solver, we find that a = -20 and b = 11.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
