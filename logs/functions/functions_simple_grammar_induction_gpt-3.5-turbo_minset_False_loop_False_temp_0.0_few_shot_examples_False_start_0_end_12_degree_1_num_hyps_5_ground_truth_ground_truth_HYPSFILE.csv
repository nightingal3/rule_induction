"To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can create a system of equations using the given data points.

Using the form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 represents a constant term and x^1 represents the input value, we can substitute the given data points into the equation and solve for a and b.

When solving for a and b, we have:

For the input -10 and output -213:
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1

For the input 9 and output 167:
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1

For the input 4 and output 67:
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1

For the input -3 and output -73:
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1

For the input 20 and output 387:
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1

Simplifying these equations, we get:

-213 = a + (-10)b

167 = a + (9)b

67 = a + (4)b

-73 = a + (-3)b

387 = a + (20)b

Now we have a system of equations where we can solve for a and b. By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b, and then express the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form of the function.

Solving this system of equations, we find:

a = -4

b = 18

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -4x^0 + 18x^1",-421.8,"[20, -13]"
"To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of a and b in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. We can do this by using the given input-output pairs and solving a set of linear equations.

Let's set up the equations:

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1   -> Equation 1
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1       -> Equation 2
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1         -> Equation 3
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1       -> Equation 4
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1      -> Equation 5

Simplifying the equations, we have:

-213 = a - 10b         -> Equation 1
167 = a + 9b          -> Equation 2
67 = a + 4b            -> Equation 3
-73 = a - 3b           -> Equation 4
387 = a + 20b          -> Equation 5

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Solving these equations, we get:

a = 4
b = 21

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

a = -22.645

67 = a + 4b        (equation 3)
-73 = a - 3b       (equation 4)
387 = a + 20b      (equation 5)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Adding (equation 1) + (equation 4):
-213 + (-73) = a - 10b + a - 3b
-286 = 2a - 13b     (equation 6)

Adding (equation 2) + (equation 3):
167 + 67 = a + 9b + a + 4b
234 = 2a + 13b      (equation 7)

Multiplying (equation 7) by 5 and subtracting (equation 6) from it:
5(234) - (-286) = 5(2a + 13b) - (2a - 13b)
1145 = 10a + 65b - 2a + 13b

To solve this system of equations, we can subtract equations (2) and (3) to eliminate a:

167 - 67 = a + 9b - (a + 4b)
100 = 5b
b = 20

Now, we can substitute the value of b back into equations (2), (3), (4), and (5) to find a:

To find the coefficients a and b, we can use the method of least squares to fit a line to the data points.

Let's label the inputs as x and the outputs as y.

Using the given data points, we have:

x = [-10, 9, 4, -3, 20]
y = [-213, 167, 67, -73, 387]

We want to find the coefficients a and b that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the modeled outputs and the actual outputs.

The equations for this linear regression problem are:

∑y = na + ∑bx
∑xy = ∑ax + ∑bx^2

where n is the number of data points, ∑y is the sum of the outputs, ∑x is the sum of the inputs, and ∑xy is the sum of the product of inputs and outputs.

Let's calculate the required sums:

∑y = -213 + 167 + 67 - 73 + 387 = 335
∑x = -10 + 9 + 4 - 3 + 20 = 20
∑xy = (-10 * -213) + (9 * 167) + (4 * 67) + (-3 * -73) + (20 * 387) = -2130 + 1503 + 268 + 219 + 7740 = 10140

From the above equations, we can write:

335 = 5a + 20b   ...(1)
10140 = 20a + 200b   ...(2)

By solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

Multiply equation (1) by 4 and subtract equation (2) from it:

(1340 - 10140) = (20 * 5a - 20a) + (20 * 20b - 200b)

a = -8800/80

20b = 885
b = 885/20

The given data does not show a clear pattern that can be captured by a single equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. The outputs do not seem to vary linearly with the inputs. It is possible that the relationship between the inputs and outputs may be more complex or involve higher-order terms.

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a quadratic equation. 

The function that approximates the given data points in the exact form Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 can be written as:

"Given the provided input-output pairs, we can apply the method of least squares to determine the coefficients of the function. Let's assume the function can be expressed as a linear combination of two terms, y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To solve for the coefficients a and b, we can formulate and solve a system of equations using the provided input-output pairs:

-18a + (-18)b = 339
0a + (0)b = -3
5a + (5)b = -98
-3a + (-3)b = 54
-16a + (-16)b = 301

Simplifying the equations, we have:

-18a - 18b = 339
0a + 0b = -3
5a + 5b = -98
-3a - 3b = 54
-16a - 16b = 301

Simplifying further, we can write the system of equations as:

-18a - 18b = 339
0 = -3
5a + 5b = -98
-3a - 3b = 54
-16a - 16b = 301

From the equation 0 = -3, we can conclude that there is no unique solution for this system of equations.

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship can be approximated by a linear function. Let's write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

For the inputs and outputs provided:

Input: 5, Output: -31
Input: 9, Output: -51
Input: -11, Output: 49
Input: -4, Output: 14
Input: -12, Output: 54

From the given data points, we can observe that when the input increases, the output decreases. Therefore, we can assume a negative relationship between input and output.

Considering the linear form, we can write the function as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Simplifying the equation, we have:

Output: y = a + bx

To determine the values of a and b, we can use any two of the given input-output pairs.

Taking the first and third pairs:

For Input: 5, Output: -31

-31 = a + 5b    ........(1)

For Input: -11, Output: 49

49 = a - 11b    ........(2)

Solving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):

-80 = 16b

Dividing both sides by 16:

b = -5

Substituting b = -5 into equation (1):

-31 = a + 5(-5)

-31 = a - 25

a = -31 + 25

a = -6
