                      b = -14

Now we can substitute b = -14 in any of the equations to solve for a. Let's use the third equation:

-5(-14) + a = 55
70 + a = 55
a = -15

So the values of a and b are a = -15 and b = -14.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -15 + (-14)x",-0.0,"[-14, -15]"
"Based on the given data, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs can be written in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Let's calculate the values of a and b:

For the first data point (-20, 265):
265 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
265 = a + (-20)b

For the second data point (-15, 195):
195 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)^1
195 = a + (-15)b

For the third data point (-5, 55):
55 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
55 = a + (-5)b

For the fourth data point (-10, 125):
125 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
125 = a + (-10)b

For the fifth data point (6, -99):
-99 = a(6)^0 + b(6)^1
-99 = a + 6b

Now we have a system of 5 linear equations in two variables (a and b). By solving this system, we can find the values of a and b.

Solving the system of equations:

265 = a + (-20)b
195 = a + (-15)b
55 = a + (-5)b
125 = a + (-10)b
-99 = a + 6b

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
195 - 265 = (-15)b - (-20)b
-70 = -15b + 20b
-70 = 5b
b = -70/5
b = -14

Substituting the value of b in the fifth equation:
-99 = a + 6(-14)
-99 = a - 84
a = -99 + 84
a = -15

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

Output: y = -15x^0 - 14x^1",-0.0,"[-14, -15]"
"Based on the given inputs and outputs, the function can be written as:

Output: y = 4x^1 + 80

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is y = 4x + 80.",-29861.8,"[-14, -15]"
Output: y = -10x^0 + 5x^1,-55102.2,"[-14, -15]"
"The function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be written as:

Output: y = -5x^0 + 20x^1",-175839.2,"[-14, -15]"
