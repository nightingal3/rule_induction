"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To come up with a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since x^0 is equal to 1, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

By substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation, we can solve for the values of a and b. Let's calculate them:

For the first pair (Input: -10, Output: -213):
-213 = a + (-10)b

For the second pair (Input: 9, Output: 167):
167 = a + 9b

For the third pair (Input: 4, Output: 67):
67 = a + 4b

For the fourth pair (Input: -3, Output: -73):
-73 = a + (-3)b

For the fifth pair (Input: 20, Output: 387):
387 = a + 20b

By solving this system of linear equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b, which will define our function.

The solution for this system is:
a = -3
b = 20

Therefore, the function that best captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -3 + 20x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: -10
Output: -213

Input: 9
Output: 167

Input: 4
Output: 67

Input: -3
Output: -73

Input: 20
Output: 387


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: 15
    ",Output: 297,287,False,"[20, -13]"
