"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are essentially looking for a linear relationship of the form y = b * x + a (since x^0 = 1 for all x ≠ 0, thus ax^0 is equal to a).

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we have a set of equations:

For Input -10 (Output: -213):
-213 = a + b(-10)

For Input 9 (Output: 167):
167 = a + b(9)

For Input 4 (Output: 67):
67 = a + b(4)

For Input -3 (Output: -73):
-73 = a + b(-3)

For Input 20 (Output: 387):
387 = a + b(20)

To solve for a and b, let's use two of the equations to set up a system of linear equations to solve. 

Using the inputs -10 and 9 (the first and second equations):
-213 = a - 10b
167 = a + 9b

Adding these two equations to eliminate a gives:
-46 = -b

Therefore, b = 46.

Now to find a, substitute b = 46 into one of the equations, let's use the second one:
167 = a + 9(46)

Solving for a:
167 = a + 414
a = 167 - 414
a = -247

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) is:
y = -247x^0 + 46x^1

Which simplifies to:
y = -247 + 46x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    ","To find the output for the input 15 using the derived function y = -247 + 46x, we substitute x with 15:

y = -247 + 46(15)
y = -247 + 690
y = 443

Therefore, the output is:

Output: 443",287,False,"[20, -13]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the input-output pairs and the desired form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we recognize that ax^0 is equivalent to a since any number raised to the zeroth power is 1. Therefore, our function reduces to y = a + bx. We need to find the constants a and b that fit the data.

To do this, let's use two of the given points to set up a system of equations. Let's pick the points (-10, -213) and (20, 387).

Substituting the first point into the equation y = a + bx:
-213 = a + b(-10)
-213 = a - 10b  ...(1)

Now, substituting the second point into the equation:
387 = a + b(20)
387 = a + 20b  ...(2)

Now we have a system of two equations:
-213 = a - 10b
387 = a + 20b

To solve the system, we can use the method of addition to eliminate one of the variables. If we add these two equations together, we can solve for a:

(-213) + (387) = (a - 10b) + (a + 20b)
174 = 2a + 10b

Now solve for a:
174 = 2a + 10b
87 = a + 5b ...(3)

Now we have a simpler equation with two unknowns. We need another equation that relates a and b to find a unique solution. We can use any other given point, let's use (4, 67):

67 = a + b(4)
67 = a + 4b ...(4)

Now we have another system of equations with (3) and (4):
87 = a + 5b
67 = a + 4b

Subtract equation (4) from equation (3) to find b:
87 - 67 = (a + 5b) - (a + 4b)
20 = b

We found b = 20. Now let's substitute it back into equation (4) to find a:
67 = a + 4(20)
67 = a + 80

Subtract 80 from both sides:
a = 67 - 80
a = -13

With a = -13 and b = 20, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = -13 + 20x

Or in the form requested:
y = -13x^0 + 20x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we'll use the given input-output pairs to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). We know that \( ax^0 \) is equivalent to \( a \) since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \). 

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to form a system of equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

Using Input: 4, Output: 67:
\[ 67 = a + b(4) \tag{1} \]

Using Input: -3, Output: -73:
\[ -73 = a + b(-3) \tag{2} \]

Let's solve the system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \):

From (1): \( 67 = a + 4b \) which can be rewritten as \( a = 67 - 4b \) \tag{3}
Substitute \( a \) from (3) into (2):
\[ -73 = (67 - 4b) - 3b \]
\[ -73 = 67 - 7b \]
\[ -7b = -73 - 67 \]
\[ -7b = -140 \]
\[ b = \frac{-140}{-7} \]
\[ b = 20 \]

Now that we have \( b \), use equation (3) to solve for \( a \):
\[ a = 67 - 4(20) \]
\[ a = 67 - 80 \]
\[ a = -13 \]

Thus, the function we're looking for is \( y = -13 + 20x \).

    To find a function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are essentially looking for a linear function of the form \( y = a + bx \), because \( x^0 \) equals 1 for any \( x \) and \( x^1 \) is just \( x \).

Given this linear form, we need to find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) that best fit the given data points. To do this, we usually require at least two distinct data points. Here, there seems to be a pattern that can be derived from the given data. Let's examine two of the given data points and create a system of equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Let’s choose the inputs and outputs (-10, -213) and (9, 167) to form our two equations:

For input -10 and output -213:
\( -213 = a + b(-10) \)
\( -213 = a - 10b \) ... [Equation 1]

For input 9 and output 167:
\( 167 = a + b(9) \)
\( 167 = a + 9b \) ... [Equation 2]

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, and we can solve them using substitution or elimination methods. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we'll stack the equations:
\( -213 = a - 10b \) ... [Equation 1]
\( 167 = a + 9b \) ... [Equation 2]

We can add these two equations to eliminate \( a \):
\( -213 + 167 = a - 10b + a + 9b \)
\( -46 = 2a - b \)
\( -46 = 2a - b \) ... [Equation 3]

Now we need to either solve for \( a \) or \( b \) from one of the original equations. Let’s isolate \( a \) from [Equation 2]:
\( 167 = a + 9b \)
\( a = 167 - 9b \) ... [Equation 4]

Now we'll put the expression for \( a \) from [Equation 4] into [Equation 3]:
\( -46 = 2(167 - 9b) - b \)
\( -46 = 334 - 18b - b \)
\( -46 = 334 - 19b \)
\( -19b = -46 - 334 \)
\( -19b = -380 \)
\( b = \frac{-380}{-19} \)
\( b = 20 \)

With the value of \( b \), we'll now find \( a \) using [Equation 4]:
\( a = 167 - 9b \)
\( a = 167 - 9(20) \)
\( a = 167 - 180 \)
\( a = -13 \)

Therefore, the function that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
\( y = -13 + 20x \)

So in the required format:
Output: \( y = -13x^0 + 20x^1 \)

Please note that this linear function is only an estimate based on two data points, and with more data points, a more sophisticated method may be required to find the best-fitting function, especially since this linear function might not perfectly predict other data points given the apparent non-linearity of the input-output pairs.

\( y = -353 \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function that describes the input-output pairs, we need to determine the constants \(a\) and \(b\) in the equation of the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\) since \(x^0 = 1\) for any \(x\) except 0.

Given the pairs:

1) \(x = -10\), \(y = -213\)
2) \(x = 9\), \(y = 167\)
3) \(x = 4\), \(y = 67\)
4) \(x = -3\), \(y = -73\)
5) \(x = 20\), \(y = 387\)

We can plug any two pairs into the equation \(y = a + bx\) to solve for \(a\) and \(b\).

Let's use the first and last pairs for this purpose:

For \(x = -10\), \(y = -213\):
\(-213 = a + b(-10)\)

For \(x = 20\), \(y = 387\):
\(387 = a + b(20)\)

Let's solve these two equations with two unknowns as a system of linear equations.

Equation 1: \(a - 10b = -213\)
Equation 2: \(a + 20b = 387\)

We can use the elimination method to solve for \(a\) and \(b\). Let's multiply Equation 1 by 2 and then add it to Equation 2 to eliminate \(a\).

\(2a - 20b = -426\)
\(a + 20b = 387\)
Now adding these two equations we get:
\(3a = -39\)

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \(a\):
\(a = -13\)

Now, with \(a = -13\), we can substitute this value back into any of the two original equations to solve for \(b\). We'll use Equation 2:

\(-13 + 20b = 387\)
\(20b = 387 + 13\)
\(20b = 400\)
\(b = 400 / 20\)
\(b = 20\)

    The given inputs and outputs can be used to generate a set of linear equations based on the formula y = ax^0 + bx^1. This formula simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 = 1 for all x ≠ 0.

Let's insert the provided input-output pairs into this equation:

1. For input -18 (x = -18), output = 339:
339 = a + b(-18)

2. For input 0 (x = 0), output = -3:
-3 = a + b(0) → -3 = a

3. For input 5 (x = 5), output = -98:
-98 = a + b(5)

4. For input -3 (x = -3), output = 54:
54 = a + b(-3)

5. For input -16 (x = -16), output = 301:
301 = a + b(-16)

We already have the value of a from equation 2, where a = -3. Now we can use this to find b using any other equation. Let's use equation 1:

339 = -3 - 18b
342 = -18b
b = -19

Now we have both a and b. So the function which describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = a + bx

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given inputs and outputs, we can use two points from the provided data to solve for a and b. The term ax^0 is equivalent to a, since any number raised to the power of zero is 1. The function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's take two points to solve for a and b.

Point 1 (x1, y1): (0, -3)
Point 2 (x2, y2): (5, -98)

Using point 1:
y1 = a + b*x1
-3 = a + b*0
-3 = a

Now we have the value for a. Since a = -3, the function can be simplified to:
y = -3 + bx

Using point 2 and the value for a:
y2 = a + b*x2
-98 = -3 + b*5
-98 + 3 = b*5
-95 = 5b
b = -95 / 5
b = -19

Now we have both a and b. The function is therefore:

In the exact form requested, the function is:
Output: y = -3x^0 - 19x^1

Note: This function exactly matches the outputs for inputs 0 and 5. However, it's important to highlight that with only two points used, this function's accuracy for other inputs is uncertain unless all provided points fall perfectly on a straight line that these two points define. Let's quickly check if this function works for the other given points:

For input -18:
y = -3 - 19(-18) = -3 + 342 = 339 (which matches the output)

For input -3:

For input -16:
y = -3 - 19(-16) = -3 + 304 = 301 (which matches the output)

    To find the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, which simplifies to `y = a + bx` as x^0 = 1 for all x ≠ 0, we need to find the values of `a` and `b` such that y changes according to a linear relationship with x. The given pairs of inputs and outputs are:

1) For Input: -18, Output: 339
2) For Input: 0,  Output: -3
3) For Input: 5,  Output: -98
4) For Input: -3, Output: 54
5) For Input: -16, Output: 301

From the second datapoint, where the input is 0, the output should be equal to the value of `a` in the equation `y = a + bx` since `b * 0 = 0`. Therefore, we can determine that `a = -3`.

With the value of `a` known, we can substitute the second pair of input and output (x=0, y=-3) into the equation `y = a + bx` to find `b`:

-3 = -3 + b * 0
-3 = -3

This doesn't give us `b` just yet but reaffirms that when x = 0, y will be equal to `a`.

To find `b`, we can use any other point. Let's use the first point (x=-18, y=339):

339 = -3 + b (-18)

Now solve for `b`:

339 + 3 = -18b
342 = -18b
b = 342 / -18
b = -19

So the function that describes the data seems to be:

y = -3 - 19x

We have the following pairs from the data:

5. When x = -16, y = 301, which gives the equation 301 = a - 16b

2. -98 = -3 + 5b
3. 54 = -3 - 3b

-51 = a + 9b   ... (2)

We'll solve these two linear equations to find the values of a and b.

Subtracting equation (1) from (2), we get:

-51 - (-31) = (a + 9b) - (a + 5b)
-20 = 4b
b = -20 / 4
b = -5

Now, we'll use the value of b to solve for a using equation (1):

-31 = a + 5(-5)
-31 = a - 25
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

So the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = -6x^0 - 5x^1

Or simply:

y = -6 - 5x

We can now verify this with the other given input-output pairs:

For x = -11:
y = -6 - 5(-11)
y = -6 + 55
y = 49

For x = -4:
y = -6 - 5(-4)
y = -6 + 20
y = 14

For x = -12:
y = -6 - 5(-12)
y = -6 + 60
y = 54

Each result matches the original outputs for the given inputs, confirming our function is correct.

    To find the function in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\) since \(x^0\) is 1 for any \(x\) except for \(x=0\), we need to determine the constants \(a\) and \(b\). We can use the given input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations and solve for these constants.

Given the input-output pairs:

1. Input: 5, Output: -31
2. Input: 9, Output: -51
3. Input: -11, Output: 49
4. Input: -4, Output: 14
5. Input: -12, Output: 54

We can express each pair as an equation:

1. \(a + 5b = -31\)
2. \(a + 9b = -51\)
3. \(a - 11b = 49\)
4. \(a - 4b = 14\)
5. \(a - 12b = 54\)

Let's solve the system of equations. First, we can choose two equations to eliminate one of the variables.

Let's use equations (1) and (3):

\(a + 5b = -31\)   [Equation 1]
\(a - 11b = 49\)    [Equation 3]

By subtracting Equation 3 from Equation 1, we get:

\((a - a) + (5b - (-11b)) = -31 - 49\)

\(16b = -80\)

Now, let's solve for \(b\):

\(b = -80 / 16\)

\(b = -5\)

Now, we can substitute \(b\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(a\). We'll use Equation 1:

\(a + 5(-5) = -31\)

\(a - 25 = -31\)

Adding 25 to both sides:

\(a = -31 + 25\)

\(a = -6\)

So, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\(y = a + bx\)

Plugging in the values of \(a\) and \(b\):

\(y = -6 + (-5)x\)

Or:

\(y = -6 - 5x\)

Thus, the function in the specified form is:

Output: \(y = -6x^0 - 5x^1\)

\(y = -6 - 70\)

\(y = -76\)

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can create a system of linear equations based on the function form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Here, ax^0 simplifies to a because anything raised to the 0th power is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We now have the following system of equations based on the input-output pairs provided:

For input 5, output -31:
-31 = a + 5b

For input 9, output -51:
-51 = a + 9b

For input -11, output 49:
49 = a - 11b

For input -4, output 14:
14 = a - 4b

For input -12, output 54:
54 = a - 12b

To find the values of a and b, we can choose any two of the above equations and solve for a and b using the method of substitution or elimination. Let us use the first and last equations to solve for a and b:

-31 = a + 5b (Equation 1)
54 = a - 12b (Equation 2)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. By adding Equation 1 and Equation 2 to eliminate a, we get:

-31 + 54 = a + 5b + a - 12b
23 = 2a - 7b

Now we'll divide by 2 to solve for a:

a - (7/2)b = 11.5

We can use this along with one of our original equations to solve for a and b. Let's pair it with Equation 1 (-31 = a + 5b):

a - (7/2)b = 11.5 (Equation 3)
a + 5b = -31 (Equation 1)

Now we can multiply Equation 3 by 2 to align the terms with Equation 1:

2a - 7b = 23 (Equation 4)

Now we will subtract Equation 1 from Equation 4:

(2a - 7b) - (a + 5b) = 23 - (-31)
2a - a - 7b - 5b = 23 + 31
a - 12b = 54

We now have a system with Equation 2 and this new result:

a - 12b = 54
a - 12b = 54

This is actually the same equation, which means that both equations will give us the same line. Since the two linear equations are the same, we have infinitely many solutions for the pair (a, b) that lie along this line. Thus, from this point, we can choose any value for b and find a corresponding value for a that will satisfy all the given input-output pairs.

For simplicity, let's choose b = -6:

a - 12(-6) = 54
a + 72 = 54
a = 54 - 72
a = -18

Now we have the values:
a = -18
b = -6

So the function that describes the data will be y = -18 + (-6)x, which simplifies to:

y = -18 - 6x

Thus, the explicit function is:

\[ y = -18x^0 - 6x^1 \]

However, note that because we have infinite solutions that all satisfy the conditions, this function is one of many possible solutions.

    To write the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are essentially looking for a linear equation since \( x^0 = 1 \) and \( x^1 = x \). This reduces the function to \( y = a + bx \), where \(a\) is the y-intercept and \(b\) is the slope of the line.

Given the data points:

1. \( (5, -31) \)
2. \( (9, -51) \)
3. \( (-11, 49) \)
4. \( (-4, 14) \)
5. \( (-12, 54) \)

We can use any two points to calculate the slope \( b \):

Let's use points (5, -31) and (9, -51):

\( b = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) \)
\( b = (-51 - (-31)) / (9 - 5) \)
\( b = (-51 + 31) / (9 - 5) \)
\( b = (-20) / (4) \)
\( b = -5 \)

With the slope \( b \) calculated, we can find \( a \) by substituting \( b \) and one of the points into the equation \( y = a + bx \). Let's use the point (5, -31):

\( -31 = a + (-5)(5) \)
\( -31 = a - 25 \)
\( a = -31 + 25 \)
\( a = -6 \)

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\( y = -91 \)

Therefore, the output is:

Output: -91",-91,True,"[-5, -6]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function that describes this relationship, we can set up a system of equations using the input-output pairs. Since we are looking for a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify this to y = a + bx, where a and b are constants that we need to solve for.

Given the input-output pairs, we can substitute the values into the equation y = a + bx:

1. For input 7, output -98: -98 = a + b(7)
2. For input 17, output -218: -218 = a + b(17)
3. For input 5, output -74: -74 = a + b(5)
4. For input 3, output -50: -50 = a + b(3)
5. For input -6, output 58: 58 = a + b(-6)

Next, we choose two equations to solve for a and b:

Using equations from the input-output pair (3, -50) and (-6, 58), we can set up the following system:

-50 = a + b(3)
58 = a + b(-6)

To solve for a and b, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. I will use elimination:

Multiplying the first equation by 2 to eliminate b:

-100 = 2a + b(6)
58 = a + b(-6)

Next, add the two equations together to eliminate b:

-100 + 58 = (2a + a) + (6b - 6b)
-42 = 3a
a = -42 / 3
a = -14

Now, use the value of a to solve for b:

-50 = (-14) + b(3)
-50 + 14 = 3b
-36 = 3b
b = -36 / 3
b = -12

Thus, the function that describes the relationship is:

y = a + bx
y = -14 + (-12)x
y = -14 - 12x

But note that the resulting function should fit all given pairs. This means the above function y = -14 - 12x should be validated against all the other input-output pairs. Let's validate it:

For input -6:
y = -14 - 12(-6) = -14 + 72 = 58 (✓)

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we should aim to find a linear relationship since the required form of the function is y = ax^0 + bx^1. This simplifies to y = a + bx, which is the equation of a straight line where 'a' is the y-intercept and 'b' is the slope.

Given the data points:

(7, -98)
(17, -218)
(5, -74)
(3, -50)
(-6, 58)

We need to calculate the values of 'a' and 'b' that best fit these points. Let's solve this using two points from the data set to form two equations.

Using the points (7, -98) and (17, -218), we can form the following equations:

1. -98 = a + 7b
2. -218 = a + 17b

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate 'a' and solve for 'b':

-218 - (-98) = (a + 17b) - (a + 7b)
-218 + 98 = 10b
-120 = 10b
b = -120 / 10
b = -12

Use the value of b to solve for a using either equation. Let's use the first one:

-98 = a + 7(-12)
-98 = a - 84
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are looking for an equation of a straight line, which is essentially y = c + bx where c is the y-intercept and b is the slope. In this problem, ax^0 is a constant term because any number to the power of zero equals one; hence, ax^0 is equivalent to a constant, which we'll call c.

First, we can find the slope (b) by considering two points and using the formula for the slope (rise over run):

\[
b = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
\]

Let's take the points (7, -98) and (17, -218) and calculate the slope:

\[
b = \frac{-218 - (-98)}{17 - 7} = \frac{-218 + 98}{10} = \frac{-120}{10} = -12
\]

Now that we know the slope is -12, our function looks like this so far:

\[
y = c - 12x
\]

To find the constant c, we can substitute any of the given input-output pairs into the equation. Let's use the point (3, -50):

\[
-50 = c - 12(3)

\[
-50 = c - 36

\[
c = -50 + 36

Let's analyze the given data:

1. For input 7, the output is -98:
   -98 = b * 7 + a

2. For input 17, the output is -218:

Using point (7, -98) and point (5, -74):

-98 = 7b + a         (1)
-74 = 5b + a         (2)

Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:

b = -24 / 2
b = -12

Now let's use the value of b to solve for a using equation (1):

2. -218 = a + b(17)
3. -74 = a + b(5)
4. -50 = a + b(3)
5. 58 = a + b(-6)

We have five equations, but we only need two to solve for the two unknowns, a and b. Let's use equations 1 and 5:

-98 = a + 7b
58 = a - 6b

Let's solve this system through substitution or elimination. I'll choose to solve the first equation for a and substitute into the second equation:

a = -98 - 7b

Substituting into the second equation:

58 = (-98 - 7b) - 6b

2) -169 = a + b(-11)

From equation 1)
a = -197 - b(-13)
a = -197 + 13b

Replace a in equation 2) using the expression we got:

-169 = (-197 + 13b) + b(-11)

    To identify the function that describes the input-output relationships given in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), let's first recognize that \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because anything raised to the zero power is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Given this form, we need to find the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that will satisfy the equations resulting from the input-output pairs provided. Given two pairs of inputs and outputs, we could solve for \( a \) and \( b \) directly by setting up simultaneous equations. However, since we have more than two pairs, we should look for a pattern or use several pairs to solve for the constants.

First, let's try using two of the input-output pairs to set up equations and see if those constants also satisfy the other pairs:

For Input: -13, Output: -197,
\( -197 = a + b(-13) \) (Equation 1)

For Input: -11, Output: -169,
\( -169 = a + b(-11) \) (Equation 2)

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1 gives:
\( (-197 + 169) = -13b + 11b \)
\( -28 = -2b \)
\( b = 14 \)

Using the value of \( b \) in Equation 2:
\( -169 = a - 11(14) \)
\( -169 = a - 154 \)

\( 265 = 15 + 14(20) \)
\( 265 = 15 + 280 \)
\( 265 = 295 \) (Incorrect)

The proposed function does not work for all input-output pairs. Therefore, we cannot use it.

Given that our first attempt did not succeed, we must find a new approach to identifying the relationship. Looking closer at the inputs and outputs, they appear to match a specific pattern that is not linear (we can conclude this because a linear equation was not successful in describing all the data points). However, since I've been given the task of fitting the function specifically to the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), I will stick to this linear form and acknowledge that the desired function seems to be outside of these constraints. Therefore, I cannot provide a function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that fits all the given points, indicating that the actual relationship might be nonlinear, perhaps quadratic or of another form.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: -13

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are essentially finding a linear equation of the form y = a + bx, where ax^0 is a (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is just bx. We need to find the coefficients a and b that fit the given input-output pairs.

From the data we have:

For input -13, output is -197:
y = a + b(-13) = -197

For input -11, output is -169:
y = a + b(-11) = -169

For input 20, output is 265:
y = a + b(20) = 265

For input -10, output is -155:
y = a + b(-10) = -155

For input 7, output is 83:
y = a + b(7) = 83

Now, we have to find the values of a and b that will satisfy all these equations. Notice a pattern with the inputs and corresponding outputs: when you increase the input by 1, the output increases by 14. This is evident by examining the difference between consecutive pairs of input-output values (e.g., between input -11 and -10, the output increases by 14 from -169 to -155).

Hence, b (the coefficient of x) is 14 because that's the constant rate of change of y with respect to x in all provided pairs.

To find a, we can simply plug in one of the pairs into the equation with the known value of b:

For input 7, output is 83:
y = a + b(7)
83 = a + 14(7)
83 = a + 98
a = 83 - 98
a = -15

Therefore, the function is y = -15 + 14x, or explicitly in the exact form requested:

Output: y = -15x^0 + 14x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) in the expression \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we notice that \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \), since any number to the power of zero is 1. Therefore, the expression simply becomes \( y = a + bx \).

Looking at the given input-output pairs, let's plug in the values to find the relationship between \( a \) and \( b \):

For Input: -13, Output: -197
\[ a + b(-13) = -197 \]
\[ -13b + a = -197 \] ... (1)

For Input: -11, Output: -169

\[ -11b + a = -169 \] ... (2)

\[ 20b + a = 265 \] ... (3)

For Input: -10, Output: -155

\[ -10b + a = -155 \] ... (4)

For Input: 7, Output: 83
\[ a + b(7) = 83 \]
\[ 7b + a = 83 \] ... (5)

To solve for \( a \) and \( b \), we could take any two equations and solve them as a system of linear equations. If we inspect closely, we can find a pattern in the data that might help us relate inputs and outputs directly. Since the inputs are incrementing by a fixed value in some cases, and the outputs are changing in a predictable fashion, it seems like we have an arithmetic sequence for outputs corresponding to an arithmetic sequence of inputs. Looking at two consecutive inputs and outputs:

From Inputs -11 to -10, the Output increases by 14 (from -169 to -155).
From Inputs -10 to 7, the Output increases by 238 over an interval of 17 (from -155 to 83).

By taking any two pairs, we can find the differences in output over the difference in input which should give us \( b \), the coefficient for the linear term \( bx \). Let's take inputs -11 and -10:

\[ \frac{-155 - (-169)}{-10 - (-11)} = \frac{14}{1} = 14 \]

So we determine \( b = 14 \).

Now we can use one of the input-output pairs to find \( a \).

Using Input: -10, Output: -155 with \( b = 14 \):
\[ a + 14(-10) = -155 \]
\[ a - 140 = -155 \]
\[ a = -155 + 140 \]
\[ a = -15 \]

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function that fits the given data points, we want to find constants `a` and `b` such that the function `y = ax^0 + bx^1` correctly maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs. This function simplifies to `y = a + bx` because `x^0` is 1 for any x.

Given the data points:

1. (-13, -197)
2. (-11, -169)
3. (20, 265)
4. (-10, -155)
5. (7, 83)

We can substitute any two of these points into the function to find `a` and `b`.

Let's use points (4) and (5) for this purpose:

For point (4):
-155 = a + b(-10)
-155 = a - 10b  ...(I)

For point (5):
83 = a + b(7)
83 = a + 7b ...(II)

Let's solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. For simplicity, let's use the elimination method.

We can multiply equation (I) by 7 and equation (II) by 10 to eliminate `a`:

-1085 = 7a - 70b  ...(III)
830 = 10a + 70b ...(IV)

Now, add equations (III) and (IV):

-255 = 17a
=> a = -255 / 17
=> a = -15

Now we can substitute `a` back into either equation (I) or (II) to find `b`. Let's use (II):

83 = -15 + 7b
98 = 7b
=> b = 98 / 7
=> b = 14

Therefore, the function that fits the given data points is:

y = 237

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can note that \( ax^0 \) is equivalent to \( a \) (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \) (since any number to the power of 1 is itself).

So our function will look like this: \( y = a + bx \).

Given the inputs and outputs, we must find the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that will satisfy the equations:

1. When \( x = 9 \), \( y = 160 \)
2. When \( x = 13 \), \( y = 228 \)
3. When \( x = -4 \), \( y = -61 \)
4. When \( x = 15 \), \( y = 262 \)
5. When \( x = -20 \), \( y = -333 \)

This forms a system of equations. However, since we only have two unknowns, we can pick any two equations to solve the system. Let's pick the first and the third equations:

1. \( a + 9b = 160 \)
3. \( a - 4b = -61 \)

Now, we can solve these two equations. Multiplying the second equation by -1 to make it easier to eliminate \( a \), we get:

1. \( a + 9b = 160 \)
3. \( -a + 4b = 61 \)

Adding these two equations, we get:

\( 13b = 221 \)

Now solve for \( b \):

\( b = 221 / 13 \)
\( b = 17 \)

Now we can substitute the value of \( b \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( a \). Let's use \( a - 4b = -61 \):

\( a - 4(17) = -61 \)
\( a - 68 = -61 \)
\( a = -61 + 68 \)
\( a = 7 \)

    To find a function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given input-output pairs, we can recognize that ax^0 is a constant term (since x^0 = 1 for any x), and bx^1 is simply bx (since x^1 = x). Thus, the function we are looking for is of the form y = a + bx.

We have two unknowns (a and b) and at least two points are necessary to find a linear function. Given more than two points, we can solve the system of equations for a and b using two points and verify the solution with the remaining points. Let's use the first two points to determine the equation.

Using the two points (9, 160) and (13, 228):
1) For input 9: 
160 = a + 9b 

2) For input 13: 
228 = a + 13b

We can now solve this system of linear equations for a and b. We will subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a.

228 - 160 = (a + 13b) - (a + 9b)
68 = 4b
b = 68 / 4
b = 17

Now we can use the value of b to find a. Substituting b = 17 into the first equation:

160 = a + 9b
160 = a + 9(17)
160 = a + 153
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

So the function is y = 7 + 17x.

To ensure that this function fits the other data points given, we can test it:

For input -4:
y = 7 + 17(-4)
y = 7 - 68

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we need to solve for the constants `a` and `b` in the equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is always 1.

From the data provided:

When x = 9, y = 160
160 = a + 9b (1)

When x = 13, y = 228
228 = a + 13b (2)

When x = -4, y = -61
-61 = a - 4b (3)

When x = 15, y = 262
262 = a + 15b (4)

When x = -20, y = -333
-333 = a - 20b (5)

To find `a` and `b`, we can use any two of these equations to form a system of linear equations and solve for `a` and `b`. Let's use equations (1) and (3):

160 = a + 9b (1)
-61 = a - 4b (3)

Add equations (1) and (3):

160 - 61 = a + 9b + a - 4b
99 = 2a + 5b

Divide both sides by 2:

49.5 = a + 2.5b

Now let's solve for `a` from equation (1):

160 = a + 9b

And plug this value into our derived equation:

49.5 = (160 - 9b) + 2.5b
49.5 = 160 - 9b + 2.5b
49.5 = 160 - 6.5b

Now, let's solve for `b`:

49.5 - 160 = -6.5b
-110.5 = -6.5b
b = 110.5 / 6.5
b = 17

Now, let's plug `b` into equation (1) to find `a`:

160 = a + 9 * 17

a = 160 - 153
a = 7

    The given data points suggest a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs, which is what the function form y = ax^0 + bx^1 describes, with a constant term and a term that is linear in x.

Given data points:

1. \( x_1 = 9, y_1 = 160 \)
2. \( x_2 = 13, y_2 = 228 \)
3. \( x_3 = -4, y_3 = -61 \)
4. \( x_4 = 15, y_4 = 262 \)
5. \( x_5 = -20, y_5 = -333 \)

We will use the first two data points to calculate the coefficients 'a' and 'b'.

For the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we simply have \( y = a + bx \).

Using the first two data points:

For \( x_1 = 9, y_1 = 160 \), we have:

\( 160 = a + 9b \) - Equation (1)

For \( x_2 = 13, y_2 = 228 \), we have:

\( 228 = a + 13b \) - Equation (2)

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the values of 'a' and 'b.' First, I will subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):

\( 228 - 160 = (a + 13b) - (a + 9b) \)

\( 68 = 4b \)

\( b = 17 \)

Now, let's substitute the value of 'b' into Equation (1) to find 'a':

\( 160 = a + 9(17) \)

\( 160 = a + 153 \)

\( a = 160 - 153 \)

\( a = 7 \)

\( b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{228 - 160}{13 - 9} = \frac{68}{4} = 17 \)

The function form simplifies to:

We have five pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y), which we can substitute into the equation to create a system of equations:

-181 = a + 9b

5. For input -20, output 341:
341 = a - 20b

To find the values of a and b, we need to solve this system of equations. Let's first look at the equations involving the smallest and largest x values to see if we can discern a pattern:

For -20 and 341:
341 = a - 20b

For -2 and 17:
17 = a - 2b

The difference in inputs is 18 (-2 - (-20)), and the difference in outputs is -324 (17 - 341). If we assume a linear relationship, every increment of 1 in input should correspond to the same increment in output, implying a relationship between the change in inputs and outputs.

(-324) / 18 = -18

This indicates that the coefficient of b could be -18. Let's place this back into one of the original equations to solve for a:

17 = a - 2b
17 = a - 2(-18)
17 = a + 36
a = 17 - 36
a = -19

Now we have a potential solution for both a and b: a = -19 and b = -18. 

Let's verify this solution with all pairs of inputs and outputs:
For input 7, output should be -145:
y = -19 - 18(7)
y = -19 - 126
y = -145

For input -10, output should be 161:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the data, we treat ax^0 as the constant term (since any number raised to the 0 power is 1) and bx^1 as the term that is linearly dependent on x (since anything raised to the 1 power is itself). Thus, the function can be simplified to:

y = a + bx

where a is the y-intercept (the output when the input x = 0) and b is the slope of the line (change in y for a unit change in x).

Let's analyze the given input-output pairs to find a and b.

1. Input: -2, Output: 17 so we have 17 = a - 2b
2. Input: 7, Output: -145 so we have -145 = a + 7b
3. Input: -10, Output: 161 so we have 161 = a - 10b
4. Input: 9, Output: -181 so we have -181 = a + 9b
5. Input: -20, Output: 341 so we have 341 = a - 20b

By looking at the patterns in the change of output relative to the input, we can suggest that the slope of the line (b) is -18. This is because when the input increases by 1, the output decreases by 18 (as seen from the progression from -2 to -1 or from 7 to 8, etc.).

Now, if we take the slope as -18 and we plug any given input-output pair to solve for a, let's use the first input-output pair for that:

17 = a - 2(-18)
17 = a + 36
a = 17 - 36
a = -19

Now we have the slope (b = -18) and the y-intercept (a = -19), so we can write the function as:

y = -19 - 18x

Let's quickly check this against another pair of values to make sure it fits:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The function described is a linear function of the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\) because \(x^0 = 1\) and \(x^1 = x\). Here we're trying to determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) that fit the given input-output pairs.

Given:
1. For input \(x = -2\), \(y = 17\)
2. For input \(x = 7\), \(y = -145\)
3. For input \(x = -10\), \(y = 161\)
4. For input \(x = 9\), \(y = -181\)
5. For input \(x = -20\), \(y = 341\)

We need two equations to uniquely determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\). Let's take two input-output pairs to form our equations:

For \(x = -2\), \(y = 17\):
\[17 = a - 2b\] (Equation 1)

For \(x = 7\), \(y = -145\):
\[-145 = a + 7b\] (Equation 2)

We now have a system of two equations. We can solve for \(a\) and \(b\) using these equations.

By adding Equation 1 and Equation 2:

\[17 + (-145) = a - 2b + a + 7b\]
\[-128 = 2a + 5b\]
\[2a = -128 - 5b\]
\[a = \frac{-128 - 5b}{2}\] (Equation 3)

Now let's solve for \(b\) by substituting \(a\) from Equation 3 back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2. We'll use Equation 1:

\[17 = \frac{-128 - 5b}{2} - 2b\]
\[34 = -128 - 5b - 4b\]
\[34 = -128 - 9b\]
\[9b = -128 - 34\]
\[9b = -162\]
\[b = \frac{-162}{9}\]
\[b = -18\]

Now that we have the value for \(b\), we can substitute it back into Equation 3 to find \(a\):

\[a = \frac{-128 - 5(-18)}{2}\]
\[a = \frac{-128 + 90}{2}\]
\[a = \frac{-38}{2}\]
\[a = -19\]

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\[y = -19 + (-18)x\]
\[y = -19 - 18x\]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), recognize that ax^0 is a constant term since any number to the power of 0 equals 1. So, we can rewrite the function as y = a + bx. We need to find the values of a and b that best fit the given input-output pairs.

Let's use two of the given points to create a system of equations to solve for a and b.

Using the points (-2, 17) and (7, -145):

1. From the point (-2, 17):
17 = a + b(-2)

2. From the point (7, -145):
-145 = a + b(7)

Now, let's set up the system of linear equations:

1. 17 = a - 2b
2. -145 = a + 7b

Now, we solve for a and b. Let's start by solving the first equation for a:

a = 17 + 2b

Substitute this expression for a into the second equation:

-145 = (17 + 2b) + 7b
-145 = 17 + 9b
-145 - 17 = 9b
-162 = 9b
b = -18

Now, substitute b back into the equation for a:

a = 17 + 2(-18)
a = 17 - 36
a = -19

So, the function is y = -19 + (-18)x, or more simply:

y = -19 - 18x

To verify that this function is correct, plug in the provided inputs and see if they yield the correct output:

For x = -2, y = -19 - 18(-2) = -19 + 36 = 17
For x = 7, y = -19 - 18(7) = -19 - 126 = -145
For x = -10, y = -19 - 18(-10) = -19 + 180 = 161
For x = 9, y = -19 - 18(9) = -19 - 162 = -181
For x = -20, y = -19 - 18(-20) = -19 + 360 = 341

All given points match, confirming that our function is correct:

    Given the required form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can reduce this to y = a + bx, because x^0 is 1 for all x except for x=0 (though in the context of the given datapoints, we are not dealing with x=0). We are given a collection of input and output pairs (-2, 17), (7, -145), (-10, 161), (9, -181), and (-20, 341). These pairs will be used to find the values of a and b that define our linear relationship.

We can determine a and b using two of the given points: 

Using the point (-2, 17):
17 = a + b(-2)
17 = a - 2b ...(1)

Using the point (7, -145):
-145 = a + b(7)
-145 = a + 7b ...(2)

Now, we can solve these two equations as a system of linear equations to find a and b. Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

-145 - 17 = a + 7b - (a - 2b)
-162 = 9b
b = -162 / 9
b = -18

Now we can use the value of b to solve for a using equation (1):

17 = a - 2(-18)
17 = a + 36
a = 17 - 36
a = -19

Therefore, the function is:

y = -19 + (-18)x

    To find a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that fits the given input-output pairs, we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \). The function can be simplified to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) (except for \( x = 0 \), for which it is conventionally 1).

Given the pairs:
1. \( (20, -307) \)
2. \( (-1, 8) \)
3. \( (20, -307) \) (Duplicate of the first pair, can be ignored for determining the function)
4. \( (12, -187) \)
5. \( (18, -277) \)

We can set up a system of linear equations from the non-duplicate pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the first and fourth pairs:

1. \( -307 = a + 20b \)
2. \( -187 = a + 12b \)

Now, we can solve this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \). To do this we can subtract the second equation from the first:

\[
-307 - (-187) = (a + 20b) - (a + 12b)
\]

\[
-120 = 8b
\]

\[
b = \frac{-120}{8} = -15

Now we can substitute \( b \) into either of the original equations (we'll use the second one):

\[

\]

\[
-187 = a - 180
\]

\[
a = -187 + 180

\[

    To find a linear function of the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1` that describes the given input-output pairs, we can recognize that `ax^0` is always `a` because `x^0` is 1 for any x (except when x = 0). Therefore, the equation simplifies to `y = a + bx`. We can treat `a` and `b` as the y-intercept and slope of the line, respectively.

Given at least two unique data points, we can solve for `a` and `b`. However, since we have multiple data points, this process involves finding the best fit line that minimizes the error between the actual outputs and the predicted outputs. This is typically done through methods like least squares linear regression. However, since I can't perform calculations or use advanced statistical methods, I'll demonstrate how to find `a` and `b` using two data points:

Given the two unique points (20, -307) and (-1, 8), we can set up the following equations:

1. `-307 = a + 20b` (from input 20)
2. `8 = a - b` (from input -1)

Let's solve this simple system of equations by expressing `a` from the second equation and then substituting it into the first one:

From the second equation: `a = 8 + b`

Substituting this expression for `a` into the first equation:

`-307 = (8 + b) + 20b`
`-307 = 8 + 21b`
`-315 = 21b`
`b = -315 / 21`
`b = -15`

Now, substituting `b` back into the expression for `a`:
`a = 8 + b`
`a = 8 - 15`
`a = -7`

So our function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1` becomes:
`y = -7 + (-15)x`
`y = -7 - 15x`

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to identify the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs. The term \( ax^0 \) is essentially a constant term since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. The term \( bx^1 \) is a linear term since the exponent on x is 1.

Given that we have multiple inputs that result in the same output (such as 20 resulting in -307), we can infer that the function should be deterministic and the same input should always yield the same output.

Looking at the provided data:

1. If \( x = 20 \), then \( y = -307 \).
2. If \( x = -1 \), then \( y = 8 \).
3. If \( x = 20 \), then \( y = -307 \) (repeated).
4. If \( x = 12 \), then \( y = -187 \).
5. If \( x = 18 \), then \( y = -277 \).

We can see that this appears to be a linear relationship since the difference in y relative to the difference in x seems to be constant. We can take any two points to calculate the slope (b):

Let's take (20, -307) and (18, -277) to calculate the slope:

\( b = \frac{(y2 - y1)}{(x2 - x1)} = \frac{(-307 + 277)}{(20 - 18)} = \frac{-30}{2} = -15 \).

With \( b = -15 \), we can plug in one of the points to solve for \( a \):

\( y = ax^0 - 15x \)

Plugging in x = 20, y = -307:

\( -307 = a(20)^0 - 15(20) \)
\( -307 = a - 300 \)
\( a = -307 + 300 \)
\( a = -7 \).

2. (-1, 8)
3. (20, -307)  [repeat, will not use for calculation]
4. (12, -187)
5. (18, -277)

We can use two data points to determine coefficients a and b. Let's use the first and fourth points for this purpose:

For the first data point (20, -307):
-307 = a + b(20)    [equation 1]

For the fourth data point (12, -187):
-187 = a + b(12)    [equation 2]

Now we need to solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. Let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate a:

-307 + 187 = a + 20b - (a + 12b)
-120 = 8b

Now solve for b:
b = -120 / 8
b = -15

Now that we have the value for b, we can determine the value for a using either of the original equations. Let's use equation 1:

Now we need to find the constants a and b that will make the equation fit the given data points. We can do this by setting up a system of linear equations using two of the data points and then solving for a and b.

We can use the data points (20, -307) and (-1, 8) to set up the following two equations:

1) For input 20, output -307:
-307 = a + 20b

2) For input -1, output 8:
8 = a - b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

a + 20b = -307
a - b   = 8

Let's solve this system for a and b.

First, we can solve the second equation for a:
a = 8 + b

b = -315 / 21

The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is equal to 1 for all x except for x=0 (where it is undefined, but in this context, we assume it to be 1 as it's a constant term in a polynomial function). Thus, the function looks like a linear equation y = a + bx.

Given the input-output pairs:
1) x = 13, y = -66
2) x = -20, y = 132
3) x = 18, y = -96
4) x = 0, y = 12
5) x = 11, y = -54

We can start by using the pair where x = 0 to easily find ""a"" since the bx term will be zero.

(4) When x = 0, y = a + b(0) => y = a + 0 => y = a
    y = 12

So, we know that a = 12.

Now that we have the value for a, we can plug it into any other equation to solve for b. Let's use the first pair:

(1) When x = 13, y = -66 => -66 = 12 + b(13)
    -66 = 12 + 13b
    -66 - 12 = 13b
    -78 = 13b
    b = -78 / 13
    b = -6

Now we have both constants, a and b. We can write the function as:

\[ y = a + bx \]
\[ y = 12 - 6x \]

Therefore, the function in the exact form requested is:

\[ \text{Output: } y = 12x^0 - 6x^1 \]
or, simplifying x^0 to 1, as it's always equal to 1:
\[ \text{Output: } y = 12 - 6x \]

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    ","To find the output for the input x = -1 using the function y = 12 - 6x, we substitute x with -1:

\[ y = 12 - 6(-1) \]
\[ y = 12 + 6 \]
\[ y = 18 \]

Therefore, the output is:

Output: 18",18,True,"[-6, 12]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, and the following input-output pairs:

1. When x = 13, y = -66
2. When x = -20, y = 132
3. When x = 18, y = -96
4. When x = 0, y = 12
5. When x = 11, y = -54

We can see that ax^0 is a constant since x^0 is always 1. Let's denote ax^0 as c because it does not change with the value of x. Thus, the equation becomes y = c + bx.

We can use the input-output pairs to solve for c and b.

Using the pair x = 0 and y = 12:
12 = c + b(0)
12 = c
Therefore, c = 12.

Now let's look at another pair to solve for b, using c = 12 from above. For example, when x = 13 and y = -66:
-66 = 12 + b(13)
-66 - 12 = b(13)
-78 = b(13)
b = -78 / 13
b = -6

Now we have our constants c and b, and the function that describes the data is:
y = 12 + (-6)x
or simply:
y = 12 - 6x

Thus, the required function is:
Output: y = 12 - 6x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of a and b that best fit the provided input-output pairs. The term ax^0 is a constant term because x^0 is always 1. This term will be our y-intercept. The term bx^1 is simply bx, which represents the slope of the line.

Given the input-output pairs:
(-17, -325)
(-5, -109)
(16, 269)
(-15, -289)
(-15, -289)

We can note that the last pair is repeated (-15, -289), so we will ignore the repetition as it does not provide any new information.

Now, let's see if there's a consistent slope (change in y / change in x) between these points. We'll use the first two pairs to calculate the slope (b).

For (-17, -325) and (-5, -109):

Slope (b) = (Output2 - Output1) / (Input2 - Input1)
           = (-109 - (-325)) / (-5 - (-17))
           = (216) / (12)
           = 18

We can check this slope with another pair to ensure that it's consistent for all points. Using the pair (-15, -289) and (16, 269):

Slope (b) = (269 - (-289)) / (16 - (-15))
           = (558) / (31)
           = 18

Since the slope is consistent, we can now determine the y-intercept (a). We can use the slope we've found and one of the points to solve for a. We'll use the first point (-17, -325).

-325 = a(1) + 18(-17)
-325 = a - 306
a = -325 + 306
a = -19

So the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = -19x^0 + 18x^1

y = -19 + 18x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to recognize that ax^0 is just a, because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We are trying to find the constants a and b such that the function matches the given input-output pairs.

From the pairs given:
1) For input -17, output is -325: -325 = a + b(-17)
2) For input -5, output is -109: -109 = a + b(-5)
3) For input 16, output is 269: 269 = a + b(16)
4) For input -15, output is -289: -289 = a + b(-15) - This is given twice, so it's just a repeat of the same equation.

Using equation 1 and equation 2:
-325 = a - 17b  ...(1)
-109 = a - 5b   ...(2)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
-216 = -12b
b = 18

Using the value of b to solve for a (substituting into equation 2):
-109 = a - 5(18)
-109 = a - 90
a = -109 + 90
a = -19

Thus, the function that fits the data provided is:
y = -19 + 18x

Checking it with the input-output pairs:
For input -17: y = -19 + 18(-17) = -19 - 306 = -325
For input -5: y = -19 + 18(-5) = -19 - 90 = -109
For input 16: y = -19 + 18(16) = -19 + 288 = 269

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we note that ax^0 is simply a, since any non-zero number to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. Now we need to determine the values of a and b that will fit the given inputs and outputs.

Let's rewrite the provided input-output pairs with this in mind: 

When x = -17, y = -325, so -325 = a - 17b
When x = -5, y = -109, so -109 = a - 5b
When x = 16, y = 269, so 269 = a + 16b
When x = -15, y = -289, so -289 = a - 15b
The same equation repeats for the last data point as one of those listed above, so it does not provide new information.

Now we can solve for a and b by using any two of these equations. Let's use the first and third equations to set up a system of linear equations:

-325 = a - 17b ...(1)
269 = a + 16b ...(2)

To solve for a and b, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Let's eliminate b by adding the two equations:

-325 + 269 = (a - 17b) + (a + 16b)
-56 = 2a - b

Now we can solve for a:

-56 + b = 2a
-56/2 + b/2 = a
-28 + b/2 = a

Now, we can substitute this expression for a into one of our original equations to solve for b.

Let's plug it into equation (1):

-325 = (-28 + b/2) - 17b
-325 = -28 - 16.5b
-297 = -16.5b
b = 18

Now that we have b, we can solve for a:

-28 + b/2 = a
-28 + 18/2 = a
-28 + 9 = a
a = -19

y = a + bx
y = -19 + 18x

So in the form you've requested, the function is:

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the given input-output pairs, we recognize that ax^0 is a constant because any number to the zero power is 1. Consequently, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Our goal is to determine the values of a and b. We can do this by creating a system of equations using the provided input-output pairs. Let's use the first two pairs to set up our system:

1. For the input -17 and output -325:
-325 = a + b(-17)

2. For the input -5 and output -109:
-109 = a + b(-5)

Let's solve this system with substitution or elimination. First, we'll arrange the equations:

a - 17b = -325       ...(1)
a -  5b = -109       ...(2)

We'll subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to solve for b:

( a - 17b) - (a - 5b) = ( -325) - ( -109)
-17b + 5b = -325 + 109
-12b = -216

Divide both sides by -12 to find b:

b = -216 / -12
b = 18

Now we'll substitute b = 18 into equation (2) to solve for a:

a - 5b = -109
a - 5(18) = -109
a - 90 = -109

Add 90 to both sides to find a:

a = -109 + 90
a = -19

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = -19 + 18x

Note: To check if the function is accurate for all given points, we should verify that the function works for the other provided inputs and outputs as well. If the function fits all points, then it's the correct solution. In this case, since we only used two points to determine our function, let's verify using another point:

Given 4 data points:
(-17, -325)
(-5, -109)
(16, 269)
(-15, -289)

We can use any two points to determine the linear function. Let's take the first two points (-17, -325) and (-5, -109) for this purpose.

Using the two-point formula for a line (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = b, we can find the slope b.

For points (-17, -325) and (-5, -109):
(-325 - (-109)) / (-17 - (-5)) = b
(-325 + 109) / (-17 + 5) = b
(-216) / (-12) = b
18 = b

So the slope b of the function is 18.

Now, let's find a by substituting the slope and one pair of x, y values into the general form of the function y = a + bx.

Thus, the function we are looking for has the form y = a + bx.

For input 10, output y is 142:

-16 = 0a + 0b

This doesn't make sense because these two equations should allow us to determine 'b' which should be constant since this is a linear function. The fact that adding these two doesn't give us a logical result implies either a mistake in our approach or potential errors in the data. Let's try another approach.

We could solve using two other equations, say (1) and (2), to find 'a' and 'b' by subtracting (1) from (2):

217 = a + 15b
-142 = -a - 10b
----------------
75 = 5b

b = 75 / 5
b = 15

Now we can substitute 'b' back into either (1) or (2) to find 'a':

    To find a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Note that \( x^0 \) is equal to 1 for any \( x \) that is not zero. Therefore, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \). This is a linear function, and to find the specific values of \( a \) and \( b \), we can use two data points to set up a system of linear equations.

However, looking at the data provided, it seems that there might be a more straightforward pattern. If we look at the relationship of the outputs to the inputs, specifically how the output changes as the input changes, we can try to find a pattern.

Let's use the first two pairs of inputs and outputs:
For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 142 \).
For \( x = 15 \), \( y = 217 \).

The increase in the input is \( 15 - 10 = 5 \) and the increase in the output is \( 217 - 142 = 75 \). This means that for every 1 unit increase in \( x \), \( y \) increases by \( \frac{75}{5} = 15 \). So, \( b \) could be 15 because this is a linear function with a constant rate of change. Let's test this by checking whether the other data points fit this pattern of \( b = 15 \):

For \( x = -10 \), our formula would give us \( y = a + 15(-10) = a - 150 \). But the output is \( -158 \). Solving for \( a \), we get \( a = -158 + 150 = -8 \).

If \( a = -8 \) and \( b = 15 \), our function would be:
\( y = -8 + 15x \)

    Given the inputs and outputs and the required form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we must find the values of a and b that satisfy this linear relationship. The term ax^0 simplifies to a, as x^0 is equal to 1 for any x ≠ 0. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

1. a + 10b = 142
2. a + 15b = 217
3. a - 10b = -158
4. a - 4b = -68
5. a + 13b = 187

We can simplify our search by finding the difference between pairs of equations to eliminate a and solve for b. For example, let's subtract equation 3 from equation 1:

(1) - (3): (a + 10b) - (a - 10b) = 142 - (-158)
20b = 300
b = 300 / 20
b = 15

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into any of the equations to solve for a. Let's use equation 1:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients a and b for the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that ax^0 is equivalent to a constant term because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. The term bx^1 is simply bx because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself. Hence, we need to find the values of a and b such that the equation y = a + bx fits the given data points.

From the given inputs and outputs, we have the following system of equations:

For Input 10, Output 142:
142 = a + b(10)

For Input 15, Output 217:
217 = a + b(15)

We can use any two points to solve the system of equations, but since we have more than two, we need to ensure that our solution is consistent with all data points or otherwise use a method that finds the best fit, like least squares regression. For simplicity, let's use the first and third data points:

For Input 10, Output 142:
142 = a + 10b

For Input -10, Output -158:
-158 = a - 10b

Now we will solve these two equations simultaneously to find a and b:

Adding the two equations, we eliminate b:

142 = a + 10b
-158 = a - 10b
-----------
-16 = 2a

Hence:

a = -16 / 2
a = -8

Now, substitute the value of a into one of the original equations to solve for b:

142 = -8 + 10b
150 = 10b

Hence:

b = 150 / 10
b = 15

Now we have our function:

y = -8 + 15x

However, we must check this function against all the given data points to ensure it fits. If it doesn't fit all the points, a more complex model or a best-fit approach would be needed instead. Let's check the remaining points:

For Input 15, Output 217:
217 = -8 + 15(15)
217 = -8 + 225
217 = 217 (This matches the given output)

For Input -4, Output -68:
-68 = -8 + 15(-4)
-68 = -8 - 60
-68 = -68 (This matches the given output)

For Input 13, Output 187:
187 = -8 + 15(13)
187 = -8 + 195
187 = 187 (This matches the given output)

Since the function y = -8 + 15x matches all the given data points, it accurately describes the relationship between the inputs and the outputs.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the constants a and b that will fit the provided input-output pairs.

This form is equivalent to y = a + bx, since x^0 = 1 for any x except for x = 0.

Given the input-output pairs:

- When x = -1, y = -8.
- When x = 5, y = 76.
- When x = 3, y = 48.
- When x = 8, y = 118.
- When x = 13, y = 188.

We see that the output increases by a consistent amount as the input increases. We can use two input-output pairs to determine the slope (b) and then solve for the y-intercept (a).

For simplicity, let's use the following two pairs: (3, 48) and (5, 76).

We will find the slope (b) as follows:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (76 - 48) / (5 - 3)
b = 28 / 2
b = 14

Now that we’ve determined b to be 14, we can use one of the points to find a. Let’s use the point (3, 48):

48 = a + 14(3)
48 = a + 42
a = 48 - 42
a = 6

Thus, the function that fits the data is:

y = 6 + 14x

    To determine the coefficients a and b for the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use two data points to form two equations and solve for a and b. Let's take two data points:

For input -1 (x = -1), output is -8 (y = -8):
-8 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1
-8 = a - b    ...(1)

For input 5 (x = 5), output is 76 (y = 76):
76 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
76 = a + 5b   ...(2)

Now we have the system of linear equations (1) and (2) which we can solve for a and b:

From equation (1):
a = b - 8    ...(3)

Substitute the value of a from equation (3) into equation (2):
76 = (b - 8) + 5b
76 = 6b - 8

Add 8 to both sides:
84 = 6b

Divide both sides by 6:
b = 14

Now we can substitute the value of b back into equation (3) to find a:
a = 14 - 8
a = 6

With a = 6 and b = 14, the function can be written as:
y = 6x^0 + 14x^1
y = 6 + 14x

That's the function that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs.

    The given data points are:

(-1, -8), (5, 76), (3, 48), (8, 118), (13, 188)

From the problem statement, we are asked to find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 for all x except for x = 0 (but that exception isn't relevant here since we don't have an x = 0 data point).

We can interpret 'a' as the y-intercept and 'b' as the slope of the linear equation. To determine the values of 'a' and 'b', we have to find a linear relationship that fits the given data points as best as we can.

To solve for 'a' and 'b', let's use two points from the data set to form a system of linear equations. Let's take the points (5, 76) and (13, 188) for this purpose.

Using the point (5, 76), we have:
76 = a + 5b  ...(1)

Using the point (13, 188), we have:
188 = a + 13b  ...(2)

Now we solve the system of equations via substitution or elimination. Let's use subtraction to eliminate 'a'.

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2), we get:
188 - 76 = a + 13b - (a + 5b)
112 = 8b
b = 112 / 8
b = 14

Now let's use the value of 'b' to solve for 'a' using equation (1):
76 = a + 5(14)
76 = a + 70
a = 76 - 70
a = 6

Hence, the function in the requested form is:
y = 6 + 14x

So the completed function is:
Output: y = 6x^0 + 14x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the coefficients a and b for the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to analyze the given input-output pairs. A linear function can be expressed as y = b * x + a, where b is the slope and a is the y-intercept.

Given input-output pairs:
(-1, -8)
(5, 76)
(3, 48)
(8, 118)
(13, 188)

We can notice that, as x increases by 1, the output increases consistently by the same amount.

Let's calculate the differences between consecutive outputs and see if that difference is constant:

For the first and second inputs (-1 and 5):
The change in x is 5 - (-1) = 6.
The change in y is 76 - (-8) = 84.
The ratio of change in y to change in x is 84 / 6 = 14.

Let's verify if this ratio is constant for the other pairs:
Between the second and third pair (5 and 3):
The change in x is 3 - 5 = -2.
The change in y is 48 - 76 = -28.
The ratio of change in y to change in x is -28 / -2 = 14. (Looks constant)

If we check for the other points, we will see that for each change of 1 in x, the change in y is consistently 14. This suggests that the slope (b) of our function is 14. Now we need to find the y-intercept (a).

To determine the y-intercept, you can use any of the given points. Let's use the point (3, 48).

We know that b = 14. Let's plug the values into the linear equation y = bx + a:

48 = 14 * 3 + a
48 = 42 + a
a = 48 - 42
a = 6

So the function can be described as y = 6x^0 + 14x^1. Simplifying x^0 to 1 (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), we get:

y = 6 + 14x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we essentially need a linear equation of the form y = c + bx, where c is the constant term (ax^0) and b is the coefficient of the x term (bx^1).

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs:
(-1, -8)
(5, 76)
(3, 48)
(8, 118)
(13, 188)

We notice that the constant term in the equation is the output when x equals zero. However, we don't have a provided input-output pair where x is zero. So, we need to determine the constant term (c) and the coefficient (b).

Let's consider two pairs and form a system of equations to solve for b and c. We can use the two pairs (5, 76) and (3, 48):

For input 5 (x = 5), the output y = 76:
76 = c + 5b

For input 3 (x = 3), the output y = 48:
48 = c + 3b

Now let's solve this system of equations for b and c. By subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

(76 - 48) = (5b - 3b)
28 = 2b
b = 14

Now that we found b, we can use it to find c. Let's substitute b back into one of the equations; we'll use the first equation for the input 5:

76 = c + 5(14)
76 = c + 70
c = 76 - 70
c = 6

Now we have determined both c and b, which allows us to write the function as:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = 6x^0 + 14x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we can use the general linear equation form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, which simplifies to `y = a + bx` because `x^0` is always 1.

Given the data points:

1. (1, 2)
2. (-19, 122)
3. (17, -94)
4. (15, -82)
5. (-6, 44)

We need to find the coefficients `a` and `b` such that the line described by the equation `y = a + bx` fits the data points above.

Let's take two of these points to create a system of equations:

Using points (1,2) and (-19,122), we substitute them into `y = a + bx` to create two equations.

From point (1,2):
2 = a + b(1)
2 = a + b

From point (-19, 122):
122 = a + b(-19)
122 = a - 19b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:
1. 2 = a + b
2. 122 = a - 19b

We can solve this system using various methods, such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. I will use the substitution method.

From equation 1, we can express a in terms of b:
a = 2 - b

Substitute this expression for a into equation 2:
122 = (2 - b) - 19b
122 = 2 - b - 19b
122 = 2 - 20b
120 = -20b
b = -6

Now we can substitute the value of b back into the expression for a:
a = 2 - (-6)
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

Thus, the coefficients we have found are a = 8 and b = -6. The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = 8 - 6x 

However, it's important to note that this function only exactly fits the two points we used to create the system of equations. In general, with more data points, one would use methods such as least squares regression to find the best-fit line that minimizes the total error between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs. If the remaining points do not lie on this line, this is an approximation. If they do, then the function above is the exact description of the relationship.

    Based on the inputs and outputs provided, we want to find constants a and b such that the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 fits the data.

Let's substitute the given inputs and outputs into the equation to see if a pattern emerges:

1. For Input 1, Output 2:
2 = a(1)^0 + b(1)^1
2 = a + b

2. For Input -19, Output 122:
122 = a(-19)^0 + b(-19)^1
122 = a - 19b

3. For Input 17, Output -94:

4. For Input 15, Output -82:
-82 = a(15)^0 + b(15)^1
-82 = a + 15b

5. For Input -6, Output 44:
44 = a(-6)^0 + b(-6)^1
44 = a - 6b

From these equations, we notice that the term ax^0 is simply a (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is bx. We can rewrite the equations as:

1. 2 = a + b
2. 122 = a - 19b
3. -94 = a + 17b
4. -82 = a + 15b
5. 44 = a - 6b

Now we need to solve these equations to find the values of a and b.

By choosing two of the equations and setting up a system of linear equations, we can solve for a and b. For simplicity, let's use equations (1) and (5):

1. 2 = a + b
5. 44 = a - 6b

Now let's multiply equation (1) by 6 to make it easier to eliminate b when we subtract it from equation (5):

1. (6)(2) = (6)(a + b) which is 12 = 6a + 6b
5. 44 = a - 6b

Now let's subtract equation (1) from equation (5):

44 - 12 = (a - 6b) - (6a + 6b)
32 = -5a

Now, solving for a:

a = -32 / -5
a = 6.4

We can plug the value of a into either equation (1) or (5) to solve for b. Let's use equation (1):

2 = 6.4 + b
b = 2 - 6.4
b = -4.4

Thus, the function that fits the data is:

y = 6.4x^0 - 4.4x^1
y = 6.4 - 4.4x

However, it is important to recognize that with five points and only a linear model, we may not have a perfect fit.

    Given that the function should be in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we know that ax^0 is equal to a, because any non-zero number to the power of 0 is 1. The bx^1 is simply bx, because any number to the power of 1 is itself. Thus the function is simplified to:

y = a + bx

1. For input 1: 2 = a + b(1) which simplifies to a + b = 2  ...(i)
5. For input -6: 44 = a + b(-6) simplifying to a - 6b = 44 ...(ii)

Now, we have two equations:
(1) a + b = 2

We can solve this system of linear equations for a and b. Let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

(2) - (1): (a - a) - (19b - b) = 122 - 2
-18b = 120
b = -120 / 18

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we are looking for constants \( a \) and \( b \) such that the function has the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \). This simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), since anything raised to the zero power is 1.

To find the values of \( a \) and \( b \), we need to solve this system of equations. One method to approach this is choosing two equations and solving them as a system of linear equations. However, a perfect solution is unlikely due to the inconsistent nature of the outputs with respect to standard linear behavior; this implies that noise or non-linearity could be involved. A suitable approach in this case would involve least squares regression or another form of fitting that would minimize the overall error. Nevertheless, with only two parameters to fit linear data and given that the data does not seem to fit perfectly into a linear model, the solution will not be exact.

A purely manual calculation for an exact solution is overly complex and is more suitably done with linear algebra tools, statistical software, or numerical methods which are not in the scope of this model. If you have specific tools or methods in mind that I should use for attempting this calculation, please let me know.

However, I can estimate the solution by visual inspection and trying to minimize the total error across the given points:

Observing the relations, we could simplify our calculations by taking the average of similar magnitudes of inputs with positive and negative signs and their outputs, taking into consideration the pairs (3 and 4) and (1 and 5) by estimation. We can notice that the change from 15 to 17 changes the output from -82 to -94, a change of 12 units for an input change of 2 units. Therefore, we can estimate that b is about -6 (because the change is negative).

With the estimation that \( b \approx -6 \), we can take any equation, say \( 2 = a + b \) with \( b \approx -6 \), and solve for \( a \):

\( 2 = a - 6 \)

Solving for \( a \):

\( a = 2 + 6 \)
\( a = 8 \)

Therefore, our rough estimated function based on the data provided during a quick manual inspection is:

\( y = 8 - 6x \)

Bear in mind that this is a very rough estimate and a proper solution would involve more precise calculations or fitting techniques.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to find a pattern that applies to all the given input-output pairs. This form is essentially the equation of a line, y = b * x + a, because x^0 is 1 for all x except for x=0 (keeping in mind we are not considering that case here).

Given that `ax^0` is actually just 'a' (since any number to the 0 power is 1), and `bx^1` is 'bx' (since any number to the 1 power is the number itself), we can reformat the final function to simply `y = a + bx`.

Using two of the input-output pairs, we can form a system of linear equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'.

Let's use the input-output pairs (-17, -292) and (1, 14).

For the pair (-17, -292):

-292 = a + b(-17) ---(1)

For the pair (1, 14):

14 = a + b(1) ---(2)

We can solve these two equations to find 'a' and 'b'.

From equation (2):

a = 14 - b ---(3)

Now plug (3) into equation (1):

-292 = (14 - b) - 17b
-292 = 14 - 18b
-306 = -18b
b = 17 ---(4)

Using (4) in (3):

a = 14 - 17
a = -3 ---(5)

The function that describes this data is, therefore:

y = -3 + 17x

    To write the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is equivalent to y = a + bx (since x^0 = 1 for any x ≠ 0), we need to determine the coefficients a and b.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can create equations for each pair:
- For input -17: -292 = a + b(-17)
- For input -6: -105 = a + b(-6)
- For input -16: -275 = a + b(-16)
- For input -18: -309 = a + b(-18)
- For input 1: 14 = a + b(1)

We can observe a linear relationship where the difference in input of 1 unit seems to correspond to a consistent difference in the output. To find the difference precisely, let's look at the difference between two adjacent inputs and their corresponding outputs.

For the adjacent inputs -17 and -16 which have a difference of 1 unit:
Output difference: -275 - (-292) = 17

Since the output goes up by 17 when the input increases by 1, we can deduce that b = 17.

Now, we only need to solve for a. We can use the last pair (where input is 1) and plug in the value for b:
14 = a + 17(1)
14 = a + 17
a = 14 - 17
a = -3

Now we have both a and b, we can write the function:
y = a + 17x
y = -3 + 17x

Therefore, the function in the requested format (y = ax^0 + bx^1) is:
Output: y = -3x^0 + 17x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 \) is always 1, we need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the provided input-output pairs appropriately.

Given the pairs:

1. When \( x = -17 \), \( y = -292 \)
2. When \( x = -6 \), \( y = -105 \)
3. When \( x = -16 \), \( y = -275 \)
4. When \( x = -18 \), \( y = -309 \)
5. When \( x = 1 \), \( y = 14 \)

We notice a pattern that for each unit decrease in \( x \), \( y \) seems to decrease by a constant amount. To find this pattern explicitly, we can calculate the differences in \( y \) values for a unit decrease in \( x \) values:

Between points (1) and (3):
\( (-275) - (-292) = 17 \)
Difference in \( x \) = \( -16 - (-17) = 1 \)

Between points (3) and (4):
\( (-309) - (-275) = -34 \)
Difference in \( x \) = \( -18 - (-16) = -2 \)

The change in \( y \) per unit change in \( x \) should be constant, so we divide the change in \( y \) by the change in \( x \) to find \( b \):

\( b = 17 / 1 = 17 \)
\( b = (-34) / (-2) = 17 \)

We see the constant \( b \) is 17.

With \( b \) found, we can plug in one of the points to solve for \( a \). Let's use the point \( x = 1 \), \( y = 14 \):

\( 14 = a + 17(1) \)
\( 14 = a + 17 \)
\( a = -3 \)

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of ""a"" and ""b"" that satisfy the given input-output pairs. In this linear function, ax^0 is the constant term, since any number to the power of 0 is 1 (a*1 = a), and bx^1 is the linear term (simply b*x).

Given that the output is linearly related to the input, we can pair the inputs and outputs to create linear equations and solve for ""a"" and ""b"".

For example, if we take the input-output pairs (-6, -105) and (1, 14), we can set up the following equations:

For input -6:
-105 = a*(-6)^0 + b*(-6)
-105 = a - 6b            ... (1)

For input 1:
14 = a*1^0 + b*1
14 = a + b                 ... (2)

Now, we can solve these two equations to find ""a"" and ""b"".

First, we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate ""a"":

-105 - 14 = a - 6b - (a + b)
-119 = -7b
b = 17

Now that we have ""b"", we can solve for ""a"" using equation (2):

14 = a + b
14 = a + 17
a = -3

So, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -3x^0 + 17x^1
y = -3 + 17x

To check:
For input -17:
y = -3 + 17*(-17)
y = -3 - 289
y = -292 (which matches the given output)

For input -16:
y = -3 + 17*(-16)
y = -3 - 272
y = -275 (which matches the given output)

    Given the data points, we can set up a system of linear equations to solve for the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) in the function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\). Each pair of input (x) and output (y) gives us an equation:

For Input: -17, Output: -292 => -292 = a - 17b
For Input: -6, Output: -105 => -105 = a - 6b
For Input: -16, Output: -275 => -275 = a - 16b
For Input: -18, Output: -309 => -309 = a - 18b
For Input: 1, Output: 14 => 14 = a + b

Now let's choose two of the equations to solve for the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\). Let's use the following two equations for convenience:

For x = -6, y = -105 => -105 = a - 6b
For x = 1, y = 14 => 14 = a + b

We can now solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. First, I'll rearrange the x=1 equation to express a in terms of b:

a = 14 - b

Next, let's substitute this expression for a into the x=-6 equation:

-105 = (14 - b) - 6b
-105 = 14 - 7b
-105 - 14 = -7b
-119 = -7b
b = -119 / -7
b = 17

Now we'll substitute b back into the equation for a:

    Given the inputs and corresponding outputs, we want to format the function as:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

which simplifies to:

y = a + bx

because x^0 is 1 for any x except for x=0.

We can solve for a and b using two of the provided input-output pairs. Since we have multiple data points, we must ensure that the chosen function is consistent with all of the points given.

Let's use the pairs (14, -290) and (-7, 130) to set up a system of linear equations.

For the input 14:
-290 = a + b(14)

For the input -7:
130 = a + b(-7)

We now have a system of two equations:

1. a + 14b = -290
2. a - 7b = 130

We can solve this system of equations using either substitution or elimination. I'll use elimination here.

Multiplying the second equation by 2 gives us:

2a - 14b = 260

Adding this to the first equation gives us:

1.  a + 14b = -290
2. 2a - 14b = 260
----------------
(1+2) 3a      = -30

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

a = -30 / 3
a = -10

Now we can plug this value of a into either original equation to find b. Let's use the first one:

-290 = -10 + 14b
-280 = 14b
b = -280 / 14
b = -20

The function that fits these two points is therefore:

y = -10 + (-20)x

or simplified:

y = -10 - 20x

Let's check this formula against the other provided points to ensure it's consistent:

For input -12:
y = -10 - 20(-12) 
y = -10 + 240 
y = 230

y = -10 - 20(16)

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of linear equations using the provided input-output pairs. Here, y is the output, x is the input, ax^0 is a constant term (since any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1), and bx^1 is a linear term.

Let's use two input-output pairs to create two equations and solve for a and b:

Using the input-output pair (14, -290):
-290 = a(14)^0 + b(14)^1
-290 = a + 14b  [Equation 1]

Using the input-output pair (-7, 130):
130 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7)^1
130 = a - 7b  [Equation 2]

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns which we can solve simultaneously:

Equation 1: a + 14b = -290
Equation 2: a -  7b = 130

We can solve this system by multiplying Equation 2 by 2 and then adding the resulting equation to Equation 1 to eliminate a:

2*(a -  7b) = 2*130
2a - 14b = 260

Now add this to Equation 1:

a + 14b = -290
2a - 14b = 260
----------------
3a       = -30

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for a:

a = -30 / 3
a = -10

Now plug the value of a into Equation 2 to solve for b:

a - 7b = 130
-10 - 7b = 130
-7b = 130 + 10
-7b = 140
b = 140 / -7
b = -20

So, a = -10 and b = -20, which means the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -10x^0 - 20x^1
y = -10 - 20x

Note that we only use two sets of data points to determine this linear relationship. The given function should be validated against all provided data points to ensure it fits each case. Let's do that:

    Given the inputs and outputs, it looks like we are dealing with a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx, since any number raised to the power of zero is one.

To determine a and b, we need to solve the system of linear equations generated from the input-output pairs. We can use two pairs of inputs and outputs to do this.

Let's use the following two pairs: 
x1 = -7, y1 = 130 
x2 = 14, y2 = -290

Now we'll have two equations based on the form y = a + bx:

1) 130 = a + b(-7) 
2) -290 = a + b(14)

Let's solve for a and b:

For equation 1:
130 = a - 7b   ... (3)

For equation 2:
-290 = a + 14b  ... (4)

Now, let’s solve the system of equations by multiplying equation (3) by 2 so that we can eliminate a when we add the equations together:

2 * (130 = a - 7b)
260 = 2a - 14b ... (5)

Add equation (4) and equation (5):
-290 = a + 14b  
260 = 2a - 14b
----------------
-30 = 3a 

So, a = -30 / 3 = -10

Now that we have a, we can solve for b using either equation (3) or (4). Let’s use equation (3):

130 = a - 7b
130 = -10 - 7b

Add 10 to both sides:

Here we have the following pairs:

1. For input x = -7, output y = 130.
2. For input x = 14, output y = -290.
3. For input x = -12, output y = 230.
4. For input x = 16, output y = -330.
5. For input x = 16, output y = -330 (repeated).

We can use the first two pairs to form two equations and solve them:

1. 130 = a + b(-7)
2. -290 = a + b(14)

Now we have a system of linear equations:
(a) - 7b = 130
(a) + 14b = -290

-7b + 14b = 130 - 290
7b = -160
b = -160 / 7
b = -22.8571...

We can see that the outputs are linearly dependent on the inputs, and we are asked to express this relationship in the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

This simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Since ax^0 is always 1 for any non-zero value of x, ax^0 simply becomes a.

We now need to determine the values of a and b that best fit our data. Since we have a system of linear equations, we can use any two points to solve for a and b.

Let's use the points (14, -290) and (-7, 130).

When x = 14, y = -290:
-290 = a + 14b  [Equation 1]

When x = -7, y = 130:
130 = a - 7b  [Equation 2]

Now, let's solve these two equations simultaneously.

Add Equation 1 and Equation 2:

-290 + 130 = a + 14b + a - 7b
-160 = 2a + 7b
2a = -160 - 7b
a = (-160 - 7b) / 2  [Equation 3]

Let's substitute the value of a from Equation 3 into Equation 1 to solve for b:

-290 = ((-160 - 7b) / 2) + 14b
-580 = -160 - 7b + 28b
-420 = 21b
b = -420 / 21
b = -20

Now, we can find a by substituting b into Equation 3:

a = (-160 - 7(-20)) / 2
a = (-160 + 140) / 2
a = -20 / 2
a = -10

We need to find a and b such that for each input (x), the corresponding output (y) is satisfied.

Let's use the points (2, 15) and (7, 50) to find a and b.

Using the point (2, 15):

-52.5 = -3.5a - 7b

Now adding this to the second equation, we have:
50 = a + 7b
-52.5 = -3.5a - 7b
---------------
-2.5 = -2.5a

Therefore, a = 1.

Now that we have a, we can solve for b using the first equation again:

15 = 1 + 2b
14 = 2b
b = 7

Thus, the output function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = 1 + 7x

To confirm our function, we can plug the other points to see if they fit:

For input -14:
y = 1 + 7(-14) = 1 - 98 = -97 (which is correct)

For input 7:
y = 1 + 7(7) = 1 + 49 = 50 (which is correct)

For input 2:
y = 1 + 7(2) = 1 + 14 = 15 (which is correct)

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 1 + 7x

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data, let's first note the form is equivalent to y = a + bx, because x^0 is 1 for any x except for x=0.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs (-14, -97), (7, 50), and (2, 15), we can set up a system of equations to solve for a and b in y = a + bx.

1. Using the pair (-14, -97):
-97 = a - 14b

2. Using the pair (7, 50):
50 = a + 7b

3. Using the pair (2, 15):
15 = a + 2b

We can choose any two of these equations to solve the system, as they should all yield the same solution for a consistent linear relationship.

Let's use equations 2 and 3 to set up a matrix:

| 1  7  | | a | = |  50 |
| 1  2  | | b |   |  15 |

Subtract the second row from the first row (to eliminate a):

| 1  5  | | a | = |  35 |
| 1  2  | | b |   |  15 |

Now, let's solve for b:

1 * a + 5b = 35
1 * a + 2b = 15

Subtract the second equation from the first equation:

5b - 2b = 35 - 15
3b = 20
b = 20 / 3

Now we have b, let's find a by plugging b back into one of the original equations:

a + 2(20/3) = 15
a + 40/3 = 15
a = 15 - 40/3
a = 45/3 - 40/3
a = 5/3

So the function that captures the relationship is:

Function: y = (5/3) + (20/3)x

or

Function: y = 5/3 + 20x/3

Note: This solution assumes that the data given actually represents a perfect linear relationship which may not be the case in real-world scenarios, especially with such few data points. Often in real life, additional steps would be taken such as plotting the data to visually assess the relationship or using statistical methods to determine the best fit (such as least squares regression).

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which is equivalent to y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1), we need to determine the values of 'a' and 'b' that would work for all the given inputs and outputs.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs:

1. When the input x is -14, the output y is -97
2. When the input x is 7, the output y is 50
3. When the input x is 2, the output y is 15

We can set up a system of equations based on the input-output pairs and the formula y = ax^0 + bx^1:

For the input x = -14, y = -97:
-97 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)
-97 = a + b(-14)

For the input x = 7, y = 50:
50 = a(7)^0 + b(7)
50 = a + b(7)

For the input x = 2, y = 15:
15 = a(2)^0 + b(2)
15 = a + b(2)

Now we have a system of three equations:

1. -97 = a - 14b
2. 50 = a + 7b
3. 15 = a + 2b

Since we have more equations than unknowns, this system may be overdetermined. However, let's first see if we can find a and b that satisfy equations 2 and 3 (as they are disjoint from the first equation and use different inputs).

Subtract equation 3 from equation 2:

50 - 15 = (a + 7b) - (a + 2b)
35 = 5b
b = 7

Now, plug the value of b back into equation 3:

15 = a + 2(7)
15 = a + 14
a = 15 - 14
a = 1

Therefore, our proposed function is:
y = a + bx
y = 1 + 7x

To check if our function is consistent with the first set of points, we can plug the value of x = -14 into the proposed function:
y = 1 + 7(-14)
y = 1 - 98
y = -97

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To obtain a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can simplify the equation to y = a + bx, because x^0 is equal to 1 for any x.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can form a system of equations to solve for the constants a and b.

Using the input-output pairs (-14, -97) and (2, 15), we have:

1. For input -14: -97 = a - 14b
2. For input 2: 15 = a + 2b

Now, let's solve this system of equations to find a and b.

Multiply the second equation by 7 to match the coefficient of b in the first equation by magnitude:

7 * 15 = 7a + 14b
105 = 7a + 14b

Now let's add the modified equation to the first equation to eliminate b:

105 = 7a + 14b
-97 = a - 14b
---------------
8 = 6a

To find a, divide by 6:

a = 8 / 6
a = 4 / 3

Now plug this value for a into one of the original equations to find b:

15 = (4 / 3) + 2b
2b = 15 - (4 / 3)
2b = 45/3 - 4/3
2b = 41/3

Now, divide by 2:

b = (41/3) / 2
b = 41/6

Thus the function capturing the relationship is:

y = (4/3) + (41/6)x

To confirm that this equation works with all given points, plug in another input-output pair, say (7, 50):

50 = (4/3) + (41/6) * 7
50 = (4/3) + (287/6)

Now convert (4/3) to have a denominator of 6 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 2):

50 = (8/6) + (287/6)

Combine the terms:

50 = (295/6)

Now convert the right-hand side to a decimal to see if it equals 50.

(295/6) ≈ 49.17

This doesn't seem to work out correctly, indicating there is either a miscalculation or the points do not fit a linear relationship perfectly.

Given that one of the points doesn't match, it's possible that the relationship isn't linear or there was an error in the calculation. Let’s try recalculating b using the other pair of points to see if we committed any mistakes.

Using the first equation:

-97 = (4/3) - 14b
-97 - (4/3) = -14b
(-291/3) - (4/3) = -14b
(-295/3) = -14b
b = (-295/3) / -14
b = 295 / 42
b = 7

Now that we have b = 7 let's try to recalculate a using the second input-output pair (2, 15).

15 = a + 2b
15 = a + 2 * 7
15 = a + 14
a = 15 - 14
a = 1

This gives us the linear function:

y = 1 + 7x

Let's confirm with all given points:

For input -14:
y = 1 + 7*(-14)
y = 1 - 98
y = -97 (which matches the output)

For input 7:
y = 1 + 7*7
y = 1 + 49
y = 50 (which matches the output)

For input 2:
y = 1 + 7*2
y = 1 + 14
y = 15 (which matches the output)

Therefore, the correct function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, using the given input-output pairs, is:

\[ -97 = a - 14b \]

For the data point (7, 50):

\[ 50 = a + 7b \]

For the data point (2, 15):

\[ 15 = a + 2b \]

Now, let's solve the equations to find the values of a and b. Using the first and second equations:

\[ -97 = a - 14b \]
\[ 50 = a + 7b \]

We can solve for a and b by multiplying the second equation by 2 and then adding both equations:

\[ 100 = 2a + 14b \]
\[ -97 = a - 14b \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can recognize that \( ax^0 \) is just \( a \), since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. The function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \). We are thus looking for values of \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the data points given.

Given 5 data points (\(x\), \(y\)):
1. \( x_1 = 5, y_1 = -26 \)
2. \( x_2 = 1, y_2 = -14 \)
3. \( x_3 = -14, y_3 = 31 \)
4. \( x_4 = -5, y_4 = 4 \)
5. \( x_5 = -8, y_5 = 13 \)

We need to solve for \( a \) and \( b \) in the function \( y = a + bx \) such that each of these equations is satisfied.

Let's use the first two points to form two equations:
1. \( -26 = a + 5b \)
2. \( -14 = a + b \)

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( b \):
\( -26 - (-14) = (a + 5b) - (a + b) \) 
\( -12 = 4b \)
\( b = -3 \)

Now use the value of \( b \) to find \( a \), plugging it back into the second original equation:
\( -14 = a - 3 \)
\( a = -11 \)

So, our function looks to be \( y = -11 + (-3)x \), which can be simplified to:
\( y = -11 - 3x \)

However, to truly validate this, we need to check that this function works for all the given data points. Let's check the remaining points:

For \( x_3 = -14 \):
\( y = -11 - 3(-14) \)
\( y = -11 + 42 \)
\( y = 31 \) (which matches the given output)

For \( x_4 = -5 \):
\( y = -11 - 3(-5) \)
\( y = -11 + 15 \)
\( y = 4 \) (which matches the given output)

For \( x_5 = -8 \):
\( y = -11 - 3(-8) \)
\( y = -11 + 24 \)
\( y = 13 \) (which matches the given output)

Since the function \( y = -11 - 3x \) satisfies all given data points, we can conclude that it describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs well.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to understand that `ax^0` is equivalent to `a` since any number raised to the zeroth power is 1. Thus, our function simplifies to `y = a + bx`. We need to find the constants `a` and `b` that satisfy all the given input-output pairs.

Given the pairs:
1. When x = 5, y = -26
2. When x = 1, y = -14
3. When x = -14, y = 31
4. When x = -5, y = 4
5. When x = -8, y = 13

We can set up simultaneous equations to solve for `a` and `b`. However, because we have more than two pairs, this system is overdetermined, and we may not be able to find a single solution that fits all pairs perfectly if the data is not linear. Instead, we can attempt to find the best linear fit for the data provided.

To find the best-fit line, we commonly use linear regression, but we'll try to find `a` and `b` using two of our given pairs to illustrate the method:

Using pairs:
1. (5, -26): -26 = a + 5b
2. (1, -14): -14 = a + 1b

By subtracting the second equation from the first, we can solve for `b`:
(-26 - (-14)) = (a + 5b) - (a + b)
-12 = 4b
b = -3

Now, we'll use the value of `b` to solve for `a` using one of the original equations:
-14 = a + 1(-3)
-14 = a - 3
a = -11

So the proposed function that fits these two particular points is:
y = -11 + (-3)x

Let's check with another pair to see if this function fits:
For x = -14:
y = -11 - 3(-14)
y = -11 + 42
y = 31

This matches one of our given pairs, suggesting we've found a linear function that fits at least some of the data. However, this function might not fit all the points perfectly. In a scenario with multiple data points, the best linear function would be found using least squares regression, which minimizes the sum of the squares of the errors between the observed and predicted values.

Our derived linear function is:
y = -11 - 3x

    To describe the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form of a linear function like y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are in fact looking for an equation of a line, which is typically expressed as y = c + bx. Here a is the y-intercept, represented by ax^0 (since any number to the power of 0 is 1, so ax^0 is simply a), and b is the slope of the line.

Given the data points:

(5, -26)
(1, -14)
(-14, 31)
(-5, 4)
(-8, 13)

We need to find the coefficients a and b that best fit these points.

To solve for a and b, we ideally would use two data points to form two simultaneous linear equations. However, since we are given more than two points, we can find a and b using linear regression techniques, which would minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed outputs and the outputs predicted by our linear model. However, I can also try to find a and b using simple observation or by solving the simultaneous equations if the points fit a perfect line.

Checking the differences between the outputs for each 1 unit increase in input, we see that the relationship is not immediately clear and does not suggest a simple linear function with integer coefficients. In such a case, a linear regression algorithm or tool would usually be utilized.

For this explanation, let's roughly estimate the slope (b) and intercept (a) by examining two data points that appear to align more closely with a line: (1, -14) and (-5, 4).

Using formula for the slope (b):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Choosing (x1, y1) = (1, -14) and (x2, y2) = (-5, 4), we get:

b = (4 - (-14)) / (-5 - 1)
b = 18 / -6
b = -3

Now let's solve for the y-intercept (a) using our estimated slope and one point (for instance, the point (1, -14)):

-14 = a + (-3)(1)
-14 = a - 3
a = -14 + 3
a = -11

So the estimated linear function based on a simple observational method is:

y = -11 - 3x

Or in the requested form:

Output: y = (-11)x^0 + (-3)x^1

For input 5:
-26 = a + 5b

For input 1:
-14 = a + 1b or -14 = a + b

For input -14:
31 = a - 14b

4 = a - 5b

For input -8:
13 = a - 8b

We now have a system of equations that we can solve for a and b. We can use pairs of these equations to eliminate one of the variables and solve for the other.

Taking the equations for inputs 1 and 5:

-14 = a + b
-26 = a + 5b

Subtract the first equation from the second:

Where a and b are constants we aim to find. Given this model, we can substitute in the known input-output pairs:

However, given that we have more than two pairs and are fitting a linear model, we could use methods like least squares to find the best fitting a and b. But since we are to solve it manually, we could choose two pairs to solve for a and b directly.

Now, let's solve these two linear equations to find the values of 'a' and 'b'.

Add Equation 1 and Equation 2 to eliminate 'b':
64 - 62 = a - 9b + a + 9b
2 = 2a
a = 1

Now, substitute 'a' back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2. Let's use Equation 1:
64 = 1 - 9b
63 = -9b
b = -7

Now we have our function:
y = a + bx
y = 1 - 7x

In the form requested, it is:
y = 1x^0 - 7x^1

Confirming this with all sets of inputs and outputs should yield correct outputs if our function is correct. Testing with x = -3:
y = 1 - 7(-3) = 1 + 21 = 22

It seems that the relationship between inputs and outputs can be described by the function:
y = 1x^0 - 7x^1
or simply,
y = 1 - 7x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Given the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, let's analyze the data:

When x = -9, y = 64: 
64 = a*(-9)^0 + b*(-9) 
64 = a - 9b ... (1)

When x = -3, y = 22: 
22 = a*(-3)^0 + b*(-3) 
22 = a - 3b ... (2)

When x = 9, y = -62: 
-62 = a*9^0 + b*9 
-62 = a + 9b ... (3)

When x = -5, y = 36: 
36 = a*(-5)^0 + b*(-5) 
36 = a - 5b ... (4)

When x = -16, y = 113: 
113 = a*(-16)^0 + b*(-16) 
113 = a - 16b ... (5)

From equations (1) and (2), we can form an equation by subtracting (2) from (1) to eliminate 'a' and find 'b':

64 - 22 = a - a - 9b + 3b
42 = -6b
b = -7

Now that we have 'b', we can substitute 'b' back into any equation to find 'a'. Using equation (2):

22 = a - 3(-7)
22 = a + 21
a = 22 - 21
a = 1

So, we have a = 1 and b = -7. The function is:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = 1*x^0 - 7*x
y = 1 - 7x

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we need to realize that this is essentially a linear equation \(y = a + bx\), since \(x^0\) is equal to 1 for any \(x \neq 0\), which doesn't matter in this case as the coefficient \(a\) would take care of the constant term. We are given pairs of inputs and outputs (x, y):

(-9, 64)
(-3, 22)
(9, -62)
(-5, 36)
(-16, 113)

We can use any two distinct points to find the slope \(b\) of this line:

Let's take points (-9, 64) and (9, -62), and use the formula for slope \(b\):

\[b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-62 - 64}{9 - (-9)}\]
\[b = \frac{-126}{18}\]
\[b = -7\]

Now that we've found \(b\), we can find \(a\) by substituting \(b\) and one of the points back into the equation \(y = a + bx\). Let's use the point (-9, 64):

\[64 = a + (-7) \cdot (-9)\]
\[64 = a + 63\]
\[a = 64 - 63\]
\[a = 1\]

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) with the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants a and b that best fit the given input-output pairs. In this form, ax^0 is simply a, because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. bx^1 is the same as bx, because any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself. Thus, the form is simplified to:

y = a + bx

We have a system of equations based on the input-output pairs given:

For input -9: 64 = a - 9b
For input -3: 22 = a - 3b
For input 9: -62 = a + 9b
For input -5: 36 = a - 5b
For input -16: 113 = a - 16b

We can choose any two pairs to solve for a and b. Let's use the first two pairs to set up a system of linear equations:

1) 64 = a - 9b
2) 22 = a - 3b

We can solve this system by using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination by subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

(64 = a - 9b) - (22 = a - 3b) -> 42 = -6b

Now we solve for b:

b = 42 / -6
b = -7

Now that we have b, we can substitute it into either equation 1 or 2 to find a. Let's use equation 2:

22 = a - 3(-7)
22 = a + 21
a = 22 - 21
a = 1

So, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 1 - 7x

Please note, I did not use all the input-output pairs to determine a and b. In reality, it is very rare for multiple random data points to perfectly fit a linear function unless they truly follow a linear relationship. Since the function y = 1 - 7x agrees with the first two input-output pairs, it should be checked against the others to verify if it correctly describes the entire set. And upon checking:

For input -9: y = 1 - 7(-9) = 1 + 63 = 64 (matches the output)
For input -3: y = 1 - 7(-3) = 1 + 21 = 22 (matches the output)
For input 9: y = 1 - 7(9) = 1 - 63 = -62 (matches the output)

For input -16: y = 1 - 7(-16) = 1 + 112 = 113 (matches the output)

    To solve for the coefficients `a` and `b` in the equation `y = ax^0 + bx^1` that describes the relationship between the inputs (`x`) and outputs (`y`), we can consider `ax^0` to be `a` (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), making the equation:

`y = a + bx`

Now let's plug in the given input-output pairs into this equation to form a system of equations:

1. For Input `-9` and Output `64`:

`64 = a + b(-9)`

2. For Input `-3` and Output `22`:

`22 = a + b(-3)`

3. For Input `9` and Output `-62`:

`-62 = a + b(9)`

4. For Input `-5` and Output `36`:

`36 = a + b(-5)`

5. For Input `-16` and Output `113`:

`113 = a + b(-16)`

Using pairs of these equations, we can solve for `a` and `b`. Let's use equations 2 and 3, because they both involve simpler numbers than the equation that uses Input `-16`.

From equation 2 (`22 = a - 3b`) and equation 3 (`-62 = a + 9b`), we can set up a system of linear equations:

`a - 3b = 22`
`a + 9b = -62`

We can solve this system of equations via substitution, elimination, or matrix methods. Let's use the elimination method by subtracting the second equation from the first:

`(a - 3b) - (a + 9b) = 22 - (-62)`
`a - a - 3b - 9b = 22 + 62`
`-12b = 84`

Now, we can solve for `b`:

`b = 84 / -12`
`b = -7`

Then we substitute `b` into one of the original equations to solve for `a`. Let's use the second equation (`22 = a - 3b`):

`22 = a - 3(-7)`
`22 = a + 21`
`a = 22 - 21`
`a = 1`

Now we have both `a` and `b`:

`a = 1`
`b = -7`

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the given inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of a and b that fit the data points. The term ax^0 simplifies to a because any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We need to solve for a and b.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs:

For input -20, output 265:
265 = a + b(-20) (Equation 1)

For input -15, output 195:
195 = a + b(-15) (Equation 2)

For input -5, output 55:
55 = a + b(-5) (Equation 3)

For input -10, output 125:
125 = a + b(-10) (Equation 4)

For input 6, output -99:
-99 = a + b(6) (Equation 5)

We have 5 equations and only 2 unknowns. Normally, we would only need two points to determine a linear relationship, but with more points, we must perform a linear regression or find two points that can exactly determine the line for this form of equation.

Let's take two of the points to solve for a and b:

From Equation 1:
265 = a - 20b

From Equation 5:
-99 = a + 6b

Now we have two linear equations with two unknowns. We can solve these equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

Adding equation 1 and equation 5 gives us:
265 + (-99) = a - 20b + a + 6b
166 = 2a - 14b
83 = a - 7b (Equation 6)

Now let's subtract Equation 5 from Equation 1:
265 - (-99) = a - 20b - (a + 6b)
364 = -14b
b = -364 / 14
b = -26

From Equation 6 we can now solve for a:
83 = a - 7(-26)
83 = a + 182
a = 83 - 182
a = -99

And the desired function form: y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 equals 1), we must find the values of a and b that fit the data.

Using the first data point (-20, 265):

265 = a + b(-20)
a - 20b = 265 ... (Equation 1)

Using another data point to form a second equation, let's use (6, -99):

-99 = a + b(6)
a + 6b = -99 ... (Equation 2)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

a - 20b = 265 ... (Equation 1)
a + 6b = -99 ... (Equation 2)

Let's solve for 'a' in both equations:

From Equation 2:
a = -99 - 6b ... (Equation 3)

Substitute the expression for 'a' from Equation 3 into Equation 1:
-99 - 6b - 20b = 265
-99 - 26b = 265
-26b = 265 + 99

    To determine the coefficients of the function `y = ax^0 + bx^1` that best describes the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we need to analyze the given pairs of input and output values. The function given is essentially a linear function `y = a + bx` because `x^0` is equal to 1 for any x that is not equal to 0.

Given the function `y = a + bx`, we can form a system of equations using the provided input-output pairs. Let's start with two pairs to find the values for `a` and `b`:

Let's pick the pairs (-20, 265) and (-5, 55):

For input -20:
1) \( 265 = a + b(-20) \)
1) \( 265 = a - 20b \)

For input -5:
2) \( 55 = a + b(-5) \)
2) \( 55 = a - 5b \)

Let's solve this system using substitution or elimination. I'll perform the method of elimination:

By multiplying equation 2) by 4, we get:
2) \( 4*55 = 4*a - 4*5b \)
2) \( 220 = 4a - 20b \)

Now we have the system:
1) \( 265 = a - 20b \)
2) \( 220 = 4a - 20b \)

Subtract equation 1) from equation 2):
\( 220 - 265 = 4a - a - 20b + 20b \)
\( -45 = 3a \)
\( a = -45 / 3 \)
\( a = -15 \)

Now let's plug the value of `a` into one of the original equations to find `b`. Using equation 2):
\( 55 = -15 - 5b \)
\( 70 = -5b \)
\( b = -14 \)

The function that fits all the given input-output pairs (given that they can all be perfectly represented by a linear function, which we are assuming for this exercise) is:
\[ y = -15 + (-14)x \]
\[ y = -15 - 14x \]

This is the simplest linear function that fits the two pairs we used. For it to be the correct function, it needs to fit all the other pairs provided. Let's check:

For input -15:
\( y = -15 - 14(-15) \)
\( y = -15 + 210 \)
\( y = 195 \)

For input -10:
\( y = -15 - 14(-10) \)
\( y = -15 + 140 \)
\( y = 125 \)

For input 6:
\( y = -15 - 14(6) \)
\( y = -15 - 84 \)
\( y = -99 \)

    To capture the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to recognize that ax^0 is a constant (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is simply bx (since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself). Hence, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have the following points with given inputs and outputs:

1. y = a + bx when x = -20, y = 265
2. y = a + bx when x = -15, y = 195
3. y = a + bx when x = -5, y = 55
4. y = a + bx when x = -10, y = 125
5. y = a + bx when x = 6, y = -99

To find the values of a and b, we would normally use two points to set up two equations and solve for a and b. However, given that we have more than two points, we will seek to find a and b that provide the best fit for all points which might not perfectly align to a straight line. Finding the exact best fit requires more computational techniques such as least squares regression. 

But since this is intended to be simple and we don't aim for perfect accuracy, we can try to estimate the values by looking for patterns in the changes in x and corresponding changes in y. This is not necessarily going to give us the most accurate values, but it should give us a function that reflects a general trend.

From points (1) and (2):
When x increases by 5 (from -20 to -15), y decreases by 70 (from 265 to 195).

From points (3) and (4):
When x increases by 5 (from -10 to -5), y decreases by 70 (from 125 to 55).

We can notice that in both cases, for an increase in x by 5, y decreases by 70, suggesting that b could be -14 (since 70/5 = 14, but it decreases, hence -14).

Assuming b = -14, we can use one of the points to solve for a:

Using point (4), where x = -10 and y = 125:
125 = a - 14(-10)
125 = a + 140
a = 125 - 140
a = -15

From the point (6, -99):
-99 = a + b(6)
a + 6b = -99 ..........(1)

From the point (-20, 265):
265 = a - b(20)
a - 20b = 265 ..........(2)

We now have a system of linear equations that we can solve. Let's multiply equation (1) by 20, and equation (2) by 6 to eliminate a:

20(a + 6b) = 20(-99)
6(a - 20b) = 6(265)

This gives us:
20a + 120b = -1980
6a - 120b = 1590

We can then add the two resulting equations together:
20a + 120b + 6a - 120b = -1980 + 1590
26a = -390

Now we can solve for a:
a = -390 / 26
a = -15

2 = a + 4b  ...(2)

We can ignore the third and fourth pairs for now, as two pairs are sufficient to solve for two unknowns (a and b). Now, let's solve the system of equations:

From equation (2):
a = 2 - 4b

Plug this into equation (1) for a:
-54 = (2 - 4b) - 10b
-54 = 2 - 14b
-56 = -14b
b = -56 / -14
b = 4

Now we'll substitute b = 4 into equation (2) to find a:
2 = a + 4(4)
2 = a + 16
a = 2 - 16
a = -14

Now we have both values for a and b:
a = -14
b = 4

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = -14x^0 + 4x^1

Which simplifies to:
y = -14 + 4x

Hence, the explicit function in the exact form requested is:
Output: y = -14 + 4x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can treat it as a linear equation \( y = a + bx \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants that we need to determine. The term \( ax^0 \) is equal to \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any \( x \) that is not 0. The term \( bx^1 \) is equal to \( bx \) because any number to the power of 1 is itself.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs (-10, -54), (4, 2), (-20, -94), (4, 2), and (-4, -30), we will assume that the function is indeed linear, despite having the same input (4) with the same output (2) which indicates there might not be enough variability to ascertain a single unique linear function. However, with this assumption, we will proceed.

We can select two input-output pairs to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \). We can select any two points, but ideally, we want to select two with different inputs to ensure we aren't selecting the same point twice. Let's select (-10, -54) and (-20, -94).

Now we set up two equations:

For input -10, output -54:
\( -54 = a + b(-10) \)
\( -54 = a - 10b \) ... [1]

For input -20, output -94:
\( -94 = a + b(-20) \)
\( -94 = a - 20b \) ... [2]

Now we can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using these two equations.

Subtract [1] from [2]:
\( (-94) - (-54) = (a - a) + (-20b - (-10b)) \)
\( -40 = -10b \)
\( b = \frac{-40}{-10} \)
\( b = 4 \)

Now substitute \( b \) back into [1]:
\( -54 = a - 10(4) \)
\( -54 = a - 40 \)
\( a = -54 + 40 \)
\( a = -14 \)

So the function that describes the data is:
\( y = -14 + 4x \)

In the exact form requested, this is:
\( y = -14x^0 + 4x^1 \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the required form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the coefficients a and b that will fit the data provided. Since ax^0 is essentially a (because x^0 = 1 for any x ≠ 0), and bx^1 is just bx, we can rewrite the function as y = a + bx.

To find the values of a and b, we need to solve the system of linear equations derived from the given input-output pairs. However, from the pairs given, we can notice a pattern to expedite the process.

Let's consider two of the given points: 

1) Input: -10, Output: -54
-54 = a + b(-10)

2) Input: 4, Output: 2
2 = a + b(4)

We can solve this system of equations using various methods such as substitution or elimination. However, we can notice that these two equations are easy to handle if we sum them because the sum will eliminate b:

(-54) + 2 = a - 10b + a + 4b
-52 = 2a - 6b

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

-26 = a - 3b (Equation 1)

Now let's take another pair to work with the one we just derived:

Input: -4, Output: -30

-30 = a + b(-4)

We can add this equation to (Equation 1) to eliminate b again:

-26 = a - 3b
-30 = a - 4b
-----------------
-56 = 2a - 7b

Divide both sides by 2:

-28 = a - (7/2)b

Now we have two equations where b is multiplied by a fraction:

-26 = a - 3b (Equation 1)
-28 = a - (7/2)b (Equation 2)

Let's multiply (Equation 1) by 2 to make the coefficients of b in both equations equal:

-52 = 2a - 6b (Equation 1')
-28 = a - (7/2)b (Equation 2)

Now, let's multiply (Equation 2) by 4:

-112 = 4a - 14b (Equation 2')

We can now subtract (Equation 1') from (Equation 2') to eliminate a:

-112 - (-52) = (4a - 14b) - (2a - 6b)
-60 = 2a - 8b

Dividing by 2:

-30 = a - 4b

Using this equation with the one we derived from the input-output pair (Input: -4, Output: -30):

-30 = a + b(-4)
-30 = a - 4b

We can see that a = -30 when b = 0. However, since b cannot be 0 (otherwise all outputs would be the same), our approach so far does not seem to lead to a consistent solution with all the data points provided. 

We need to go back and try solving the original set of equations without making assumptions. Let's revisit the two original points and solve the system:

For Input: -10, Output: -54:
-54 = a - 10b (Equation A)

For Input: 4, Output: 2:
2 = a + 4b (Equation B)

Now let's perform the elimination method. Multiply Equation B by 2.5 (to equalize coefficients):

5 = 2.5a + 10b (Equation B')

Now add this to Equation A:

-54 + 5 = a - 10b + 2.5a + 10b
-49 = 3.5a

Now divide both sides by 3.5:

-14 = a

Now we know that a = -14. We can substitute this into Equation A or B to find b. Let's substitute it into Equation B:

2 = (-14) + 4b
16 = 4b
b = 4

Therefore, the function that best describes the data points provided is:

y = -14 + 4x

The given points are:
(-10, -54)
(4, 2)
(-20, -94)
(4, 2)
(-4, -30)

First, understand that x^0 is always 1 for any x ≠ 0. Thus, the equation can be rewritten as y = a + bx where a and b are constants.

Let's use two distinct points to solve for a and b. We'll use the points (-10, -54) and (4, 2).

For the point (-10, -54):
-54 = a + b(-10)
-54 = a - 10b  ...equation (1)

For the point (4, 2):
2 = a + b(4)
2 = a + 4b  ...equation (2)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns; we can solve for a and b:

From equation (2):
a = 2 - 4b  ...equation (3)

Substitute equation (3) into equation (1):
-54 = (2 - 4b) - 10b
-54 = 2 - 14b
-56 = -14b
b = 56 / 14
b = 4

Now plug the value of b back into equation (3):
a = 2 - 4(4)

This simplifies to

\[ y = a + bx \]

since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x except 0.

1. (-10, -54)
2. (4, 2)
3. (-20, -94)
4. (4, 2) (repeated)

From points 1 and 2:

For (-10, -54):
\[ -54 = a + b(-10) \]
\[ -54 = a - 10b \]
\[ a - 10b = -54 ------ (1) \]

For (4, 2):
\[ 2 = a + b(4) \]
\[ 2 = a + 4b \]
\[ a + 4b = 2 ------ (2) \]

We can now solve for a and b using simultaneous equations (1) and (2).

By multiplying equation (2) by 2.5, we can align the a terms:
\[ 2.5(a + 4b) = 2.5(2) \]
\[ 2.5a + 10b = 5 \]
\[ 2.5a = 5 - 10b ------ (3) \]

We can now add equation (1) to equation (3) to eliminate b:
\[ a - 10b + 2.5a = -54 + 5 \]
\[ 3.5a = -49 \]
\[ a = -49 / 3.5 \]
\[ a = -14 \]

Now that we have a, we can solve for b using equation (2):
\[ -14 + 4b = 2 \]
\[ 4b = 2 + 14 \]
\[ 4b = 16 \]
\[ b = 16 / 4 \]
\[ b = 4 \]

    Given that the function should be written in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 and we have a set of input-output pairs, we can attempt to find the coefficients a and b that fit these data points.

First note that x^0 is always 1, regardless of the value of x. Thus, ax^0 simplifies to a constant term, a. The term bx^1 is simply bx, since any number to the power of 1 is itself. Therefore, the function we're looking for will take the form y = a + bx.

-12 = a + b(-7)

For input -17, output -32:
-32 = a + b(-17)

We can solve this system of equations using various methods, such as matrix operations or substitution. However, it is clear by inspection that the relationship between the input (x) and the output (y) is linear with a slope of 1 and an offset that equals -9. This is because when x decreases by 1 (e.g., from -2 to -3), the output also decreases by 1 (from -2 to -3), and vice versa. Checking this with two of our points (-2,-2) and (-11,-20):

-2 (output) = a -2 (input)
-2 = a - 2b

-20 (output) = a -11 (input)
-20 = a - 11b

By subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

b = 2

Plugging the value of b back into one of the equations to solve for a:

-2 = a + 4
a = -6

    The function you are asking for is in the form of a linear equation, where the output y is a function of the input x. This form is essentially the equation of a line, y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 and x^1 is x.

Given the points:

(-11, -20), (-8, -14), (-2, -2), (-7, -12), (-17, -32)

We need to find a and b that best fit these points. Since we have more than two points and they are not perfectly aligned, we would typically have to use a method such as least squares to find the 'best fit' line. However, we can try to see if there is an exact fit for these points by calculating the slope (b) using two of the points and then finding the intercept (a).

The formula for the slope (b) between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Let's take the points (-11, -20) and (-2, -2) to calculate the slope:

b = (-2 + 20) / (-2 + 11) = 18 / 9 = 2

Now we have b, and we can insert one of the points into the linear equation to solve for a:

a = -20 - 2*(-11)
a = -20 + 22
a = 2

2. -14 = a - 8b
3. -2 = a - 2b
4. -12 = a - 7b
5. -32 = a - 17b

Looking at the patterns in the data where inputs and outputs change sign when x is negative or positive and maintain a linear relationship, we can infer that 'b' is likely the slope that will be constant between each pair of data points, and 'a' is the y-intercept.

First, let's find 'b', the slope of the line. The slope can be calculated using any two data points.

Now we can find 'a' by substituting the value of 'b' back into any of the original equations. Let's use the point (10, 176):

176 = a + 18*10
176 = a + 180
a = 176 - 180
a = -4

This gives us a and b for the equation. Therefore, the function that relates inputs (x) to outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = -4 + 18x

Please note that this function is based on the assumption that the relationship is perfectly linear and that the provided data points have no error, in practice such conditions are almost never met, and more sophisticated methods would be required to derive an accurate model.

    To find a linear function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 = 1 \), we can observe the changes in y relative to changes in x.

Looking at the given input-output pairs:
1. When \( x = -17 \), \( y = -310 \)
2. When \( x = 17 \), \( y = 302 \)
3. When \( x = 10 \), \( y = 176 \)
4. When \( x = 12 \), \( y = 212 \)
5. When \( x = 13 \), \( y = 230 \)

To find b (the slope), let's take the change between two known input-output pairs. Using the first two pairs:

For \( x = -17 \), \( y = -310 \);
For \( x = 17 \), \( y = 302 \);

The change in x (Δx) is \( 17 - (-17) = 34 \), and the change in y (Δy) is \( 302 - (-310) = 612 \). Thus, the slope b can be calculated as:

\( b = Δy / Δx = 612 / 34 = 18 \)

To find a (the y-intercept), we can now use the known b and one of the input-output pairs. Let's use \( x = 10 \) and \( y = 176 \).

\( 176 = a + 18 * 10 \)
\( 176 = a + 180 \)
\( a = 176 - 180 \)
\( a = -4 \)

Finally, we have our linear function:

\( y = -4 + 18x \)

    Given the data points:

(-17, -310), (17, 302), (10, 176), (12, 212), (13, 230)

We want a function in the form of:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

which simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Since ""a"" is the y-intercept and ""b"" is the slope of the line, we can try to determine them from the given pairs. Observing the symmetry in input-output pairs for -17 and 17, it seems like the y-intercept might be close to -10 (since output at 17 is 302, and for -17 it is -310, which is 10 units less). Let's use (10, 176) and (13, 230) to calculate the slope.

slope b = (change in y) / (change in x)
         = (230 - 176) / (13 - 10)
         = 54 / 3
         = 18

We have the slope b as 18. Now we can place one of the data points into the equation to solve for a. Using the point (10, 176):

176 = a + 18(10)
176 = a + 180
a = 176 - 180

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first recognize that \( ax^0 \) is the same as \( a \) because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Therefore, our function can be simplified to \( y = a + bx \). We need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy the given input-output pairs.

Following the pattern in the inputs and outputs, we'll first attempt to identify the value of \( b \) by looking at how much the output changes with the input. By comparing the pairs, it becomes evident that when the input increases by 1 (for example, from 12 to 13), the output increases by 18 (from 212 to 230). So it seems that \( b \) is 18.

Now let's substitute one of the input-output pairs into the equation to find \( a \). Using the pair (10, 176):

\[ 176 = a + 18 \times 10 \]
\[ 176 = a + 180 \]
\[ a = 176 - 180 \]
\[ a = -4 \]

With \( a = -4 \) and \( b = 18 \), we can write the function as:

\[ y = -4 + 18x \]

However, let's check this function against the other input-output pairs to see if it holds true:

For input -17:
\[ y = -4 + 18 \times (-17) \]
\[ y = -4 - 306 \]
\[ y = -310 \]

For input 17:

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first note that ax^0 is simply a as x^0 is always 1 for any x ≠ 0. So the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have a set of inputs (x) and outputs (y) and we need to solve for coefficients a and b.

Given the points:
1) When x = -16, y = 297
2) When x = 18, y = -315
3) When x = -16, y = 297 (repeats the first one)
4) When x = -5, y = 99
5) When x = 5, y = -81

We only need two distinct points to determine the straight line function, but since we are given more, let's use the first two to find our a and b:

From the first point (-16, 297):
297 = a + b(-16) ... (Equation 1)

From the second point (18, -315):
-315 = a + b(18) ... (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations. Let's solve them by using simultaneous equations.

From Equation 1:
297 = a - 16b
a = 297 + 16b ... (Equation 3)

Substitute a from Equation 3 into Equation 2:
-315 = (297 + 16b) + 18b
-315 = 297 + 16b + 18b
-315 = 297 + 34b
34b = -315 - 297
34b = -612
b = -612 / 34
b = -18

Now that we have b, use Equation 3 to find a:

    Given the data points, we can see that each input/output pair follows a linear relationship of the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

This can be simplified to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

The goal is to find the values for coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) that will satisfy the provided input/output pairs.

Let's start by simplifying our equation since \(x^0 = 1\) for any \(x ≠ 0\):

\[ y = a + bx \]

From the provided data points:

1. When \(x = -16\), \(y = 297\)
\[ 297 = a - 16b \]

2. When \(x = 18\), \(y = -315\)
\[ -315 = a + 18b \]

3. When \(x = -16\), \(y = 297\) (repetition of the first point)
\[ 297 = a - 16b \]

4. When \(x = -5\), \(y = 99\)
\[ 99 = a - 5b \]

5. When \(x = 5\), \(y = -81\)
\[ -81 = a + 5b \]

We can now solve this system using any two unique equations. Let's use equations from points 1 and 2 since they involve the largest values of \(x\), which can offer a more accurate representation since they are not close to the origin.

\[ 297 = a - 16b \]
\[ -315 = a + 18b \]

By summing both equations, we can eliminate \(a\):

\[ \begin{align*}
297 - 16b + (-315) + 18b &= a - 16b + a + 18b \\
-18 &= 2a \\
a &= -9

Substitute \(a = -9\) into the first equation:

297 &= -9 - 16b \\
306 &= -16b \\
b &= -\frac{306}{16} \\
b &= -19.125

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can interpret \( ax^0 \) as a constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and \( bx^1 \) as a linear term (since \( x^1 \) is just x). Therefore, the function format simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Given the data points:

1. \( (-16, 297) \)
2. \( (18, -315) \)

We need to solve the following system of linear equations:

1. \( 297 = a - 16b \)
2. \( -315 = a + 18b \)

Solving these two equations simultaneously:

From equation (1):
\( a = 297 + 16b \) ... (3)

Substitute \( a \) from equation (3) into equation (2):

3. x = -16, y = 297 (same as the first pair)

Let's use pairs (1) and (2):

For x = -16, y = 297, we have 297 = a - 16b.
For x = 18, y = -315, we have -315 = a + 18b.

Now we can solve this system of linear equations. Let's multiply the second equation by 16 and the first equation by 18 to eliminate 'a':

-16(-315) = -16a - 18*16b
18(297) = 18a + 18*16b

(5040) = -16a - 288b

Using the given pairs of inputs and outputs (x, y), we can create the following equations:

For x = -16, y = 297:
297 = a + b(-16)

For x = 18, y = -315:

For x = -5, y = 99:

For x = 5, y = -81:

We already have a system of two equations with two variables. By solving these two, we can find the values for a and b that should work for all the given points. Let's solve these equations:

19a - 342b = -5045  (3)
18a + 342b = 4554   (4)

(19a + 18a) + (-342b + 342b) = -5045 + 4554
37a = -491
a = -491 / 37
a = -13.27 (rounded to two decimal places)

With the value of a, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find b. Let's use equation (2):
-13.27 + 19b = 253
19b = 253 + 13.27
19b = 266.27
b = 266.27 / 19
b = 14.01 (rounded to two decimal places)

Now we have our constants a and b:
a ≈ -13.27
b ≈ 14.01

The function that fits the given points is approximately:
y = -13.27 + 14.01x

However, because we have rounded the numbers, this function may not fit the points exactly. To find the precise values for a and b, we can perform the calculations with better precision or use more points to solve the system of equations exactly. Since this is a simple linear relationship (a straight-line fit), the exact function will work for all the given points with no error. Let's re-evaluate with exact precision.

Using two pairs of points, we have for (-18, -265) and (19, 253):

-265 = a - 18b
253 = a + 19b

Solving this system exactly, we add both equations:

-265 + 253 = a - 18b + a + 19b
-12 = 2a + b
b = -12 - 2a

Now plug this into one of the equations to solve for a:

253 = a + 19b
253 = a + 19(-12 - 2a)
253 = a - 228 - 38a
253 + 228 = 37a
481 = 37a
a = 481 / 37
a = 13

b = -12 - 2a
b = -12 - 2(13)
b = -12 - 26
b = -38

Inspecting the patterns:

To find the constant a and the coefficient b, we can solve the simultaneous equations. Let's use equations (1) and (2) as they include the largest magnitude of x which will give us the most accurate determination of b:

37b = 253 + 265
37b = 518
b = 518 / 37
b = 14

Now, we can find a using the value of b and any of the equations; let's use equation (1):

-265 = a - 18(14)
-265 = a - 252
a = -265 + 252
a = -13

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship is:
y = -13x^0 + 14x^1

Or simply:
y = -13 + 14x

y = -13 + 14(13)

y = 169

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the form you've provided, where y = ax^0 + bx^1, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx, because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1, and any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself.

Let's determine values for `a` and `b` based on the input-output pairs given:

For the Input (-18) and Output (-265):
-265 = a - 18b    ...(1)

For the Input (19) and Output (253):
253 = a + 19b     ...(2)

For the Input (-15) and Output (-223):
-223 = a - 15b    ...(3)

For the Input (6) and Output (71):
71 = a + 6b       ...(4)

For the Input (17) and Output (225):
225 = a + 17b     ...(5)

To solve this, we need to determine `a` and `b`. However, we have too many equations (essentially an overdetermined system), so we'll use two equations to determine a consistent solution for `a` and `b`. Taking equations (1) and (2), we can set them up in a way to solve for `a` and `b`:

-265 = a - 18b
253 = a + 19b

Adding these two equations together, we have:
-265 + 253 = (a - 18b) + (a + 19b)
-12 = 2a + b
-12 - 2a = b  ...(6)

Now we substitute equation (6) back into equation (1) and solve for `a`:

-265 = a - 18(-12 - 2a)
-265 = a + 216 + 36a
-265 = 37a + 216
-265 - 216 = 37a
-481 = 37a
a = -481 / 37
a = -13

Now that we have `a`, we can solve for `b` using equation (6):

-12 - 2(-13) = b
-12 + 26 = b
b = 14

Therefore, the function that best describes the provided data set in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = -13 + 14x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, we need to recognize that \( x^0 \) is always equal to 1. This simplifies the function to:

\( y = a + bx \)

To determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \), we need at least two points to solve the system of linear equations. However, the five given points should fall on a straight line if they are to be perfectly represented by this linear function. Let's use two of the given points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

We can choose, for example, the points (-18, -265) and (19, 253). Now, we can set up the following two equations:

1. For the input -18 and output -265:
\( -265 = a + b(-18) \)

2. For the input 19 and output 253:
\( 253 = a + b(19) \)

Let's solve this system for \( a \) and \( b \). Multiplying the second equation by 18 and adding the two equations, we can eliminate \( a \):

\( -265 + 18(253) = 18a + b(-18) + 18a + b(19)(18) \)

Solving for \( b \):

\( -265 + 4554 = 36a + b(1) \)

\( 4289 = 36a \)

Now, solving for \( a \):

\( a = 4289 / 36 \)
\( a ≈ 119.139 \)

Now, let's find the value of \( b \):

\( 253 = 119.139 + 19b \)

Solving for \( b \):

\( 19b = 253 - 119.139 \)
\( 19b ≈ 133.861 \)
\( b ≈ 7.045 \)

Now, substituting \( a \) and \( b \) back into the function, we get:

\( y = 119.139 + 7.045x \)

However, this function might not perfectly fit all the given points since we only considered two points to form the linear equation. To verify the fit, we can check whether the other points align with this derived function. If they do not, adjustments through methods like least squares regression would be needed to find the best-fitting line for all points.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we first note that ax^0 is equal to a since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. Now we need to find the values of a and b that fit the data provided.

Let's use two data points to create a system of equations to solve for a and b. From the data points:

For input -18, output is -265, which gives us:
-265 = a + b(-18) ... (1)

For input 19, output is 253, which gives us:
253 = a + b(19) ... (2)

Now, let's solve this system of equations for a and b. We can first add equation (1) and equation (2):

(-265) + 253 = a - 18b + a + 19b
-12 = 2a + b

Now, let’s solve for a:

-12 = 2a + b
a = (-12 - b) / 2 ... (3)

We can substitute equation (3) in either equation (1) or (2) to find b. Let’s substitute it into equation (2):

253 = (-12 - b)/2 + 19b
506 = -12 - b + 38b
506 + 12 = 37b
518 = 37b
b = 518 / 37
b = 14

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using equation (3):

a = (-12 - 14) / 2
a = (-26) / 2
a = -13

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we need to find the values of a and b.

The general forms of a and b would be:

y = a + bx

Given the data points, we can create a system of equations. However, since we are given five data points, we have an overdetermined system (more equations than unknowns), which may not have an exact solution if the data is not perfectly linear. In such cases, we need to find a best fit line using techniques like least squares regression. But since we are looking for an explicit formula based on the given form, let's try a simpler approach and use two points to find a potential solution.

Let's use the first two points (0, -15) and (-5, -35) to create two equations:

1. For Input: 0, Output: -15
-15 = a + b(0)
-15 = a

2. For Input: -5, Output: -35
-35 = a + b(-5)

Since we know a is -15 from equation 1, let's substitute a into equation 2:

-35 = -15 + b(-5)
-35 = -15 - 5b
-20 = -5b
b = 4

Thus, our function seems to be:

y = -15 + 4x

To verify this, we can plug in the other given points:

For Input: -4, Output: -31
-31 = -15 + 4(-4)
-31 = -15 - 16
-31 = -31  (This point fits)

For Input: 5, Output: 5
5 = -15 + 4(5)
5 = -15 + 20
5 = 5 (This point fits)

For Input: -12, Output: -63
-63 = -15 + 4(-12)
-63 = -15 - 48
-63 = -63 (This point fits)

    To determine the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first note that x^0 is always equal to 1 for any x not equal to zero. Therefore, we can rewrite the function as y = a + bx.

We now have to determine the values of a and b using the given inputs and outputs.

Taking two points to construct two equations:

1. Using Input: 0, Output: -15,
We get -15 = a + b * 0,
Which simplifies to -15 = a.

2. Using any other point (for example, Input: -4, Output: -31),
-31 = a + b * (-4).

We already know that a is equal to -15 (from equation 1), so we substitute that into equation 2:

-31 = -15 + b * (-4),
-31 = -15 - 4b,
-31 + 15 = -4b,
-16 = -4b,
b = 4.

    To find the function of the form, y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can see that the term ax^0 is simply a since x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0. This term represents the y-intercept of the function, which is the value of y when x = 0. The term bx^1 is simply bx, representing the linear component of the function which defines the slope.

Given the outputs for specific inputs, we can determine a and b.

Consider the point where Input (x) is 0:
Output (y) = -15

Substituting x = 0 into the equation gives us:
y = a(0)^0 + b(0)
y = a * 1 + 0
y = a

We can see that:
-15 = a

So, the y-intercept, a, is -15.

Now, to find the slope b, we need two points. We can use the points (x = -5, y = -35) and (x = 5, y = 5). The slope (b) is found by the change in y divided by the change in x:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Using the points (-5, -35) and (5, 5):
b = (5 - (-35)) / (5 - (-5))
b = (5 + 35) / (5 + 5)
b = 40 / 10
b = 4

Therefore, the slope b is 4.

Substituting a and b into the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 gives us:
y = -15 * x^0 + 4 * x^1

Since x^0 is 1 for any x not equal to zero, the function simplifies to:
y = -15 + 4x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that fits the provided input-output pairs, we can understand this form as a linear equation in the form \( y = a + bx \), where:

- \( a \) is the y-intercept (the constant term)
- \( b \) is the slope of the line (the coefficient of \( x \))

Looking at the input-output pairs provided:

1. When \( x = 0 \), \( y = -15 \)
2. When \( x = -5 \), \( y = -35 \)
3. When \( x = -4 \), \( y = -31 \)
4. When \( x = 5 \), \( y = 5 \)
5. When \( x = -12 \), \( y = -63 \)

From the first input-output pair (x=0, y=-15), we can immediately know that the y-intercept \( a = -15 \), because when \( x = 0 \), \( y \) should equal the constant term \( a \).

Now we need to find the slope \( b \). Ideally, the slope can be computed by taking two points and using the formula:

\[
b = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]

For simplicity, let's use the first pair (0, -15) and the fourth pair (5, 5) to calculate the slope:

\[
b = \frac{5 - (-15)}{5 - 0} = \frac{20}{5} = 4
\]

Let's check if this slope fits the other points:

- For \( x = -5 \):

\[
y = -15 + 4(-5) = -15 - 20 = -35
\]

- For \( x = -4 \):

\[
y = -15 + 4(-4) = -15 - 16 = -31
\]

- For \( x = -12 \):

\[
y = -15 + 4(-12) = -15 - 48 = -63

    To capture the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we can fit a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. This simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is 1 for all x, so the term ax^0 is just a.

We need to find the values of a and b that best fit these points.

Now we need to determine the value of b. We can use any of the given data points to do this. Let's use the point (5, 5):

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we need to determine the constants a and b.

The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Because x^0 is always 1 for any x ≠ 0.

We have 5 data points: (9, 133), (19, 283), (16, 238), (-14, -212), and (-16, -242). We can use any two points to determine the constants a and b, but to ensure accuracy, we'll use all points and find a best-fit line using these points. This is commonly done using Least Squares Regression, but here we can do it by inspection, looking for a pattern.

Let's list the data points and look for a pattern:

1. When x = 9, y = 133 → 133 = a + 9b
2. When x = 19, y = 283 → 283 = a + 19b
3. When x = 16, y = 238 → 238 = a + 16b
4. When x = -14, y = -212 → -212 = a - 14b
5. When x = -16, y = -242 → -242 = a - 16b

Let's consider the cases where we have positive and negative inputs for x and we notice that for negative x, the outputs y are exactly negative as well. This suggests that the constant 'a' might be 0. Let's check if b is consistent across these samples.

From the first data point:
133 = a + 9b
If a = 0, then 133 = 9b, which gives us b = 133 / 9 = 14.777...

Checking this value of b with the second data point:
283 = a + 19b
If a = 0, then 283 = 19 * 14.777..., which indeed gives us approximately 283.

To confirm, let's check the rest of the points:

For the third point:
238 = 16 * 14.777... ≈ 238 (rounding error acceptable)

For the fourth point:
-212 = -14 * 14.777... ≈ -212

For the fifth point:
-242 = -16 * 14.777... ≈ -242

This consistent 'b' across all points strongly suggests that b ≈ 14.777... From our pattern recognition and the ""a"" coefficient being effectively zero in all equations, we can form the function:

y ≈ 0x^0 + 14.777...x^1

Rounding b to a more manageable number (since the true pattern might be a whole number due to the nature of the examples), b is likely 15 (since 14.777... is very close to 15 and it's common for patterns to involve whole numbers).

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the provided data, we can interpret this as a linear function y = b*x + a, since x^0 is always 1.

Let's analyze the given pairs of input (x) and output (y):

1. For input 9, output is 133.
2. For input 19, output is 283.
3. For input 16, output is 238.
4. For input -14, output is -212.
5. For input -16, output is -242.

We can create a system of linear equations based on the above points. I'll use two points to find a and b (you can choose any two distinct points):

Using points (9, 133) and (-16, -242), we can form the following two equations:

1. 133 = b*9 + a
2. -242 = b*(-16) + a

Now let's solve for b and a.

From equation 1, we can express a as:
a = 133 - b*9           --- (3)

Substitute a into equation 2:
-242 = -16b + (133 - 9b)
-242 = -16b + 133 - 9b
-375 = -25b
b = 15

Now we find a using b = 15:

Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we simplify it to y = a + bx, since x^0 = 1 and x^1 = x.

Now, let's take two of the input-output pairs to set up two equations and solve for a and b:

For the pair (9, 133):
133 = a + b(9)

For the pair (-14, -212):
-212 = a + b(-14)

We now have a system of two equations:
1) a + 9b = 133
2) a - 14b = -212

We can solve this system by using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

By subtracting equation 2 from equation 1, we eliminate a:
1) a + 9b = 133
2) - (a - 14b) = 212

This leads to:
9b - (-14b) = 133 - (-212)
23b = 345
b = 345 / 23
b = 15

    Sure, let's find the linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the given inputs and outputs.

The formula simplifies to:
y = a + bx

We have several input-output pairs to determine the coefficients a and b:
(9, 133)
(19, 283)
(16, 238)
(-14, -212)
(-16, -242)

To find a and b, we can set up two equations using two pairs of inputs and outputs. I'll use the first two pairs for simplicity.

For the input-output pair (9, 133):
133 = a + b(9)

For the input-output pair (19, 283):
283 = a + b(19)

We can solve this system of linear equations to find the values of a and b. Let's subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the a term and solve for b.

(283 - 133) = a + b(19) - (a + b(9))
150 = b(19 - 9)
150 = b(10)
b = 150 / 10
b = 15

Now we can solve for a using b = 15 and one of the equations. Let's use the first one:
133 = a + b(9)
133 = a + 15(9)
133 = a + 135
a = 133 - 135
a = -2

Putting it all together, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:
Output: y = -2 + 15x

    ","To find the output for the input -4 using the function y = -2 + 15x, we substitute x with -4:

y = -2 - 60
y = -62

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To derive the function that captures the relationship between the given inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of ""a"" and ""b"". The term ax^0, where x^0 is always 1 for any non-zero x, can be seen as a constant, and bx^1 is our linear term, b times the input x.

Given the points:
(9, 133), (19, 283), (16, 238), (-14, -212), (-16, -242)

We can observe that increasing the input by 10 results in an increase of 150 in the output (for example, from 9 to 19 we increase from 133 to 283, and from 16 to -16 we decrease from 238 to -242, which is a change of -480 in output over a change of -32 in input, or 150 per 10 units of input).

Thus, we can deduce that b = 150/10 = 15.

To determine the constant term a, we need to substitute one of the points into the equation y = ax^0 + bx, and then solve for a.

Using the point (9, 133):
133 = a(1) + 15(9)
133 = a + 135
a = 133 - 135
a = -2

Therefore, the function that describes the data provided is:

    To solve for the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that ax^0 is a constant term (since any number to the power of zero equals 1), and bx^1 is simply bx (as any number to the power of one equals itself). So the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We are given five pairs of input-output pairs, which we can write as a system of equations:

1. For input 2: a + 2b = 59
2. For input -16: a - 16b = -301
3. For input -5: a - 5b = -81
4. For input 3: a + 3b = 79
5. For input -2: a - 2b = -21

Let's pick two equations to solve for a and b. We choose equations that make the computation easier, so let's use 1 and 5 for their small coefficients:

1. a + 2b = 59
5. a - 2b = -21

Adding these two equations will eliminate b and allow us to solve for a:

(a + 2b) + (a - 2b) = 59 - 21
2a = 38
a = 19

Now we can substitute the value of a into one of the equations to solve for b. Let's use equation 1:

19 + 2b = 59
2b = 59 - 19
2b = 40
b = 20

Now we have the values for 'a' and 'b'. Therefore, the function is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that ax^0 is equivalent to the constant term a, because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1 (assuming x is not 0). The second term bx^1 is just bx, as any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself. Our function is then y = a + bx.

We have the following pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y):

(2, 59)
(-16, -301)
(-5, -81)
(3, 79)
(-2, -21)

To find a and b, we can use two of these pairs to set up a system of linear equations. Let's select (2, 59) and (-16, -301):

For (2, 59):
59 = a + 2b   (1)

For (-16, -301):
-301 = a - 16b (2)

Now, let's solve this system of equations for a and b. Multiply equation (1) by 8 so we can use the elimination method:

8 * (59) = 8 * (a + 2b),
472 = 8a + 16b   (3)

Now add equation (2) to (3):

157 = 8a + 16b
-301 = a - 16b
-----------------
-301 + 157 = 8a + 16b + a - 16b
-144 = 9a
a = -144 / 9
a = -16

Now with the value of a, we can substitute it into either original equation to find b. Using equation (1):

59 = -16 + 2b
59 + 16 = 2b
75 = 2b
b = 75 / 2
b = 37.5

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the data, we need to determine the coefficients 'a' and 'b'. Since ax^0 is always a (because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), we can simplify the equation to y = a + bx.

Let's use the input-output pairs to form equations:

1. When input x = 2, output y = 59:
   59 = a + 2b

2. When input x = -16, output y = -301:
   -301 = a - 16b

3. When input x = -5, output y = -81:
   -81 = a - 5b

4. When input x = 3, output y = 79:
   79 = a + 3b

5. When input x = -2, output y = -21:
   -21 = a - 2b

We now have a system of equations. To solve for 'a' and 'b', we can use any two equations and solve them simultaneously. Let's use equations 1 and 5, because they will allow us to eliminate 'a' easily and solve for 'b'.

Equation 1:
59 = a + 2b

Equation 5:
-21 = a - 2b

By adding these two equations, we can cancel out 'a':

(59) + (-21) = (a + 2b) + (a - 2b)
38 = 2a

Now divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'a':

a = 19

Now we can solve for 'b' using the value of 'a' in either of the original equations. Let's use equation 1:

59 = 19 + 2b

Subtract 19 from both sides:

40 = 2b

Divide both sides by 2:

b = 20

Now we can write the function as:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Substitute 'a' and 'b' into the function:

y = 19x^0 + 20x^1

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^{0} + bx^{1} \), we are essentially looking for a linear equation of the form \( y = a + bx \), since \( x^{0} \) equates to 1 for any x except when x is zero.

We will use two pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Choosing the pairs with inputs 2 and -2 for convenience, we have:

For input 2:
\( 59 = a + 2b \) (1)

For input -2:
\( -21 = a - 2b \) (2)

Now, let's solve these two equations simultaneously to find \( a \) and \( b \).

Adding (1) and (2):
\( 59 + (-21) = (a + 2b) + (a - 2b) \)
\( 38 = 2a \)
\( a = 19 \)

Now that we have \( a \), we can solve for \( b \) using either equation (1) or (2); we'll use equation (1):

We need to find consistent values for a and b that will satisfy all these pairs. This can be done by solving the equations formed by these pairs but since we can infer from the pairs that the relationship seems to be linear (since it's in the form of y = a + bx), we will choose two pairs to form two equations and solve for a and b.

Let's use the following two pairs: (2, 59) and (-16, -301).
From the pair (2, 59), we get:
59 = a + b(2)  => 59 = a + 2b  ...(1)

From the pair (-16, -301), we get:
-301 = a + b(-16)  => -301 = a - 16b  ...(2)

Now we have a system of two equations that we can solve for a and b. Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to solve for b:

For input 13, output 55:

For input -20, output -44:
-44 = a - 20b

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Multiplying the second equation by 13 and the first one by 20 to eliminate a when we add them together:

13(-44) = 13a - 260b
20(55) = 20a + 260b

This simplifies to:

-572 = 13a - 260b
1100 = 20a + 260b

Now, add the two equations together:

(1) 20*55 = 20a + 260b
(2) 13*(-44)= 13a - 260b

Adding these two equations, we have:

y ≈ 75.4285714 + (-1.5714286)x

or in the exact reduced fraction form:
y = (528/7) - (11/7)x

Please note that these are least squares solution approximations based on the given data points, and using other pairs of equations could give us slightly different approximations due to rounding errors. However, with exact arithmetic, any two equations should yield the same result for a linear system.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the pattern that describes the input-output relationship in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to recognize that ax^0 is simply a constant (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is just bx (since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself).

We will use the provided input-output pairs to find values for a and b that fit the data:

1. For input 13, output is 55:
   55 = a(13^0) + b(13^1)
   55 = a + 13b

2. For input -20, output is -44:
   -44 = a(-20^0) + b(-20^1)
   -44 = a - 20b

Now we can use these two equations to solve for a and b.

From equation 1:
a + 13b = 55

From equation 2:
a - 20b = -44

Now we can solve these equations simultaneously for a and b. To do this, let's use elimination method by, for example, adding the two equations together to eliminate a:

(a + 13b) + (a - 20b) = 55 - 44
2a - 7b = 11
a - (7/2)b = 11/2

Now let's isolate a in the above equation:
a = (11/2) + (7/2)b

We can now use this expression for a and substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for b. We'll use equation 1 for simplicity:

(11/2) + (7/2)b + 13b = 55
Multiply everything by 2 to clear the fraction:
11 + 7b + 26b = 110
33b = 99
b = 99 / 33
b = 3

With the value of b known, we can solve for a:

a = (11/2) + (7/2)(3)
a = (11/2) + (21/2)
a = 32/2
a = 16

So, the function that seems to fit the provided data points is:
y = 16 + 3x

However, let's confirm it with other data points provided:

For input 15, output is 61:
61 = 16 + 3(15)
61 = 16 + 45
61 = 61  (True)

For input -1, output is 13:
13 = 16 + 3(-1)
13 = 16 - 3
13 = 13  (True)

For input -14, output is -26:
-26 = 16 + 3(-14)
-26 = 16 - 42
-26 = -26  (True)

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is y = 16 + 3x or, in the given form:

y = 16x^0 + 3x^1

    To come up with a linear function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we need to note that \(x^0\) is equal to 1 for any \(x\) that does not equal zero, and \(bx^1\) simplifies to \(bx\). Therefore, the function will look like:

\[y = a + bx\]

To determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\), we need to form a system of equations using the given input-output pairs. Let's use two points to derive the coefficients: 

Using the points (-11, 72) and (-2, 0):
For point (-11, 72):
\[72 = a + b(-11)\]
\[72 = a - 11b\]

For point (-2, 0):
\[0 = a + b(-2)\]
\[0 = a - 2b\]

We now have a system of two linear equations:

1. \(72 = a - 11b\)
2. \(0 = a - 2b\)

We can solve this system to find \(a\) and \(b\).

Subtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate \(a\):
\[72 - 0 = (a - 11b) - (a - 2b)\]
\[72 = -11b + 2b\]
\[72 = -9b\]
\[b = -72 / 9\]
\[b = -8\]

Now we plug \(b\) back into one of the equations to solve for \(a\), using the second equation:
\[0 = a - 2b\]
\[0 = a - 2(-8)\]
\[0 = a + 16\]
\[a = -16\]

So the function in the specified form would be:
\[y = -16 + (-8)x\]
\[y = -16 - 8x\]

This function fits the two points we used to derive it, but we need to verify if it fits the remaining points before we can confirm it describes the entire data set.

Checking if the function works for the other points:
For input -3:
\[y = -16 - 8(-3)\]
\[y = -16 + 24\]
\[y = 8\]
This matches the given output.

For input 18:
\[y = -16 - 8(18)\]
\[y = -16 - 144\]
\[y = -160\]
This matches the given output.

For input -7:
\[y = -16 - 8(-7)\]
\[y = -16 + 56\]
\[y = 40\]
This matches the given output.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To capture the relationship between the given inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the coefficients a and b which satisfy the equation for all given data points.

The equation y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is equal to 1 for all x ≠ 0.

We have five pairs of inputs and outputs:

1. For x = -11, y = 72
2. For x = -3, y = 8
3. For x = -2, y = 0
4. For x = 18, y = -160
5. For x = -7, y = 40

Let's substitute the values of x and y into the equation y = a + bx to get a system of equations:

1. 72 = a - 11b
2. 8 = a - 3b
3. 0 = a - 2b
4. -160 = a + 18b
5. 40 = a - 7b

Now, let's solve for a and b using these equations.

From equation 3, we get:
a = 2b

Now substitute a from equation 3 into the other equations to express them in terms of b:

1. 72 = 2b - 11b => -9b = 72 => b = 72 / -9 => b = -8
2. 8 = 2b - 3b => -b = 8 => b = -8 (which agrees with equation 1)
4. -160 = 2b + 18b => 20b = -160 => b = -160 / 20 => b = -8 (which also agrees)
5. 40 = 2b - 7b => -5b = 40 => b = 40 / -5 => b = -8 (which also agrees)

Since a = 2b, and we have determined that b = -8:
a = 2 * (-8) => a = -16

So the function that best describes the given points is:
y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -16 + (-8)x

    To write the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we recognize that \( ax^0 \) is simply \( a \) because any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1. Hence, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Our goal is to find the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the given input-output pairs:

1. For Input: -11, Output: 72, we have:
\[ 72 = a + b(-11) \]

2. For Input: -3, Output: 8, we have:
\[ 8 = a + b(-3) \]

\[ -160 = a + b(18) \]

5. For Input: -7, Output: 40, we have:
\[ 40 = a + b(-7) \]

To solve for \( a \) and \( b \), we can use two of the input-output pairs as a system of linear equations. However, looking at the inputs and outputs given, it's clear that there is no single linear function that will pass through all five of these points, as they do not align in a straight line pattern.

Regardless, if we attempt to solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using two of the equations (as we cannot solve for more than two unknowns with only two equations), we might pick the points which suggest a linear relationship. We could use the points (Input: -2, Output: 0) and (Input: -3, Output: 8), because they seem to suggest a clearer line (they are close together and might provide a decent approximation of the slope).

So for these two points, we have:
1. \( 0 = a - 2b \)
2. \( 8 = a - 3b \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( a \):
\( 8 - 0 = (a - 3b) - (a - 2b) \)
\( 8 = -b \)

Now we find \( b \):
\( b = -8 \)

Then using \( b \) to solve for \( a \) using the first equation:
\( 0 = a - 2(-8) \)
\( 0 = a + 16 \)
\( a = -16 \)

Therefore, the function that approximates the relationship between the inputs and outputs given these two points would be:
\[ y = -16 - 8x \]

    To find a linear function that fits the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can understand this as y = a + bx, where a and b are constants that we want to determine. The general form of a line in algebra is y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept. In this case, a corresponds to c (y-intercept) and b corresponds to m (slope).

Based on the given inputs and outputs, we need to find a consistent pattern that would allow us to determine a and b. We have been given five points that lie on the line described by the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Let's represent each input-output pair as coordinates (x, y):
(-11, 72)
(-3, 8)
(-2, 0)
(18, -160)
(-7, 40)

We can start by using any two points to calculate the slope b of the line (remembering that the slope is the change in y divided by the change in x):

Let's take points (-2, 0) and (-3, 8):
b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (0 - 8) / (-2 - (-3))
b = (-8) / (1)
b = -8

Now we have the slope, so the equation looks like y = a - 8x.

To find a, we can substitute any point into this equation and solve for a. Let's use the point (-2, 0):

0 = a - 8*(-2)
0 = a + 16
a = -16

Now, we have both a and b, so we can write the function:

y = -16 - 8x

However, let's verify this function with the other given points to make sure it's consistent with them:

For x = -11:
y = -16 - 8*(-11)
y = -16 + 88
y = 72 (which matches the given output)

For x = 18:
y = -16 - 8*18
y = -16 - 144
y = -160 (which matches the given output)

For x = -7:
y = -16 - 8*(-7)
y = -16 + 56
y = 40 (which matches the given output)

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is equivalent to y = a + bx (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), we need to find constants a and b that fit the data given.

We have pairs of inputs and outputs that we can use to form equations:

1. When input (x) is -11, output (y) is 72:
   72 = a + b(-11)

2. When input (x) is -3, output (y) is 8:
   8 = a + b(-3)

3. When input (x) is -2, output (y) is 0:
   0 = a + b(-2)

   -160 = a + b(18)

5. When input (x) is -7, output (y) is 40:
   40 = a + b(-7)

We can solve this system of equations using various methods like substitution or linear regression. However, to simplify the process, let's pick two equations and solve for a and b:

From equation 3:
a = -2b

Let's use this a in equation 4 to find b:
-160 = (-2b) + b(18)
-160 = -2b + 18b
-160 = 16b
b = -160 / 16
b = -10

Now we have the value for b, we can solve for a:

    To find a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that represents the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y), it is equivalent to finding a function of the form y = a + bx, since x^0 is always 1.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we have the following systems of equations:

1) For input 11: -204 = a + 11b
2) For input -4:  66 = a - 4b
3) For input -17: 300 = a - 17b
4) For input -15: 264 = a - 15b
5) For input 20: -366 = a + 20b

We can solve these equations using any two points to find the values of a and b. Let's use inputs 11 and -4 to set up two simultaneous equations:

-204 = a + 11b  ...(1)
66 = a - 4b     ...(2)

Adding equations (1) and (2) eliminates a, leading to:

-204 + 66 = a + 11b + a - 4b
-138 = 2a + 7b
-69 = a + (7/2)b       ...(3)

Now, let's isolate a in equation (2) and substitute into equation (1):

66 = a - 4b  =>  a = 66 + 4b  ...(4)

Substituting equation (4) into equation (1):

-204 = (66 + 4b) + 11b
-204 = 66 + 15b
-204 - 66 = 15b

    Given the data and the specified form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can understand that we are dealing with a linear function of the form:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, and \( x \) is the input. The term \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \), because any non-zero number to the power of 0 is 1.

Let's find \( a \) and \( b \) using two data points:

1. \( x = 11, y = -204 \)
\[ -204 = a + 11b \]

2. \( x = -4, y = 66 \)
\[ 66 = a - 4b \]

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply the second equation by 11 to align the \( a \) coefficients:

\[ 11 \times 66 = 11a - 44b \]
\[ 726 = 11a - 44b \]

Keep the first equation as is:

\[ -204 = a + 11b \]

Now add the two equations together to eliminate \( a \):

\[ 726 - 204 = 11a - 44b + a + 11b \]
\[ 522 = 12a - 33b \]

We simplified to:

\[ 522 = 12a - 33b \] (Equation 3)

We could now choose another pair of input-output to create another system and solve it together with Equation 3, but since we need to express \( a \) and \( b \) explicitly using only the given form, we are limited; however, we can assume that if there is indeed a consistent linear relationship, any two points would suffice to find \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's use the pair \( x = -17, y = 300 \) to create our second system:

\[ 300 = a - 17b \] (Equation 4)

Now we have two equations (Equation 3 and Equation 4) and two unknowns (\( a \) and \( b \)). We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using either substitution or elimination, but we should be aware that since we are using different points than we used to create the first set of equations, if the system is not exactly linear or contains some error, we will not get the same \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's now solve the system formed by Equations 3 and 4. Multiplying Equation 4 by 12 to match the \( a \) coefficient from Equation 3:

\[ 12 \times 300 = 12a - 204b \]
\[ 3600 = 12a - 204b \] (Equation 5)

Now subtract Equation 3 from Equation 5 to solve for \( b \):

\[ 3600 - 522 = 12a - 204b - 12a + 33b \]
\[ 3078 = -171b \]

\[ b = \frac{3078}{-171} \]
\[ b = -18 \]

Plug \( b = -18 \) into Equation 4:

\[ 300 = a - 17(-18) \]
\[ 300 = a + 306 \]
\[ a = 300 - 306 \]
\[ a = -6 \]

Now we'll solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate a:

(-366) - (-204) = (a + 20b) - (a + 11b)
-366 + 204 = 20b - 11b

b = -162 / 9

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we essentially need to find a linear function y = b * x + a, since ax^0 is just a constant term (a) and bx^1 is bx.

The general form of a linear equation is y = mx + c, where m is the slope of the line and c is the y-intercept. In the context of the form requested (y = ax^0 + bx^1), the equivalent is y = b * x + a, where 'b' is the slope and 'a' is the y-intercept.

Given the data points:

b = (66 - (-204)) / (-4 - 11)
b = (66 + 204) / (-15)

-204 = -18*11 + a
-204 = -198 + a
a = -204 + 198
a = -6

Therefore, the linear function that fits the data provided is:

y = -18x - 6

In the requested form it would be written as:

y = -6x^0 - 18x^1

Please note that this function is determined based on the assumption that the relationship between inputs and outputs is linear, which the provided data may not necessarily follow exactly. Ideally, more data points would be used to determine the most accurate linear fit using methods such as least squares regression. However, with the limited data points given, this function provides the closest linear relationship based on the form requested.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the pairs of input (x) and output (y) and the requested form of the function, y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are essentially looking for a linear function where ax^0 is a constant term (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is a linear term (since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself).

Let's solve for a and b to match the provided data points:

Using the data point (11, -204), we have:
-204 = a*11^0 + b*11^1
-204 = a + 11b

Using the data point (-4, 66), we have:
66 = a*(-4)^0 + b*(-4)^1
66 = a - 4b

Now we can set up a system of equations to solve for a and b:
1) a + 11b = -204
2) a - 4b = 66

We can solve the system of equations by various methods, such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's use the elimination method:

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
(1) a + 11b = -204
(2) - (a -   4b =   66)

This results in the following when simplifying:
15b = -270

Solving for b gives us:
b = -270 / 15
b = -18

Now we can substitute the value of b into either of the original equations to solve for a. Let's substitute b into the second equation:

a - 4(-18) = 66
a + 72 = 66
a = 66 - 72
a = -6

Now we've solved for both a and b, our function is:

y = a*x^0 + b*x^1
y = -6*x^0 - 18*x^1
y = -6*1 - 18x
y = -6 - 18x

    To define the function y in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which can be simplified to y = a + bx since x^0 = 1 for any x except x = 0), we need to determine the constants a and b that fit the provided input-output pairs. This form represents a simple linear equation with y being the output, x the input, and a and b being coefficients.

Given the pairs:
(-12, 9)
(20, -55)
(-4, -7)
(-10, 5)
(8, -31)

We can set up a system of equations to solve for a and b using two of these points (we can use more to check for consistency, but only two are needed to determine a unique solution for a linear equation):

Using the points (-12, 9) and (20, -55), we get:
1. 9 = a + (-12)b
2. -55 = a + 20b

Now, we can solve this system of equations for a and b. Let's use the method of substitution or elimination. I will demonstrate the elimination method:

First, arrange the equations:
a - 12b = 9    ...(1)
a + 20b = -55  ...(2)

Now, to eliminate a, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
a + 20b - (a - 12b) = -55 - 9
a + 20b - a + 12b = -55 - 9
32b = -64
b = -64 / 32
b = -2

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using either equation. Let's use equation 1:
a - 12(-2) = 9
a + 24 = 9
a = 9 - 24
a = -15

Thus, the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the provided data points is:

1. (-12, 9)
2. (20, -55)
3. (-4, -7)
4. (-10, 5)
5. (8, -31)

We can set up two equations from two of the pairs to solve for a and b. Let's use the first two pairs to do this:

For input -12 and output 9:
9 = a + b(-12) -> Equation 1

For input 20 and output -55:
-55 = a + b(20) -> Equation 2

Let's solve these two equations simultaneously:

From Equation 1:
a = 9 + 12b -> Equation 3

Substitute Equation 3 into Equation 2:
-55 = (9 + 12b) + 20b
-55 = 9 + 32b
-55 - 9 = 32b
-64 = 32b
b = -2

Now let's find a:
a = 9 + 12b
a = 9 + 12(-2)
a = 9 - 24
a = -15

So, the function that fits the input-output pairs is:
y = -15 + (-2)x

y = -15 - 2x

We can verify this solution by plugging in the other input values, but since you've only asked for the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 given the inputs and outputs, the function you're looking for is:

    To find the function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we are looking for a linear function such as `y = a + bx`, where `x` is the input and `y` is the output. To determine the coefficients `a` and `b`, we can set up a system of equations using the input-output pairs provided.

We will use two pairs to solve for `a` and `b`, and then check if our function matches the other given points. Let's use the points (-12, 9) and (20, -55):

1. For the input -12:
\[ 9 = a + b(-12) \]
\[ 9 = a - 12b \]

2. For the input 20:
\[ -55 = a + b(20) \]
\[ -55 = a + 20b \]

Now we have two equations:
\[ 9 = a - 12b \tag{1} \]
\[ -55 = a + 20b \tag{2} \]

If we subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2), we can solve for `b`:
\[ -55 - 9 = (a + 20b) - (a - 12b) \]
\[ -64 = 32b \]
\[ b = -64 / 32 \]
\[ b = -2 \]

Now we will solve for `a` by substituting `b = -2` into Equation (1):
\[ 9 = a - 12(-2) \]
\[ 9 = a + 24 \]
\[ a = 9 - 24 \]
\[ a = -15 \]

So the function is:
\[ y = -15 + (-2)x \]
or written in the requested format:
\[ y = -15x^0 - 2x^1 \]

Let's quickly check with the other given input-output pairs to ensure our derived function is correct:

For input -4:
\[ y = -15 + (-2)(-4) \]
\[ y = -15 + 8 \]
\[ y = -7 \]

For input -10:

\[ y = -15 + 20 \]
\[ y = 5 \]

    To find the coefficients `a` and `b` in the function of the form

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

we will use two of the provided input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations. Since \( x^0 \) is always 1, the function simplifies to

\[ y = a + bx \]

Let's pick two input-output pairs to create our system. We'll use the pairs (-12, 9) and (20, -55). Plugging these into our function gives us:

\[ 9 = a + b(-12) \]
\[ -55 = a + b(20) \]

Now, let’s solve this system of equations for `a` and `b`.

From the first equation:
\[ a = 9 + 12b \]

Substitute `a` from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ -55 = (9 + 12b) + 20b \]

Combine like terms:
\[ -55 = 9 + 32b \]

Move the constant term to the other side:
\[ -55 - 9 = 32b \]

\[ -64 = 32b \]

Solve for `b`:
\[ b = -64 / 32 \]
\[ b = -2 \]

Now that we have `b`, we can substitute it back into the equation for `a`:
\[ a = 9 + 12(-2) \]
\[ a = 9 - 24 \]

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the values of a and b that satisfy this relationship for each given input-output pair. Given that x^0 is always 1 for any x ≠ 0, we can rewrite the function as y = a + bx, where a and b are constants that we need to find.

From the problem, we have the following pairs of input and output:

1. For x = -12, y = 9
2. For x = 20, y = -55
3. For x = -4, y = -7
4. For x = -10, y = 5
5. For x = 8, y = -31

Let's form a system of equations based on these pairs and try to solve for a and b.

9 = a + b(-12)
-55 = a + b(20)
-7 = a + b(-4)
5 = a + b(-10)
-31 = a + b(8)

Now, we could try to solve this system of equations using methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. However, since we have more equations than variables, the system is overdetermined. There may not be an exact solution that satisfies all equations, hence we can opt for a method that finds an approximate solution, such as least-squares regression.

For this situation, however, since you've asked for an exact form, it seems that there is no perfect solution that fits this as a linear function. Therefore, let's choose two of the given points (any two, as long as they are not the same point) and solve for a and b. This solution will only be approximate and will only exactly fit the two points chosen, not all of the data provided. Let's use the first and second points for this purpose.

From point 1:
9 = a - 12b

From point 2:
-55 = a + 20b

Let's solve this system using the method of elimination or substitution. First, we isolate a in the first equation:

a = 9 + 12b

Then we substitute this back into the second equation:

-55 = (9 + 12b) + 20b
-55 = 9 + 32b
-64 = 32b
b = -64 / 32
b = -2

Having determined b, we can now find a:

a = 9 + 12(-2)
a = 9 - 24
a = -15

So an approximate linear function that fits the first two points, ignoring the rest, is:

y = -15 + (-2)x
y = -15 - 2x

    The function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is basically a linear equation, where x represents the input and y represents the output. The constants a and b represent the y-intercept and the slope of the line, respectively. The term ax^0 is equal to a, since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

With the given input-output pairs, we can write the following equations based on the equation form y = a + bx:

For Input: -16, Output: 82
82 = a - 16b ...(1)

52 = a - 11b ...(2)

For Input: -18, Output: 94
94 = a - 18b ...(4)

For Input: 3, Output: -32
-32 = a + 3b ...(5)

We need to solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. One strategy is to pick two equations and solve them simultaneously for a and b.

If we take Equations (1) and (3):

(1) 82 = a - 16b
(3) -98 = a + 14b

We can then add these two equations to eliminate a:

82 - 98 = a - 16b + a + 14b
-16 = 2a - 2b
-8 = a - b ...(6)

Now we can isolate a or b in this equation. Let's find a in terms of b:

-8 + b = a ...(7)

Now we can use this expression for a in one of the original equations to find b. Let's use Equation (1):

82 = (-8 + b) - 16b
82 = -8 + b - 16b
82 = -8 - 15b
82 + 8 = -15b
90 = -15b
b = -6

Now we can find a using Equation (7):

-8 + b = a
-8 - 6 = a
a = -14

For Input 3, Output -32:
-32 = a + 3b

To solve this system of equations, we can use any two pairs to solve for a and b. Since we're looking for a pattern, we should choose two equations that would simplify the process. However, we need to ensure that our final a and b values are consistent across all the given data points.

Let's use the pairs from Input -16, Output 82 and Input 14, Output -98:

82 = a - 16b
-98 = a + 14b

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1)  82 = a - 16b
2) -98 = a + 14b

We can stack these equations and add them to eliminate the a variable and solve for b first:

(82) + (-98) = (a - 16b) + (a + 14b)
-16 = 2a - 2b
-8 = a - b

Now let's express a in terms of b using equation (1):

82 = a - 16b
a = 82 + 16b

Let's substitute this expression into the equation -8 = a - b:

-8 = (82 + 16b) - b
-8 = 82 + 15b
-90 = 15b
b = -6

Now we can substitute b back into the expression for a:

a = 82 + 16b
a = 82 + 16(-6)
a = 82 - 96
a = -14

So, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -14x^0 - 6x^1
y = -14 - 6x

However, we should check this function against all data points to ensure it is consistent. After substitution:

2. 52 = a - 11b

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate 'a':

From Input -16 (Equation 1):
82 = a - 16b ... (1)

From Input 14 (Equation 3):
-98 = a + 14b ... (2)

Now we'll solve this system of equations using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

From Equation (1), we can express a as:
a = 82 + 16b

Now we substitute a in Equation (2) with the result from above:
-98 = (82 + 16b) + 14b
-98 = 82 + 16b + 14b
-98 = 82 + 30b
-98 - 82 = 30b
-180 = 30b
b = -180 / 30
b = -6

Now we substitute b back into Equation (1) to solve for a:

a = 82 - 96
a = -14

So the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find the equation of the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b. This form is essentially a linear equation y = a + bx, where ax^0 is a constant term (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is a linear term.

Given the data points:

(-16, 82), (-11, 52), (14, -98), (-18, 94), and (3, -32),

We can set up two equations using two of the data points to solve for a and b in the form y = a + bx. Based on the provided points, let's use (-16, 82) and (14, -98) for more diversity in the input range:

For input -16 and output 82:
82 = a + b(-16)

For input 14 and output -98:
-98 = a + b(14)

Let's solve this system of two equations:

1) 82 = a - 16b
2) -98 = a + 14b

Now we will multiply the second equation by 1 to easily eliminate a when we add the two equations together:

1) 82 = a - 16b
2*) -98 = a + 14b

Then, add these two equations together:

82 - 98 = a - 16b + a + 14b
-16 = 2a - 2b
-8 = a - b

Now we have a new equation relating a and b. Let's solve for b using the relationship found by dividing both sides by -2 from the equation obtained above:

-8 = a - b  ->  b = a + 8

Now we will insert b into one of the original equations to find the value of a. Let's use equation 1):

82 = a - 16b
82 = a - 16(a + 8)
82 = a - 16a - 128
82 = -15a - 128
210 = -15a
a = -14

Now that we have a, we can find b:

b = a + 8
b = -14 + 8
b = -6

Therefore, the function that describes the relation between inputs and outputs in the form Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = -14x^0 - 6x^1

Which simplifies to:

y = -14 - 6x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Input: -12
    ","To find the output for the input -12 using the derived function y = -14 - 6x, we substitute x with -12:

y = -14 - 6(-12)
y = -14 + 72
y = 58

Therefore, the output is:

Output: 58",58,True,"[-6, -14]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    From the given input-output pairs, we need to find constants a and b such that the output y can be described by the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 for any given input x. The term ax^0 is equivalent to a because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Let's use two of the given pairs of inputs and outputs as simultaneous equations to solve for a and b:

1. Using the input-output pair (-1, -7):
-7 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1
-7 = a - b  (since (-1)^0 = 1 and (-1)^1 = -1)

2. Using the input-output pair (3, 9):
9 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1
9 = a + 3b (since (3)^0 = 1 and (3)^1 = 3)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
I. -7 = a - b
II. 9 = a + 3b

We can solve this system by adding the two equations together to solve for a:
I + II: -7 + 9 = (a - b) + (a + 3b)
2 = 2a + 2b
a + b = 1       (Dividing both sides by 2)

Now, we can use this new equation a + b = 1 to solve for b by using equation I:
a = 1 - b
Substituting a in I:
-7 = (1 - b) - b
-7 = 1 - 2b
-2b = -7 - 1
-2b = -8
b = 4

Now using the value of b to solve for a:
a + 4 = 1
a = 1 - 4
a = -3

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -3x^0 + 4x^1
y = -3 + 4x

So the final function is:
y = -3 + 4x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the given inputs (x values) and outputs (y values), we should understand that ax^0 is simply a, since any number to the power of zero is one. So our function will look like y = a + bx, where a and b are constants that we need to determine.

Given that we have multiple points (x, y), we can plug these into our equation and form a system of equations to solve for a and b.

Let’s use the given points to set up some equations:

1. For input -18 and output -75:
-75 = a - 18b

2. For input -1 and output -7:
-7 = a - 1b or -7 = a - b

3. For input 3 and output 9:
9 = a + 3b

4. For input 2 and output 5:
5 = a + 2b

Since we are only looking for a single function that fits all points, we expect the values of a and b to work for all equations. However, it's quite possible that there is no single function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits all these points exactly, since they may not lie on the same line. Still, we can check if a solution exists that works for all the provided point pairs.

Let's choose two equations and solve for a and b. We'll use equations (2) and (4) since they seem simpler and are less likely to involve calculation mistakes due to the smaller coefficients.

From equation 2:
-7 = a - b

From equation 4:
5 = a + 2b

Now, we can solve for a and b using these two equations. Adding the two equations together to eliminate b gives us:
-2 = 2a + b + a - b
-2 = 3a
a = -2/3

Now we can use the value of a to find b, by substituting a into either of the two equations. We'll use equation 4:
5 = (-2/3) + 2b
5 + 2/3 = 2b
(15 + 2)/3 = 2b
17/3 = 2b
b = 17/6

However, we need to check whether these values for a and b hold true for the other two equations. Let's substitute into equation 1:
-75 = (-2/3) - 18(17/6)
-75 = (-2/3) - (3*17)
-75 = (-2/3) - 51

This does not equal -75, so we've found an inconsistency. Furthermore, because one set of a and b does not satisfy all four equations, the original assumption - that there is one linear function of the form y = a + bx that fits all points - is incorrect.

Thus, there is no function in the specific form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that accurately captures the relationship between inputs and outputs for all given data points. The relationship between the given inputs and outputs cannot be described by a simple linear function.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    The given data points are:

(-18, -75), (-1, -7), (3, 9), (-18, -75), and (2, 5)

We are looking for a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to:

y = a + bx

This equation suggests a linear relationship between x and y. To find the coefficients a and b, we need to solve a system of equations created by plugging in the data points into the equation.

Given that we have more than two points and the points do not all lie on the same line, there might not be an exact solution (perfect fit) for the coefficients a and b. Instead, we can aim at finding the best linear fit for the data given. This fit can be found using methods like least squares regression.

However, considering the form of the equation and the specific nature of this task, we can attempt to determine a and b by inspection considering the provided data points.

One approach would be to use two data points to solve for a and b since that's enough to determine a line. However, since we want to fit the line to all provided data as best as possible, it's best to either choose two points that we feel are most representative of the data or compute the best-fit line if inspection doesn't immediately yield a result.

Using the points (2, 5) and (3, 9), we can set up two equations based on the presumed linear formula:

5 = a + 2b
9 = a + 3b

Solving for a and b from these two equations:

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
9 - 5 = a + 3b - (a + 2b)
4 = b

Plugging b = 4 back into the first equation:
5 = a + 2(4)
5 = a + 8
a = 5 - 8
a = -3

So, we have the coefficients a = -3 and b = 4. Substituting these into our function, we get:

y = -3 + 4x

The data points (-18, -75) and (-1, -7), however, do not fit perfectly into this equation, which indicates either some data might have noise or error, or a simple linear function may not be the best fit for all data points. A linear regression for all points would find a line that minimizes the overall error but might not pass through any of the points exactly.

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can use two data points to set up and solve a system of linear equations. However, considering we have multiple data points here, let's ensure that the function is consistent with all the given input-output pairs.

Considering the equation \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), and noting that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x (aside from x being 0), the equation simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Let's set up the equations using two different input-output pairs (I'll choose the pairs (-1, -7) and (2, 5) for variety):

From input -1 and output -7:
\[ -7 = a + b(-1) \]
\[ a - b = -7 \]

From input 2 and output 5:
\[ 5 = a + b(2) \]
\[ a + 2b = 5 \]

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations for a and b.

Starting with the two equations:

1. \( a - b = -7 \)
2. \( a + 2b = 5 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

\( (a + 2b) - (a - b) = 5 - (-7) \)

This simplifies to:

\( 3b = 12 \)

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

\[ b = 4 \]

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either of the first two equations to find a. Let's use the first equation:

\[ a - 4 = -7 \]

Adding 4 to both sides gives us:

\[ a = -3 \]

So the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) with the coefficients we've found is:

\[ y = -3 + 4x \]

This function should now be tested against all provided data points to ensure accuracy throughout. Upon testing, we can see that the function works perfectly for the inputs 2 and -1:

For input -1: \( y = -3 + 4(-1) = -3 - 4 = -7 \) (matches given output)
For input 2: \( y = -3 + 4(2) = -3 + 8 = 5 \) (matches given output)

However, we need to confirm consistency with the other given data points. For example, taking input 3:

For input 3: \( y = -3 + 4(3) = -3 + 12 = 9 \) (matches given output)

And for input -18:

For input -18: \( y = -3 + 4(-18) = -3 - 72 = -75 \) (matches given output)

    Given the set of input-output pairs:

(-18, -75), (-1, -7), (3, 9), (-18, -75), (2, 5), 

We observe that the function has the form of a line:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

In this equation, a and b are coefficients that we have to find to best fit the given data. Since ax^0 is essentially a (as anything to the power of 0 is 1), we rewrite the equation in the standard form for a linear equation:

y = a + bx

Now we need to find the values of a and b. However, we are given multiple points which don't seem to lie on the same straight line (which is a requirement for them to be describable by a single linear equation in the form y = a + bx). Due to this mismatch, finding a single pair of a and b that fits all given points exactly is not possible.

Nonetheless, by inspection of the input-output pairs, we can detect a possible linear pattern:

Input: -1
Output: -7

This can give us one point, (-1, -7). And another point:

Input: 2
Output: 5

This is the second point, (2, 5).

Using these two points, we can find the slope (b):

b = (Output2 - Output1) / (Input2 - Input1)
b = (5 - (-7)) / (2 - (-1))
b = 12 / 3
b = 4

Now that we have the slope of the line, we can find a by plugging one of the points into the equation y = a + 4x. We'll use the point (2, 5).

5 = a + 4(2)
5 = a + 8
a = 5 - 8
a = -3

Therefore, our function describing the data as closely as possible with a linear approximation through the points (-1, -7) and (2, 5) is:

    To find a function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first need to understand that \( x^0 \) is equal to 1 for any value of x (except when x=0), and \( bx^1 \) is simply bx. So, we are essentially looking for a function of the form \( y = a + bx \), where a and b are constants.

Given the data points:

\[

(-10, -70) &\Rightarrow -70 = a - 10b \\
\end{align*}
\]

By looking at the data provided, we can identify a pattern that the output is 12 times the input plus 2:

When the input is 6, \( 6 \times 12 + 2 = 74 \)

When the input is 19, \( 19 \times 12 + 2 = 191 \)

We can also see this pattern holds for the negative inputs:

When the input is -11, \( -11 \times 12 + 2 = -130 + 2 = -128 \), but it should result in -79. Since this doesn't align with the negative input outputs, let's correct the understanding by checking with more values.

With the input of -5, \( 5 \times 12 + 2 = 60 + 2 = 62 \), not -25 as it should be. The pattern does not hold here, so we made a mistake and should recalculate.

Let's examine the relationship again:

For the input 6, the output is 74. If we assume that 'b' is multiplied by 6 to give us the part of the output that is dependent on the input, the rest must be a constant 'a'. We can try finding 'b' first using the provided pairs, and then we'll solve for 'a'.

Taking two positive input/output pairs for simplicity:

For input 6 and output 74,
\[ a + 6b = 74 \]

For input 19 and output 191,
\[ a + 19b = 191 \]

Let's attempt to simplify this to find 'b' by isolating 'a':

From the first equation,
\[ a = 74 - 6b \]

Substituting 'a' from the first equation into the second gives us:
\[ 74 - 6b + 19b = 191 \]
\[ 13b = 191 - 74 \]
\[ 13b = 117 \]
\[ b = 117 / 13 \]
\[ b = 9 \]

Now we find 'a' using the value of 'b' (9) in one of our original equations:
\[ a + 6b = 74 \]
\[ a + 6 \times 9 = 74 \]
\[ a + 54 = 74 \]
\[ a = 74 - 54 \]
\[ a = 20 \]

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

\[ y = 20 + 9x \]

\[ y = 20x^0 + 9x^1 \]

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we will use the provided data points to determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1. We can initially rewrite the function as y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 for any value of x (except for x=0) and x^1 is just x.

Now let's analyze the given data points:

When x = 6, y = 74
When x = 19, y = 191
When x = -11, y = -79
When x = -5, y = -25
When x = -10, y = -70

We can see that as x changes, y changes at a constant rate. This implies that b corresponds to this rate of change. To find b, we can divide the change in y by the change in x for any two data points where x changes. For example, using the first two data points:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (191 - 74) / (19 - 6)
b = 117 / 13
b = 9

Now that we have b, we can find a by substituting the value of b into one of our original equations. Again, let's use the first data point (x = 6, y = 74):

y = a + bx
74 = a + 9(6)
74 = a + 54
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

Now we have both coefficients, a and b. Plugging these into our original form, we get:

y = 20x^0 + 9x^1

Or simplifying, since x^0 is 1,

y = 20 + 9x

Let's verify this function using another data point (x = -10, y = -70):

y = 20 + 9x
y = 20 + 9(-10)
y = 20 - 90

5. For input -10, output -70:
-70 = a - 10b

By examining these equations, we need to find values for a and b that make all these equations true simultaneously. Let's investigate the changes in output as we change the input:

Moving from point 4 to point 1 (input from -5 to 6), output changes from -25 to 74:
74 - (-25) = 99
6 - (-5) = 11

99 is the change in output when the input changes by 11 units, which suggests that b could be 99 / 11 = 9.

Let's verify this with another interval, like from point 5 to point 3 (input from -10 to -11), output changes from -70 to -79:
-79 - (-70) = -9
-11 - (-10) = -1

The change in output is -9 when the input changes by -1 units, which again suggests that b = -9 / -1 = 9.

Since we are seeing a consistent pattern, let's assume b = 9 and solve for a using one of the equations:

Using point 1 (input 6, output 74):
74 = a + 6 * 9
74 = a + 54
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

With these values for a and b, we have the function:

For input 19: y = 20 + 9(19) = 20 + 171 = 191 (matches the output)
For input -11: y = 20 + 9(-11) = 20 - 99 = -79 (matches the output)

Now that we have ""b"", we can solve for ""a"" using either Equation 1 or Equation 2. Let's use Equation 1:

74 = a + 6 * 9
74 = a + 54
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

Now we've found ""a"" and ""b"":

a = 20
b = 9

Thus, the function that seems to fit the data is:

y = 20 + 9x

However, if we test this function with some of the other provided data points, such as x = -11, according to our function, y would be:

y = 20 + 9(-11)
y = 20 - 99
y = -79

Which matches the given output. Doing a similar check for the other data points should yield matching results if our derived function is correct. Assuming we've done this for all provided points and all points match, we have the correct function:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given input-output pairs, we can recognize that x^0 is simply 1 for any x, so the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given this, let's look at the given data and see if we can identify a pattern:

For input 6, output is 74:
74 = a + b(6)

For input 19, output is 191:
191 = a + b(19)

For input -11, output is -79:
-79 = a + b(-11)

For input -5, output is -25:
-25 = a + b(-5)

For input -10, output is -70:
-70 = a + b(-10)

Looking at the pairs, it seems the output varies linearly with the input, indicating b is constant. To find b, we can take two input-output pairs and create two equations, then solve for b:

Taking the input-output pairs (6, 74) and (19, 191), we get:
74 = a + 6b
191 = a + 19b

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:
191 - 74 = (a + 19b) - (a + 6b)
117 = 13b
b = 117 / 13
b = 9

Now we can use this value of b to find a. Using the pair (6, 74):
74 = a + 6(9)
74 = a + 54
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:
y = 20 + 9x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    From the given input-output pairs, it looks like the output can be determined by a linear relationship. The general form of a linear equation is y = ax + b, but the task requires us to express this function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Note that x^0 is always 1 for any x except for x = 0. Therefore, the term `ax^0` is equivalent to `a`, because `a * 1 = a`. So our task is to represent our equation in the form y = a + bx.

Here are the given input-output pairs:
1. For input x = 6, output y = 8
2. For input x = -5, output y = -25
3. For input x = -3, output y = -19
4. For input x = -10, output y = -40
5. For input x = -14, output y = -52

Looking at the inputs and outputs, one might notice that the output is decreasing by 4 whenever the input decreases by 1. This is characteristic of a slope (b) in the linear equation. So we can hypothesize that b = -4.

To find a, we can use one of the input-output pairs and substitute b = -4 into the equation y = a + bx. Let's choose the first pair for this purpose:

8 = a + (−4)(6)
8 = a - 24
a = 8 + 24
a = 32

So the proposed function would be:
y = 32 + (-4)x

Expressing this in the required format (y = ax^0 + bx^1), we get:
Output: y = 32x^0 + (-4)x^1

Since x^0 = 1, this simplifies to:
Output: y = 32 + (-4)x

    To define a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of a and b that will satisfy the given input-output pairs. The term ax^0 is a constant term because anything raised to the power of zero is 1. Therefore, ax^0 can be thought of as just a constant, c. So, we are essentially looking for a function of the form y = c + bx.

Given the pairs:

    Input: 6    Output: 8   ⇒  c + 6b = 8
    Input: -5   Output: -25 ⇒  c - 5b = -25
    Input: -3   Output: -19 ⇒  c - 3b = -19
    Input: -10  Output: -40 ⇒  c - 10b = -40
    Input: -14  Output: -52 ⇒  c - 14b = -52

We can use the given pairs to set up a system of equations and solve for c and b.

Let's take two equations to solve for c and b:

c + 6b = 8      (1)
c - 5b = -25    (2)

If we subtract (2) from (1), we get:

(6b + c) - (-5b + c) = 8 - (-25)
6b + c + 5b - c = 8 + 25
11b = 33
b = 33 / 11
b = 3

Now that we have b, we can use it to find c:

c + 6b = 8
c + 6(3) = 8
c + 18 = 8
c = 8 - 18
c = -10

    Observing the given input-output pairs, we can attempt to determine the constants `a` and `b` for the linear function `y = ax^0 + bx^1`. The equation simplifies to `y = a + bx` since `x^0` equals `1` for all x except 0, and `x^1` equals x.

Let's plug in the pairs one by one to find a pattern:

1. For input 6, output 8:
   `8 = a + 6b`

2. For input -5, output -25:
   `-25 = a - 5b`

4. For input -10, output -40:
   `-40 = a - 10b`

5. For input -14, output -52:
   `-52 = a - 14b`

To find `a` and `b`, we can use any two of these equations and solve them simultaneously. Let's use the first and second equations for a simpler computation:

From the first equation:
`8 = a + 6b` --> (1)

From the second equation:
`-25 = a - 5b` --> (2)

Add equation (1) and (2) to eliminate `a`:
`8 + (-25) = (a + 6b) + (a - 5b)`
`-17 = 2a + b`
`b = -17 - 2a` --> (3)

Now let's substitute `b` from equation (3) into equation (1):
`8 = a + 6(-17 - 2a)`
`8 = a - 102 - 12a`
`11a = 110`
`a = 10`

Now substitute `a` back into equation (3) to find `b`:
`b = -17 - 2 * 10`
`b = -17 - 20`
`b = -37`

    To find the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) that best explain the relationship between the input (x) and the output (y).

Given that \(x^0 = 1\) for any value of x (except for x=0), and \( bx^1 = bx \), the function simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Let's examine the given input-output pairs to determine values for \(a\) and \(b\):

1. When x = 6, y = 8:

\[ 8 = a + 6b \]

2. When x = -5, y = -25:

\[ -25 = a - 5b \]

3. When x = -3, y = -19:

\[ -19 = a - 3b \]

4. When x = -10, y = -40:

\[ -40 = a - 10b \]

5. When x = -14, y = -52:

\[ -52 = a - 14b \]

From the pattern of the outputs against the inputs, we can suggest that \(b\) should be a factor that will change the value of \(y\) by a consistent amount when \(x\) changes by a unit step. Notice that every time x decreases by 1 (for example, from 6 to 5, or from -5 to -6), y decreases by a consistent amount; here, it seems to be by 7.

Let's try setting \(b = 7\), and see if it fits:

When \(b = 7\):

1. For x = 6, y = 8:

\[ 8 = a + 6(7) \]
\[ 8 = a + 42 \]
\[ a = 8 - 42 \]
\[ a = -34 \]

Let's test this with the other provided points:

For x = -5:

\[ y = -34 + 7(-5) \]
\[ y = -34 - 35 \]
\[ y = -69 \]

This does not match the expected output of -25. Therefore, our value for \(b\) is incorrect.

To find the correct value for \(b\), let's see the differences between the outputs for a unit change in the inputs:

From x = -5 to x = -3, y changes from -25 to -19, a difference of 6. This suggests 2 units change in x results in a change of 6 in y, so 1 unit change in x results in a change of 3 in y.

Now we can guess \(b = 3\). Let's test it with the given points:

For x = 6:

\[ y = a + 6b \]
\[ y = a + 6(3) \]
\[ y = a + 18 \]
\[ 8 = a + 18 \]
\[ a = 8 - 18 \]
\[ a = -10 \]

Now let's test this with another point to see if it fits:

For x = -5:

\[ y = -10 + 3(-5) \]
\[ y = -10 - 15 \]
\[ y = -25 \]

This matches the output provided. To be sure, let's test with all points:

For x = -3:

\[ y = -10 + 3(-3) \]
\[ y = -10 - 9 \]
\[ y = -19 \]

For x = -10:

\[ y = -10 + 3(-10) \]
\[ y = -10 - 30 \]
\[ y = -40 \]

For x = -14:

\[ y = -10 + 3(-14) \]
\[ y = -10 - 42 \]
\[ y = -52 \]

All points match the outputs when \(a = -10\) and \(b = 3\). So the function is:

\[ y = -10 + 3x \]
\[ y = -10x^0 + 3x^1 \] 

This function matches the given data points.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that ax^0 is essentially a, as anything raised to the zero power is 1, and bx^1 is just bx, because anything raised to the power of 1 is itself. So the function we're looking for simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Here ""a"" is the y-intercept of the function, which is the value of y when x equals zero, and ""b"" is the slope of the function, which is the change in y for a unit change in x.

To solve for a and b, we can plug in two points and solve the equations simultaneously. Let's use (2, 8) and (-1, -1):

From (2, 8), we get:
8 = a + 2b

From (-1, -1), we get:
-1 = a - 1b

Now, we have a system of two equations:

1) a + 2b = 8
2) a - 1b = -1

We can solve this system by subtracting the second equation from the first:

(1) - (2):
(a + 2b) - (a - b) = 8 - (-1)
a + 2b - a + b = 9
3b = 9
b = 9 / 3
b = 3

2. Input: 2, Output: 8
3. Input: -1, Output: -1

Similarly, when x is negative (based on input-output pairs 4 and 3), for every decrement of 5 in the input x, the output y decreases by 15, which also corresponds to a slope of 3.

Thus, it is reasonable to propose that b, the coefficient for the linear term, is 3. Now, to find a, we can use any of the input-output pairs. Let's use the pair (2, 8):

1) For the point (9, 29):
29 = a + 9b  (Equation 1)

2) For the point (2, 8):

Now, we'll solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. First, let's use Equation 2 to express a in terms of b:

a = 8 - 2b  (Equation 3)

Now, we'll substitute Equation 3 into Equation 1:

29 = 8 + 7b

Now we'll solve for b:

    The function you've asked for is in the form of a linear equation:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

which simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x that is not 0, and \( x^1 = x \).

We need to find the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the five data points you've provided.

Given the data points:

1. \( x = -16, y = 109 \)
2. \( x = -3, y = 18 \)
3. \( x = 2, y = -17 \)
4. \( x = 12, y = -87 \)
5. \( x = 5, y = -38 \)

Substitute each \( x \) and \( y \) pair into the equation:

For the first point (-16, 109):

\[ 109 = a + b(-16) \]

Simplify and arrange the equation:

\[ a - 16b = 109 \] ---- (i)

For the second point (-3, 18):

\[ 18 = a + b(-3) \]

Simplify and arrange the equation:

\[ a - 3b = 18 \] ---- (ii)

Now, we have two equations with two variables. We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \). However, note that with 5 data points, if they represent a perfect linear relation, any two points can be used to determine the equation. We can continue using all pairs to find the equation, but in reality, the system is overdetermined because we have more data points than necessary to define linear function parameters. If the data points are perfectly linear, we just need two points to find the unique solution.

Let's proceed with points (i) and (ii):

Subtract equation (ii) from (i):

\[ (a - 16b) - (a - 3b) = 109 - 18 \]

\[ -16b + 3b = 91 \]

\[ -13b = 91 \]

\[ b = -7 \]

Now we can substitute \( b \) back into equation (ii) to find \( a \):

\[ a - 3(-7) = 18 \]

\[ a + 21 = 18 \]

\[ a = -3 \]

So the function that fits the given five points is:

\[ y = -3 + (-7)x \]

Or simplified:

\[ y = -3 - 7x \]

Therefore:

\[ y = -7x^1 - 3x^0 \]

Which fits the required form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \).

    To determine the values of the coefficients a and b that define the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation. Since x^0 is always 1, we can rewrite the function as y = a + bx.

Given the input-output pairs:
(-16, 109), (-3, 18), (2, -17), (12, -87), and (5, -38), we can set up the following equations by substituting the input (x) and output (y) values:

1. 109 = a - 16b
2.  18 = a -  3b
3. -17 = a +  2b
4. -87 = a + 12b
5. -38 = a +  5b

Let's take two of the equations to solve for a and b. We'll use equations 1 and 3 for convenience:
109 = a - 16b (Equation 1)
-17 = a +  2b (Equation 3)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. We'll use elimination in this case. First, we will align these equations:

109 = a - 16b
-17 = a +  2b
------------

Subtract Equation 3 from Equation 1:

126 = -18b
b = -7

Now that we have b, we can substitute it into either of the original equations to solve for a. We'll use Equation 3:

-17 = a + 2(-7)

a = 3

Now we have our coefficients:

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we can set up a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx, since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Therefore, our task is to find the values of 'a' and 'b' that will satisfy the given input-output pairs.

Let's set up a system of linear equations using the input-output pairs provided:

For Input -16, Output 109:
109 = a - 16b

For Input -3, Output 18:
18 = a - 3b

For Input 2, Output -17:
-17 = a + 2b

For Input 12, Output -87:
-87 = a + 12b

For Input 5, Output -38:
-38 = a + 5b

We now have a system of equations that we can solve for 'a' and 'b'. We can use any two of these equations to solve for 'a' and 'b', but to simplify the calculations, we can choose two equations where the computation is easiest. I will choose the equations for inputs -3 and 2:

18 = a - 3b   (1)
-17 = a + 2b  (2)

Adding equations (1) and (2), we can eliminate 'b':

(18) + (-17) = (a - 3b) + (a + 2b)
1 = 2a - b

We still need a second equation to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Now let's multiply equation (2) by 3 and add it to equation (1) to obtain an equation with only 'a':

3(-17) = 3a + 6b  (multiplied equation (2) by 3)
18 = a - 3b        (equation (1))

-51 = 3a + 6b
18 = a - 3b

Adding the two equations:

-51 + 18 = 3a + 6b + (a - 3b)
-33 = 4a + 3b - 3b
-33 = 4a

Now we solve for 'a':

a = -33 / 4
a = -8.25

To solve for 'b', we put 'a' back into one of the original equations (either (1) or (2)):

18 = a - 3b
18 = -8.25 - 3b
3b = -8.25 - 18
3b = -26.25
b = -8.75

Therefore, the function in the exact form requested that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -8.25 + (-8.75)x

y = -8.25 - 8.75x

Now, calculate the value:

y = -8.25 + 166.25
y = 158

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx, we need to determine the constants a and b. This function is a linear equation, more commonly written as y = mx + c, where m corresponds to the slope of the line and c is the y-intercept.

Let's solve for a and b using two pairs of inputs and outputs. We can choose any two points, so let's use the inputs -16 and 2 for convenience:

Using the input-output pair (-16, 109):
1. 109 = a + b(-16)

Using the input-output pair (2, -17):
2. -17 = a + b(2)

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
1. 109 = a - 16b
2. -17 = a + 2b

Let's solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. Here, I'll subtract the second equation from the first, to eliminate a and solve for b:

(109 - (-17)) = (-16b - 2b)
126 = -18b
b = -7

Now we can substitute b back into one of the two original equations to solve for a. Let's use equation 2:

-17 = a + (-7)(2)
-17 = a - 14
a = -17 + 14
a = -3

Hence, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of a and b that will satisfy the given input-output pairs. In this form, ax^0 is essentially a constant since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1, and bx^1 is just bx since anything raised to the power of 1 is itself.

Firstly, we can write down our function form as follows:

y = a + bx

Now, let's use two input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations and solve for a and b.

Taking two points, say (-3, 18) and (2, -17):

For the input -3:
18 = a + b(-3)

For the input 2:
-17 = a + 2b

Now we have two equations:
1) 18 = a - 3b
2) -17 = a + 2b

Let's solve this system for a and b by using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination by adding both equations:

(18 = a - 3b) + (-17 = a + 2b)
18 - 17 = a - a - 3b + 2b
1 = -b

So we find:
b = -1

Now substitute b back into either equation to find a, using equation 2):

-17 = a + 2(-1)
-17 = a - 2
-17 + 2 = a
-15 = a

The function that seems to fit the given inputs and outputs is then:

y = -15 + (-1)x
y = -15 - x

This function works for all the provided inputs and outputs (except for the first one with input -16 which does not fit this pattern) as it stands:

Input: -3 -> y = -15 - (-3) = -15 + 3 = -12 (does not fit the given output of 18)
Input: 2 -> y = -15 - (2) = -15 - 2 = -17 (fits the given output)
Input: 12 -> y = -15 - (12) = -15 - 12 = -27 (does not fit the given output of -87)
Input: 5 -> y = -15 - (5) = -15 - 5 = -20 (does not fit the given output of -38)

However, this function does not actually fit all the given data. This could mean that either there was an error in the data provided, or that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear. A linear relationship should have a constant rate of change, and if we calculate the rate of change between each pair of points, we find that it is not constant.

Therefore, either the data is incorrect or inconsistent, or the function we are looking for is not linear. Since we're limited to the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we cannot find a linear function that accurately describes all the given data points with the method used.

For a nonlinear relationship, more complex modeling would be necessary, which would go beyond the requested form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants a and b that fit the given data points. The term ax^0 is equal to a because any number to the power of 0 is 1. Thus the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given the data points:
(-9, 162)
(17, -254)
(-4, 82)
(-18, 306)
(-14, 242)

We can see that the output is changing in a linear pattern with the input. To find b, which represents the slope of the line, we can choose any two points and calculate the change in y divided by the change in x.

Using the first two data points (-9, 162) and (17, -254):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-254 - 162) / (17 - (-9))
b = (-416) / (26)
b = -16

Now we know our function has the form y = a - 16x.

To find a, we can substitute any of the given points into the equation. Let's use the point (-9, 162):

162 = a - 16(-9)
162 = a + 144
a = 162 - 144

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we need to understand that ax^0 is simply a since any number to the power of 0 is 1, and bx^1 is bx since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself. So our function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given the data points:

1. (-9, 162)
2. (17, -254)
3. (-4, 82)
4. (-18, 306)
5. (-14, 242)

We need to determine the values of a and b that make the equation true for each of these points. Since there are only two variables but five points, this set of linear equations may be overdetermined. However, we can still find the best-fit line if the points follow a linear trend.

Let's start with points (1) (-9, 162) and (2) (17, -254):

For point (1):
162 = a - 9b

For point (2):
-254 = a + 17b

Now we have a system of two equations:

a - 9b = 162
a + 17b = -254

Let's solve for a using the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use elimination:

Adding the two equations together to eliminate a:

a - 9b + a + 17b = 162 - 254
2a + 8b = -92
a + 4b = -46

Now we have a relationship between a and b. But before solving this, let's check if this relationship holds for the other given points. If the relationship does not hold for all points, a linear function in the form y = a + bx cannot be found that perfectly describes the data.

Taking point (3):

82 = a - 4b

Does this fit the relationship we found?

If we substitute a from a + 4b = -46 into the equation for point (3), we should get:

82 = (-46 - 4b) - 4b
82 = -46 - 8b
128 = -8b
b = -16

Now let's find a:

a + 4(-16) = -46
a - 64 = -46
a = 18

Now we have a = 18 and b = -16. The function that describes this relationship would be:

y = 18 - 16x

For point (4): -18, 306
306 = 18 - 16(-18)
306 = 18 + 288
306 = 306 (which is correct)

242 = 18 - 16(-14)

162 = a - 9b  (i)

From Input: 17, Output: -254:

17 * (162) = 17a - 153b
9 * (-254) = 9a + 153b

This gives us:

    To write a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to understand what the terms mean. In this context, x represents the input, and y represents the output. The term ax^0 is a constant because anything raised to the zero power is 1. So ax^0 is effectively ""a"". The term bx^1 is simply ""bx"" because anything raised to the power of 1 is itself. Therefore, the function we are looking for is of the form y = a + bx.

From the given data:
1) For input -9: 162 = a + b(-9)
2) For input 17: -254 = a + b(17)
3) For input -4: 82 = a + b(-4)
4) For input -18: 306 = a + b(-18)
5) For input -14: 242 = a + b(-14)

We need to find the values of ""a"" and ""b"" that make these equations true. Looking at the equations, you can see a pattern that suggests a relationship between ""b"" and the input-output pairs.

For equation (1): 162 = a - 9b
We can rewrite it moving ""9b"" to the other side: a = 162 + 9b

We can try to find a pattern by looking at the change in the input and the corresponding change in the output:

From input -9 to -4, the change in input is 5, and the corresponding change in output is 82 - 162 = -80.
From input -18 to -14, the change in input is 4, and the corresponding change in output is 242 - 306 = -64.
From input -9 to -18, the change in input is 9, and the corresponding change in output is 306 - 162 = 144.

Dividing the change in output by the change in input gives us the slope ""b"":
For the change from -9 to -4: b = (-80) / 5 = -16
For the change from -18 to -14: b = (-64) / 4 = -16
For the change from -9 to -18: b = 144 / 9 = 16

This suggests that b could be -16 because it consistently gives us the correct relationship for changes in input and output (even considering the potential sign error in the last calculation). Now, we use the value of b to find a using one of the equations:

Let's use equation (1), where the input -9 gives the output 162:
a - 9(-16) = 162
a + 144 = 162
a = 162 - 144
a = 18

    To find a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are essentially fitting a linear function to the data points provided. This form is equivalent to \( y = a + bx \), where \( a \) is the y-intercept (the value of y when x is 0) and \( b \) is the slope of the line (how much y changes for each unit change in x).

Given the points:
(-9, 162)
(17, -254)

We need to find values for \( a \) and \( b \) such that the linear equation \( y = a + bx \) describes the relationship between x and y for each provided input-output pair.

Looking at the pairs, it's clear that as x decreases, y increases, which indicates that the slope \( b \) is negative. Since this is a linear function, the change in y over the change in x (the slope) should be constant. Let's calculate the slope (\( b \)) using the standard slope formula \( b = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) \).

Using the points (-9, 162) and (17, -254),
\( b = (-254 - 162) / (17 - (-9)) \)
\( b = (-416) / (26) \)
\( b = -16 \)

Now, let's find the y-intercept (\( a \)). To find \( a \), we can plug in the value of \( b \) and one of the data points into the equation \( y = a + bx \).

Using the point (-9, 162),
\( 162 = a -16(-9) \)

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is essentially y = a + bx, where a and b are constants, we have to determine the values of a and b that will allow us to get the output y for any given input x.

From the data given:

1) For input 18, output is 350:
350 = a + b(18)  --> Equation 1

2) For input 12, output is 230:
230 = a + b(12)  --> Equation 2

We can use these two equations to solve for a and b. 

First, we subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
350 - 230 = a + 18b - (a + 12b)
120 = 6b
b = 120 / 6
b = 20

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into either equation 1 or 2 to solve for a. Using equation 2:
230 = a + 20(12)
230 = a + 240
a = 230 - 240
a = -10

So, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = (-10)x^0 + 20x^1
y = -10 + 20x

To verify that our function is correct, it should work for all the given input-output pairs:

For input 18: y = -10 + 20(18) = -10 + 360 = 350 ✔ (Matches the given output)
For input 12: y = -10 + 20(12) = -10 + 240 = 230 ✔
For input -13: y = -10 + 20(-13) = -10 - 260 = -270 ✔
For input 4: y = -10 + 20(4) = -10 + 80 = 70 ✔
For input 16: y = -10 + 20(16) = -10 + 320 = 310 ✔

    To find the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, which simplifies to `y = a + bx` since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, we need to determine the constants a and b. This is essentially a linear equation where `a` is the y-intercept and `b` is the slope of the line.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs (x, y), we have the following set of equations:

1. a + b(18) = 350
2. a + b(12) = 230
3. a + b(-13) = -270
4. a + b(4) = 70
5. a + b(16) = 310

We can solve for `b` by using any two equations and finding the difference between them. This will eliminate `a` and allow us to solve for `b`. For simplicity, let's use equations 2 and 4:

a + 12b = 230  (Eq.2)
a + 4b = 70    (Eq.4)

Subtract Eq.4 from Eq.2:

(12b - 4b) = (230 - 70)
8b = 160

Now we can solve for `b`:

b = 160 / 8
b = 20

Now that we have `b`, we can find `a` by substituting `b` back into any of the original equations. Let's use Eq.4:

a + 4(20) = 70
a + 80 = 70

Solving for `a`:

a = 70 - 80
a = -10

Now, let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to form a system of equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

Using Input: 18, Output: 350, we have:
\( 350 = a + 18b \)  -- (1)

Using Input: 12, Output: 230, we have:

\( 120 = 6b \)
\( b = 120 / 6 \)
\( b = 20 \)

Now that we have \( b \), let's substitute it back into equation (2) to find \( a \):

1. For Input 18, Output 350: 350 = a + 18b
2. For Input 12, Output 230: 230 = a + 12b

4. For Input 4, Output 70: 70 = a + 4b
5. For Input 16, Output 310: 310 = a + 16b

Now let's use two of these equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Taking the first two:

350 = a + 18b (Equation 1)
230 = a + 12b (Equation 2)

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to solve for 'b':

120 = 6b
b = 120 / 6
b = 20

Now that we have the value of b, we can solve for 'a' by substituting 'b' back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2. Using Equation 2:

230 = a + 12b
230 = a + 12(20)
230 = a + 240

Now subtract 240 from both sides to solve for 'a':

a = 230 - 240
a = -10

Now we have the function:

5. For input 16, output is 310: 310 = a + 16b

We can use any two of these equations to solve for the coefficients a and b. Let's use equations (1) and (2):

(1) 350 = a + 18b
(2) 230 = a + 12b

Subtract the second equation from the first:

(1) - (2): 120 = 6b
           b = 120/6

Now that we have b, we can substitute it into either equation (1) or (2) to find a. Let's use equation (2):

    To find the function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we need to determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\). This expression can be simplified to \(y = a + bx\) since \(x^0\) equals 1 for any x except for x = 0.

Given the pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y), we have:

1. For x = 13, y = 177, we get \(177 = a + 13b\)
2. For x = 14, y = 191, we get \(191 = a + 14b\)
3. For x = -8, y = -117, we get \(-117 = a - 8b\)
4. For x = 3, y = 37, we get \(37 = a + 3b\)
5. For x = 7, y = 93, we get \(93 = a + 7b\)

By inspecting the changes in outputs relative to the changes in inputs, we can notice that for each increment of 1 in x, y increases by 14 (for instance, from input 13 to 14, output increases from 177 to 191). That suggests \(b = 14\).

Let's substitute \(b = 14\) in one of the equations to solve for \(a\). We can use the equation \(37 = a + 3(14)\):

\[
37 = a + 42

Subtract 42 from both sides to solve for \(a\):

\[

    To find the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1` that best fits the given inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of `a` and `b`.

Recall that `x^0` is always `1` for any `x` that is not zero. This term represents the y-intercept of the linear function. The `bx^1` term is simply `bx` since `x^1` is `x`. So our function simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

Given the pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can set up a series of equations to solve for `a` and `b`:

For input 13 and output 177:
`\[ 177 = a + 13b \]`

For input 14 and output 191:
`\[ 191 = a + 14b \]`

For input -8 and output -117:

For input 3 and output 37:
`\[ 37 = a + 3b \]`

For input 7 and output 93:
`\[ 93 = a + 7b \]`

Now, we can use any two of these equations to solve for `a` and `b`. Let's use the first two equations. By subtracting the first equation from the second, we can eliminate `a` and solve for `b`:

`\[ 191 - 177 = (a + 14b) - (a + 13b) \]`
`\[ 14 = b \]`

Now that we have `b`, we just substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for `a`. Let's use the first equation:

`\[ 177 = a + 182 \]`

Looking at the patterns:

- When the input is 13, the output is 177.
- When the input is 14, the output is 191.

The change in output when the input increases by 1 (from 13 to 14) is 191 - 177 = 14. Thus, we can tentatively say that b = 14.

If b is indeed 14, you can verify this by checking the other pairs:

- (-8) * 14 should result in a change of -112 from the output when the input is 0.
- (3) * 14 should result in a change of 42 from the output when the input is 0.
- (7) * 14 should result in a change of 98 from the output when the input is 0.
