"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The relationship described between the inputs and outputs is consistent with a linear function, which can be generally expressed in the form:

\[ y = ax^1 + bx^0 \]

Here, \(ax^1\) represents the linear term (where \(a\) is the slope of the line) and \(bx^0\) is the constant term (since any number to the power of zero is 1, \(bx^0\) simplifies to \(b\)).

Our job is to find the best values for \(a\) and \(b\) that fit the given points. We have five points:

1. (-10, -213)
2. (9, 167)
3. (4, 67)
4. (-3, -73)
5. (20, 387)

We can calculate \(a\) and \(b\) using two points and solving the system of equations they create. Let's choose points (4, 67) and (9, 167) for convenience. Substituting into \(y = ax + b\), we get:

\[ 67 = 4a + b \]
\[ 167 = 9a + b \]

Now let's solve for \(a\) and \(b\). Subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ 167 - 67 = 9a - 4a + b - b \]
\[ 100 = 5a \]
\[ a = 20 \]

Now, use the value for \(a\) to solve for \(b\) by substituting \(a = 20\) into one of the initial equations:

\[ 67 = 4(20) + b \]
\[ 67 = 80 + b \]
\[ b = 67 - 80 \]
\[ b = -13 \]

Therefore, the linear function that fits the given data points is:

\[ y = 20x - 13 \]

This function does not perfectly fit all the given points but should relate the inputs and outputs as closely as possible given the constraint that the function is linear. More complex functions could provide a better fit, but you've specified the form as \(y = ax^1 + bx^0\), so that is the linear approximation we'll use.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    ","To find the output for the input 15 using the derived linear function \( y = 20x - 13 \):

\[ y = 20(15) - 13 \]

\[ y = 287 \]

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that ax^0 is equivalent to a (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is simply bx. So the function we are looking for is of the form y = a + bx.

We have a set of inputs (x) and corresponding outputs (y), and we need to determine the coefficients a and b that define the linear relationship. Since we have more than two points, we can't solve the coefficients using a simple linear system. Instead, we can use linear regression to find the approximation of a and b that would give us the best fit for the given points.

However, for the purpose of this exercise and without using sophisticated statistical software or methods, we'll inspect and try to deduce a pattern that fits the given inputs and outputs.

Looking at the given inputs and outputs:

- For x = -10, y = -213
- For x = 9, y = 167
- For x = 4, y = 67
- For x = -3, y = -73
- For x = 20, y = 387

By experimenting with these values, we can look for a relationship that seems to fit all of them. Let's first check the differences between consecutive outputs in relation to consecutive inputs.

(167 - 67) / (9 - 4) = 100 / 5 = 20
(67 - (-73)) / (4 - (-3)) = 140 / 7 = 20
(387 - 167) / (20 - 9) = 220 / 11 = 20

It looks like for each step of 1 in x, y increases by 20. This suggests that b could be 20. Now we need to find a.

Using the point (x, y) = (4, 67) and assuming b = 20:
67 = a + 20*4
67 = a + 80
a = 67 - 80
a = -13

Thus, the function should be y = -13 + 20x.

To check if this is consistent with the other points:

For x = -10:
y = -13 + 20*(-10) = -13 - 200 = -213 (which matches the given output)

For x = 9:
y = -13 + 20*(9) = -13 + 180 = 167 (which matches the given output)

For x = 4:
y = -13 + 20*(4) = -13 + 80 = 67 (which matches the given output)

For x = -3:
y = -13 + 20*(-3) = -13 - 60 = -73 (which matches the given output)

For x = 20:
y = -13 + 20*(20) = -13 + 400 = 387 (which matches the given output)

Therefore the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs for the given points is:

y = -13 + 20x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    If we are to find a linear function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can interpret this as the equation of a line in the form of \( y = b_0 + b_1x \), where \( b_0 \) is the y-intercept and \( b_1 \) is the slope of the line.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we need to find \( b_0 \) and \( b_1 \) such that the equation fits the data provided. Generally, for two points, there is a unique solution for a linear function. But since we have more than two points, we need to find the best fit line that can be determined using methods like least squares regression. However, since you require the explicit form with no more information, we may not get an exact fit but rather an approximation. Here, we can do a rough estimation based on two points and then check if the line is a reasonable fit for the other points.

Let's select two points to determine the equation of the line: (9, 167) and (-10, -213). We can use these to find the slope (\( b_1 \)) first.

\[ b_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{167 - (-213)}{9 - (-10)} = \frac{380}{19} = 20 \]

Now we will use the slope and one point, say (9, 167), to find the intercept (\( b_0 \)).

\[ y = b_0 + b_1x \]
\[ 167 = b_0 + 20 \cdot 9 \]
\[ b_0 = 167 - 180 \]
\[ b_0 = -13 \]

So, our proposed linear function is:

\[ y = -13 + 20x \]

Let's check quickly whether this line is a reasonable approximation for the other provided points:

For input 4:
\[ y = -13 + 20 \cdot 4 \]
\[ y = -13 + 80 \]
\[ y = 67 \] (matches the output)

For input -3:
\[ y = -13 + 20 \cdot (-3) \]
\[ y = -13 - 60 \]
\[ y = -73 \] (matches the output)

For input 20:
\[ y = -13 + 20 \cdot 20 \]
\[ y = -13 + 400 \]
\[ y = 387 \] (matches the output)

Since this function matches all the given points perfectly, we can confidently say that the function describing the data is:

\[ y = -13 + 20x \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), where \(x\) is the input and \(y\) is the output, we can observe that \(ax^0\) is effectively just \(a\) since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1.

This simplifies the equation to \(y = a + bx\).

Given the inputs and outputs, we have the following equations:

1) \(a + b(-10) = -213\)
2) \(a + b(9) = 167\)
3) \(a + b(4) = 67\)
4) \(a + b(-3) = -73\)
5) \(a + b(20) = 387\)

To solve for \(a\) and \(b\), we can choose any two equations and solve the system of equations. Let's use equations 2 and 3:

\(a + 9b = 167\) (Equation 2)
\(a + 4b = 67\) (Equation 3)

Subtract Equation 3 from Equation 2 to eliminate \(a\):

\(9b - 4b = 167 - 67\)
\(5b = 100\)
\(b = 20\)

Now that we know \(b\), we can find \(a\) by substituting \(b = 20\) into one of the original equations. Let's use Equation 3:

\(a + 4(20) = 67\)
\(a + 80 = 67\)
\(a = 67 - 80\)

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy the given input-output pairs. Let's consider that \( x^0 \) is equivalent to 1 for any non-zero \( x \), which simplifies the function to:

\( y = a + bx \)

We need to determine \( a \) and \( b \) such that the function holds true for all given pairs. Let's start by setting up a system of equations based on the input-output pairs:

1. \( a + b(-10) = -213 \)
2. \( a + b(9) = 167 \)
3. \( a + b(4) = 67 \)
4. \( a + b(-3) = -73 \)
5. \( a + b(20) = 387 \)

To solve for \( a \) and \( b \), we can choose any two of these equations and solve the system. Let's use the input-output pairs for \( x = -10 \) and \( x = 20 \) as they are the farthest apart, which could help to avoid rounding errors in calculations:

\( a - 10b = -213 \) (Equation 1)
\( a + 20b = 387 \) (Equation 2)

Now, let's solve the above system for \( a \) and \( b \). First, add Equation 1 and Equation 2:

\( (a - 10b) + (a + 20b) = -213 + 387 \)
\( 2a + 10b = 174 \)
\( a + 5b = 87 \) (Equation 3)

Now, let's subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

\( (a + 20b) - (a - 10b) = 387 - (-213) \)
\( 30b = 600 \)
\( b = 600 / 30 \)
\( b = 20 \)

Now we can substitute \( b \) into Equation 3 to find \( a \):

\( a + 5(20) = 87 \)
\( a + 100 = 87 \)
\( a = 87 - 100 \)
\( a = -13 \)

    To find a function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the values of the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). Given that \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any non-zero \( x \), the equation can be simplified to \( y = a + bx \).

We can use two points from the provided inputs and outputs to form a system of linear equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the points \( (x_1, y_1) = (-18, 339) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) = (0, -3) \).

For point \( (x_1, y_1) \):
\[ 339 = a + b(-18) \]

For point \( (x_2, y_2) \):
\[ -3 = a + b(0) \]

From the second equation, it's clear that \( a = -3 \) because when \( x = 0 \), \( bx^1 \) is also 0, leaving \( y = a \).

Substituting \( a \) into the first equation:
\[ 339 = -3 - 18b \]
\[ 342 = -18b \]
\[ b = -\frac{342}{18} \]
\[ b = -19 \]

Now we have our values for \( a \) and \( b \):

    Let's interpret the given form y = ax^0 + bx^1 as a linear equation. In the form y = mx + b (which is more commonly used), a corresponds to b (the y-intercept) and b corresponds to m (the slope).

1. (-18, 339)
2. (0, -3)
3. (5, -98)
4. (-3, 54)
5. (-16, 301)

We need to find the best values for a and b that fit these points. The term ax^0 is a constant because any number raised to zero is 1, so ax^0 is the same as a. Therefore, the function becomes y = a + bx.

We can immediately see that when x = 0, y = -3, so our equation is y = -3 + bx.

To determine b, the slope, we ideally want two points that will allow us to solve for b directly. We can use points (0, -3) and any other one, for instance, (-18, 339).

The formula for slope (b) is (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Using our points (0, -3) and (-18, 339):

b = (339 - (-3)) / (-18 - 0)
b = (339 + 3) / (-18)
b = 342 / -18

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of 'a' and 'b'. The term ax^0 simplifies to 'a' since any number (except zero) raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Our function can thus be re-written as:
y = a + bx

From the inputs and outputs given, we have the following equations:

1. a + b(-18) = 339

3. a + b(5) = -98

    To write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are essentially looking for a linear equation, where ax^0 is a constant term (because any number x raised to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is simply bx (because any number x raised to the power of 1 is x). So effectively, we are looking for an equation of the form:

y = a + bx

We have the following system of equations from the given input-output pairs:

1) When x = -18, y = 339
2) When x = 0, y = -3
3) When x = 5, y = -98
4) When x = -3, y = 54
5) When x = -16, y = 301

Using the second equation where x = 0, we can immediately find the value of 'a' since y will equal 'a' when x is 0 (since the term bx will be 0). Thus:

a = -3

Now, to find the value of 'b', we could use any of the other equations. Since we now know 'a', we can substitute this into one of the other equations. For example, let's use the first equation:

However, with inconsistent data points, the system may be overdetermined and contradictory, implying no single line (which this function must be, as it is first order) can perfectly fit all of these points.

Using two points, for example, (5, -31) and (-11, 49), we can set up a system of linear equations to calculate `a` and `b`:

For point (5, -31):

\[
-31 = a + 5b
\]

For point (-11, 49):

\[
49 = a - 11b
\]

Solving this system of linear equations, we get:

Add the two equations:
\[
18 = 2a - 6b \\
9 = a - 3b \\
a = 9 + 3b

Now plug the expression for `a` back into one of the original equations:
\[
-31 = 9 + 3b + 5b
\]
\[
-31 = 9 + 8b
\]
\[
-40 = 8b
\]
\[
b = -5
\]

Using `b = -5` to solve for `a`:
\[
a = 9 + 3(-5)
\]
\[
a = 9 - 15
\]
\[
a = -6
\]

So the function that describes the relationship, using these two points specifically, would be:

\[
y = -6 + (-5)x

Or simplified,

\[
y = -6 - 5x

Divide both sides by 4:

b = -5

Now substitute b back into the first equation to solve for a:

a + 5(-5) = -31
a - 25 = -31
Add 25 to both sides:

a = -31 + 25
a = -6

We need to find values for \( a \) and \( b \) that fit these points. Note that since multiple points are given, it's possible that these points do not perfectly align on a straight line, thus we may need to find the best fit line.

Using the first point (5, -31):

\[ -31 = a + 5b  \]

And the second point (9, -51):

\[ -51 = a + 9b \]

Now, we can solve these two equations as a system to find \( a \) and \( b \). Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

\[ -51 - (-31) = (a + 9b) - (a + 5b) \]

\[ -20 = 4b \]

\[ b = -5 \]

Using the value of \( b \) in the first equation:

\[ -31 = a - 25 \]

    To find a linear relationship that fits the given data points, we need to find constants `a` (the y-intercept) and `b` (the slope) for the linear function `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, which simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

Given that we have 5 data points:

1. For input (x) 5, output (y) is -31: -31 = a + 5b
2. For input (x) 9, output (y) is -51: -51 = a + 9b
3. For input (x) -11, output (y) is 49: 49 = a - 11b
4. For input (x) -4, output (y) is 14: 14 = a - 4b
5. For input (x) -12, output (y) is 54: 54 = a - 12b

We can use any two of these points to solve the system of linear equations. Let's use points 1 and 3:

-31 = a + 5b         (1)
49 = a - 11b         (3)

Add the two equations together to eliminate 'a':

-31 + 49 = (a - a) + (5b - 11b)
18 = -6b
b = -3

Now, take the value of b and plug it into either of the original equations to solve for 'a'. We'll use equation (1):

-31 = a + 5(-3)
-31 = a - 15
a = -31 + 15
a = -16

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we look for coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) such that the function fits the given input-output pairs. 

Since \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because any number to the power of 0 is 1, the function becomes \( y = a + bx \). Now we have to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \). 

Given that we have more than two points, we can use two points to obtain a system of linear equations and then verify that these coefficients indeed work for the other points.

Using the points (5, -31) and (9, -51), we have two equations:

1) \( -31 = a + 5b \)
2) \( -51 = a + 9b \)

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( a \):

\( -51 - (-31) = a + 9b - (a + 5b) \)
\( -20 = 4b \)

Solving for \( b \), we get \( b = -5 \).

Now plugging \( b \) into the first equation to find \( a \):

\( -31 = a + 5(-5) \)
\( -31 = a - 25 \)
\( a = -6 \)

Thus, the function that fits the two points is \( y = -6 + (-5)x \), or \( y = -6 - 5x \). To ensure this function works for all given points, we should verify it with the remaining points:

For input -11:

\( y = -6 - 5(-11) \)

Given the data points:

1) For input x = 7, output y = -98: 
-98 = a + b(7)

2) For input x = 17, output y = -218:
-218 = a + b(17)

3) For input x = 5, output y = -74:

4) For input x = 3, output y = -50:

5) For input x = -6, output y = 58:

We have 5 equations and 2 unknowns. Since this is an overdetermined system, an exact solution might not exist, but we can find a and b that fit the data in a least squares sense. However, we can check if an exact solution is possible by looking for a consistent pattern.

Let's start by attempting to deduce the pattern by using two points to solve for a and b:

Using points 1) and 2):
-98 = a + 7b
-218 = a + 17b 

Now we have two equations with two unknowns, and we can solve for a and b. We can solve for a in terms of b from the first equation and then substitute into the second equation:

a = -98 - 7b

Substitute a into the second equation:

-218 = (-98 - 7b) + 17b
-218 = -98 + 10b
-120 = 10b
b = -12

Now substitute b back into the equation for a:

a = -98 - 7(-12)
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

So we have found values for a and b:

a = -14
b = -12

Let's verify these values with the other given points:

For point 3) x = 5:
-74 = -14 + (-12)*5
-74 = -14 - 60
-74 = -74 (This matches the provided data point.)

For point 4) x = 3:
-50 = -14 + (-12)*3
-50 = -14 - 36
-50 = -50 (This matches the provided data point.)

For point 5) x = -6:
58 = -14 + (-12)*(-6)
58 = -14 + 72
58 = 58 (This matches the provided data point.)

y = -14 + (-12)x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To fit the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we simply need to determine the appropriate values for constants a and b. The ax^0 term is essentially a constant term (because any number to the power of 0 is 1), while the bx^1 term represents a linear relationship with x.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can create a system of equations to solve for a and b. For the given data:

1. For input 7: y = a * 7^0 + b * 7^1 => -98 = a + 7b
2. For input 17: y = a * 17^0 + b * 17^1 => -218 = a + 17b
3. For input 5: y = a * 5^0 + b * 5^1 => -74 = a + 5b
4. For input 3: y = a * 3^0 + b * 3^1 => -50 = a + 3b
5. For input -6: y = a * (-6)^0 + b * (-6)^1 => 58 = a - 6b

We can use the given points to create a system of equations; however, we observe that a pattern seems to be consistent across all the data points. If we try to derive a relationship just by looking at the data points:

For the input x = 7, y is 7 less than -7 times 7:
y = -7*7 - 7 = -49 - 7 = -56

After further examination, we notice a pattern where y is always -14 times the input minus 7 times the input:

y = -14x - 7x
y = -21x

So, tested against the data:
For x = 7, y = -21*7 = -147
For x = 17, y = -21*17 = -357
For x = 5, y = -21*5 = -105
For x = 3, y = -21*3 = -63
For x = -6, y = -21*(-6) = 126

Thus, the simple linear relationship we initially derived (-21x) does not match the original outputs exactly. This implies additional work to find the correct a and b.

Given that we have inconsistent results with a straightforward pattern recognition, either the data is not linear, or we need to revisit our calculations.

Let's try the pattern of subtracting 14x twice to resemble the given function form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = a + bx

Using the first point to solve for a:
-98 = a + 7b
Using the last point to solve for b:
58 = a - 6b

By adding both equations, we can cancel out a:
-98 + 58 = a + 7b + a - 6b
-40 = 2a + b
-40 - 58 = 2a + b - (a - 6b)
-98 = a + 7b

This linear system implies that:

a + 7b = -98
a - 6b = 58

This pair of equations can be solved using linear algebra techniques. However, we can simplify the process by subtracting the second equation from the first:

(7b - (-6b)) = -98 - 58
13b = -156
b = -156 / 13
b = -12

Now, we plug the value of b into one of the original equations to solve for a:

a + 7(-12) = -98
a - 84 = -98
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

y = -14x^0 - 12x^1
y = -14 - 12x

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's use two of the given points to find a and b:

Using (x1, y1) = (7, -98) and (x2, y2) = (17, -218), we have:

-98 = b*7 + a  --(1)
-218 = b*17 + a --(2)

To solve for b and a, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

(-218) - (-98) = b*17 - b*7
-218 + 98 = b*(17 - 7)
-120 = b*10
b = -120 / 10

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first observe that the format ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to a + bx because any number (except 0) to the power of 0 is 1. This means we're looking for a linear function in the form y = a + bx.

We have several input-output pairs: (7, -98), (17, -218), (5, -74), (3, -50), (−6, 58). Let's use two of these pairs to solve for a and b.

Let's take (7, -98) and (17, -218) to form two equations:

1) For input 7: -98 = a + 7b
2) For input 17: -218 = a + 17b

Now, let's solve for a and b by using these two equations.

Substract equation 1) from equation 2) to eliminate a:

    To express the relationship between the input \( x \) and output \( y \) in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to solve for \( a \) and \( b \) which are constants.

The term \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any \( x \) except 0 (which is not relevant here since our inputs are not equal to 0). The term \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \) because \( x^1 \) is just \( x \).

Hence, the function can be written as:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Now, we need to determine the values of constants \( a \) and \( b \) so that the function fits the given input-output pairs. We can set up a system of linear equations using the data provided:

To solve for \( a \) and \( b \), we can choose two of these equations and solve them as a system of linear equations. Let's use the data for input 7 and input -6:

\( -98 = a + 7b \) (1)
\( 58 = a - 6b \) (2)

By adding equation (1) and equation (2), we can eliminate \( b \):

\( -98 + 58 = a + 7b + a - 6b \)
\( -40 = 2a + b \)
\( -40 - b = 2a \)
\( a = (-40 - b) / 2 \) (3)

Now, let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate \( a \):

\( -98 - 58 = a + 7b - (a - 6b) \)
\( -156 = 13b \)
\( b = -156 / 13 \)
\( b = -12 \)

Now, we can substitute \( b \) back into equation (3) to find \( a \):

\( a = (-40 - (-12)) / 2 \)
\( a = (-40 + 12) / 2 \)
\( a = -28 / 2 \)
\( a = -14 \)

Now, we have a system of equations. However, we only need two of them to solve for \( a \) and \( b \) since it's a linear function. Let's use equations from the second and fourth inputs because their \( x \) values are close, which might simplify the arithmetic:

From Input -11 (2nd equation):
\( -169 = a - 11b \)

\( -155 = a - 10b \)

Let's subtract the fourth equation from the second:

\( (-169 - (-155)) = (a - a) - (11b - 10b) \)
\( -169 + 155 = -b \)
\( -14 = -b \)

So, \( b = 14 \).

Now plug the value of \( b \) into the fourth equation to find \( a \):

\( -155 = a - 10b \)
\( -155 = a - 10(14) \)
\( -155 = a - 140 \)
\( a = -155 + 140 \)

b = (output change) / (input change)
b = (output at -11 - output at -13) / (input at -11 - input at -13)
b = (-169 - (-197)) / (-11 - (-13))
b = (28) / (2)
b = 14

Given that the slope (b) is consistent across all the data points, this suggests a common increment of 14 in the output for each increment of 1 in the input.

Now we will calculate the y-intercept (a). We can use any of the given data points for this. I'll use the point (-10, -155):

y = a + bx
-155 = a + 14(-10)
-155 = a - 140
a = -155 + 140
a = -15

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -15 + 14x

This function fits all the provided data points.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Therefore, the result is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to analyze the given inputs and outputs.

Let's assume that this function is a simple linear function with the form y = c + bx, which is equivalent to y = ax^0 + bx^1 when a = c (a constant term) and b is the linear coefficient.

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to calculate the coefficients a and b. We will use the Input/Output pairs (-13, -197) and (-11, -169) to calculate the linear coefficient b:

(-197) = a + b(-13)
(-169) = a + b(-11)

The first equation gives us:

a = -197 + 13b ------- (1)

The second one gives us:

a = -169 + 11b ------- (2)

Now we shall subtract (2) from (1) to get b:

(-197 + 13b) - (-169 + 11b) = -197 - (-169) + 13b - 11b
-28 = 2b
b = -28 / 2
b = -14

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either (1) or (2) to find a:

a = -197 + 13b
a = -197 + 13(-14)
a = -197 - 182
a = -379

So, the function can be written as:

y = -379x^0 - 14x^1

Simplifying by removing the exponent, we get the function:

y = -379 - 14x

However, let's check with the other given points if they satisfy this function:

For input 20:
y = -379 - 14(20) = -379 - 280 ≠ 265

For input -10:
y = -379 - 14(-10) = -379 + 140 ≠ -155

For input 7:
y = -379 - 14(7) = -379 - 98 ≠ 83

So, the function y = -379 - 14x does not fit all the given points, and a linear relationship cannot describe the outputs accurately. Since my job is to recognize patterns, it seems that the relationship might not be linear after all. A more complex function or higher degree polynomial may be necessary to accurately model this data. Without more information or additional data points, it is not possible to determine the exact function that describes this relationship. However, if we assume a linear relationship regardless, then there might be an error in the data or additional context needed to understand it.

    First, let's consider the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input (x):  20 | Output (y):  265

We want to find a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is equivalent to y = a + bx since any number raised to the zeroth power (x^0) is 1.

To determine values for a and b, we can use two points to form two equations and solve for the variables. Let's use the points (-13, -197) and (20, 265).

For the input -13:
y = a + b(-13)
-197 = a - 13b  ...(1)

For the input 20:
y = a + b(20)
265 = a + 20b ...(2)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

(1) -197 = a - 13b
(2)  265 = a + 20b

Let's solve this system of equations. We can do this by adding equation (1) to equation (2) to solve for 'a' first:

-197 + 265 = (a - 13b) + (a + 20b)
68 = 2a + 7b
34 = a + (7/2)b ...(3)

Now, we substitute equation (3) into equation (1) to solve for 'b':

-197 = 34 - (7/2)b - 13b
-231 = -(33/2)b
b = 14

With b = 14, we now substitute that back into equation (3) to solve for 'a':

34 = a + (7/2)(14)
34 = a + 49
a = -15

    Given the pattern of the inputs and outputs, let's try to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy the given equation form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \).

Given the equation must take the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), this simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any non-zero x.

Now we want to find values for \( a \) and \( b \) using the data provided.

Using the first pair (-13, -197):

-197 = a + b(-13)

Using the second pair (-11, -169):

-169 = a + b(-11)

265 = a + b(20)

Using the fourth pair (-10, -155):

-155 = a + b(-10)

Using the fifth pair (7, 83):

83 = a + b(7)

We have five equations with two unknowns. However, we only need two equations to find a unique solution for a and b. Let's use the first two pairs to set up a system of equations:

-197 = a - 13b
-169 = a - 11b

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( a \):

-197 - (-169) = (a - 13b) - (a - 11b)
-28 = -2b
b = 14

Now that we have the value for \( b \), we can find \( a \):

-197 = a - 13(14)
-197 = a - 182
a = -197 + 182
a = -15

So the function that appears to capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    We have a system of equations given by the pairs of inputs and outputs provided. We want to write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1.

Let's substitute the given input-output pairs into our function:

1. When x = 9, y = 160:  
   160 = a + 9b
   
2. When x = 13, y = 228:

   262 = a + 15b
   
5. When x = -20, y = -333:
   -333 = a - 20b

Now we need to solve this system of equations. We can try to find a and b that satisfy all equations, but typically for solving such systems we would need as many independent equations as there are variables. Here we have 2 variables and 5 equations, which suggests an overdetermined system that may not have an exact solution.

However, since you're asking for an explicit solution and based on the pattern of the given points, we can try to determine the common differences and see if we can derive a and b.

Looking at the inputs 9 and 13 (a difference of 4) and their respective outputs 160 and 228 (a difference of 68), we can find the slope b:

228 - 160 = 68  
13 - 9 = 4  
b = 68 / 4  
b = 17  

Now that we have b, we can use one of the input-output pairs to solve for a. Let's use the first pair (9, 160):

From the given inputs and outputs, we can create a system of equations:

1) For input 9 (x=9), output 160 (y=160): 160 = a + 9b
2) For input 13 (x=13), output 228 (y=228): 228 = a + 13b

Now, we can solve this system for \( a \) and \( b \).

\( 228 - 160 = a + 13b - (a + 9b) \)
\( 68 = 4b \)

\( b = 17 \)

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the given data points, we are essentially looking for a linear relationship between the input x and the output y, since ax^0 is a constant term (a) and bx^1 is a simple linear term (bx).

So our function will look like:

y = a + bx

We need to find the constants a and b. Since we have multiple data points, we can form a system of linear equations using them to solve for a and b. However, with more than one data point, we can't be entirely sure there will be a perfect linear relationship. Hence, what we can do is take two of the points and solve for a and b. We may then check how well these parameters fit the other points.

For simplicity, let's take the points (9, 160) and (-20, -333) to find a and b. Two equations are formed as follows:

160 = a + b(9)
-333 = a + b(-20)

Let's solve these two equations.

For the first equation:
a + 9b = 160  ... (1)

For the second equation:
a - 20b = -333  ... (2)

Now, let's solve for a and b using these equations.

Subtracting (2) from (1) gives us:
29b = 493
b = 493 / 29
b = 17

Using the value of b to solve for a:
a + 9(17) = 160
a + 153 = 160
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

We can use two points to determine the function. Let's use the first two points \( (-2, 17) \) and \( (7, -145) \).

The slope \( b \) is calculated by:
\[ b = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Using points (7, -145) and (-2, 17):
\[ b = \frac{-145 - 17}{7 - (-2)} \]
\[ b = \frac{-162}{9} \]
\[ b = -18 \]

So our function will have the form:
\[ y = c - 18x \]

    To find a linear function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are actually looking for a function of the form y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 for any x except for x=0 (and even then, most mathematicians define 0^0 to be 1) and x^1 is just x.

We have several input-output pairs to work with:
(-2, 17), (7, -145), (-10, 161), (9, -181), (-20, 341)

We're looking to determine the coefficients 'a' and 'b' such that:

y = a + bx

To find 'a' and 'b', we can use two of the given pairs to set up a system of equations. However, looking at the pattern of inputs and outputs, we can see that as 'x' increases by a certain amount, the value of 'y' seems to decrease by a consistent amount, suggesting that 'b' is negative. Moreover, since doubling 'x' seems to more than double the change in 'y', that suggests 'b' is also larger than 1 in magnitude. 

We can try using two of the input-output pairs to solve for 'a' and 'b'. A simple way to find 'b' is to look at the change in 'y' over the change in 'x' between two data points, a method similar to calculating the derivative or the slope of a line. 

Using the points (-2, 17) and (7, -145), the change in 'y' is -145 - 17 = -162, and the change in 'x' is 7 - (-2) = 9. The slope 'b' is then:

b = (-162) / 9
b = -18

Now that we have 'b', we can determine 'a' by plugging 'b' and one pair of 'x' and 'y' into the equation:

17 = a + (-18)(-2)
17 = a + 36
a = 17 - 36
a = -19

Therefore, the linear function that appears to best describe the given data points is:

This function is a linear function of the form y = mx + b, where m represents the slope and b represents the y-intercept. Because we have more than two points, the function should perfectly fit if the relationship is truly linear.

To find the constants a and b (which are equivalent to b and a in the y = mx + b form, respectively):

Let's take any two points to find the slope (m). We'll use (7, -145) and (-2, 17).

m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
m = (-145 - 17) / (7 - (-2))
m = (-162) / (9)
m = -18

So we have b = -18.

Now we need to find a (the y-intercept, which is the same as the constant term in the function we were originally asked for). We can plug the slope and one of the points into the equation to solve for a.

Using point (7, -145):

-145 = -18 * 7 + a
-145 = -126 + a
a = -145 + 126
a = -19

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:
y = -19 + (-18)x, or
y = -18x - 19 (written in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, where a = -19 and b = -18).

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx (since x^0 equals 1), we need to determine the values of a and b that will fit all of the provided input-output pairs.

Let's use two of the input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations:

For the input -2 and output 17:
17 = a - 2b (1)

For the input 7 and output -145:
-145 = a + 7b (2)

Now we will solve this system for a and b.

From equation (1):
a = 17 + 2b

Substituting a from equation (1) into equation (2):
-145 = (17 + 2b) + 7b
-145 = 17 + 9b
-145 - 17 = 9b
-162 = 9b
b = -162 / 9
b = -18

Now that we have b, let's find a using equation (1):
a = 17 + 2(-18)
a = 17 - 36
a = -19

Now we can write the function:
y = a + bx
y = -19 - 18x

Make sure you check this function with the other input-output pairs to ensure it fits all the data:

For x = -10:
y = -19 - 18(-10)
y = -19 + 180
y = 161

For x = 9:
y = -19 - 18(9)
y = -19 - 162
y = -181

For x = -20:
y = -19 - 18(-20)
y = -19 + 360
y = 341

Since it fits all the given pairs, the function that describes the data is:
y = -19 - 18x

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find values that satisfy the relationship between the given inputs (x) and outputs (y). This function simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is 1 for all x except x = 0 (and even then, it's commonly accepted to be 1), and x^1 is just x.

Let's use two data points to calculate the coefficients. We can pick any two points, but to simplify calculations, let's use the first two:

1) For x=-2, y=17:
17 = a + b(-2)

2) For x=7, y=-145:
-145 = a + b(7)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

a - 2b = 17    ...(1)
a + 7b = -145  ...(2)

We can solve this system using a variety of methods, such as substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

By adding equation (1) to equation (2), we can eliminate a and solve for b:

(1) + (2): (a - 2b) + (a + 7b) = 17 - 145
2a + 5b = -128
2a = -128 - 5b      ...(3)

Now, we can solve for a using any of the original equations. Let's use equation (1), isolating a:

a = 17 + 2b       ...(4)

Let's substitute the value of a from (4) into (3):

2(17 + 2b) = -128 - 5b
34 + 4b = -128 - 5b
9b = -162
b = -18

Now that we have b, we can find a using equation (4):

a = 17 + 2(-18)
a = 17 - 36
a = -19

So our function that describes the data is:

y = -19 + (-18)x

    To find a function that captures the relationship in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx (since anything to the power of zero is 1), we need to determine the constants a and b.

Given the data points:

(20, -307),
(-1, 8),
(20, -307),  // This point is the same as the first one and doesn't provide extra information
(12, -187),
(18, -277),

Let's use two distinct points to find a and b. We can choose points (20, -307) and (-1, 8) for this purpose. Substituting these into the equation y = a + bx gives us two equations:

-307 = a + 20b  (1)
8 = a - b        (2)

Now, let's solve this system of equations.

From equation (2), we can express a as:
a = 8 + b

Now we substitute this into equation (1):
-307 = (8 + b) + 20b
-307 = 8 + 21b
-307 - 8 = 21b
-315 = 21b
b = -315 / 21
b = -15

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into the equation for a:
a = 8 + b
a = 8 - 15
a = -7

Thus, the function that describes the data is:
y = -7 + (-15)x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Let's analyze the given input-output pairs to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \) in the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \). This function is linear and can be simplified to \( y = a + bx \), since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any non-zero value of \( x \).

Given the data:

1. For \( x = 20 \), \( y = -307 \):
   \[ -307 = a + b(20) \]

2. For \( x = -1 \), \( y = 8 \):
   \[ 8 = a + b(-1) \]

3. For \( x = 20 \), \( y = -307 \):
   \[ -307 = a + b(20) \]

4. For \( x = 12 \), \( y = -187 \):
   \[ -187 = a + b(12) \]

5. For \( x = 18 \), \( y = -277 \):
   \[ -277 = a + b(18) \]

We notice that the first and third input-output pairs are the same which does not provide additional information, so we can disregard one of them. Now, we will use two of the unique input-output pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Using pair 2 and pair 4:
- For pair 2:
  \[ 8 = a - b \]
  Which can be rewritten as:
  \[ a = 8 + b \] (Equation 1)

- For pair 4:
  \[ -187 = a + 12b \]

We can substitute Equation 1 into the equation for pair 4 to solve for \( b \):
\[ -187 = (8 + b) + 12b \]
\[ -187 = 8 + 13b \]
\[ -195 = 13b \]
\[ b = -15 \]

Now, we can use \( b \) to find \( a \) using Equation 1:
\[ a = 8 + (-15) \]
\[ a = -7 \]

The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, based on the simplified form \( y = a + bx \), is:
\[ y = -7 - 15x \]

Please note that because we have only used two out of the four unique data points, this function might only be an approximation of the actual relationship between input and output. Additionally, if the data is subject to noise or not perfectly linear, this function would be an approximate linear regression.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data points, we first need to recognize that ax^0 is just a, since any number to the power of zero is 1. So, we rewrite the function as y = a + bx. 

The function is linear, and we have multiple inputs and outputs to determine the coefficients a and b. However, because two inputs (20) yield the same output (-307), we can immediately use that information to see that the input does not change the output, suggesting that b is 0. 

Let's check this against all given data points:

1. For input 20, output is -307:
  -307 = a + 20*b
2. For input -1, output is 8:
  8 = a - 1*b
3. For input 20, output is -307 (same as the first):
  -307 = a + 20*b
4. For input 12, output is -187:
  -187 = a + 12*b
5. For input 18, output is -277:
  -277 = a + 18*b

From the first and the third equation, we know that b must be 0 since there is no change in the output even though the input is the same for two different occurrences.

If b = 0, then the function simplifies to y = a. 

We can figure out the value of a by looking at the second equation:

8 = a - 1*0
8 = a

So the function is y = 8 + 0*x, which simplifies to y = 8.

But if we look at other data points, they do not conform to y = 8, which means there is an inconsistency or the data provided does not describe a linear relationship with a single coefficient for b.

However, since we have conflicting data points, we cannot find a consistent linear function in the form y = a + bx that fits all the given data points.

The information provided suggests an error in the data or the relationship may not be linear. For the purpose of the task and given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, and assuming (20, -307) is the correct pair, the closest approximation considering b = 0 due to the duplicate input of 20 yielding the same output would be:

y = -307

But even this does not fit the other points, implying the data might be non-linear or there is some other rule governing the outputs that is not captured by a simple linear function. Further information or clarification would be needed to provide a precise function.

We can observe that for each input x, we have a corresponding output y which we need to describe using the function:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Given that x^0 is always 1, we can simplify this to:

y = a + bx

To find the coefficients a and b, we need at least two unique input-output pairs to solve the system of equations. We have multiple inputs, but the pair with x = 20 is repeated. Still, we have enough unique pairs to work with.

Let's use pairs (20, -307) and (-1, 8):

For (20, -307):

-307 = a + 20b   (1)

For (-1, 8):

8 = a - b        (2)

Now let's solve this system of equations.

From equation (2):
a = 8 + b        (3)

Substitute (3) into (1):

-307 = (8 + b) + 20b
-307 = 8 + 21b
-315 = 21b
b = -315 / 21

(20, -307), (-1, 8), (12, -187), (18, -277)

Since we have more than two points, we can calculate the slope (b) using two points and then find the y-intercept (a). To simplify the calculations, I will use the first and the fourth data points (20, -307) and (18, -277). The slope b is calculated by the change in y divided by the change in x:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-277 + 307) / (18 - 20)
b = (30) / (-2)
b = -15

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To capture the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the coefficients a and b that make the equation hold true for the given set of input-output pairs.

Firstly, the term ax^0 is just a, because anything raised to the zero power is 1.

Therefore, the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given the provided pairs of inputs and outputs:

1. When x = 13, y = -66 (Pair 1)
2. When x = -20, y = 132 (Pair 2)
3. When x = 18, y = -96 (Pair 3)
4. When x = 0, y = 12 (Pair 4)
5. When x = 11, y = -54 (Pair 5)

Pair 4 immediately gives us the value of a since when x = 0, the term bx will be 0, and thus y = a. So, from Pair 4:

12 = a + b(0)
12 = a

We now know that a = 12. Let's plug that into one of the other pairs to solve for b. Let's use Pair 1:

-66 = 12 + b(13)
-66 - 12 = b(13)
-78 = b(13)
b = -78 / 13
b = -6

So we have now found both a and b. The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = 12 + (-6)x
y = 12 - 6x

This fits the form requested: y = ax^0 + bx^1, with a = 12 and b = -6.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The function described in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 can be thought of as a linear equation y = a + bx, where:
- a is the y-intercept, which is the constant term (x^0 = 1 for all x, so ax^0 is just a constant a).
- b is the slope of the line, which is the coefficient in front of the x term (x^1 is just x, so bx^1 is bx).

Given multiple input-output pairs, one can solve for a and b using two of those pairs. Since we have multiple pairs here, we can use any two to solve for a and b in the linear equation, but we should check that the solution is valid for all the given pairs.

Let's take two pairs to set up a system of linear equations and solve for a and b:

Using input-output pair (-17, -325) gives us:
-325 = a + (-17)b

Using input-output pair (16, 269) gives us:
269 = a + (16)b

We can now solve this system of equations to find a and b:

From the first equation:
a = -325 + 17b

Substitute a in the second equation:
269 = (-325 + 17b) + (16)b
269 = -325 + 17b + 16b
269 = -325 + 33b
269 + 325 = 33b
594 = 33b
b = 594 / 33
b = 18

Now that we have b, we can solve for a:
a = -325 + 17(18)
a = -325 + 306
a = -19

So the function is:
y = -19 + 18x

However, let's verify this with all given input-output pairs to ensure its accuracy:

For input -17:
y = -19 + 18(-17)
y = -19 - 306
y = -325 (matches given)

For input -5:
y = -19 + 18(-5)
y = -19 - 90
y = -109 (matches given)

For input 16:
y = -19 + 18(16)
y = -19 + 288
y = 269 (matches given)

For input -15 (given twice):
y = -19 + 18(-15)
y = -19 - 270
y = -289 (matches given)

As the function y = -19 + 18x is consistent with all the given pairs, it is the correct linear relationship based on the provided data.

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we should recognize that this can be simplified to y = a + bx since x^0 is equal to 1 for all x (except for x = 0 which is an undefined case which is not relevant here).

Looking at the provided input and output pairs, we need to figure out the constants a and b:

1. For the input -17, the output is -325: -325 = a -17b
2. For the input -5, the output is -109: -109 = a - 5b
3. For the input 16, the output is 269: 269 = a + 16b
4. For input -15, the output is -289 (repeated, so it provides no new information).

We can set up a system of equations to solve for a and b based on any two unique pairs from the list above. Let’s use pairs (1) and (3), as they seem to be diverse in terms of input values:

-325 = a - 17b
269 = a + 16b

We can solve for a and b using any two of these equations. Let’s solve the system by adding the two equations:

-325 + 269 = a - 17b + a + 16b
-56 = 2a - b
-56/2 = a - b/2
-28 = a - b/2

From here, we solve for a in terms of b:

a = b/2 - 28

Now substituting a into one of our initial equations, let's use the second one:

-109 = (b/2 - 28) - 5b
-109 = b/2 - 28 - 5b
-109 = -9b/2 - 28
-109 + 28 = -9b/2
-81 = -9b/2
b = (2 * -81) / -9
b = -162 / -9
b = 18

Now that we have b, we can solve for a:

a = (18/2) - 28
a = 9 - 28
a = -19

So the function that relates the input x and the output y is:

y = -19 + 18x

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which is essentially \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 \) is always 1 and \( x^1 \) is simply \( x \), we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \). We can do this by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given input-output pairs and solving for \( a \) and \( b \).

Given the pairs:

1. When \( x = -17 \), \( y = -325 \)
2. When \( x = -5 \), \( y = -109 \)
3. When \( x = 16 \), \( y = 269 \)
4. When \( x = -15 \), \( y = -289 \)
5. The last pair is a repetition of the previous one and does not provide a new equation.

From the first pair, we get:

\( -325 = a + b(-17) \)
\( a - 17b = -325 \) - Equation (1)

And from the second pair:

\( -109 = a + b(-5) \)
\( a - 5b = -109 \) - Equation (2)

We can solve these two linear equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).

Subtracting Equation (2) from Equation (1), we get:

\( (-325 - (-109)) = (-17b - (-5b)) \)
\( -325 + 109 = -17b + 5b \)
\( -216 = -12b \)
\( b = 18 \)

Using \( b = 18 \) in Equation (2):

\( a - 5(18) = -109 \)
\( a - 90 = -109 \)
\( a = -109 + 90 \)
\( a = -19 \)

Therefore, our function is:

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since any number to the power of zero is 1, we need to determine the values of a and b that will satisfy the equation using the given input-output pairs.

We have the following pairs: (-17, -325), (-5, -109), (16, 269), (-15, -289), repeating (-15, -289).

Let's consider the first two pairs to set up two equations:

1. For input -17, output -325:

-325 = a + b(-17)

2. For input -5, output -109:

-109 = a + b(-5)

Now, let's solve this system of equations to find a and b.

From equation 1:   a = -325 + 17b  ... (equation 3)

Substitute a from equation 3 into equation 2:

-109 = (-325 + 17b) + b(-5)
-109 = -325 + 17b - 5b
-109 = -325 + 12b
12b = 216
b = 18

Now substitute the value of b back into equation 3 to find a:

a = -325 + 17 * 18
a = -325 + 306
a = -19

Now, we must check if these values work with all the input-output pairs. Since we have a repeating pair (-15, -289), it will not provide a different equation, so we can ignore it for now and check the other non-repeating pairs:

For input 16, output 269:

269 = -19 + 18(16)
269 = -19 + 288
269 = 269   ✓ (Matches)

Since we only have 3 unique points and we've used two to determine the two unknowns and the third point fits the function, we can be confident that this is the correct function. Now let's write the function in the required form:

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to recognize the pattern in the given input-output pairs. We observe that the output increases as the input increases, which suggests a linear relationship since the function is of the form y = a + bx.

Given the pairs:
1. When x = -17, y = -325
2. When x = -5, y = -109
3. When x = 16, y = 269
4. When x = -15, y = -289
5. When x = -15, y = -289 (repeated, so no additional information)

From the pairs, we can establish two simultaneous equations using two different input-output pairs to solve for a and b:

From pair 1:
-325 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)
-325 = a - 17b          (1)

From pair 2:
-109 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)
-109 = a - 5b           (2)

Now, we can solve these two equations:

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:

(-325) - (-109) = (a - 17b) - (a - 5b)
-325 + 109 = -17b + 5b
-216 = -12b
b = 18

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it into one of the equations to find a. Using equation (2):

-109 = a - 5(18)
-109 = a - 90
a = -109 + 90
a = -19

So the function that relates the inputs and outputs is:

\( b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-158 - 142}{-10 - 10} = \frac{-300}{-20} = 15 \)

Equation 1:

By adding the two equations, we eliminate `b`:

\(b = 14\)

Now that we have \(b\), we can solve for \(a\):

\(a - b = -8\)
\(a - 14 = -8\)
\(a = -8 + 14\)
\(a = 6\)

So the function that best captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs given is:

\(y = 6 + 14x\)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants a and b. The term ax^0 will always be equal to a, since any number to the power of zero is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Now, let's use the given inputs and their corresponding outputs to find the values of a and b.

When input (x) is -1, output (y) is -8:
-8 = a + b(-1)  ->  Equation 1
When input (x) is 5, output (y) is 76:
76 = a + b(5)  ->  Equation 2
Let's solve these equations to find values for a and b.

From Equation 1:
-8 = a - b  ->  a = b - 8  ->  Equation 3

Now let’s plug the value from Equation 3 into Equation 2:
76 = (b - 8) + b(5)
76 = 5b + b - 8
76 = 6b - 8
76 + 8 = 6b
84 = 6b
b = 84 / 6
b = 14

Now we'll find the value of a using Equation 3:
a = b - 8
a = 14 - 8
a = 6

Our function y = a + bx becomes:
y = 6 + 14x

We can verify this function with the other given input-output pairs:

For input 3 (x = 3), the output should be 48:
y = 6 + 14(3) = 6 + 42 = 48 (which matches the given output)

For input 8 (x = 8), the output should be 118:
y = 6 + 14(8) = 6 + 112 = 118 (which matches the given output)

For input 13 (x = 13), the output should be 188:
y = 6 + 14(13) = 6 + 182 = 188 (which matches the given output)

Therefore, the function is correctly captured as y = 6 + 14x.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to recognize a pattern in the inputs and outputs. The term ax^0 is equivalent to a because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx, where a and b are constants that we want to determine.

Given the inputs and outputs, we can plug in the values to form a system of equations.

For the input -1 and output -8:
-8 = a + b(-1) ... (1)

For the input 5 and output 76:
76 = a + b(5) ... (2)

For the input 3 and output 48:
48 = a + b(3) ... (3)

For the input 8 and output 118:
118 = a + b(8) ... (4)

For the input 13 and output 188:
188 = a + b(13) ... (5)

If we take two of these equations, we can solve for a and b using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use equations (1) and (2) in this example.

From equation (1):
-8 = a - b
a = -8 + b ... (6)

Now plug the expression for a from equation (6) into equation (2):

76 = (-8 + b) + 5b
76 = -8 + 6b
84 = 6b
b = 14

Now we can substitute b back into equation (6) to find a:

a = -8 + b
a = -8 + 14
a = 6

Let's check these constants with the another set of inputs and outputs to make sure they are correct. Using the input 3 and output 48:

48 = a + b(3)
48 = 6 + 14(3)
48 = 6 + 42
48 = 48

That checks out. Now we can write the function explicitly in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 using the constants we found:

Function: y = 6x^0 + 14x^1

Since x^0 is 1, we can simplify this to:

Function: y = 6 + 14x

    To find the correct function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are essentially fitting a line to the data points provided. In this linear equation (which is analogous to y = a + bx), ax^0 is the y-intercept (since x^0 is always 1), and bx^1 is the slope times the input x.

Let's denote:
- a as the y-intercept
- b as the slope
- x as the input
- y as the output

Given the points (-1, -8), (5, 76), (3, 48), (8, 118), (13, 188), we can set up two equations using two pairs of points to solve for a and b.

Using the point (x, y) = (-1, -8), the equation is:
-8 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)
-8 = a - b
a = b - 8 ... (1)

Using the point (x, y) = (5, 76), the equation is:
76 = a(5)^0 + b(5)
76 = a + 5b
5b = 76 - a
b = (76 - a) / 5 ... (2)

Let's use another point to create a third equation. Taking (x, y) = (3, 48):
48 = a(3)^0 + b(3)
48 = a + 3b
3b = 48 - a
b = (48 - a) / 3 ... (3)

Now we have two expressions for b (equations (2) and (3)). Setting them equal to each other:

(76 - a) / 5 = (48 - a) / 3
3(76 - a) = 5(48 - a)
228 - 3a = 240 - 5a
5a - 3a = 240 - 228
2a = 12
a = 12 / 2
a = 6

Next, we plug the value of a into equation (2) or (3) to find b. Using equation (2):
b = (76 - 6) / 5
b = 70 / 5
b = 14

Therefore, the function that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = 6x^0 + 14x^1
Which simplifies to:
y = 6 + 14x

Now let's check this function against the other data points to ensure it fits well.

For the input x = 3:
y = 6 + 14(3) = 6 + 42 = 48
Which matches the given output.

For the input x = 8:
y = 6 + 14(8) = 6 + 112 = 118

For the input x = 13:

It appears that the function y = 6 + 14x accurately represents the data provided.

    To find the function that best captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), given that the function is in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we need to determine the values of a and b. 

The term \(ax^0\) will always be a, since \(x^0\) is 1 for any value of x (except for x = 0, for which it's undefined but is considered 1 in practice for continuous functions). The term \(bx^1\) is simply bx, since any number raised to the power of 1 is itself. So, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We have pairs of inputs and outputs which can be considered coordinates (x, y) that the function must pass through:

(-1, -8), (5, 76), (3, 48), (8, 118), and (13, 188)

We can plug in the x and y values from two different points to create two equations and then solve for a and b. However, looking at the provided points, it's clear that the change in y relative to the change in x is consistent, implying that b should be constant and that a can be determined by the difference. 

We can see this by calculating the slope (b) between consecutive points, which should be the same if the relationship is linear.

Using points (5, 76) and (8, 118), we calculate the slope:

b = (118 - 76) / (8 - 5) = 42 / 3 = 14

Now that we know b, we can solve for a using any of the points provided. We'll use the point (5, 76):

76 = a + 14*5
76 = a + 70
a = 76 - 70
a = 6

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 6 + 14x

Writing this in the requested format:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1
Function: y = 6x^0 + 14x^1

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we should recognize that this is a linear equation:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = a + bx

Here, ax^0 simplifies to a since any number (except 0) to the power of 0 is 1. Now, we need to find the values of a and b that best fit the provided input-output pairs.

Given the data points:

1. (1, 2)
2. (-19, 122)
3. (17, -94)
4. (15, -82)
5. (-6, 44)

Let's solve for a and b using two of the given points. We choose two points to formulate a system of two equations with two unknowns. For convenience, let's pick the first two points:

Using point (1, 2):
2 = a + b(1)
2 = a + b

Using point (-19, 122):
122 = a + b(-19)
122 = a - 19b

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. 2 = a + b 
2. 122 = a - 19b

Solving the first equation for a gives us a = 2 - b.

Substituting a in the second equation:

122 = (2 - b) - 19b
122 = 2 - 20b
120 = -20b
b = -6

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find a:

2 = a + (-6)(1)
2 = a - 6
a = 8

Therefore, the linear function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we essentially need to find the values of a and b that satisfy the given input-output pairs. The term ax^0 is just a, since any number raised to the zeroth power is 1. The term bx^1 is simply bx, since any number raised to the first power is itself. 

So, we're looking for a function y = a + bx that fits the data.

To find a and b, we need at least two (x, y) pairs. Once we have the equation system, we can solve for a and b. However, there may not be an exact fit for a and b if the data is not perfectly linear. If the data is not linear, we would typically use a method like least-squares regression to find the best fit. In this context, though, I will treat the problem as though a perfect linear fit is possible and use two of the given points to determine a and b.

Let's use the first two data points to create our equations:

Using input 1 (x = 1) and output 2 (y = 2), we get the equation 2 = a + b.
Using input -19 (x = -19) and output 122 (y = 122), we get the equation 122 = a - 19b.

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1) a + b = 2
2) a - 19b = 122

To solve for a and b, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
(a - 19b) - (a + b) = 122 - 2
a - a - 19b - b = 120
-20b = 120

Dividing both sides by -20 to solve for b:
b = 120 / -20
b = -6

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into the first equation to solve for a:
a + (-6) = 2
a - 6 = 2
Adding 6 to both sides to solve for a:
a = 8

Therefore, the function that fits the given data points is:
y = a + bx
y = 8 - 6x

However, this is calculated using only two points and might not represent the entire dataset adequately. Normally for such a small dataset, you could solve the system of linear equations with all the points, however, that could result in an over-determined system which might not have an exact solution. To verify our function fits all the points, we would need to check this function against all the provided data points.

Let's check the function y = 8 - 6x with all provided data points:

For x = 1, y = 8 - 6*1 = 2 (matches the given output for x=1)
For x = -19, y = 8 - 6*(-19) = 8 + 114 = 122 (matches the given output for x=-19)
For x = 17, y = 8 - 6*17 = 8 - 102 = -94 (matches the given output for x=17)
For x = 15, y = 8 - 6*15 = 8 - 90 = -82 (matches the given output for x=15)
For x = -6, y = 8 - 6*(-6) = 8 + 36 = 44 (matches the given output for x=-6)

Since the derived function matches all given data points, we can conclude:

    Given the data points:

(1, 2)
(-19, 122)
(17, -94)
(15, -82)
(-6, 44)

We are looking to describe the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1,

which simplifies to:

y = a + bx,

because x^0 = 1 for any value of x (except when x=0, in that case x^0 is undefined).

To determine the constants 'a' and 'b', we could use any two distinct data points to set up a system of linear equations, assuming the relationship is linear. Using the given points (1, 2) and (-19, 122), we can set up the following equations:

For (1, 2):
2 = a + b(1)
2 = a + b

For (-19, 122):
122 = a + b(-19)
122 = a - 19b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1) a + b = 2
2) a - 19b = 122

We can solve this system to find the values of 'a' and 'b'. Let's subtract the second equation from the first one:

(a + b) - (a - 19b) = 2 - 122
a + b - a + 19b = -120
20b = -120

Now solving for b:
b = -120 / 20
b = -6

Now we substitute this value into the first equation to find 'a':

a + (-6) = 2
a - 6 = 2
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

So, the function in the specified form is:

y = 8 - 6x

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we have to understand that \( x^0 \) is always equal to 1 for any nonzero value of \( x \), and \( bx^1 \) is just \( bx \). So, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We have five pairs of inputs and outputs, which give us five equations:

1. \( y = a + b(1) \) when \( x = 1 \), hence \( 2 = a + b \)
2. \( y = a + b(-19) \) when \( x = -19 \), hence \( 122 = a - 19b \)
3. \( y = a + b(17) \) when \( x = 17 \), hence \( -94 = a + 17b \)
4. \( y = a + b(15) \) when \( x = 15 \), hence \( -82 = a + 15b \)
5. \( y = a + b(-6) \) when \( x = -6 \), hence \( 44 = a - 6b \)

We can use any two of these equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). To keep things simple, let's use equations 1 and 5:

\( 2 = a + b \)    (Equation 1)
\( 44 = a - 6b \) (Equation 5)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. By multiplying the first equation by 6, we get:

\( 12 = 6a + 6b \)

Now subtract equation 5 from this new equation:

\( 12 = 6a + 6b \)
\(-44 = a - 6b \)
\[ ---------------- \]
\( -32 = 5a \)

Dividing both sides by 5 to solve for \( a \):

\( a = \frac{-32}{5} = -6.4 \)

Now insert \( a \) into equation 1 to solve for \( b \):

\( 2 = -6.4 + b \)
\( b = 2 + 6.4 \)
\( b = 8.4 \)

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the constants 'a' and 'b' in the function `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to understand that `x^0` is always 1, and `x^1` is simply `x`. 

Therefore, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We have a system of equations based on the given input-output pairs:

1. 2 = a + b(1)
2. 122 = a + b(-19)
3. -94 = a + b(17)
4. -82 = a + b(15)
5. 44 = a + b(-6)

We can solve this system to find the values of a and b that best fit the data. For a simple linear model, we typically would only need two points, but here we have five, which suggests we might not be able to fit a perfect line to the data. We will have to find the values of 'a' and 'b' that minimize the error across all points, typically using a method like least squares.

However, to illustrate the process with basic algebra, we can tentatively solve for 'a' and 'b' using two points first and then check those against our other points to see if they fit:

Let's pick two points (1, 2) and (-19, 122) to construct two equations and then solve for 'a' and 'b':

2 = a + b(1)
122 = a + b(-19)

Rearranging the first equation we get:
a = 2 - b

Substituting that into the second equation:
122 = (2 - b) + b(-19)
122 = 2 - b - 19b
122 = 2 - 20b
120 = -20b
b = -6

Then substitute b back into the first equation to solve for 'a':
a = 2 - (-6)
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

So our preliminary function is:
y = 8 - 6x

Testing this function with the other points:
-94 = 8 - 6(17) = 8 - 102 ≠ -94 (does not fit)
-82 = 8 - 6(15) = 8 - 90 ≠ -82 (does not fit)
44 = 8 - 6(-6) = 8 + 36 = 44 (fits)

Since the function does not work for all points, this suggests that a single linear function may not describe the entire data set perfectly. However, using the two points (1, 2) and (-19, 122), the best linear function we can derive from this limited information is:

y = 8 - 6x

This linear function fits some but not all of the given data points, which implies that either there is some error in the data or that the relationship between inputs and outputs is not perfectly linear and might require a more complex model to be accurately captured.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the data, let's first understand the terms:

- ax^0 is simply a since x^0 is 1 for any x that is not zero.
- bx^1 is just bx, since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself.

Therefore, the function we're looking for is y = a + bx.

Given the data points, we need to find a and b such that the function matches the outputs for the corresponding inputs. We have several data points which we can use to find a pattern.

Let's take a look at the data points:

-292 = a + b(-17)

For input -6, output is -105:  
-105 = a + b(-6)

-275 = a + b(-16)

For input -18, output is -309:  
-309 = a + b(-18)

For input 1, output is 14:  
14 = a + b(1)

When looking at the outputs, one might observe that they are somewhat proportionate to the inputs (considering the absolute values). The difference between the input values across our pairs gives us insight into the coefficient 'b'. Let's use the given pair of (-17, -292) and (-16, -275):

-292 = a - 17b  
-275 = a - 16b

Now we'll subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate 'a' and find the value of 'b':

-292 - (-275) = (-17b) - (-16b)  
-17 = b

Now that we have 'b', let's use the pair (1, 14) to find 'a':

14 = a + 1(-17)  
14 = a - 17  
a = 14 + 17  
a = 31

Now we have both 'a' and 'b', thus the function can be written as:

y = 31 - 17x

Substituting into the function form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where a = 31 and b = -17, we get:

y = 31x^0 - 17x^1

This function should now describe the provided input-output relationship in the data.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), given in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to recognize that ax^0 is essentially a constant (since any number to the zeroth power is 1) and bx^1 is simply bx (since any number to the first power is itself). Therefore, we are looking for a function of the form:

y = a + bx

where a is a constant and b is the coefficient of x.

Given the data points:

(-17, -292)
(-6, -105)
(-16, -275)
(-18, -309)
(1, 14)

We can see that the output (y) decreases as the input (x) decreases, suggesting that b is negative. Additionally, when x increases by 1, the change in y (∆y) should be consistent since we're assuming a linear relationship.

Look at the following two data points: (1, 14) and (-17, -292).

When x increases from -17 to 1 (a change of 18 units), y increases from -292 to 14 (a change of 306 units).
The rate of change is Δy/Δx = 306/18 = 17.

So for each increase in x by 1, y increases by 17 units, suggesting b = 17. Now we just need to find a.

Let's use the data point (1, 14).
Plugging in those values into our function we get:

14 = a + 17*1
14 = a + 17
a = 14 - 17
a = -3

Therefore, our function that fits the data provided is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that will make the function describe the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y).

Given that \( ax^0 \) essentially simplifies to \( a \) (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), and \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \), our function looks like this:

\( y = a + bx \)

Let's use two of the data points to create a system of equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Take the inputs and outputs (-17, -292) and (1, 14):

For input -17 and output -292:
\( -292 = a + b(-17) \)
\( -292 = a - 17b \) ... (1)

For input 1 and output 14:
\( 14 = a + b(1) \)
\( 14 = a + b \) ... (2)

Now, let's solve this system of equations. Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

\( -292 - 14 = a - 17b - (a + b) \)
\( -306 = -18b \)

Divide by -18:

\( b = \frac{-306}{-18} \)
\( b = 17 \)

Now that we have the value for \( b \), we can substitute it back into equation (2) to solve for \( a \):

\( 14 = a + 17 \times 1 \)
\( 14 = a + 17 \)
\( a = 14 - 17 \)
\( a = -3 \)

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\( y = -3 + 17x \)

So for \( x = -5 \):

\( y = -3 + 17(-5) \)
\( y = -3 - 85 \)
\( y = -88 \)

Therefore, the output for the input -5 is:

    We are given 5 points (input-output pairs): `(-17, -292), (-6, -105), (-16, -275), (-18, -309), (1, 14)`. The requested function is linear and follows the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

which simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

To find the parameters \(a\) and \(b\), we need to define a system of equations using the given points. We'll use two of the points to set up two equations and solve for \(a\) and \(b\). Let's choose the points (1, 14) and (-6, -105) for convenience.

By substituting \(x = 1\) and \(y = 14\):

\[ 14 = a + b \cdot 1 \] 
\[ 14 = a + b \]

And by substituting \(x = -6\) and \(y = -105\):

\[ -105 = a + b \cdot (-6) \]
\[ -105 = a - 6b \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) \( 14 = a + b \)
2) \( -105 = a - 6b \)

We can solve this system by using substitution or elimination. If we subtract equation 2 from equation 1, we get:

\[ 14 - (-105) = (a + b) - (a - 6b) \]
\[ 119 = 7b \]
\[ b = 17 \]

Now, we can substitute \(b = 17\) back into either equation 1 or 2 to solve for \(a\). Using equation 1:

\[ 14 = a + 17 \]
\[ a = 14 - 17 \]
\[ a = -3 \]

We want to fit our function to the form:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Given the data points, we can form the following set of equations:

1. For input -17: \( a - 17b = -292 \)
2. For input -6: \( a - 6b = -105 \)
3. For input -16: \( a - 16b = -275 \)
4. For input -18: \( a - 18b = -309 \)
5. For input 1: \( a + b = 14 \)

We can solve this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \). However, it looks like we have too many equations for a simple linear regression, which generally only needs two points to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). Nevertheless, we should find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that fit all points well. 

Given the differences in the outputs seem to be consistent as the inputs change incrementally (for example, from -17 to -16 and from -16 to -18), the coefficient \( b \) seems consistent. 

We can take any two points to determine \( a \) and \( b \), but let's choose the two points where the difference in inputs is 1 unit, to ensure easy calculation:

Using inputs -16 and -17: 

For input -16: \( a - 16b = -275 \) (Equation 1)
For input -17: \( a - 17b = -292 \) (Equation 2)

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2, we get:

\[ (a - 17b) - (a - 16b) = -292 - (-275) \]
\[ -17b + 16b = -17 \]
\[ -b = -17 \]
\[ b = 17 \]

Now we can substitute \( b \) back into any of the original five equations to find \( a \). Let's use the point (1, 14):

\( a + 17(1) = 14 \)
\( a = 14 - 17 \)
\( a = -3 \)

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 which is actually y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for any x except for x = 0, and x^1 is simply x, we need to determine the constants a and b such that this linear equation fits the provided input-output pairs.

Given the pairs:

(-7, 130), (14, -290), (-12, 230), (16, -330), and (16, -330)

We notice that for each increase in input, there is a consistent decrease in output, suggesting a negative slope. To find this linear relationship, we can use any two points to determine the slope (b).

Using points (14, -290) and (-7, 130):

slope (b) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-290 - 130) / (14 - (-7))
b = (-420) / (21)
b = -20

Now that we have b, we can find the y-intercept (a) by substituting b and one of the points back into the equation y = a + bx. Let's use the point (14, -290):

-290 = a + (-20)(14)
-290 = a - 280
a = -290 + 280

2. -290 = a(14)^0 + b(14)^1
3. 230 = a(-12)^0 + b(-12)^1
4. -330 = a(16)^0 + b(16)^1

Since x^0 is always 1, the equations simplify to:

1. 130 = a - 7b
2. -290 = a + 14b
3. 230 = a - 12b
4. -330 = a + 16b

We can use any two pairs to find a and b. Let's use pairs (1) and (2):

From (1): a = 130 + 7b
From (2): a = -290 - 14b

Equating both expressions for a gives us:

130 + 7b = -290 - 14b

Solving for b gives us:

21b = -420
b = -20

Substitute the value of b in the equation a = 130 + 7b to find a:

a = 130 + 7(-20)
a = 130 - 140

2) x = 14, y = -290
3) x = -12, y = 230
4) x = 16, y = -330
5) x = 16, y = -330 (this is a duplicate of the 4th point and doesn't provide additional information)

Using two distinct points (1 and 2, for example) we can form a system of linear equations to solve for a and b:

For x = -7, y = 130:
130 = a - 7b     ... (1)

For x = 14, y = -290:
-290 = a + 14b   ... (2)

Now, we can solve the system of equations to find values for a and b. Let's multiply equation (1) by 2 to eliminate a when subtracted from equation (2):

2(130) = 2a - 7(2b)
260 = 2a - 14b    ... (3)

Now subtract equation (3) from equation (2):
-290 - 260 = a + 14b - (2a - 14b)
-550 = -a

Now we have found a:
a = 550

Insert a into equation (1) to find b:
130 = 550 - 7b
7b = 550 - 130
7b = 420
b = 60

Now we have both a and b:
a = 550
b = 60

So the function is:
y = 550 + 60x

However, we need to check this against the other points to make sure the function is consistent. Checking with x = -12:

y = 550 - 720
y = -170

    Based on the provided inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations that correspond to the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1  
y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 for any x except for x = 0.

Let's substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation to find a and b:

For input -7, output 130:
130 = a + b(-7) ... (1)

For input 14, output -290:
-290 = a + b(14)  ... (2)

For input -12, output 230:
230 = a + b(-12) ... (3)

For input 16, output -330:
-330 = a + b(16)  ... (4)

We have four equations, but only two are necessary to solve for a and b since they are constants. Let's use equations (1) and (2) to construct a system of equations to solve for a and b.

From equation (1):
130 = a - 7b  ... (1)

From equation (2):
-290 = a + 14b ... (2)

Now, let's solve this system of equations. We can do this by multiplying equation (1) by 2 and adding it to equation (2) to eliminate a:

2*(130) = 2a - 14b  ... (1 modified)
-290 = a + 14b       ... (2)

260 = 2a - 14b
-290 = a + 14b

Adding the above equations gives us:
260 - 290 = 2a - a
-30 = a

Now that we have a, we can use either equation (1) or (2) to solve for b. Using equation (1) with the found value of a:

130 = -30 - 7b
160 = -7b
b = -160 / -7
b = 160 / 7
b = 22.857...

So, the coefficients are as follows:
a = -30,
b ≈ 22.857

Therefore, the approximate function capturing the relationship between the input and output is:
y = -30 + 22.857x

However, given the nature of the input/output pairs, these values should actually be exact to prevent any deviations. Let's check our calculations.

Let's check with the input 14 (from equation 2):
y = -30 + 22.857(14) 
y = -30 + 320
y = 290

Which does not match the desired output of -290, indicating a mistake in our calculations. Let's recalculate:

1) Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get:
260 = 2a - 14b

2) Adding the modified first equation to the second one, we get:
260 - 290 = 2a - a - 14b + 14b
-30 = a

Now we go back to the first equation to solve for b using the value we've found for a (-30):
130 = -30 - 7b 
160 = -7b
b = -160 / -7
b = 22.857...

It seems that we have reached the same point as before, which indicates a potential error in the logic. Given the fixed relationship in these linear equations represented by the inputs and outputs, b should be an integer or a simple fraction. Let's go back and solve the system of equations using equations (1) and (2) once more, but with a sharper attention to detail.

From equation (1):
130 = a - 7b  ... (1)

From equation (2):
-290 = a + 14b ... (2)

To eliminate b, we can multiply equation (1) by 2 and add to equation (2):

2 * (130) = 2a - 14b  ... (1') -> 260 = 2a - 14b
-290 = a + 14b         ... (2)

Adding (1') and (2) we get:
260 - 290 = 2a - 14b + a + 14b
-30 = 3a
a = -10

Now we calculate b by substituting a back into either equation (1) or (2); let's use equation (1):
130 = -10 - 7b
140 = -7b
b = -20

So our corrected coefficients are:
a = -10
b = -20

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given inputs and outputs, we must determine the constants a and b. Since ax^0 is just a (because any number to the zero power is 1), we are essentially fitting a linear function of the form y = a + bx.

Given the data points:

1. When x = -7, y = 130
2. When x = 14, y = -290
3. When x = -12, y = 230
4. When x = 16, y = -330

To solve for a and b, we need to set up a system of equations. However, in this case, we can immediately notice that with equal increments in x, there seems to be equal decrements in y, which is indicative of a linear relationship where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the line.

Looking at the inputs and outputs, let's calculate the differences in y for known differences in x:

From Point 1 to Point 3 (x from -7 to -12, a change of -5 units):
230 - 130 = 100

The change in x is -5 and the change in y is 100, so we get one slope calculation:
100/-5 = -20

From Point 3 to Point 4 (x from -12 to 16, a change of 28 units):
-330 - 230 = -560

The change in x is 28 and the change in y is -560, so we get another slope calculation:
-560/28 = -20

The slope b is consistent across these two calculations and equal to -20. We can use this slope and one of the points to solve for a. Let's use Point 1 (x = -7, y = 130):

Given the pairs of input (x) and output (y), we can set up a system of equations to solve for a and b.

Using the given input-output pairs:

1) For x = -14, y = -97:
-97 = a + b(-14)

2) For x = 7, y = 50:
50 = a + b(7)

3) For x = 2, y = 15:
15 = a + b(2)

Since we have two unique input-output pairs (the pair with x = -14 and y = -97 is repeated), we can only solve for a and b using these two unique pairs.

Let's use (2) and (3):

For (2):
50 = a + 7b (Equation 2)

For (3):
15 = a + 2b (Equation 3)

Now we'll subtract Equation 3 from Equation 2 to eliminate a and only solve for b:

(50 = a + 7b) - (15 = a + 2b)
35 = 5b
b = 35 / 5
b = 7

Now we substitute b = 7 into either Equation 2 or Equation 3 to find a. We'll use Equation 3:

15 = a + 2b
15 = a + 2(7)
15 = a + 14
a = 15 - 14
a = 1

So, we have found that:
a = 1,
b = 7.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that will make the function fit the given input-output pairs. Let's first simplify the function by noting that any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, so \( x^0 \) is simply 1. This simplifies our function to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Now let's use the given input-output pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Since we have several input-output pairs, we can use two of them to form a system of equations and solve for our coefficients.

Using the pairs (-14, -97) and (2, 15):

1. \( -97 = a + b(-14) \)
2. \( 15 = a + b(2) \)

Now, we solve this system of linear equations. Let’s first use the second equation to express \( a \) in terms of \( b \):

\[ a = 15 - 2b \]

Substitute this into the first equation:

\[ -97 = (15 - 2b) + b(-14) \]
\[ -97 = 15 - 28b - 14b \]
\[ -97 = 15 - 42b \]
\[ -97 - 15 = -42b \]
\[ -112 = -42b \]
\[ b = \frac{112}{42} \]
\[ b = \frac{8}{3} \]

Now that we have \( b \), we can substitute it back into the equation for \( a \):

\[ a = 15 - 2b \]
\[ a = 15 - 2(\frac{8}{3}) \]
\[ a = 15 - \frac{16}{3} \]
\[ a = \frac{45}{3} - \frac{16}{3} \]
\[ a = \frac{29}{3} \]

Putting these together, our function is:

\[ y = \frac{29}{3} + \frac{8}{3}x \]

To ensure that this formula is indeed the correct one, let's check it with the other input-output pairs.

For the input 7:

\[ y = \frac{29}{3} + \frac{8}{3}(7) \]
\[ y = \frac{29}{3} + \frac{56}{3} \]
\[ y = \frac{85}{3} \]
\[ y = 28.333... \]

Since this does not match the given output of 50 when the input is 7, the calculated values of \( a \) and \( b \) are incorrect. There seems to have been an error in the calculation or the approach to solving for the coefficients.

Given that two different x inputs (7 and -14) are both giving the same output, it's apparent there is a linear relationship. To adjust the function adequately, we can simply take two different input-output pairs and calculate the slope, \( b \), between them:

Let's try calculating the slope ( \( b \) ) again using the formula for slope between two points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\):

\[ b = \frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1} \]

Using the input-output pairs (-14, -97) and (7, 50):

\[ b = \frac{50 - (-97)}{7 - (-14)} = \frac{147}{21} = 7 \]

The slope is 7, so \( b = 7 \). To find \( a \), we can now use one of the input-output pairs with the newfound value of \( b \). Using the input-output pair (2, 15):

\[ 15 = a + 7(2) \]
\[ 15 = a + 14 \]
\[ a = 15 - 14 \]
\[ a = 1 \]

So the corrected function is:

\[ y = 1 + 7x \]

Now we check this function with all input-output pairs:

For input -14:
\[ y = 1 + 7(-14) = 1 - 98 = -97 \]

For input 2:
\[ y = 1 + 7(2) = 1 + 14 = 15 \]

For input 7:
\[ y = 1 + 7(7) = 1 + 49 = 50 \]

The function fits all given data points, so the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

\[ y = 1 + 7x \]

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first note that ax^0 is simply a (since any number to the power of zero is 1), and bx^1 is bx (since any number to the power of one is the number itself). So the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We have pairs of inputs and outputs:

(-14, -97)
(7, 50)
(2, 15)
(7, 50)

We will use two pairs to create a system of equations and solve for a and b.

Using the pairs (-14, -97) and (2, 15), we can setup the following equations:

-97 = a - 14b
15 = a + 2b

To solve the system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.

Multiply the second equation by 7 to align the b terms:

-97 = a - 14b
105 = 7a + 14b

Now add both equations to eliminate b:

(105 - 97) = 7a + a
8 = 8a

Divide both sides by 8:

a = 1

Substitute a back into one of the original equations to solve for b:

15 = 1 + 2b
14 = 2b
b = 7

Therefore, the function that fits the given points is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we need to recognize that \(ax^0\) is essentially \(a\), as any number to the power of 0 is 1, and \(bx^1\) is simply \(bx\), as any number to the power of 1 is itself.

Thus, we are looking for a function of the form \(y = a + bx\).

Given the data points:

1. \(x = -14\), \(y = -97\)
2. \(x = -14\), \(y = -97\) (This is the same as the first point and doesn't provide any new information.)
3. \(x = 7\), \(y = 50\)
4. \(x = 2\), \(y = 15\)
5. \(x = 7\), \(y = 50\) (This is the same as the third point and doesn't provide any new information.)

We can use two different data points to find a and b. Let's use the points \((-14, -97)\) and \( (7, 50)\).

We can set up two equations:

1. \( -97 = a + (-14)b \)
2. \( 50 = a + 7b \)

Now we can solve for a and b using these two equations.

From the first equation:
 \( a = -97 + 14b \) ... (equation 3)

Substitute \( a \) from equation 3 into the second equation:
 \( 50 = (-97 + 14b) + 7b \)
 \( 50 = -97 + 21b \)
 \( 147 = 21b \)
 \( b = 7 \)

Now solve for \( a \) using the value of \( b \) in equation 3:
 \( a = -97 + 14*7 \)
 \( a = -97 + 98 \)
 \( a = 1 \)

So, the function that fits the given data points is:

    Let's use the given inputs and outputs to determine the values of \( a \) (the y-intercept) and \( b \) (the slope of the line) in the linear function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \). The \( ax^0 \) term simplifies to \( a \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) that isn't 0. So the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We are given pairs of values for \( x \) and \( y \):

1. \( x = -14, y = -97 \)
2. \( x = 7, y = 50 \)
3. \( x = 2, y = 15 \)

We can set up a system of equations using two pairs of values to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). For example, we can use pairs (1) and (3):

1. \( -97 = a + b(-14) \)
2. \( 15 = a + b(2) \)

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

From the second equation:
\( a = 15 - 2b \)

Substitute \( a \) in the first equation:

\( -97 = (15 - 2b) + b(-14) \)
\( -97 = 15 - 2b - 14b \)
\( -97 = 15 - 16b \)
\( -112 = -16b \)
\( b = 7 \)

Substitute \( b \) into the expression for \( a \):

\( a = 15 - 2(7) \)
\( a = 15 - 14 \)
\( a = 1 \)

Now we have found \( a \) and \( b \):

\( a = 1 \)
\( b = 7 \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we need to determine the coefficients 'a' and 'b'. This expression is equivalent to the linear function y = a + bx, because x^0 is always 1 for any x that is not 0.

With the linear function y = a + bx, we have two unknowns, so normally two points are sufficient to determine the function. However, we have been given five points, which could be more than needed if they are consistent or might suggest that there is no single linear function that exactly fits all the points if they are inconsistent. We will try to find a linear function that fits the points as closely as possible.

Let’s construct two equations using two pairs of the given points to solve for 'a' and 'b':

Using the points (5, -26) and (1, -14), we have:

-26 = a + 5b (1)
-14 = a + b   (2)

We can solve these two equations in two unknowns to find 'a' and 'b'. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) gives:

-12 = 4b
b = -12 / 4
b = -3

Now, we can use this ‘b’ value in equation (2) to find 'a':

-14 = a - 3
a = -14 + 3
a = -11

The resulting linear function appears to be y = -11 + (-3)x or y = -11 - 3x.

However, since we utilized only two points from the five available, it is important to check whether this function fits all the other points:

For input -14:
y = -11 - 3(-14)
y = -11 + 42
y = 31 (matches the given output)

For input -5:
y = -11 - 3(-5)
y = -11 + 15
y = 4 (matches the given output)

For input -8:
y = -11 - 3(-8)
y = -11 + 24
y = 13 (matches the given output)

Since all points match the function y = -11 - 3x, we can conclude that this function describes the relationship between inputs and outputs for the provided data points.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), we need to determine the parameters \( a \) and \( b \) that will produce the output values given the respective input values.

Given the input and output pairs, we can set up a system of equations:

For the input of 5:
\( -26 = a + 5b \)

For the input of 1:
\( -14 = a + b \)

For the input of -14:
\( 31 = a - 14b \)

For the input of -5:
\( 4 = a - 5b \)

For the input of -8:
\( 13 = a - 8b \)

From the input of 1 and the output of -14, we can determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) with ease. Substituting \( x = 1 \) and \( y = -14 \) into our simplified function format yields:

\( -14 = a + 1b \)
\( -14 = a + b \)
\( -14 - b = a \)

Now we can use the result of \( a = -14 - b \) and substitute it into one of the other equations to find the value of \( b \). Let's use the input of 5 and output of -26:

\( -26 = a + 5b \)

Substituting the value of \( a \):

\( -26 = (-14 - b) + 5b \)
\( -26 = -14 + 4b \)
\( -12 = 4b \)
\( b = -3 \)

Now substituting \( b \) back into the equation for \( a \):

\( a = -14 - b \)
\( a = -14 - (-3) \)
\( a = -14 + 3 \)
\( a = -11 \)

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we need to determine the constants a and b.

The term ax^0 is simply a constant term a, because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. The term bx^1 is equivalent to bx, as any number to the power of 1 is the number itself. So we are looking for a function:

y = a + bx

Let's write down the equations using the given inputs and corresponding outputs:

For Input 5 and Output -26:
-26 = a + b(5)

For Input 1 and Output -14:
-14 = a + b(1)

For Input -14 and Output 31:
31 = a + b(-14)

For Input -5 and Output 4:
4 = a + b(-5)

For Input -8 and Output 13:
13 = a + b(-8)

We now have five equations and two unknowns. This system is overdetermined, meaning there are more equations than unknowns. Since it's unlikely there is a perfect solution, we need to find the values of a and b that best satisfy all five equations, this is usually done by methods such as least squares.

However, without additional computational tools or methods, we cannot find an exact least squares solution through a straightforward text-based interface. So, we need to make an educated guess or manually calculate a close approximate solution based on the given data points. One way to start is by looking for patterns or by creating a scatter plot of the points and drawing a line that seems to best fit all the points.

Let's pick two points to create a simple linear equation (this will not be perfect but will give us a rough estimate):

Using the points (5, -26) and (1, -14), we can form two equations:
-26 = a + 5b
-14 = a + 1b

Now, if we subtract the second equation from the first, we eliminate a and can solve for b:
-26 - (-14) = (a - a) + (5b - b)
-12 = 4b
b = -3

Now that we have an estimate for b, we can substitute back to solve for a using one of the original equations:
-14 = a + 1(-3)
-14 = a - 3
a = -14 + 3
a = -11

As an educated guess based on the two equations derived from the points (5, -26) and (1, -14), our function would be:
y = -11 - 3x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The given form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is essentially a linear equation of the form y = b*x + a, since x^0 is 1 for any value of x except for x=0 (more broadly, the value 0^0 can be a point of contention, but for our purposes, non-zero x values are where we apply the equation). To find a and b, we can use two of the given input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations.

Let's choose the input-output pairs (5, -26) and (1, -14):

1. For the input 5 (x=5), the output is -26 (y=-26): -26 = 5b + a
2. For the input 1 (x=1), the output is -14 (y=-14): -14 = b + a

Now, we have the following system of equations:

5b + a = -26
b + a = -14

To solve for b, subtract the second equation from the first:

(5b + a) - (b + a) = -26 - (-14)
4b = -12
b = -3

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using the second equation:

-3 + a = -14
a = -14 + 3
a = -11

So the function that fits the given points is:

y = -11x^0 - 3x^1

Note that we only used two points to determine this function. However, since a linear function is uniquely determined by two points, if all the given points fall exactly on a line described by this function, then this function will capture the entire relationship between inputs and outputs as given. If any other point does not fit this line, this would indicate that the relationship is not linear. Let's check the other points to confirm:

For x = -14:
y = -11 - 3*(-14)
y = -11 + 42
y = 31 (fits the given output)

We have a series of (x, y) pairs that are provided: (5, -26), (1, -14), (-14, 31), (-5, 4), and (-8, 13).

Here, x^0 is always equal to 1, regardless of the value of x. Therefore, to find the correct values of a and b we need at least two different (x, y) pairs to set up a system of equations. Let's use the first two pairs:

For input 5 and output -26:
-26 = a + 5b  (1)

For input 1 and output -14:
-14 = a + 1b  (2)

Now let's solve these equations to find a and b:

From equation (2):
a = -14 - b  (3)

Now we insert the value of a from equation (3) into equation (1):

-26 = (-14 - b) + 5b
-26 = -14 + 4b

b = -3

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that best fit the provided input-output pairs. The given form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any \( x \) that is not equal to 0.

Given the input-output pairs:

1. \( x = -9,   y = 64 \)
2. \( x = -3,   y = 22 \)
3. \( x = 9,    y = -62 \)
4. \( x = -5,   y = 36 \)
5. \( x = -16,  y = 113 \)

Let's plug each pair into the equation \( y = a + bx \) to find \( a \) and \( b \).

For \( x = -9 \), \( y = 64 \):
\( 64 = a + b(-9) \)

For \( x = -3 \), \( y = 22 \):
\( 22 = a + b(-3) \)

For \( x = 9 \), \( y = -62 \):
\( -62 = a + b(9) \)

For \( x = -5 \), \( y = 36 \):
\( 36 = a + b(-5) \)

For \( x = -16 \), \( y = 113 \):
\( 113 = a + b(-16) \)

To solve for \( a \) and \( b \), we would typically use a system of equations. However, with the given points, it seems that there is no single linear function that can describe this data perfectly due to its non-linear nature. We would instead need to use a method such as least squares to find the best fitting linear approximation. Nonetheless, the task requires that we present the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), so we can attempt to approximate the values of \( a \) and \( b \).

To find an approximation without more advanced numerical methods, we can make a rough estimation by observing the given points. The average output for the negative inputs seems to be higher than for the positive input. Let's try to estimate \( b \) first by comparing the change in y over the change in x for a pair of points. We can use the first and the third point:

From \( x = -9 \) to \( x = 9 \), \( y \) changes from \( 64 \) to \( -62 \), which is a \( 64 - (-62) = 126 \) change in \( y \) and a \( 9 - (-9) = 18 \) change in \( x \), so approximately:

\( b \approx \frac{126}{18} \approx 7 \) (Please note this is a rough estimation).

We can approximate \( a \) by substituting the estimated \( b \) into one of the original equations:

\( y = a + bx \)  
\( y = a + 7x \)

Using \( x = -9, y = 64 \):

\( 64 = a + 7(-9) \)
\( 64 = a - 63 \)
\( a \approx 64 + 63 \)
\( a \approx 127 \) (Again, this is just an estimation).

Thus, our roughly estimated function would be:
\( y \approx 127 + 7x \)

But please be aware, this approximation does not accurately describe the relationship for all the given points because a linear function cannot perfectly fit the given non-linear data. To obtain a precise function, one would likely need to consider a polynomial or another non-linear model, and utilize methods like least squares regression for fitting the data.

    To find the function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we recognize that `ax^0` is equivalent to `a` (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), and `bx^1` is simply `bx`. Therefore, we need to find `a` and `b` such that `y = a + bx` fits the given data points.

Given the data points:

1. (-9, 64)
2. (-3, 22)
3. (9, -62)
4. (-5, 36)
5. (-16, 113)

The goal is to find constants `a` and `b` that will satisfy the equation `y = a + bx` for all those input-output pairs. To find `a` and `b`, we could set up a system of linear equations using two data points and solve it. However, since we have more than two points, we would actually need to use a best-fit line if the data is not perfectly linear. For simplicity and assuming the data is perfectly linear, let's just use the first two points to form two equations and solve for `a` and `b`.

Using points 1 and 2:

For point 1 (-9, 64):
64 = a + b(-9)

For point 2 (-3, 22):
22 = a + b(-3)

Let's solve this system of equations:

From equation (1): a = 64 - 9b
Substitute a into equation (2):
22 = (64 - 9b) + b(-3)
22 = 64 - 9b - 3b
22 = 64 - 12b
12b = 64 - 22
12b = 42
b = 3.5

Now, substitute the value of b into the equation for a:
a = 64 - 9(3.5)
a = 64 - 31.5
a = 32.5

Thus, the function would be y = 32.5 + 3.5x.

However, it is essential to note that this function will not perfectly fit all the given data points, as more than two points generally require a method of curve fitting like least squares to find the best fit if they do not lie precisely on a straight line, which is outside the scope of our simple approach. But for demonstration purposes and if we assume the given problem desires a simple linear model without specifying the need for fitting to all points, y = 32.5 + 3.5x may be the result.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a linear function that relates the input x to the output y (in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1), we are essentially looking for a function y = b * x + a (since a * x^0 is just a, as anything to the power of zero is one.)

We have a set of input-output pairs to work with:
1. x = -9, y = 64
2. x = -3, y = 22
3. x = 9, y = -62
4. x = -5, y = 36
5. x = -16, y = 113

We want to find a and b such that y = a + b * x fits these points as closely as possible.

To find a and b, we can use two points from the given data points to solve the system of linear equations. Let's use the first two points for convenience:

For x = -9, y = 64:
64 = a - 9b

For x = -3, y = 22:
22 = a - 3b

Now, we can solve these two equations using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination.

First, multuplying the second equation by 3 gives us equivalent systems:
64 = a - 9b          [Equation 1]
66 = 3a - 9b         [Equation 2 multiplied by 3]

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:
66 - 64 = 3a - a - 9b + 9b
2 = 2a
a = 1

Now that we have a, let's plug it into the second equation to solve for b:
22 = 1 - 3b
-3b = 22 - 1
-3b = 21
b = -7

Our function, therefore, is y = 1 - 7x.

Written in the exact form you specified, it would be:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = 1x^0 - 7x^1
y = 1 - 7x

Please note that while the function fits two of the provided points exactly, it may not perfectly fit the others since a linear function cannot perfectly model all given points if they are not collinear. Further analysis, such as least squares regression, would provide the best-fit line that minimizes the squared differences between the model's predictions and the actual data, but that goes beyond the simplicity of using two points to find a and b for a linear function.

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that matches the given inputs and outputs, we first acknowledge that ax^0 is just a because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

With this form, we can set up equations based on the provided input-output pairs:

For input -9 and output 64:

We have five equations and only two unknowns (a and b). Usually, with more equations than unknowns, you cannot find a solution that will fit all the data points exactly, unless they all are perfectly on a straight line, which in real-world data is unlikely. This scenario suggests that there will be no exact solution but rather an approximation.

However, these data points look like they might actually align. When you notice that the outputs seem to go up and down as the input changes from negative to positive or vice versa, this fluctuation can't be captured just by a straight line (linear equation) of the form y = a + bx. There's some asymmetry in the data that a linear function will not be able to capture accurately. Therefore, these data points don't seem to represent a linear relationship, and it might not be possible to find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that perfectly fits all given points.

An accurate model for these data points would likely necessitate a polynomial of higher degree or some other non-linear model. This departure from a linear model is evident in how drastically the output values increase, which suggests higher powers of x are involved or perhaps another variable is affecting the output in ways not captured by a simple linear model.

Therefore, if you're strictly looking for a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we would require more context (such as instructions to create a best-fit line) or the acceptance that the function will not fit all points exactly.

    ","To find a linear function of the form y = a + bx that fits the data points provided, we can try to solve the system of equations you've hinted at using two of the provided input-output pairs. However, as I mentioned earlier, a perfect fit is unlikely, but let's attempt it with two data points to find a provisional solution.

We can use the following two equations:
For input -9 and output 64:
64 = a - 9b

For input -3 and output 22:
22 = a - 3b

Now let's solve for `a` and `b`.

We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate `a`. This gives us:
64 - 22 = a - 9b - (a - 3b)
42 = -6b
b = -7

Now that we have `b`, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for `a`. Using the second equation:
22 = a - 3(-7)
22 = a + 21
a = 1

So the approximate linear function based on these two data points is:

    The function y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx, where a is the y-intercept (the output when x=0) and b is the slope of the line (how much y changes for a one-unit change in x).

Given the data points:

1. (-9, 64)
2. (-3, 22)
3. (9, -62)
4. (-5, 36)
5. (-16, 113)

We are looking for constants a and b that satisfy the equation y = a + bx for each of the given points.

This data does not align linearly. Thus, it is impossible to identify a single linear function that will pass through all these points exactly. However, we can approximate one using a method such as least squares regression. Given that this is not a perfect linear relationship and without the tools to calculate the approximation, finding an exact solution manually is not feasible.

Nonetheless, I can demonstrate how you would set up the equations for two points to illustrate how you might calculate a and b if the data were linear:

Let's take two points (-9, 64) and (-3, 22) and set up the equations for those:

For x = -9 and y = 64:
64 = a - 9b  ...... (1)

For x = -3 and y = 22:
22 = a - 3b  ...... (2)

If we were to solve these two equations for a and b, we would subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

64 - 22 = (-9b) - (-3b)
42 = -6b

b = -7

Using b = -7 in equation (2):
22 = a + 3(7)
22 = a + 21

a = 1

The function that fits these two points is therefore:
y = 1 - 7x

However, this function will not fit the other points given. Thus, with the points provided and the requirement to define the function in the form y = a + bx, an exact solution cannot be determined.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), let's understand what each term represents. Here, \( ax^0 \) is always a since \( x^0 \) is 1 for any x that isn't 0. So this part of the function is a constant value that represents the y-intercept when x is 0. The term \( bx^1 \) simplifies to bx, which is a linear term where b represents the slope of the line.

Given the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can rename it to be \( y = a + bx \). We need to find the constants a and b that fit the data provided.

Let's plot the inputs and outputs and find the slope (b) between each consecutive pair of points:

For input -20 and -15:
\( slope_1 = (output_{-15} - output_{-20}) / (-15 - (-20)) \)
\( slope_1 = (195 - 265) / (5) \)
\( slope_1 = -70 / 5 \)
\( slope_1 = -14 \)

For input -15 and -10:
\( slope_2 = (output_{-10} - output_{-15}) / (-10 - (-15)) \)
\( slope_2 = (125 - 195) / (5) \)
\( slope_2 = -70 / 5 \)
\( slope_2 = -14 \)

For input -10 and -5:
\( slope_3 = (output_{-5} - output_{-10}) / (-5 - (-10)) \)
\( slope_3 = (55 - 125) / (5) \)
\( slope_3 = -70 / 5 \)
\( slope_3 = -14 \)

For input -5 and 6 (we're skipping the zero since it's not included in the data but we're presuming linearity across all points):
\( slope_4 = (output_{6} - output_{-5}) / (6 - (-5)) \)
\( slope_4 = (-99 - 55) / (11) \)
\( slope_4 = -154 / 11 \)
\( slope_4 = -14 \)

All slopes are -14, so \( b = -14 \).

We can now use any one of the given points to solve for a. Let’s use the point (-20, 265):

\( 265 = a + (-14)*(-20) \)
\( 265 = a + 280 \)

For Input 6, Output -99: -99 = a + 6b

Now we solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. However, with more than two data points and only two variables, the system might be over-specified, which suggests there could be no single solution that fits all points perfectly. In this case, we need to find the values of a and b that best fit all the given points (for instance, using least squares regression), but given the nature of the question, we look for an exact solution, assuming one exists.

Let's take the last two equations:

For Input -5, Output 55: 55 = a - 5b
For Input 6, Output -99: -99 = a + 6b

If we add these two equations, we can eliminate the variable a:

(55 + -99) = (a - 5b) + (a + 6b)
-44 = 2a + b

Now let's pick another pair of equations:

For Input -20, Output 265: 265 = a - 20b
For Input -10, Output 125: 125 = a - 10b

Subtracting these two equations:

(265 - 125) = (a - 20b) - (a - 10b)
140 = -10b

We can see that b = -140 / 10 = -14.

With the value of b, we can now find a using the equation -44 = 2a + b:

-44 = 2a - 14
-44 + 14 = 2a

Thus, a = -30 / 2 = -15.

y = a + bx

where a and b are constants that we need to solve for. This is the equation of a line where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope.

We are given five data points:
(-20, 265), (-15, 195), (-5, 55), (-10, 125), and (6, -99)

Let's first arrange these points by input values in ascending order:
(-20, 265), (-15, 195), (-10, 125), (-5, 55), (6, -99)

We can attempt to visually assess the trend to estimate the slope (b):
From input -20 to -15 (a change of 5), the output increases by 195 - 265 = -70.
From input -15 to -10 (a change of 5), the output increases by 125 - 195 = -70.
From input -10 to -5 (a change of 5), the output increases by 55 - 125 = -70.
From input -5 to 6 (a change of 11), the output decreases by -99 - 55 = -154.

The changes between the first three points are consistent, suggesting a pattern. However, the change between the last two points doesn't fully align with this (it doesn't decrease by 11 * -14 = -154) which could mean there is either an inconsistency in the inputs/outputs or the relationship isn't a perfect linear one.

Ignoring the potential inconsistency, if we assume a linear relationship is present, the apparent slope from the first three points is -70 / 5 = -14.

Now, assuming that's our slope (b = -14), we can take one of the points to solve for a (y-intercept). Let's use the first point (-20, 265):

265 = a + (-14)*(-20)
265 = a + 280
a = 265 - 280
a = -15

Therefore, our assumed linear equation given the pattern noticed in the first three consistent points would be:

y = -15 - 14x

Let's check this equation with the other points:
For input -15:
y = -15 - 14*(-15) = -15 + 210 = 195, which is correct.

For input -10:
y = -15 - 14*(-10) = -15 + 140 = 125, which is correct.

For input -5:
y = -15 - 14*(-5) = -15 + 70 = 55, which is correct.

For input 6:
y = -15 - 14*6 = -15 - 84 = -99, which is not correct based on the above equation.

However, because we've determined there may be an inconsistency or non-linearity, we can't ensure that our equation holds for all points without more information or analysis. In practice, we would likely need to plot these points and perhaps use a regression analysis to find the best-fitting line if the relationship is indeed linear. In this case, the line of best fit provided by linear regression would differ slightly from the simple pattern observed.

Remember, for a perfect description of the data in real-world scenarios, inconsistencies must be accounted for, and more sophisticated methods (possibly non-linear) may be necessary to model the data accurately.

Given the data points:

1. When x = -20, y = 265
2. When x = -15, y = 195
3. When x = -5, y = 55
4. When x = -10, y = 125
5. When x = 6, y = -99

2. 195 = a - 15b
3. 55 = a - 5b
4. 125 = a - 10b

Now, let's use two of the data points to form a system of linear equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'. We can use points (1) and (3) as an example:

Equation 1: a - 20b = 265
Equation 2: a - 5b = 55

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate 'a' and solve for 'b':

265 = a + (-20b)

-99 = a + 6b

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns:

1)  a - 20b = 265
2)  a +  6b = -99

We can solve this system using various methods like substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

Add both equations together to eliminate a:

a - 20b + a + 6b = 265 - 99
2a - 14b = 166

Divide both sides by 2:

a - 7b = 83

Now we can use equation 2) to express a in terms of b and then substitute it into the new equation:

a = -99 - 6b

Substitute into a - 7b = 83:

-99 - 6b - 7b = 83

Solve for b:

b = -183/13
b = -14.0769231 (approximately)

Now substitute the value of b back into the equation a = -99 - 6b:

a = -99 - 6(-14.0769231)
a = -99 + 84.4615386
a = -14.5384614 (approximately)

Therefore, the function that best fits the data (in a least-squares sense) would be approximately as follows, but note that this is a rough estimation as we picked only two points to determine the function:

y = -14.54x^0 - 14.08x^1

y = -14.54 + 239.36
y = 224.82

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we recognize that ax^0 is just a because any non-zero number to the power of 0 equals 1. Thus, we can simplify this to y = a + bx.

1. For input -10: -54 = a + b(-10)
2. For input 4: 2 = a + b(4)
3. For input -20: -94 = a + b(-20)
4. For input 4 (repeated): 2 = a + b(4)
5. For input -4: -30 = a + b(-4)

Using inputs 2 and 5, we can set up a system of two equations to solve for a and b:

(2) 2 = a + 4b
(5) -30 = a - 4b

We can add these two equations to eliminate b and solve for a:

(2) + (5): 2 - 30 = (a + 4b) + (a - 4b)
-28 = 2a
a = -14

Now solve for b using equation (2), where we already know the value of a:

2 = -14 + 4b

b = 4

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we are essentially looking for a linear equation of the form \(y = a + bx\), because \(x^0 = 1\) for any \(x\) except for \(x = 0\), and \(x^1 = x\).

Given this format, we need to determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\).

From the given input-output pairs, we can create a system of linear equations. However, because the input-output pairs have some repeated inputs with consistent outputs, using those pairs that involve unique input values should be enough. We'll use the pairs (-10, -54), (4, 2), and (-20, -94) to create our equations.

For input -10 and output -54:

\[
a + b(-10) = -54
\]

For input 4 and output 2:

\[
a + b(4) = 2
\]

From these two equations, we have:

\[
a - 10b = -54...(1)
\]
\[
a + 4b = 2...(2)
\]

Now, we solve this system of linear equations, starting by subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):

\[
(a - 10b) - (a + 4b) = -54 - 2
\]
\[
a - 10b - a - 4b = -56
\]
\[
-14b = -56
\]
\[
b = 4
\]

Substitute the value of \(b\) back into equation (2):

\[
a + 4(4) = 2
\]
\[
a + 16 = 2

\[
a = 2 - 16
\]
\[
a = -14

So, the function that describes the data is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, we need to fit this linear function to the given data points. Note that \( x^0 = 1 \) for all \( x \neq 0 \), so the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \). We are looking for the best values of \( a \) and \( b \) that explain the provided inputs and outputs.

Given the points:

1. (-10, -54)
2. (4, 2)
3. (-20, -94)
4. (4, 2) (This point is the same as point 2 and reinforces the relationship)
5. (-4, -30)

Let's use two unique points (e.g., point 1 and point 2) to create a system of linear equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Using point 1 (-10, -54):
\[ -54 = a + b(-10) \]
\[ -54 = a - 10b \]

Using point 2 (4, 2):
\[ 2 = a + b(4) \]
\[ 2 = a + 4b \]

Now we have two equations:
\[ -54 = a - 10b \] (1)
\[ 2 = a + 4b \] (2)

We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) by using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate \( a \):

\[ -54 - 2 = a - 10b - (a + 4b) \]
\[ -56 = -14b \]
\[ b = 4 \]

Now that we have \( b \), we can substitute it back into either (1) or (2) to find \( a \). Let's use equation (2):

\[ 2 = a + 4b \]
\[ 2 = a + 4(4) \]
\[ 2 = a + 16 \]
\[ a = 2 - 16 \]
\[ a = -14 \]

So the function that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, based on our linear model, is:

    To find a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first recognize that \( ax^0 \) is simply \( a \), because \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any x that isn't zero. Therefore, the function we're looking for is actually a linear function of the form \( y = a + bx \).

Given the inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the first and third data points: (-10, -54) and (-20, -94).

1. For the first data point: \( -54 = a + b(-10) \)
2. For the third data point: \( -94 = a + b(-20) \)

Now let's solve the system of equations.

From equation 1:
\( -54 = a - 10b \)
\( a = -54 + 10b \) ... (3)

We can substitute \( a \) from equation (3) into equation 2:
\( -94 = (-54 + 10b) - 20b \)
\( -94 = -54 + 10b - 20b \)
\( -94 = -54 - 10b \)
\( -10b = -94 + 54 \)
\( -10b = -40 \)
\( b = 4 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can find \( a \) using equation (3):
\( a = -54 + 10b \)
\( a = -54 + 10(4) \)
\( a = -54 + 40 \)
\( a = -14 \)

Thus, the function is:

Checking this against all data points for consistency:

For x = -10:

\( y = -14 - 40 \)
\( y = -54 \)

    To find a function that describes the relationship given by the inputs and outputs, we’ll use the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Since ax^0 is always a (because anything raised to the zeroth power equals 1), the equation simplifies to:

y = a + bx

First, let's plug in the provided input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations:

1. For input -10, output -54:
-54 = a + b(-10)

2. For input 4, output 2:
2 = a + b(4)

3. For input -20, output -94:
-94 = a + b(-20)

4. For input 4 (again), output 2:
We have already included this input-output pair in equation 2.

5. For input -4, output -30:
-30 = a + b(-4)

Due to the fact that multiple unique inputs (x values) provided different outputs (y values), we should check the consistency of these equations. If we solve equation 2 for 'a', we'll get:

2 = a + 4b
a = 2 - 4b

Now, let's solve equation 1 using this expression for 'a':

-54 = (2 - 4b) - 10b
-54 = 2 - 14b
-56 = -14b
b = 4

Now we have b, we can find 'a':

a = 2 - 4(4)
a = 2 - 16
a = -14

Let's check the consistency with the third pair:

-94 = a + b(-20)
-94 = -14 + 4(-20)
-94 = -14 - 80
-94 = -94

The third equation is consistent with the values of 'a' and 'b' we have found. Checking with the fifth pair:

-30 = a + b(-4)
-30 = -14 + 4(-4)
-30 = -14 - 16
-30 = -30

The fifth equation is also consistent.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we first need to understand what ax^0 and bx^1 represent. In this expression, a and b are coefficients we need to determine, x is the input, x^0 is any number to the power of zero (which is 1), and x^1 is the input to the power of one (which is just x itself).

So the function simplifies to: y = a + bx

We have multiple pairs of inputs and outputs (x,y) from which we can derive our a and b coefficients:

1. For input x = -11, output y = -20.
2. For input x = -8, output y = -14.
3. For input x = -2, output y = -2.
4. For input x = -7, output y = -12.
5. For input x = -17, output y = -32.

We can use any two of these points to solve for a and b. Generally, the more points are used, the better since we can minimize error and find a line of best fit. However, since the question seems to imply there's an exact fit, let's use the first two points to derive a linear equation.

Using point 1 (x_1 = -11, y_1 = -20), we have:
-20 = a + b(-11) ... (equation 1)

Using point 2 (x_2 = -8, y_2 = -14), we have:
-14 = a + b(-8) ... (equation 2)

Now we'll solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate a:

-20 - (-14) = a + b(-11) - (a + b(-8))
-6 = -3b
b = 2  (equation 3)

Now that we know b, we can substitute it back into either equation 1 or 2 to solve for a. Using equation 1:
-20 = a + 2(-11)
-20 = a - 22
a = -20 + 22
a = 2  (equation 4)

Therefore, the function that seems to describe the relationship between inputs and outputs would be:

Please note that this function is generated based on the assumption that the relationship between input and output is linear and that all given points are perfectly on a straight line. If the data has any noise or is not perfectly linear, this function would not accurately represent all given points.

-2 = a + b*(-2)

1) -2 = a - 2b
2) -20 = a - 11b

We can solve for a and b by using either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:
Multiply the first equation by 11:

11*(-2) = 11a - 22b
-22 = 11a - 22b

Then, subtract the second equation from this new equation:

-22 - (-20) = (11a - a) - (22b - (-11b))
-2 = 10a + 11b

Now let's solve system:
-2 = a - 2b   (1)
-2 = 10a + 11b (2)

From equation (1):
a = -2 + 2b

Substitute a in equation (2):

-2 = -20 + 20b + 11b

Now, we can solve for a and b using these equations.

Equation 2: -2 = a - 2b -> -2 - a = -2b -> a = -2 + 2b ....(ii)

Equation 2 (from input -17 and output -32):

Let's consider the two symmetric pairs (17,302) and (-17,-310) to calculate \(b\). Plugging these into the function gives us two equations:

\[
302 = a + 17b
\]
\[
-310 = a - 17b
\]

By adding both equations, we eliminate \(b\) and can solve for \(a\):
\[
302 - 310 = a + 17b - (a - 17b)
\]
\[
-8 = 34b
\]
\[
b = -\frac{8}{34} = -\frac{4}{17}
\]

Now we can substitute \(b\) back into one of the equations to solve for \(a\):
\[
302 = a + 17\left(-\frac{4}{17}\right)
\]
\[
302 = a - 4
\]
\[
a = 302 + 4
\]
\[
a = 306
\]

So, the function in the requested form is:
\[
y = 306x^0 - \frac{4}{17}x^1
\]
\[
y = 306 - \frac{4}{17}x
\]

    ","To find the output using the function \(y = 306 - \frac{4}{17}x\), we plug in \(x = -10\):

\[
y = 306 - \frac{4}{17}(-10)
\]

\[
y = 306 + \frac{40}{17}
\]

\[
y = 306 + 2\frac{6}{17}
\]

\[
y = 308\frac{6}{17}
\]

Since we want to give the answer as a whole number, we can calculate the fractional part:

\[
\frac{6}{17} \approx 0.3529
\]

Multiplying the decimal by 17 gives us 6, which when added to 308 gives:

\[
308 + 6 = 314
\]

Now we present the output:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to notice that ax^0 is just a, since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. So, our function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We have a system of equations based on the input-output pairs provided:

1. a + b(-17) = -310
2. a + b(17) = 302
3. a + b(10) = 176
4. a + b(12) = 212
5. a + b(13) = 230

From the first two equations, we can notice that by adding them together, we cancel out the 'b' term:

(a - 17b) + (a + 17b) = -310 + 302
2a = -8
a = -4

Now we can use this 'a' value in any of the equations to find 'b'. Let's use the third one:

-4 + 10b = 176
10b = 180
b = 18

So, our function is:

y = -4 + 18x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, recognize that ax^0 is a constant term (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is simply bx, because anything raised to the power of 1 is itself. So we're looking for a function in the form:

y = a + bx

Given the pairs:

- For x = -17, y = -310
- For x = 17, y = 302
- For x = 10, y = 176
- For x = 12, y = 212
- For x = 13, y = 230

Observing the symmetry in the first two pairs where x is negated (17 and -17), we can infer that the constant term is likely to be 0, as it cancels out in this symmetrical case. The change in output is proportional only to the change in the input.

From the first two points, increasing x by 34 (-17 to 17) increases y by 612 (-310 to 302). We can divide the change in y by the change in x to find b:

b = 612 / 34
b = 18

So our function looks like y = a + 18x, but we still need to find a. Since we're confident that a = 0 (as supported by the symmetry argument), we don't actually have to compute it, but we can check this by substituting one of the input-output pairs into our equation:

Let's use x = 10, y = 176:

176 = a + 18(10)
176 = a + 180

Solving for a:

a = 176 - 180
a = -4

Since we expected a to be 0, and the symmetry argument should generally hold, let's check with a different pair to see if we might have made a mistake. Using x = 12, y = 212:

212 = a + 18(12)
212 = a + 216

Solving for a:

a = 212 - 216
a = -4

The constant term a seems to be -4 consistently, which contradicts our initial symmetry assumption. So, there might have been an error in that assumption. Nevertheless, we can now write the function with the values we found:

y = -4 + 18x

So, our function, fitting the data given, is:

y = -4 + 18x

    To determine the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to figure out the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the given input-output pairs.

Notice that \( ax^0 \) is just \( a \), since anything raised to the power of zero is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Let's use the given data to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Since we have 5 points, we can pick any two to find \( a \) and \( b \) (assuming the data fits a linear pattern, which we'll verify later).

Using the points (10, 176) and (12, 212):

For x = 10, y = 176:
\( 176 = a + b(10) \)
\( 176 = a + 10b \) ... [Equation 1]

For x = 12, y = 212:
\( 212 = a + b(12) \)
\( 212 = a + 12b \) ... [Equation 2]

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously:

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate \( a \):
\( 212 - 176 = (a + 12b) - (a + 10b) \)
\( 36 = 2b \)
\( b = 18 \)

Now use the value of \( b \) in Equation 1 to find \( a \):
\( 176 = a + 10b \)
\( 176 = a + 10(18) \)
\( 176 = a + 180 \)
\( a = 176 - 180 \)
\( a = -4 \)

So the function seems to be \( y = -4 + 18x \). 

However, we should check this against the other provided data points to verify the consistency:

For x = 17, y = 302 according to the function:
\( y = -4 + 18(17) \)
\( y = -4 + 306 \)
\( y = 302 \)
This matches the given output.

For x = -17, y = -310 according to the function:
\( y = -4 + 18(-17) \)
\( y = -4 - 306 \)
\( y = -310 \)
This matches the given output.

For x = 13, y = 230 according to the function:
\( y = -4 + 18(13) \)
\( y = -4 + 234 \)
\( y = 230 \)
This matches the given output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is essentially y = a + bx (because x^0 is 1), we need to determine the values of a and b that best fit the given input-output pairs.

Given the pairs (-17, -310) and (17, 302), it seems like when x increases by 34 (from -17 to 17), y increases by 612 (from -310 to 302). This can give us an initial estimate for b:

Change in y / Change in x = b
b = (302 - (-310)) / (17 - (-17))
b = 612 / 34
b = 18

Now using the pair (10, 176) to find a:

176 = a + 18(10)
176 = a + 180
a = 176 - 180
a = -4

Thus, our function in the desired form y = ax^0 + bx^1 becomes:

    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can assume that the function is in the form of a linear equation y = ax^0 + bx^1. This simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 = 1 for any x except 0.

We can use the first and the second points to calculate 'a' and 'b'. We have two equations:

1. 297 = a - 16b
2. -315 = a + 18b

Solving the two equations simultaneously:

Adding the two equations to eliminate 'a', we get:
297 - 315 = -16b + 18b
-18 = 2b
b = -9

Substitute 'b' back into either one of the original equations to get 'a':

297 = a - 16(-9)

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we will utilize the fact that ax^0 is simply a constant (since any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1) and bx^1 is just bx (since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself). This simplifies the equation to y = a + bx, which is a linear equation with slope b and y-intercept a.

We are given the following pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y):

(-16, 297)
(18, -315)
(-16, 297)  [duplicate of the first pair]
(-5, 99)
(5, -81)

We can first ignore the duplicate pair since it does not provide any new information.

Now, let's plot the first, second, fourth, and fifth points on a graph to visualize the relationship between x and y. If we can see a linear pattern, we can use two points to determine the values of a and b.

Using the first and second points to determine the slope:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-315 - 297) / (18 - (-16))
b = (-612) / (34)
b = -18

Now that we have the slope, let's solve for the y-intercept (a) using one of our points. We can use the first point (-16, 297):

297 = a + (-18)(-16)
297 = a + 288
a = 297 - 288
a = 9

So, our linear equation is y = 9 - 18x.

We should check this function against all the given points to ensure it fits:

For x = -16:
y = 9 - 18(-16)
y = 9 + 288
y = 297 (matches the given output)

y = 9 - 18(18)

    Given the provided input-output pairs, we need to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) in the linear equation \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \).

The equation can be simplified to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any x ≠ 0. Therefore, the function really is a linear equation where \( a \) is the y-intercept and \( b \) is the slope of the line.

Given multiple pairs of points, we need to find values for \( a \) and \( b \) that will satisfy all provided pairs. It's clear that the same input yields the same output, as we have two instances of the input -16 leading to the output 297. The linearity must therefore hold across all given points.

Let's consider two input-output pairs to determine \( a \) and \( b \):

1. \( x_1 = -16, y_1 = 297 \)
2. \( x_2 = 18, y_2 = -315 \)

From pair 1: \( 297 = a + b(-16) \)
From pair 2: \( -315 = a + b(18) \)

Now, we have two linear equations with two variables. This can be solved using methods such as substitution or elimination. For instance, let's use the elimination method:

\[ 297 = a - 16b \]
\[ -315 = a + 18b \]

Adding these two equations to eliminate \( a \):

\[ 297 - 315 = a - 16b + a + 18b \]
\[ -18 = 2a + 2b \]
\[ -9 = a + b \]

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first one:

\[ 297 + 315 = a - 16b - (a + 18b) \]
\[ 612 = -34b \]
\[ b = -612 / 34 \]
\[ b = -18 \]

Now that we have \( b \), substituting \( b \) back into \( -9 = a + b \) gives us \( a \):

\[ -9 = a - 18 \]

    To describe the relationship between the inputs and outputs using the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first recognize that \( ax^0 \) is always equal to \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is \( 1 \) for any value of \( x \), except when \( x = 0 \). So the term \( ax^0 \) is a constant term. The term \( bx^1 \) can be simplified to \( bx \) because \( x^1 \) is just \( x \).

We have been given a set of inputs and outputs:

For \( x = -16 \), \( y = 297 \)
For \( x = 18 \), \( y = -315 \)
For \( x = -16 \), \( y = 297 \) (repeated)
For \( x = -5 \), \( y = 99 \)
For \( x = 5 \), \( y = -81 \)

We can use any two distinct pairs of inputs and outputs to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the pairs (-16, 297) and (18, -315) to form two equations:

1. \( 297 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16) \)
2. \( -315 = a(18)^0 + b(18) \)

These equations simplify to:

1. \( 297 = a - 16b \)
2. \( -315 = a + 18b \)

Now we can solve this linear system for \( a \) and \( b \). We'll use the method of elimination or substitution. Let's multiply the first equation by 18 and the second equation by 16 to make the coefficients of \( a \) equal:

1. \( 18 \times 297 = 18a - 288b \)
2. \( 16 \times -315 = 16a + 288b \)

Adding these two resulting equations eliminates \( b \):

\( 18 \times 297 + 16 \times -315 = 18a - 288b + 16a + 288b \)

\( 5346 - 5040 = 34a \)

\( 306 = 34a \)

\( a = 306 / 34 \)

\( a = 9 \)

Now substitute the value of \( a \) into either of the original equations to solve for \( b \). Using the first equation:

\( 297 = 9 - 16b \)

\( 288 = -16b \)

\( b = -288 / 16 \)

\( b = -18 \)

(1) When x = -16, y = 297
(2) When x = 18, y = -315
(3) When x = -16, y = 297 (repeat of (1))
(4) When x = -5, y = 99

Let's use two unique data points to solve for a and b. We'll use points (1) and (2):

From (1): 297 = a + b(-16)
From (2): -315 = a + b(18)

Now, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

(1') 297 = a - 16b
(2') -315 = a + 18b

We can solve this system by for example adding equations (1') and (2') to eliminate a:

297 + (-315) = (a - 16b) + (a + 18b)
-18 = 2a + 2b
-9 = a + b

    The relationship between the inputs and outputs in a linear function (y = ax^0 + bx^1) suggests that we are looking for values 'a' and 'b' that fit the given points. This is essentially a line in the form y = b + ax, where ax^0 is 1 (regardless of the value of x), so a constant term 'b' in a typical linear equation equates to ax^0 in the expression you've provided.

To determine the coefficients 'a' and 'b', we can use any two points to create a system of equations. Let's use the points (-18, -265) and (19, 253) for this purpose:

1. For the input -18 and output -265: -265 = b + a(-18)
2. For the input 19 and output 253: 253 = b + a(19)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1. -265 = b - 18a
2. 253 = b + 19a

Adding these two equations gives us:
-265 + 253 = b - 18a + b + 19a
-12 = 2b + a

From this equation, we cannot solve for 'a' and 'b' directly, since there are multiple solutions. However, we can express 'a' in terms of 'b':
a = -12 - 2b

Now, we need another equation to solve for 'b'. We will use point (-15, -223):
-223 = b + a(-15)

Substitute 'a' with (-12 - 2b):
-223 = b - 15(-12 - 2b)
-223 = b + 180 + 30b
-223 - 180 = 31b
-403 = 31b

Now we solve for 'b':
b = -403 / 31
b ≈ -13

Substitute 'b' back into the equation derived from adding the two initial equations:
a = -12 - 2(-13)
a = -12 + 26
a = 14

Now we can write the function as:
y = -13x^0 + 14x^1

    Given the data points, we want to find the constants `a` and `b` in the linear function y = ax^0 + bx^1, which can also be written as y = a + bx. This is because x^0 is equal to 1 for any value of x (except x equal to 0), so ax^0 is just a constant term. Our function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We have a system of equations based on the data points given:

1. -265 = a - 18b (from input -18, output -265)
2.  253 = a + 19b (from input 19, output 253)
3. -223 = a - 15b (from input -15, output -223)
4.   71 = a +  6b (from input 6, output 71)
5.  225 = a + 17b (from input 17, output 225)

To solve for `a` and `b`, we can pick two equations from the list and solve them as a system of linear equations. Let's use equations 1 and 2 for this purpose.

-265 = a - 18b
253 = a + 19b

By adding these two equations, we can cancel out `a` and solve for `b`:

-265 + 253 = (a - 18b) + (a + 19b) => -12 = b

Now that we know `b`, we can plug it into one of the above equations to solve for `a`. Let's use equation 2:

253 = a + 19b
253 = a + 19(-12)
253 = a - 228
a = 253 + 228
a = 481

Now that we have both `a` and `b`, our function is:

y = (481)x^0 + (-12)x^1
y = 481 - 12x

This is the linear function that best describes the given data points.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to look at the relationship between the input (x) values and the output (y) values. The term ax^0 is a constant because any number raised to the 0th power is 1. Therefore, ax^0 is just a. The term bx^1 is the same as bx since anything raised to the 1st power is itself.

Let's convert the given input-output pairs into the (x, y) coordinate pairs to analyze them:
(-18, -265), (19, 253), (-15, -223), (6, 71), (17, 225).

Looking at these pairs, we can attempt to determine the values of a and b by solving a system of equations created from two of the pairs. Let's choose two pairs that seem easy to work with: (6, 71) and (-18, -265).

For (6, 71):
71 = a + 6b

For (-18, -265):
-265 = a - 18b

We now have a system of two equations:
1) 71 = a + 6b
2) -265 = a - 18b

Let's solve it using the method of substitution or elimination. We'll use elimination in this case.

If we add (2) to (1), we get:
71 - 265 = (a + 6b) + (a - 18b)
-194 = 2a - 12b
-97 = a - 6b

So we have:
3) -97 = a - 6b

Now, let's subtract equation (3) from equation (1):
71 = a + 6b
(-97) = a - 6b
-----------------
168 = 12b

b = 168 / 12
b = 14

Now let's substitute b back into equation (1):
71 = a + 6(14)
71 = a + 84

a = 71 - 84
a = -13

So our function looks like this:
y = -13x^0 + 14x^1
y = -13 + 14x

As a final step, it is a good idea to check this function with all given input-output pairs to ensure it fits:
For x = -18:
y = -13 + 14(-18) = -13 - 252 = -265 (matches the output)

For x = 19:
y = -13 + 14(19) = -13 + 266 = 253 (matches the output)

For x = -15:
y = -13 + 14(-15) = -13 -210 = -223 (matches the output)

For x = 6:
y = -13 + 14(6) = -13 + 84 = 71 (matches the output)

For x = 17:
y = -13 + 14(17) = -13 + 238 = 225 (matches the output)

    In order to find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to solve for the coefficients `a` and `b` such that:

y = a + bx

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can set up a series of equations to solve for 'a' and 'b':

1. When input x = -18, output y = -265:
-265 = a + b(-18)

2. When input x = 19, output y = 253:
253 = a + b(19)

3. When input x = -15, output y = -223:
-223 = a + b(-15)

4. When input x = 6, output y = 71:
71 = a + b(6)

5. When input x = 17, output y = 225:
225 = a + b(17)

Now, since we have five equations and only two unknowns, the system is over-determined. However, we can take any two equations and solve the system for `a` and `b`.

Let's take the second and fourth equations for simplicity:

253 = a + b(19)  [1]
71 = a + b(6)    [2]

Subtract [2] from [1] to eliminate 'a' and solve for 'b':

253 - 71 = a + b(19) - (a + b(6))
182 = b(13)
b = 182 / 13
b = 14

Now, place 'b' back into one of the equations to solve for 'a'. Let's use equation [2]:

71 = a + b(6)
71 = a + 14(6)
71 = a + 84
a = 71 - 84
a = -13

Now we have our function:

y = -13x^0 + 14x^1
Simplified, since any number to the power of 0 is 1:
y = -13 + 14x

However, with more than two data points, it's important to note that this function may not perfectly describe the relationship for all given points, as we have chosen only two to calculate the coefficients. A least squares solution could be used to find an approximate line of best fit. However, the relationship we've derived seems to fit all given points perfectly:

For the fifth pair:
225 = -13 + 14(17)
225 = -13 + 238
225 = 225 (which is true)

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we can consider this problem as a simple linear regression, where y is a function of x and can be expressed in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx. Here, 'a' is the y-intercept and 'b' is the slope of the line.

Given the input-output pairs:

(-18, -265), 
(19, 253), 
(-15, -223), 
(6, 71), 
(17, 225)

We can use any two of these points to calculate the slope 'b':

\( b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \)

Let's use the points (-18, -265) and (19, 253) for better accuracy (as they are the furthest apart):

\( b = \frac{253 - (-265)}{19 - (-18)} = \frac{253 + 265}{19 + 18} = \frac{518}{37} = 14 \)

Now we've got our slope 'b' which is 14. Next, we can calculate 'a'. We can plug in the values of one of the known points into the equation y = a + bx. Let's use the point (6, 71):

71 = a + 14*6

Now we can solve for 'a':

a = 71 - 14*6
a = 71 - 84
a = -13

    To determine the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the data, note that ax^0 is essentially a constant term (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, ax^0 can be replaced with a constant c. The function simplifies to y = c + bx, where c and b are constants to be determined.

Given our data points:
- (0, -15)
- (-5, -35)
- (-4, -31)
- (5, 5)
- (-12, -63)

We will use two points to determine the constants c and b. Let's use the points (0, -15) and (5, 5).

From the point (0, -15) we immediately find that c = -15, since when x = 0, y must equal c.

For the point (5, 5):
5 = c + b * 5

    To find the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are essentially looking for a linear equation of the form \( y = a + bx \), because \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any x except for x=0 (undefined), and \( x^1 \) is just x. So the coefficients a and b must satisfy each of the input-output pairs given.

Let's consider the inputs and outputs as points on the graph of our function: (0, -15), (-5, -35), (-4, -31), (5, 5), and (-12, -63).

Given that \( y = a + bx \), we can substitute the input-output pairs into the equation:
1. For the input 0: \( -15 = a + b(0) \) ⇒ \( -15 = a \)
2. For the input -5: \( -35 = a + b(-5) \)
3. For the input -4: \( -31 = a + b(-4) \)
4. For the input 5: \( 5 = a + b(5) \)
5. For the input -12: \( -63 = a + b(-12) \)

Since we have already determined from the first input that a = -15, we can substitute that into any of the other equations to solve for b. Let's use the equation with the input 5 for simplicity:

\( 5 = (-15) + b(5) \)
\( 5 + 15 = 5b \)
\( 20 = 5b \)
\( b = 4 \)

Now that we have the values for a and b, we can write down the function:

\( y = -15 + 4x \)

So the function that seems to capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to identify the constants \(a\) and \(b\) that fit the data point pairs (Input, Output) provided.

The term \(ax^0\) is equivalent to \(a\), since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to \(y = a + bx\).

The term \( ax^0 \) is equivalent to \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any \( x \) that is not 0. So the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We have several input-output pairs to work with:

1. When \( x = 0 \), \( y = -15 \). Therefore, \( a + b(0) = -15 \) which simplifies to \( a = -15 \).

2. When \( x = -5 \), \( y = -35 \). Substituting \( a = -15 \) gives us \( -15 + b(-5) = -35 \).
   This simplifies to \( -15 - 5b = -35 \) or \( 5b = 15 - 35 \), so \( b = (15 - 35) / 5 = -20 / 5 = -4 \).

Now with \( a = -15 \) and \( b = -4 \), let's try it with another point to make sure our values of \( a \) and \( b \) are consistent:

Using \( x = -4 \), \( y = -31 \):
\( -15 - 4(-4) = -15 + 16 = 1 \), which does not match the expected output of \( -31 \). This suggests there might be a mistake in our calculation.

Let's check our calculations again with the pair \( x = -5 \), \( y = -35 \):

\( a = -15 \)
\( -15 - 4(-5) = -15 + 20 = 5 \), which also does not match the expected output of \( -35 \). It seems I've made a mistake in my earlier calculation.

Let's re-evaluate using another point as well:

Using \( x = 5 \), \( y = 5 \) with \( a = -15 \), gives us:
\( -15 + b(5) = 5 \), which simplifies to \( 5b = 5 + 15 \) or \( b = 20 / 5 = 4 \).

Now we have \( a = -15 \) and \( b = 4 \). This matches better with what we expect. Finally, let's check this with all given inputs to ensure it fits:

We need to find a consistent \( a \) and \( b \) that can be applied to all these points. If we try to find a pattern in the inputs and outputs, we can start by finding the difference in the output over the difference in the input (which gives us an approximation of \( b \)):

Between points 1 and 2:
\( \frac{283 - 133}{19 - 9} = \frac{150}{10} = 15 \)

If we check the other points and find that \( b = 15 \) is consistent, we can use this value.

For point 3:
\( \frac{238 - 133}{16 - 9} = \frac{105}{7} = 15 \)

For points 4 and 5 to the first point:
\( \frac{-212 - 133}{-14 - 9} = \frac{-345}{-23} = 15 \)
\( \frac{-242 - 133}{-16 - 9} = \frac{-375}{-25} = 15 \)

The value of \( b \) is consistently \( 15 \). Now we need to find \( a \). 
We can use any of the points for this. Let's use the first point (9, 133):

\( 133 = a + 15 \cdot 9 \)
\( 133 = a + 135 \)
\( a = 133 - 135 \)
\( a = -2 \)

Hence the function that describes the data is:

\( y = -2 + 15x \)

Or, in the requested format:

\( y = -2x^0 + 15x^1 \)

    To find the coefficients a and b such that the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 describes the given input-output pairs, let's first recognize that ax^0 is equivalent to a because x^0 is 1 for any non-zero x.

So, our simplified function is y = a + bx, where we need to find the values of a and b.

We can set up a system of equations with different pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for a and b. Let's take two pairs to create two equations:

For input 9 and output 133:
133 = a + b*9

For input 19 and output 283:
283 = a + b*19

Now we have two linear equations with two unknowns:

1. 133 = a + 9b
2. 283 = a + 19b

Let's solve for a and b.

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a:

(283 - 133) = (a + 19b) - (a + 9b)
150 = 10b
b = 15

Now that we have b, we can plug it back into one of our equations to solve for a. We'll use equation 1:

133 = a + 9*15
133 = a + 135
a = 133 - 135
a = -2

Now we have the coefficients, so our function is:

y = -2x^0 + 15x^1

Simplifying further, since x^0 is always 1, the function is:

y = -2 + 15x

It can be seen that this function fits with the rest of the provided input-output pairs:

If x = 16:
y = -2 + 15*16
y = -2 + 240
y = 238

If x = -14:
y = -2 + 15*(-14)
y = -2 - 210
y = -212

If x = -16:
y = -2 + 15*(-16)
y = -2 - 240
y = -242

Thus, the function describing this data is:

y = -2 + 15x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to identify the coefficients a and b. The term ax^0 is a constant since anything raised to the power of zero is one. The term bx^1 is simply bx since any number raised to the power of one is the number itself. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have several pairs of input (x) and output (y) values which we can use to determine the constants a and b:

1. y = a + bx when x = 9,   y = 133
2. y = a + bx when x = 19,  y = 283
3. y = a + bx when x = 16,  y = 238
4. y = a + bx when x = -14, y = -212
5. y = a + bx when x = -16, y = -242

Let's take two of these pairs of values to set up two equations in the two unknowns, a and b. Using the first and the last sets of values for simplicity:

For x = 9,   y = 133 => 133 = a + 9b  (1)
For x = -16, y = -242 => -242 = a - 16b (2)

Now we will solve these two equations simultaneously to find a and b:

From (1), we can express a in terms of b:
a = 133 - 9b  (3)

Replace a in (2) with the expression from (3):
-242 = (133 - 9b) - 16b
-242 = 133 - 9b - 16b
-242 = 133 - 25b
-25b = -242 - 133
-25b = -375
b = -375 / -25
b = 15

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into equation (3) to find a:

a = 133 - 9b
a = 133 - 9(15)
a = 133 - 135
a = -2

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = a + bx
y = -2 + 15x

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data points, we first need to understand what ax^0 and bx^1 represent. Here, ax^0 is a constant term (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is a linear term (since x raised to the power of 1 is just x).

The general linear function we are looking for will therefore take the form:
\[ y = a + bx \]

Given the data points:
- (2, 59)
- (-16, -301)
- (-5, -81)
- (3, 79)
- (-2, -21)

We can plug two of the data points into the function to solve for a and b. However, since we have more than two points, we cannot guarantee a single solution that will be perfect for all points unless they all lie perfectly on a line, which for real-world data is unlikely. Instead, we can aim to find the values of a and b that provide the best fit for all the data points — this is generally done using methods like least squares regression.

Since I am a pattern recognition system designed for exact solutions rather than estimations, I will demonstrate how you could solve for a and b using two points and then check against the rest.

Let's use the points (2, 59) and (-16, -301):

For (2, 59):
\[ 59 = a + 2b \]

For (-16, -301):
\[ -301 = a - 16b \]

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1. \( 59 = a + 2b \)
2. \( -301 = a - 16b \)

We can solve this system using elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

Multiply equation 1 by 8 to align the coefficients of b:
1. \( 472 = 8a + 16b \)

Then add the modified equation 1 to equation 2:
\( (472) + (-301) = (8a + a) + (16b - 16b) \)
\[ 171 = 9a \]

Divide both sides by 9 to solve for a:
\[ a = 19 \]

Now we substitute the value of a into either equation 1 or 2 to find b. Let's use equation 1:
\[ 59 = 19 + 2b \]
\[ 40 = 2b \]
\[ b = 20 \]

So the function that fits the two chosen points is:
\[ y = 19 + 20x \]

However, this solution is based only on two points. To check if it fits the other points, let's evaluate it at x = -5:

For x = -5:
\[ y = 19 + 20(-5) \]
\[ y = 19 - 100 \]
\[ y = -81 \]

It fits the third point exactly.

Now let's test it with the fourth point (x = 3):
\[ y = 19 + 20(3) \]
\[ y = 19 + 60 \]
\[ y = 79 \]

This also fits perfectly.

Finally, let's test it with the last point (x = -2):
\[ y = 19 + 20(-2) \]
\[ y = 19 - 40 \]
\[ y = -21 \]

Remarkably, the solution fits all of the provided data points exactly.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs for all the given data points is:
\[ y = 19 + 20x \]

    To find the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to determine the values of `a` and `b` that will accurately predict the output for any given input according to the data points provided.

Given that `x^0` is always 1 for any x (except for x=0, which we do not have to consider in this dataset), we can simplify the function to `y = a + bx`, with `a` representing the constant term and `b` representing the coefficient of `x`.

We can use two of the provided data points to set up a system of linear equations to solve for `a` and `b`. Let's use the following two points: (2, 59) and (-16, -301).

For the point (2, 59):
`59 = a + b(2)`,
which simplifies to:
`59 = a + 2b`. (Equation 1)

For the point (-16, -301):
`-301 = a + b(-16)`,
which simplifies to:
`-301 = a - 16b`. (Equation 2)

Now, let's solve this system of equations. First, let's multiply Equation 1 by 8 to prepare for elimination with Equation 2:

`8(59) = 8a + 16b`,
`472 = 8a + 16b`. (Equation 3)

Let's add Equation 3 and Equation 2 to eliminate `b`:

`472 + (-301) = (8a + a) + (16b - 16b)`,
`171 = 9a`.

Now, solve for `a`:

`a = 171 / 9`,
`a = 19`.

Now that we have `a`, let's substitute it back into Equation 1 to find `b`:

`59 = 19 + 2b`,
`40 = 2b`,
`b = 20`.

So our function is `y = 19 + 20x`. This should predict the output for a given input based on the pattern found in the data. We can verify this function by testing it with the provided points:

For input 2:
`y = 19 + 20(2) = 19 + 40 = 59` (matches the output)

For input -16:
`y = 19 + 20(-16) = 19 - 320 = -301` (matches the output)

For input -5:
`y = 19 + 20(-5) = 19 - 100 = -81` (matches the output)

For input 3:
`y = 19 + 20(3) = 19 + 60 = 79` (matches the output)

For input -2:
`y = 19 + 20(-2) = 19 - 40 = -21` (matches the output)

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To define a linear function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to find the coefficients `a` and `b`.

Given that this is a linear equation, we know that:

y = a * x^0 + b * x^1
y = a * 1 + b * x (since x^0 = 1)
y = a + bx

We have a series of (x, y) points: (2, 59), (-16, -301), (-5, -81), (3, 79), (-2, -21), which can be used to derive the values of `a` and `b`. A linear relationship between x and y would mean that for each unit increase in x, y increases by a constant amount b (the slope of the line).

Given that we have multiple points, we can either try to solve a system of equations or use a method like least squares regression to find a line that best fits the data.

However, without the tools for regression and just based on the data provided, a direct exact solution is not easily derivable. Nevertheless, to demonstrate how we might solve this with two points:

We will use two points from above: (2, 59) and (-2, -21).
Let's denote these points as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), respectively.

From the equation y = a + bx, we can setup two equations:

59 = a + b(2)
-21 = a - b(2)

Now, let's solve these equations for a and b.

Add these two equations:

59 + (-21) = a + 2b + a - 2b
38 = 2a
a = 19

Now we need to find b. Substitute a into any of the equations:

59 = 19 + 2b
40 = 2b
b = 20

Therefore, our function that describes the data is:

y = 19 + 20x

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\) because \(x^0 = 1\) for any \(x\) that is not zero, we need to determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the function fits the provided data points as closely as possible.

Given the data points:
1. \(x = 2\), \(y = 59\)
2. \(x = -16\), \(y = -301\)

4. \(x = 3\), \(y = 79\)
5. \(x = -2\), \(y = -21\)

One method to find \(a\) and \(b\) is to pick two of the data points and set up a system of linear equations to solve for these values.

Let's use points (1) and (5) for our equations:

For \(x = 2\), \(y = 59\): \(a + 2b = 59\) - Equation (1)
For \(x = -2\), \(y = -21\): \(a - 2b = -21\) - Equation (2)

Now we'll solve this system of equations. Adding Equation (1) and Equation (2), we get:
\(a + 2b + a - 2b = 59 - 21\)
\(2a = 38\)
\(a = 19\)

Now, let's solve for \(b\) using Equation (1):
\(19 + 2b = 59\)
\(2b = 40\)
\(b = 20\)

Thus, using \(a = 19\) and \(b = 20\). The function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\) would be:
\(y = 19 + 20x\)

However, we need to check the remaining points to ensure that this function fits all given data points.

\(x = -16\): \(y = 19 + 20(-16)\) should be -301

    To find the best function to describe this data in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to understand that the ax^0 term is a constant because any number raised to the power of zero is 1. Therefore, the function we are looking for is in the form of:

y = a + bx

We are given pairs of inputs and outputs, which we can use to create a system of equations to solve for the values of a and b. Let's substitute the given points into the function:

1. Substituting x = 2, y = 59:
59 = a + 2b

2. Substituting x = -16, y = -301:
-301 = a - 16b

3. Substituting x = -5, y = -81:
-81 = a - 5b

4. Substituting x = 3, y = 79:
79 = a + 3b

5. Substituting x = -2, y = -21:
-21 = a - 2b

We have 5 equations, but we only need two to solve for a and b since it's a linear relationship. Let's take the simplest pair of equations to solve for a and b:

From (1):
59 = a + 2b ---(i)
From (5):
-21 = a - 2b ---(ii)

Now, let's add (i) and (ii) to eliminate b and solve for a:

59 + (-21) = (a + 2b) + (a - 2b)
38 = 2a
a = 19

Next, we'll plug the value of a back into (i) to find b:

Now we have determined that a = 19 and b = 20. Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we should recognize that \( ax^0 \) is simply a constant \( a \) (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and \( bx^1 \) is a standard linear term \( bx \). So the function we're looking for will be of the form \( y = a + bx \).

Given this, we can attempt to discern the pattern by looking at the change in the output relative to the change in the input.

Between the pair of input 13 and output 55, and input 15 and output 61, we have:

- Change in input (Δx): \( 15 - 13 = 2 \)
- Change in output (Δy): \( 61 - 55 = 6 \)

With this change, we can calculate the slope \( b \) of the linear term:

\[ b = \frac{Δy}{Δx} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Now we assume that the function has a slope of 3: \( y = a + 3x \)

Next, we can use one of the input-output pairs to solve for \( a \). Let's use the pair (13, 55):

\[ 55 = a + 3(13) \]
\[ 55 = a + 39 \]
\[ a = 55 - 39 \]
\[ a = 16 \]

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data, we'll first recognize that ax^0 is a constant because any number raised to the 0 is 1. So ax^0 simplifies to a. Therefore, the function can be re-written in the more familiar linear form:

y = a + bx

Now, we need to determine the values of a and b that make this function fit the given data points as closely as possible. This is best solved through systems of equations, but with more than two points, it would typically be done using least squares regression. However, with just a couple of data points, we can try to determine a linear relation directly.

Let's plug in the pairs (x, y) from the data into the equation:

For x = 13, y = 55:
55 = a + 13b

For x = -20, y = -44:
-44 = a - 20b

For x = 15, y = 61:
61 = a + 15b

For x = -1, y = 13:
13 = a - b

For x = -14, y = -26:
-26 = a - 14b

Now, let's choose two of these equations to solve for a and b. We should pick the equations that would make the system easiest to solve. For instance, the pairs (13, 55) and (-1, 13) or (-20, -44) and (-14, -26) contain one positive and one negative x, which could simplify arithmetic.

Let's use the pairs (-1, 13) and (13, 55):

1. 13 = a - b
2. 55 = a + 13b

We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations together to eliminate b:

13 + 55 = a - b + a + 13b
68 = 2a + 12b

Divide through by 2:

34 = a + 6b

Now, using equation 1, we express a in terms of b:

a = 13 + b

Plug this a into the equation 34 = a + 6b:

34 = (13 + b) + 6b
34 = 13 + 7b
34 - 13 = 7b
21 = 7b
b = 3

Next, we'll plug b back into either equation for a; let's use a = 13 + b:

a = 13 + 3
a = 16

Therefore, the function that describes the data in the linear form y = a + bx is:

y = 16 + 3x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Looking at the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we recognize that ax^0 is simply a since any number raised to the zero power is 1. So the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We need to find the values of a and b that best fit the given input and output pairs.

The pairs given are:

(13, 55)
(-20, -44)
(15, 61)
(-1, 13)
(-14, -26)

Let's use two of the data pairs to create a system of linear equations to solve for a and b.

Using the input-output pairs (13, 55) and (-20, -44):

For input 13 and output 55:
55 = a + 13b ... (1)

For input -20 and output -44:
-44 = a - 20b ... (2)

Let's multiply equation (1) by 20 and equation (2) by 13 to eliminate 'a' when we add the two equations together:

20 * (55) = 20a + 260b ... (1') => 1100 = 20a + 260b
13 * (-44) = 13a - 260b ... (2') => -572 = 13a - 260b

Adding (1') and (2'):

1100 + (-572) = (20a + 13a) + (260b - 260b)
528 = 33a
a = 528 / 33
a = 16

Now we can substitute the value of a into equation (1) to find b:

55 = 16 + 13b
39 = 13b
b = 39 / 13
b = 3

So the function that describes the relationship between the input x and the output y is:

    To define the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, both a and b are constants that we have to solve for. The term ax^0 equates to a since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, the form simplifies to y = a + bx.

Looking at the pairs of inputs and outputs, we want to find a and b such that:

1. For input 13: a + b(13) = 55
2. For input -20: a + b(-20) = -44
3. For input 15: a + b(15) = 61
4. For input -1: a + b(-1) = 13
5. For input -14: a + b(-14) = -26

Now let's use two of these pairs to form a system of equations and solve for a and b. Let's use inputs 13 and -20 for convenience:

a + 13b = 55      ...(1)
a - 20b = -44     ...(2)

Now we'll subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:

(1) - (2): (a + 13b) - (a - 20b) = 55 - (-44)
a + 13b - a + 20b = 55 + 44
33b = 99
b = 99 / 33
b = 3

Now that we have b, let's substitute it back into equation (1) to find a:

a + 13(3) = 55
a + 39 = 55
a = 55 - 39
a = 16

The mathematical relationship between the input x and the output y for the given data points is thus:

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b that satisfy the given input-output pairs.

Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify it to:
y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 for any x except for x = 0.

We now have a linear equation, and we need to find the values of a and b that will satisfy the pairs (x, y), such as (13, 55), (-20, -44), (15, 61), (-1, 13), and (-14, -26).

Let's take two pairs of points to solve for a and b. We can use:
1) (13, 55)
2) (-20, -44)

From the first pair (13, 55):
55 = a + 13b

From the second pair (-20, -44):
-44 = a - 20b

We now have a system of two linear equations:
1) 55 = a + 13b
2) -44 = a - 20b

Let's solve this system using the method of elimination or substitution.

Multiply equation 2) by -1 to help eliminate a:
44 = -a + 20b

Now add this equation to equation 1):
55 + 44 = a + 13b - a + 20b
99 = 33b
b = 99/33
b = 3

Now we'll substitute b back into equation 1) to solve for a:

a = 55 - 39

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we recognize that ax^0 is a constant term since any number (other than zero) to the power of zero is one. So ax^0 = a. Then bx^1 is just bx, because any number to the power of one is itself. Thus, we are trying to fit the function y = a + bx to the data provided.

Our goal is to determine the constants a and b that fit the given inputs and outputs. This typically involves solving a system of equations, but because we are given more than two points and we are trying to fit a linear function to them, we'll instead use two of the points to determine the coefficients a and b, and then we will check if the same coefficients apply to the other points.

We can use any two points to find the coefficients. Let's use the points (-11, 72) and (18, -160).

So we have two equations:

1) 72 = a - 11b
2) -160 = a + 18b

Now let's solve this system of linear equations:

From equation 1:
a = 72 + 11b
Substitute the expression for a from equation 1 into equation 2:
-160 = (72 + 11b) + 18b
-160 = 72 + 29b
-160 - 72 = 29b
-232 = 29b
b = -232 / 29
b = -8

Now that we have b, we can find a:

a = 72 + 11b
a = 72 + 11(-8)
a = 72 - 88
a = -16

Substituting a and b back into the function form we get:

y = -16 + (-8)x
Or simplified:
y = -16 - 8x

So, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs for the two chosen points is y = -16 - 8x.

However, we need to verify if this function applies to the other given points:

For input -3:
y = -16 - 8(-3) = -16 + 24 = 8, which is correct.

For input -2:
y = -16 - 8(-2) = -16 + 16 = 0, which is correct.

For input -7:
y = -16 - 8(-7) = -16 + 56 = 40, which is correct.

Given that the function we derived holds true for all the other points, we can be reasonably sure that the function describing the data is y = -16 - 8x.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to identify the appropriate coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the provided input-output pairs. Here, \( ax^0 \) is simply \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is always 1, while \( bx^1 \) is \( bx \).

Given the input-output pairs, let's denote \( y \) as the output and \( x \) as the input:

When\( x = -11 \), \( y = 72 \)  
When \( x = -3 \), \( y = 8 \)  
When \( x = -2 \), \( y = 0 \)  
When \( x = 18 \), \( y = -160 \)  
When \( x = -7 \), \( y = 40 \)  

We can use two of these points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Since we know that when \( x = -2 \), \( y = 0 \), this gives us a very straightforward equation to solve for \( b \):

\( 0 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1 \)  
\( 0 = a + (-2b) \)  
\( 2b = a \) (Equation 1)

Now we should use another point to create a second equation. The point where \( x = -3 \), and \( y = 8 \) provides a simple equation:

\( 8 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1 \)  
\( 8 = a - 3b \) (Equation 2)

From Equation 1, we have \( a = 2b \). Substituting this into Equation 2, we get:

\( 8 = (2b) - 3b \)  
\( 8 = -b \)  
\( b = -8 \)

Using this value of \( b \), we can solve for \( a \) from Equation 1:

\( a = 2(-8) \)  
\( a = -16 \)  

Therefore, the function that fits the given points is:

\( y = -16x^0 - 8x^1 \)  
\( y = -16 - 8x \)

    To find the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) for the given function form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\) since any number (except zero) to the power of zero is one, we need to set up a system of equations using the provided input-output pairs.

Given the points (-11, 72), (-3, 8), (-2, 0), (18, -160), and (-7, 40), we form the following equations:

1. \(72 = a + b(-11)\)
2. \(8 = a + b(-3)\)
3. \(0 = a + b(-2)\)
4. \(-160 = a + b(18)\)
5. \(40 = a + b(-7)\)

We can use any two of these equations to solve for \(a\) and \(b\). We'll use equations 4. and 3. as they seem to provide clear coefficients.

Equation 3. states:
\(0 = a - 2b\)

Equation 4. states:
\(-160 = a + 18b\)

Now, we can solve for \(a\) from equation 3. and substitute it into equation 4.:

From equation 3. we get:
\(a = 2b\)

Substitute \(a\) in equation 4.:
\(-160 = 2b + 18b\)
\(-160 = 20b\)

Now solve for \(b\):
\(b = -160 / 20\)
\(b = -8\)

Using the value of \(b\), we can find \(a\):
\(a = 2(-8)\)
\(a = -16\)

Thus, the function that represents the data provided is:

\[y = a + bx\]
\[y = -16 - 8x\]

However, it's important to test these values against one or more of the other given points to ensure that they are correct.

\(40 = -16 - 8(-7)\)

    To find a linear function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the data, we recognize that this is the equation of a line in the form y = b + ax, since x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0, and x^1 is just x.

We are given a set of input-output pairs: (-11, 72), (-3, 8), (-2, 0), (18, -160), (-7, 40). To find the exact values for a and b, we need to solve the equations derived from these pairs. However, since we have more than two points, it's most likely that there is no exact linear function that fits all these points perfectly because they do not all line up perfectly. But we can still find a and b that provide the closest linear approximation to these points, using methods like least squares regression.

Given that this process is a bit complex and as a AI, I don't have the capability to crunch numbers, I will not be able to provide an exact solution without computational tools, but I can show you the method on how to do it with these two points (-2, 0) and (18, -160) which seem to potentially provide the most straightforward solution:

For input -2 and output 0:
0 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)
0 = a + (-2b)

For input 18 and output -160:
-160 = a(18)^0 + b(18)
-160 = a + 18b

We have a system of linear equations that we can solve for a and b:
1. a - 2b = 0
2. a + 18b = -160

By subtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we get:
(18b + a) - (-2b + a) = -160 - 0, which simplifies to:
18b - (-2b) = -160
20b = -160

Solving for b:
b = -160 / 20
b = -8

Now we can solve for a using b = -8:
a - 2(-8) = 0
a + 16 = 0
a = -16

Thus, the linear function that fits the points (-2, 0) and (18, -160) is:
y = -16x^0 - 8x^1
y = -16 - 8x

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data points, we can write this function as y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0. This is the equation of a line where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope.

We are given five data points:

1. (-11, 72)
2. (-3, 8)
3. (-2, 0)
4. (18, -160)
5. (-7, 40)

Because we only need two points to determine a line, we can choose any two points to calculate the line's slope b:

Let's take points (3) and (4) to calculate the slope:

(-2, 0) and (18, -160) 

To calculate b (the slope of the line):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-160 - 0) / (18 - (-2))
b = (-160) / (20)
b = -8

Now that we have our slope b = -8, we can use one of the points to solve for a. Let's use point (3): (-2, 0)

0 = a -8(-2)
0 = a + 16
a = -16

Therefore, the equation of the line is:

y = -16 + (-8)x

or,

y = -16 - 8x

However, this is a pattern recognition problem with limited data points. The above line equation will perfectly fit the points (-2, 0) and (18, -160), but it may not fit the other given points. This means that there might be no perfect linear relationship (in the form y = a + bx) that fits all the data points exactly. The true relationship could be more complex, or there could be some error in the data points provided.

For a perfect linear fit, we would need the same slope (b) calculated for any two given data pairs, and the same intercept (a) when calculated from any point using the same slope.

    To find a linear function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1` that fits the given inputs and outputs, we first need to recognize that `ax^0` equals `a` because any number raised to the power of zero is 1. So the function simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

Now we need to find the values of `a` and `b` that will satisfy the function for the given inputs and outputs. This means we need to solve the system of equations generated by substituting the given input-output pairs:

1) a + 11b = -204
2) a - 4b = 66
3) a - 17b = 300
4) a - 15b = 264
5) a + 20b = -366

To solve this, we can pick any two equations from the set and solve for `a` and `b`.

Let's use equations 1 and 2:
a + 11b = -204
a - 4b = 66

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives:
11b - (-4b) = -204 - 66
15b = -270
b = -270 / 15
b = -18

However, since we have more equations than unknowns (five equations and only two unknowns), this system is likely overdetermined. This usually means that there might not be a perfect solution where all equations are satisfied exactly unless the data points lie perfectly on a straight line.

In this case, we can use methods of linear regression to find the ""best fit"" line, which won't necessarily pass through all the points but minimizes the errors in some sense, like least squares. However, this is beyond the simple algebraic manipulation I can perform as a rule-based language model.

With the given data points, it's evident that they do not lie on a straight line, so no single function of the form y = a + bx will exactly fit all the given data. We would need to apply numerical methods to find an approximate solution for a and b, which requires computational tools that are not available to me.

However, if you would still like me to process the input `-3` based on the example outputs provided above and assuming that the pattern follows a linear trend (which it does not, as explained), you can interpolate or extrapolate from the existing values by estimation.

Keep in mind this is a rough estimation and not the result of an actual calculation:

For example, from the given points `(11, -204)` and `(-4, 66)`, we can estimate the change in `y` per unit change in `x` (i.e., the slope `b`) approximately:

Slope (b) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (66 - (-204)) / (-4 - 11) = 270 / -15 = -18.

The estimated function is then `y = a - 18x`. To find `a`, we can plug any of the known points into this equation. Using `(-4, 66)`:

66 = a - 18(-4)
66 = a + 72
a = 66 - 72
a = -6.

So our very rough estimated function is `y = -6 - 18x`.

But please note this is an approximation based on only two of the five points, and the true relationship is not linear, meaning this estimation will not be accurate for other data points.

Applying this estimated function to the input `-3`, we would get:

Output: y = -6 - 18(-3)
Output: y = -6 + 54
Output: y = 48

But remember, this is just an estimation and not the actual output from a proper calculation.

1. (11, -204)
2. (-4, 66)
3. (-17, 300)
4. (-15, 264)
5. (20, -366)

We can form a system of linear equations using these points and our function form y = c + bx to solve for the coefficients b and c.

Using two points to form two equations (you could alternatively do a least squares regression for a more precise answer if the data is not perfectly linear):

1. -204 = c + b(11)
2. 66 = c + b(-4)

Let's solve these two equations to find b and c.

Equation 1: -204 = c + 11b
Equation 2: 66 = c - 4b

Now, let's multiply Equation 2 by 11 to eliminate c:

Equation 2 * 11: 726 = 11c - 44b

Next, add this to Equation 1:

-204 = c + 11b
+
726 = 11c - 44b
-----------------
522 = 12c - 33b

Now let's subtract Equation 1 from the result to eliminate b:

522 = 12c - 33b
-
(-204) = c + 11b
-----------------
726 = 11c - 22b

Then, simplify to solve for c:

726 = 11c - 22(66 - c)
726 = 11c - 1452 + 22c
1178 = 33c
c = 1178 / 33
c = 35.69696969...

Now plug value of c into one of the original equations to solve for b:

66 = 35.69696969... - 4b
-4b = 66 - 35.69696969...
-4b = 30.30303030...
b = -30.30303030... / -4
b = 7.57575757...

Thus, the function that fits the data in the form y = cx^0 + bx^1 or y = c + bx with the coefficients rounded to two decimal places is:

y = 35.70 + 7.58x

Please note, however, that since there are five points and we only used two, this might not fit all points perfectly unless the data is exactly linear. In real-world cases like this, you'd typically use more sophisticated methods, such as least squares regression, to find the best fit for all points. But this provides a simple example of how you could find a linear equation given two points.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we first recognize that ax^0 is a constant term (because any non-zero number raised to the zero power is 1), and bx^1 is simply bx since any number raised to the first power is itself. 

Thus, the function we are looking for is y = a + bx, and we need to find the constants a and b.

Given the data:

For x = 11, y = -204
For x = -4, y = 66
For x = -17, y = 300
For x = -15, y = 264
For x = 20, y = -366

We can set up a system of linear equations using two pairs of data points to solve for the variables a and b. Let's pick (11, -204) and (-4, 66):

Using the pair (11, -204):
-204 = a + 11b

Using the pair (-4, 66):
66 = a - 4b

We can simplify to solve these equations. First, let's multiply the second equation by -1 to make calculations a bit simpler:

-66 = -a + 4b

Now adding this equation to the first one:

-204 + (-66) = a + 11b + (-a + 4b)
-270 = 15b

Now we can solve for b:

b = -270 / 15
b = -18

Now let's plug b back into one of our original equations to solve for a. Using the equation 66 = a - 4b:

66 = a - 4(-18)
66 = a + 72
a = 66 - 72
a = -6

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -6 + (-18)x

y = -6 - 18x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the provided data points, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b. The term ax^0 is equivalent to a, since any number (including x) raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We have a system of equations based on the data points given:

1. For the input x = 11, the output y = -204: -204 = a + 11b
2. For the input x = -4, the output y = 66:       66 = a - 4b
3. For the input x = -17, the output y = 300:     300 = a - 17b
4. For the input x = -15, the output y = 264:     264 = a - 15b
5. For the input x = 20, the output y = -366:    -366 = a + 20b

To solve for a and b, we can use any two of the above equations to set up a system of linear equations. Let's use equations (1) and (2):

-204 = a + 11b
66 = a - 4b

Adding these two equations to eliminate a, we get:

-204 + 66 = a + 11b + a - 4b
-138 = 2a + 7b

Now let's solve for a in terms of b:

-138 = 2a + 7b
a = (-138 - 7b) / 2

Now we substitute this expression for a into one of the original equations to find the value of b. We can use equation (1):

-204 = (-138 - 7b) / 2 + 11b
-408 = -138 - 7b + 22b
-408 + 138 = 15b
-270 = 15b
b = -270 / 15
b = -18

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into the expression for a:

a = (-138 - 7(-18)) / 2
a = (-138 + 126) / 2
a = -12 / 2
a = -6

    Given the data set and the required format for the function, we are looking for a linear equation of the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1.

This simplifies to:

y = a + bx.

We have the following pairs of inputs and outputs (x, y):

(-12, 9)
(20, -55)
(-4, -7)
(-10, 5)
(8, -31)

To find the appropriate values for a and b, we could use various methods like plotting the points and finding the line of best fit or using linear regression techniques. Since I am a text-based AI, I can't plot directly, but we can determine that there is a linear relationship that gives us a straight line when plotted and compute the coefficients using any of the points along with the system of equations method.

To determine the values of a and b, let's use two points to create two equations. We'll select points (-12, 9) and (20, -55) to solve the system:

9 = a + (-12)b,
-55 = a + 20b.

Now we solve for `a` and `b`:

Multiply the first equation by 20 and the second equation by 12 to eliminate `a`:

(1) 180 = 20a - 240b,
(2) -660 = 12a + 240b.

Add equation (1) and (2) to solve for a:

180 - 660 = 20a - 240b + 12a + 240b,
-480 = 32a,
a = -480 / 32,
a = -15.

Now, using the value of a, we'll substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for b. We'll use the first equation:

9 = (-15) + (-12)b,
24 = -12b,
b = -2.

Plugging the values for a and b back into the equation y = a + bx gives us:

y = -15 - 2x.

So in the required format, the function is:

Output: y = -15x^0 - 2x^1.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can recognize that \( ax^0 \) is simply \( a \) since \( x^0 = 1 \), and \( bx^1 \) is just \( bx \) since \( x^1 = x \). So, the function will simplify to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

We have a system of equations based on the provided input-output pairs:

1. When \( x = -12 \), \( y = 9\)
\[ 9 = a - 12b \]

2. When \( x = 20 \), \( y = -55 \)
\[ -55 = a + 20b \]

3. When \( x = -4 \), \( y = -7 \)
\[ -7 = a - 4b \]

4. When \( x = -10 \), \( y = 5 \)
\[ 5 = a - 10b \]

5. When \( x = 8 \), \( y = -31 \)
\[ -31 = a + 8b \]

We can solve this system using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. However, in this case, it's clear that there isn't a unique solution since we have five equations with only two variables, which is an overdetermined system. This system can either have no solution or an infinite number of solutions if some of the equations are a multiple of the others (which they are not in this case).

We can, however, choose two of these equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \) to find the best-fitting line that matches at least two of the points exactly. The other points will not lie exactly on this line if they do not all already lie on the same line (which is typical with real-world data).

Let's choose the first and last equations to solve the system:

1.  \( 9 = a - 12b \)
5. \( -31 = a + 8b \)

We can use the elimination method to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Add the two equations together to eliminate \( a \):

\[ 9 - 31 = a - 12b + a + 8b \]
\[ -22 = 2a - 4b \]
\[ -11 = a - 2b \]

Now, let's solve for \( a \) from equation 1 and substitute it into the new equation:

\[ a = 9 + 12b \]

Substitute \( a \) into the equation \( -11 = a - 2b \):

\[ -11 = (9 + 12b) - 2b \]
\[ -11 = 9 + 10b \]
\[ -20 = 10b \]
\[ b = -2 \]

Now, substitute \( b \) back into the equation for \( a \):

\[ a = 9 + 12(-2) \]
\[ a = 9 - 24 \]
\[ a = -15 \]

So, the function that fits at least two of the given points is:

\[ y = -15 + (-2)x \]
\[ y = -15 - 2x \]

Once again, it's important to emphasize that with the given data points, a single line may not perfectly fit all points. A line of best fit would require using a method like least squares, which would minimize the vertical distances squared from the data points to the line, resulting in a line that best fits all the data points in an average sense.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can use the given points to setup a system of linear equations based on the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx (since x^0 is 1). We can then solve for the coefficients a and b.

The function form is:
y = a + bx

For each given point (x, y), we'll have:
1) For x = -12: 9 = a - 12b
2) For x = 20: -55 = a + 20b
3) For x = -4: -7 = a - 4b
4) For x = -10: 5 = a - 10b
5) For x = 8: -31 = a + 8b

Let's choose two of these equations and form a system to solve for a and b. We can use equations 1) and 2), for instance.

From 1) 9 = a - 12b
From 2) -55 = a + 20b

We can solve for a in the first equation:
a = 9 + 12b

Substitute a in the second equation:
-55 = (9 + 12b) + 20b
-55 = 9 + 32b
-64 = 32b
b = -64 / 32
b = -2

Now, we can find a by substituting b back into one of the equations:
a = 9 + 12(-2)
a = 9 - 24
a = -15

Therefore, our function is:
y = -15 + (-2)x

    The function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is equivalent to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for any x different from zero.

There are infinitely many ways to determine a and b, but commonly, we would pick two of these and solve the system of linear equations. Let's use the second and the fifth equations to illustrate a solution:

-55 = a + 20b
-31 = a + 8b

Now, rearrange the equations to isolate 'a':

a = -55 - 20b
a = -31 - 8b

Set them equal to each other since they are both equal to 'a':

-55 - 20b = -31 - 8b

Now solve for 'b':

-55 + 55 - 31 = 12b - 20b
-24 = -8b
b = -24 / -8
b = 3

Now we’ll use the value of 'b' to solve for 'a' by substituting 'b' back into either equation:

-55 = a + 20b
-55 = a + 20(3)
-55 = a + 60
a = -55 - 60
a = -115

    The task is to find coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) such that the function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\) matches the given input-output pairs. Note that \(x^0 = 1\) for any \(x\), so the function simplifies to \(y = a + bx\).

2. (20, -55)

2. \(a + 20b = -55\)
3. \(a - 4b = -7\)
4. \(a - 10b = 5\)
5. \(a + 8b = -31\)

To find \(a\) and \(b\), we have to solve this system. However, it's clear that we have an overdetermined system (more equations than unknowns), which usually does not have a unique solution unless the data points lie perfectly on a line, which is improbable here.

Nevertheless, instead of solving this system directly, we'll take two equations and solve for \(a\) and \(b\):

Using pairs (1) and (2):

\(a - 12b = 9\)
\(a + 20b = -55\)

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

\(32b = -64\)
\(b = -64 / 32\)

The data suggests a linear equation of the form \( y = a + bx \), so we need two equations with two variables to solve for a and b. We can use any two points to set up our system of equations. Let's use points (1) and (3):

1. \( 82 = a - 16b \)
2. \( -98 = a + 14b \)

Let's solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. We'll go with elimination in this case:

\( 82 = a - 16b \).......(i)

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given input-output pairs, we can treat this as a simple linear regression problem where y = b + ax, since ax^0 is always 1 and does not depend on x.

Now, we are looking for the constants a and b that fit our data best. We can use two data points to solve the system of linear equations for a and b.

Let's use the following two points: (-16, 82) and (14, -98)

We can set up two equations based on the general form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = b + ax:

For input -16 and output 82: 
82 = b + a(-16) ... (1)

For input 14 and output -98: 
-98 = b + a(14) ... (2)

Now, solve the system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 4/5 and adding it to the first to eliminate b:

(4/5)(-98) = (4/5)b + (4/5)(14)a
-78.4 = (4/5)b + 11.2a
82 = b - 16a

Adding these two equations:
82 - 78.4 = (b - (4/5)b) + (-16a + 11.2a)
3.6 = (1/5)b - 4.8a

Multiply the entire equation by 5:
18 = b - 24a ... (3)

We can now solve the system given by equations (1) and (3):

From equation (3):
b = 24a + 18 ... (4)

Plug the expression from equation (4) into equation (1):
82 = (24a + 18) - 16a
82 = 8a + 18
8a = 82 - 18
8a = 64

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the inputs and outputs, we need to determine the coefficients ""a"" and ""b"" for the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. This function can also be simplified as y = a + bx, since x^0 is equal to 1.

Let's substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve for ""a"" and ""b"":

1) For Input -16, Output 82:
82 = a + b(-16)

2) For Input -11, Output 52:
52 = a + b(-11)

3) For Input 14, Output -98:
-98 = a + b(14)

4) For Input -18, Output 94:
94 = a + b(-18)

5) For Input 3, Output -32:
-32 = a + b(3)

Now we have a system of equations. We can solve this system using methods such as substitution or elimination. However, with just two parameters a and b, it's more efficient to take any two equations and solve them simultaneously for a and b. Let's choose the first and the last equations:

From equation 1): 82 = a - 16b
From equation 5): -32 = a + 3b

Now, we can solve for ""a"" and ""b"" by subtracting equation 5) from equation 1):

82 - (-32) = a - 16b - (a + 3b)
82 + 32 = a - a - 16b - 3b
114 = -19b
b = -114/19
b = -6

Having ""b"", we can find ""a"" by substituting ""b"" back into any equation, let's use equation 5):

-32 = a + 3(-6)
-32 = a - 18
a = -32 + 18
a = -14

So the coefficients for the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1 are a = -14 and b = -6.

Therefore, the relationship between the inputs and outputs is described by the function:

y = -14 + (-6)x
or simplified,
y = -14 - 6x.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the given inputs and outputs, we need to recognize the relationship between the input (x) and output (y). In the given function form, ax^0 is simply a, as x^0 is always 1 for any non-zero value of x, and bx^1 is bx, as x^1 is just x.

Thus, the function we are trying to fit is actually:

y = a + bx

The function can be considered a linear function of x with a y-intercept of a and a slope of b. Given the data points provided:

(-16, 82),
(-11, 52),
(14, -98),
(-18, 94),
(3, -32),

We can solve for a and b using any two distinct points since a line is uniquely determined by two points. Let's use the points (-16, 82) and (14, -98) to illustrate this.

For the first point (-16, 82):

82 = a + b(-16) -> 82 = a - 16b ...(1)

For the second point (14, -98):

-98 = a + b(14) -> -98 = a + 14b ...(2)

Now we can solve this system of equations to get values for a and b. Multiply the first equation by 14 and the second equation by 16 to eliminate a when we add the two equations:

14(82) = 14a - 16*14b
16(-98) = 16a + 16*14b

1148 = 14a - 224b
-1568 = 16a + 224b
--------------------
-420 = 30a

Dividing both sides by 30:

-420 / 30 = a

a = -14

Now, we plug the value of a back into one of the original equations to solve for b. We use equation (1) for this purpose:

82 = -14 - 16b
82 + 14 = -16b
96 = -16b

Dividing both sides by -16:

b = -6

Thus, the function that relates the input to the output in this case is:

y = -14 - 6x

This function will exactly fit the points (-16, 82) and (14, -98). Using the other points to check the function consistency would be a good practice. However, assuming only two points were needed for this linear relationship, this is the resulting function.

    To determine the coefficients a and b for a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use the given input-output pairs as a system of linear equations. Given that x^0 = 1 for any x (except for x = 0, which is undefined in this context), this simplifies to y = a + bx. We need to find values for a and b that will fit all the provided data points.

Based on the given points (-16, 82), (-11, 52), (14, -98), (-18, 94), and (3, -32), let's set up the equations:

1) For input -16, output 82:
82 = a - 16b

2) For input -11, output 52:
52 = a - 11b

3) For input 14, output -98:
-98 = a + 14b

4) For input -18, output 94:
94 = a - 18b

5) For input 3, output -32:
-32 = a + 3b

We can solve this system of equations using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Unfortunately, in this case, we are likely to find that no single pair of (a,b) values will exactly satisfy all five equations, as they are likely overdetermined (more equations than variables).

However, to find the closest approximate solution, let's perform a method called ""least squares,"" which minimizes the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the equation. This is typically done using more complex mathematics involving matrices or numerical software.

Since we aren't given a computational tool here, we can still try to observe the pattern in a more qualitative way. Looking at the points given, you can notice that when the input is negative, the output seems to be positive and relatively high, and when the input is positive, the output is negative and lower.

Considering this, let's use the first two points to set up a system of equations, and at least approximately satisfy those, as an example:

82 = a - 16b
52 = a - 11b

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:

30 = -5b
Therefore, b = -6

Now, placing b = -6 into one of our original equations to find a:

82 = a - 16(-6)
82 = a + 96
Therefore, a = 82 - 96
a = -14

This is not a precise solution for all the points, but it would provide a reasonable estimate based on the first two points. So the function would be:

y = -14 + (-6)x

Remember, this function is not a perfect fit for all the points, but an estimation based on a subset of the data we were provided.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the inputs and outputs, we want to find the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) such that the output can be written in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\).

Rewriting the function with \(x^0 = 1\) and \(x^1 = x\), the equation becomes:
\[ y = a + bx \]

Substituting the given input-output pairs into this function, we have the following system of equations:

1. For input (-18) and output (-75):
\[ -75 = a + b(-18) \]

2. For input (-1) and output (-7):
\[ -7 = a + b(-1) \]

3. For input (3) and output (9):
\[ 9 = a + 3b \]

4. For input (-18) and output (-75) (repeated):
\[ -75 = a + b(-18) \]

5. For input (2) and output (5):
\[ 5 = a + 2b \]

The 1st and 4th equations are identical, which means they give us the same information. Ignoring one of them, we are left with three equations to solve for two unknowns \(a\) and \(b\).

Let's use the 2nd and 5th equations to solve for \(a\) and \(b\):

2nd equation:
\[ -7 = a - b \]

5th equation:
\[ 5 = a + 2b \]

Adding the equations in an attempt to eliminate \(b\), we get:
\[ (-7) + 5 = a - b + a + 2b \]
\[ -2 = 2a + b \]

Let \(2a = -2 - b\). Now we can substitute \(2a\) in terms of \(b\) into the 2nd equation:
\[ -7 = (-2 - b) / 2 - b \]
\[ -7 = -1 - b/2 - b \]
\[ -6 = b/2 \]
\[ b = -12 \]

Now we have \(b\), we can go back to 2nd or 5th equation to solve for \(a\). Using the 2nd equation:
\[ -7 = a - (-12) \]
\[ -7 = a + 12 \]
\[ a = -19 \]

Putting these values into the original function form, we have:
\[ y = -19x^0 - 12x^1 \]
\[ y = -19 + -12x \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we shall consider ax^0 as a constant term (since any number to the power of zero equals one) and bx^1 as the linear relationship between x and y. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Let's plug in the given input-output pairs into the equation and see if we can deduce the constants a and b that fit all the data points.

For the input-output pair (-18, -75), the equation becomes:

-75 = a - 18b     (1)

For the input-output pair (-1, -7), the equation becomes:

-7 = a - 1b      (2)

For the input-output pair (3, 9), the equation becomes:

9 = a + 3b       (3)

For the input-output pair (2, 5), the equation becomes:

5 = a + 2b       (4)

Now we have four equations, but it would be redundant to use all since one data point (-18, -75) is repeated. We will use equations (2), (3), and (4) for simplicity.

From equation (2) we get:

a = -7 + b      (5)

Substitute equation (5) into equations (3) and (4):

9 = (-7 + b) + 3b
5 = (-7 + b) + 2b

Simplify those equations:

9 = -7 + 4b
5 = -7 + 3b

Now, solve for b:

9 + 7 = 4b
16 = 4b
b = 4

5 + 7 = 3b
12 = 3b
b = 4

Now we have b, we can solve for a using equation (5):

a = -7 + b
a = -7 + 4
a = -3

So the constants that best fit the provided data points are a = -3 and b = 4, hence the function is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function of the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\) that fits the given data points, we first notice that the term \(ax^0\) is equivalent to \(a\) since any number (except 0) raised to the power of 0 is 1. The term \(bx^1\) is equivalent to \(bx\). Therefore, the function we're looking for is essentially a linear function of the form \(y = a + bx\).

Given the data points:

1. When \(x = -18\), \(y = -75\)
2. When \(x = -1\), \(y = -7\)
3. When \(x = 3\), \(y = 9\)
4. When \(x = -18\) again, \(y = -75\) (it is the same point as the first one and doesn't provide extra information)
5. When \(x = 2\), \(y = 5\)

From these points, we can set up two equations based on the form \(y = a + bx\), by choosing two pairs of points that will allow us to solve for \(a\) and \(b\). Let's pick point 2 (where \(x = -1\) and \(y = -7\)) and point 3 (where \(x = 3\) and \(y = 9\)):

From point 2:
\[
-7 = a - b  \quad \text{(1)}
\]

From point 3:
\[
9 = a + 3b  \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Solving these two equations simultaneously for \(a\) and \(b\), we can multiply equation (1) by 3 to eliminate \(a\) when added to equation (2):

\[
-21 = 3a - 3b  \quad \text{(multiplied equation (1) by 3)}
\]

Adding the multiplied equation (1) by 3 to equation (2):

\[
-21 + 9 = 3a - 3b + a + 3b
\]

\[
-12 = 4a
\]

Therefore, \(a = -3\).

Now substitute \(a = -3\) back into equation (1) to find \(b\):

\[
-7 = -3 - b

\[
b = 4

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 where a and b are constants, we need to determine the values of a and b that will satisfy the given input-output pairs. Given that x^0 is always 1 for any x that isn't 0, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

For the input -18 and output -75:

You have provided the output for the input -18 twice, so we only need to consider one of them. Also, we should choose two different input-output pairs in order to solve for a and b. Let's use (2) and (3) because their input values are closer together, which might simplify the calculations.

-7 = a - b
9 = a + 3b

Adding these two equations to eliminate a, we get:

-7 + 9 = a - b + a + 3b
2 = 2a + 2b
1 = a + b       (5)

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (3), we get:

Plugging the value of b back into equation (5) gives us:

Since x^0 is always 1, we can simplify the function to:

By substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation, we can try to solve for ""a"" and ""b"". We can use any two distinct pairs to create a system of equations:

Using the pair (x=-1, y=-7):

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which can also be written as \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any \( x \) except for \( x = 0 \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that will fit the given inputs and outputs.

Given the inputs and outputs, we can list them like this:

For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 74 \)
For \( x = 19 \), \( y = 191 \)
For \( x = -11 \), \( y = -79 \)
For \( x = -5 \), \( y = -25 \)
For \( x = -10 \), \( y = -70 \)

Let's first check if \( b \) is consistent across these data points by finding the slope between each pair of points (change in output divided by change in input). If the data points are linear, we would expect this value to be the same for all pairs:

Using the first two data points for \( x = 6 \) and \( x = 19 \):

\( b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{191 - 74}{19 - 6} = \frac{117}{13} = 9 \)

Checking if this holds true for other points:

From \( x = -5 \) to \( x = 19 \):

\( b = \frac{191 - (-25)}{19 - (-5)} = \frac{216}{24} = 9 \)

And from \( x = -10 \) to \( x = 6 \):

\( b = \frac{74 - (-70)}{6 - (-10)} = \frac{144}{16} = 9 \)

It seems so far that \( b = 9 \) fits all these changes, indicating a linear relationship.

Now let's find \( a \). If we take the first data point \( x = 6 \), \( y = 74 \):

\( 74 = a + 9(6) \)

\( 74 = a + 54 \)

\( a = 74 - 54 \)

\( a = 20 \)

Using the input-output pair (6, 74):
74 = a + b(6)...(1)

We need to solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b that describe all the given pairs.

a = 74 - 6b

Now we substitute the expression for a into equation (2):
191 = (74 - 6b) + 19b
191 = 74 + 13b
191 - 74 = 13b

Let's pick two points to create a set of linear equations to solve for a and b. It's generally best to choose two points that are likely to give a precise calculation for the slope (b). Here, we can use (6, 74) and (-10, -70).

For the first point (6, 74):
74 = a + b(6)

For the second point (-10, -70):
-70 = a + b(-10)

Now we have two equations:
1) 74 = 6b + a
2) -70 = -10b + a

By subtracting the second equation from the first, we eliminate a and solve for b:
74 - (-70) = 6b - (-10b)
144 = 16b
b = 144 / 16
b = 9

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into one of the equations to solve for a:
74 = a + 6(9)
74 = a + 54
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:
Output: y = 20x^0 + 9x^1

Simplified, the function is:
Output: y = 20 + 9x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The data points provided suggest a linear relationship between the input x and the output y. The linear function is in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1.

We have several pairs of data (x, y):

(6, 74)
(19, 191)
(-11, -79)
(-5, -25)
(-10, -70)

To find the coefficients a and b for the linear function, we can use two pairs of points to set up a system of equations and solve for a and b.

Let's take the first two points (6, 74) and (19, 191) and substitute them into the equation y = a + bx to get two equations:

74 = a + 6b  (1)
191 = a + 19b (2)

Now let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to solve for b:

191 - 74 = (a + 19b) - (a + 6b)
117 = 13b
b = 117 / 13
b = 9

Now, let's solve for a using equation (1):

74 = a + 6b
74 = a + 6(9)
74 = a + 54
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

The linear function that fits the data is:

y = 20 + 9x

Which in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = 20x^0 + 9x^1

However, it's essential to note that while this function fits the two points we used to calculate it, we need to check if the same function works for the other provided points to make sure it describes the entire data set accurately.

Let's check this function against one of the other data points, such as (-11, -79):

y = 20x^0 + 9x^1
y = 20(-11)^0 + 9(-11)
y = 20 + (-99)
y = -79

The function y = 20 + 9x works for this third point as well. Let's now check it with all the remaining points to verify it describes the entire set:

(-5, -25):
y = 20 + 9(-5)
y = 20 - 45
y = -25

(-10, -70):
y = 20 + 9(-10)
y = 20 - 90
y = -70

The checks confirm that the function y = 20 + 9x correctly describes the relationship for all given data points.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants 'a' and 'b' such that our function captures the relationship between the input x and the output y. 

We are given several pairs of inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. When x = 6, y = 74
2. When x = 19, y = 191
3. When x = -11, y = -79
4. When x = -5, y = -25
5. When x = -10, y = -70

We notice that the term ax^0 is simply 'a' because any number to the zero power is 1. Therefore, the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx.

By inspecting the given input-output pairs, it looks like the output is ten times the input minus some constant value. For an input of 6, the output is 74, which is 60 (10 times 6) plus 14. For an input of 19, the output is 191, which is 190 (10 times 19) plus 1. This pattern suggests that 'b' is 10.

To find 'a', we can substitute one of the given pairs into the equation and solve for 'a':

Let's use the pair (x = 6, y = 74):

74 = a + 10*6
74 = a + 60
a = 74 - 60
a = 14

With 'b' as 10 and 'a' as 14, we have our function:

y = 14 + 10x

However, to ensure this function is correct, we should check it against the other input-output pairs provided:

For x = 19:
y = 14 + 10*19
y = 14 + 190
y = 204 (which does not match our given output of 191)

Upon closer inspection and trying to use our deduced values for 'a' and 'b', we can see that the function does not hold for other points. Therefore, our first attempt was incorrect. Let's retry.

Looking again at the given points, it appears that the input is multiplied by 10 and then adjusted by an increasing or decreasing number which does not seem to be constant. A closer inspection reveals that the input is multiplied by 10 and then adjusted by the input itself:

1. When x = 6: y = 10 * 6 + 6 - 2 = 60 + 6 - 2 = 64 (not 74 as given)
2. When x = 19: y = 10 * 19 + 19 - 2 = 190 + 19 - 2 = 207 (not 191 as given)

This pattern similarly does not seem consistent. So to correctly deduce 'b', we should look at the relationship between the output and ten times the input (as the coefficient of x^1 will indeed be multiplied by 10):

1. When x = 6: 74 - 10*6 = 14
2. When x = 19: 191 - 10*19 = 1
3. When x = -11: -79 - 10*(-11) = -79 + 110 = 31
4. When x = -5: -25 - 10*(-5) = -25 + 50 = 25
5. When x = -10: -70 - 10*(-10) = -70 + 100 = 30

We can see that we didn't find a constant after subtracting ten times the input from the output. This suggests a potential error in our initial approach. But if we look again at the results from subtracting ten times the input from the output, we can notice the following pattern:

x       y        10x       y - 10x
----------------------------------------
6       74       60        14
19      191      190       1
-11     -79      -110      31
-5      -25      -50       25
-10     -70      -100      30

We can observe that y - 10x is always equal to x + 4, except when x = 6, which seems to be an outlier given this pattern. For all other inputs, we see:

y = 10x + (x + 4)
y = 11x + 4

This function holds for the last four input-output pairs but not for the first one. Given the current information, the best function that describes the relationship of the given data points, except for when x = 6, is:

y = 11x + 4

Unfortunately, the singular point where x = 6, y = 74 does not fit this pattern and hence the function might not describe all data points perfectly. This suggests that there may have been an error with that data point, or it follows a different pattern not captured by the simple linear relationship we've derived. Assuming no error, you would need more data points or information to conclusively determine a function that fits all provided points.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    To find a linear function that best fits the data in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1), we need to determine the values of 'a' and 'b' such that the function closely matches the given inputs and outputs.

For a linear function, we are looking for a relationship of the form:
y = a + bx

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs we can set up the following equations:

For input 6 (x=6), output 8 (y=8):
8 = a + 6b

For input -5 (x=-5), output -25 (y=-25):
-25 = a - 5b

For input -3 (x=-3), output -19 (y=-19):
-19 = a - 3b

For input -10 (x=-10), output -40 (y=-40):
-40 = a - 10b

For input -14 (x=-14), output -52 (y=-52):
-52 = a - 14b

Now, to find 'a' and 'b', we can solve this system of equations using any two pairs. Let's take the first two pairs for simplicity:

From the first equation (with input 6):
8 = a + 6b  => Equation (1)

From the second equation (with input -5):
-25 = a - 5b => Equation (2)

Let's solve these two equations. First, let's multiply Equation (2) by 1 to get a positive 'a' term for elimination with Equation (1):

-25 = a - 5b  => Multiplying by 1
-25 = a - 5b  => Equation (2a)

Now, let's add Equation (2a) to Equation (1):

8 = a + 6b   => Equation (1)
-25 = a - 5b => Equation (2a)
———————
-17 = 1b

So, b = -17.

Now, let's find 'a' using Equation (1) with our found 'b':

8 = a + 6b
8 = a + 6(-17)
8 = a - 102
a = 8 + 102
a = 110

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = 110 + (-17)x

Or in the form specified:

y = 110x^0 - 17x^1

y = 42

Hence, the output for the input 4 is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we want to find the coefficients a and b such that y assumes the output values for the corresponding input values (x).

The term ax^0 is simply a, because any number raised to the zero power is 1. Therefore, we are looking for the function in the form y = a + bx, where a and b are constants.

Looking at the input-output pairs:

For x = 6, y = 8: 
8 = a + 6b

For x = -5, y = -25:
-25 = a - 5b

For x = -3, y = -19:
-19 = a - 3b

For x = -10, y = -40:
-40 = a - 10b

For x = -14, y = -52:
-52 = a - 14b

We see that when x changes, y changes at what appears to be a consistent rate, which suggests that b is the same across all pairs. What we are looking for is the common difference in y when x changes by 1, which will be our coefficient b.

We can find this by subtracting equations from each other:

From x = -3 to x = -5 (difference of 2 in x; -25 - (-19) = -6 in y):
(-25 = a - 5b) - (-19 = a - 3b)
-25 + 19 = -5b + 3b
-6 = -2b
b = 3

Now we have found b. To find a, we can substitute b into one of the original equations:

Using x = 6, y = 8:
8 = a + 6*3
8 = a + 18
a = 8 - 18
a = -10

For input 6, output 8:
8 = a*6^0 + b*6
8 = a + 6b

For input -5, output -25:
-25 = a*(-5)^0 + b*(-5)

-40 = a - 10b

For input -14, output -52:
-52 = a*(-14)^0 + b*(-14)
-52 = a - 14b

Now let's solve for a and b using the first equation:
8 = a + 6b

We can see from each of the other equations that subtracting them from the first equation cancels out a:

First and second equation:
8 - (-25) = (a + 6b) - (a - 5b)
33 = 11b
b = 3

Now substitute b into the first equation:

(5) For input -14: -52 = a*(-14)^0 + b*(-14) → -52 = a - 14b

Let's use two of these equations to solve for a and b. It's often simpler to start with the smallest numbers, so let's use equations (1) and (3):

(1) 8 = a + 6b
(3) -19 = a - 3b

Let's solve for a by summing equations (1) and (3):

8 + (-19) = (a + 6b) + (a - 3b)
-11 = 2a + 3b

Now let's solve for b by subtracting equation (3) from (1):

8 - (-19) = (a + 6b) - (a - 3b)
27 = 9b

From this we find that:

b = 27 / 9

1. For input 6: a + 6b = 8

    To come up with a function in the form of y = ax⁰ + bx⁴ that describes the data provided, let's first note that ax⁰ is a constant because any number x raised to the 0 power equals 1. Thus, ax⁰ is a, which represents the y-intercept in a linear equation. bx⁴ represents the slope times the input raised to the 1st power.

Let's examine the given input-output pairs:

1. When x = 9,  y = 29
2. When x = 2,  y = 8
3. When x = -1, y = -1
4. When x = -6, y = -16

We notice from the points given that the change in the output y is directly proportional to the change in the input x, which leads us to believe that this might be a linear relationship.

Let's use the first and the third given points to determine the coefficients a and b.

Firstly, let's use point (9, 29):

29 = a(9)⁰ + b(9)¹
29 = a + 9b ... (1)

Then using point (-1, -1):

-1 = a(-1)⁰ + b(-1)¹
-1 = a - b ... (2)

We have two equations and two unknowns. Let's solve this system of equations.

From equation (2):

a = b - 1 ... (3)

Substituting equation (3) into equation (1), we have:

29 = (b - 1) + 9b
29 = 10b - 1

Adding 1 to both sides:

30 = 10b

Divide both sides by 10:

b = 3

Now that we have the value for b, let's find a using equation (3):

a = b - 1
a = 3 - 1
a = 2

Thus, our function is:

y = 2x⁰ + 3x¹
y = 2 + 3x

    To determine the coefficients a and b for the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best matches the given input-output pairs, we'll start by writing out ax^0 + bx^1 in more familiar terms. Since x^0 is always equal to 1, ax^0 is just a. Thus the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Now let's use the provided data points to solve for a and b. We'll establish a system of equations based on the inputs and outputs:

For Input: 9, Output: 29:
29 = a + b*9

For Input: 2, Output: 8:
8 = a + b*2

For Input: -1, Output: -1:
-1 = a + b*(-1)

Since we have more than two data points, we can't find a single solution for a and b without additional constraints. However, we can see if there is a solution that fits all data points by setting up a system with two of the equations and then verifying if those coefficients also satisfy the other data points.

Let's use the first two points to set up our system:

1. 29 = a + 9b
2. 8 = a + 2b

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:

(29 - 8) = (a + 9b) - (a + 2b)
21 = 7b

Now we solve for b:

b = 21 / 7
b = 3

Now plug the value of b back into one of the equations to solve for a:

8 = a + 2*3
8 = a + 6
a = 8 - 6
a = 2

So we have potential values for a and b:

a = 2
b = 3

Let's check these values against one of the other points:

For Input: -1, Output: -1:
-1 = 2 + 3*(-1)
-1 = 2 - 3
-1 = -1 (This matches!)

And let's verify once more with another point:

For Input: -6, Output: -16:
-16 = 2 + 3*(-6)
-16 = 2 - 18
-16 = -16 (This matches as well!)

Because a = 2 and b = 3 satisfy all the given input-output pairs, we can be reasonably confident in our derived function. So, the function that describes the data is:

Looking at the given pairs of inputs and outputs, we can form a set of equations:

For Input 9, Output 29:
29 = a + 9b

For Input 2, Output 8:
8 = a + 2b

For Input -1, Output -1:
-1 = a - 1b

For Input -6, Output -16:
-16 = a - 6b

These pairs should follow the same linear function. Therefore, solving any two of these equations should give us the values of 'a' and 'b'. Since we have the outputs for the same input of -6 twice, we can use that to verify our findings at the end.

Let's use the equations from inputs 9 and 2 to solve for 'a' and 'b':

29 = a + 9b (1)
8 = a + 2b  (2)

If we subtract equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

21 = 7b

From this, we can solve for 'b':

b = 21 / 7
b = 3

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find 'a'. Using equation (2):

8 = a + 2b
8 = a + 2(3)
8 = a + 6
a = 8 - 6
a = 2

So the equation of the line, in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which fits the data provided is:

y = 2x^0 + 3x^1

Simplifying, we get:

y = 2 + 3x

    To find the coefficients a and b for the function of the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

we can look at the given input-output pairs and remember that \( x^0 \) is 1 for any x (except for x=0, but that doesn't apply here as we don't have zero input). This means that the term \( ax^0 \) simplifies to a, and the term \( bx^1 \) simplifies to bx. Therefore, we can rewrite the function as:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Now, let's use two of the provided input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations to solve for a and b. Let's use the inputs 9 and 2:

For input 9, output 29:
\[ 29 = a + 9b \]

For input 2, output 8:
\[ 8 = a + 2b \]

We can solve this system of linear equations for a and b.

From the second equation:
\[ a = 8 - 2b \]

Substitute the expression for a into the first equation:
\[ 29 = (8 - 2b) + 9b \]
\[ 29 = 8 + 7b \]
\[ 21 = 7b \]
\[ b = 3 \]

Now substitute the value of b back into the expression for a:
\[ a = 8 - 2(3) \]
\[ a = 8 - 6 \]
\[ a = 2 \]

Therefore, the coefficients are a = 2 and b = 3. The function is:

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs provided, we need to solve for a and b.

The term ax^0 is equivalent to a, since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. Hence the function simplifies to y = a + bx. Now we need two equations to solve for the two unknowns a and b.

Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to create our system of equations:

For input 9 (output 29):
29 = a + 9b  --(1)

For input 2 (output 8):
8 = a + 2b  --(2)

Now, we will solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b:

From equation (2), we can express a as:
a = 8 - 2b  --(3)

Substitute equation (3) into equation (1):
29 = (8 - 2b) + 9b
29 = 8 + 7b
21 = 7b
b = 3

Now, plug the value of b into equation (3) to find a:
a = 8 - 2(3)
a = 8 - 6
a = 2

    To capture the relationship between input (x) and output (y), we can try to find a linear fit for the data points because the requested form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 is a linear equation, where ax^0 is a constant (since any number to the power of 0 equals 1).

Let's denote:

- a and b as the coefficients we are looking to determine
- y as the output
- x as the input

The equation y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 equals 1. 

We need to find the values of 'a' and 'b' that provide the best fit. Since we are not given a tool for regression analysis here, we will need to determine an approximate solution visually or by hand. 

Considering the provided data points:

For x = -16, y = 109, therefore: 109 = a - 16b
For x = -3, y = 18, therefore: 18 = a - 3b
For x = 2, y = -17, therefore: -17 = a + 2b
For x = 12, y = -87, therefore: -87 = a + 12b
For x = 5, y = -38, therefore: -38 = a + 5b

To solve these equations simultaneously for 'a' and 'b', we might use any two of them to set up a system of linear equations since theoretically, if the data is perfectly linear, two points should suffice to determine a line.

Let's use the first two data points to set up the equations:

1. 109 = a - 16b
2. 18 = a - 3b

To solve for 'a' and 'b', we can subtract the second equation from the first:

(109 - 18) = (a - a) + (-16b - (-3b))
91 = -13b

Solving for 'b':
b = -91 / 13
b ≈ -7

Now we can substitute 'b' back into the second equation to solve for a:

18 = a - 3(-7)
18 = a + 21
a = 18 - 21
a = -3

Thus, the equations for our line will be roughly:

y ≈ -3 + (-7)x

Output: y = -3x^0 - 7x^1

Given that we have multiple input-output pairs, we can use two of them to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the following two points: (-16, 109) and (12, -87).

For these two points, we can set up two equations based on the linear form \( y = a + bx \):

1. For the input -16 and output 109: \( 109 = a -16b \)
2. For the input 12 and output -87: \( -87 = a + 12b \)

Now, we solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

From equation (1): \( a = 109 + 16b \)

Substitute \( a \) from equation (1) into equation (2):

\( -87 = 109 + 16b + 12b \)
\( -87 = 109 + 28b \)
\( -196 = 28b \)
\( b = -7 \)

Now, plug \( b \) back into either equation (1) or (2) to find \( a \). Using equation (1):

\( a = 109 + 16b \)
\( a = 109 + 16(-7) \)
\( a = 109 - 112 \)

2. \( -3, 18 \)
3. \( 2, -17 \)
4. \( 12, -87 \)
5. \( 5, -38 \)

We can see that the outputs change linearly with respect to the inputs, meaning we can just calculate \( b \) by taking two points and using the slope formula \( b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) \).

Let's use points (2, -17) and (-3, 18) to compute \( b \):

\[ b = (18 - (-17)) / (-3 - 2) \]
\[ b = (18 + 17) / (-5) \]
\[ b = 35 / (-5) \]
\[ b = -7 \]

Now we know that our function looks like \( y = a - 7x \). To find \( a \), we can plug in one of the points into the function. Let's use point (2, -17):

\[ -17 = a - 7(2) \]
\[ -17 = a - 14 \]
\[ a = -17 + 14 \]
\[ a = -3 \]

So the function is \( y = -3 - 7x \). However, this function must be written in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), so in that specific form, our function is:

\[ y = a + bx \]

To determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \), we can create a system of equations using the provided input-output pairs. We would need at least two pairs to solve for both variables. Let's use the pairs (-16, 109) and (2, -17) for this purpose:

1. Using the input -16 and output 109:
\[ 109 = a + b(-16) \]
\[ 109 = a - 16b \]

2. Using the input 2 and output -17:

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

\[ \begin{cases} 
  a - 16b = 109 \\
  a + 2b = -17 
\end{cases} \]

We can solve this system by using the method of elimination or substitution. I'll proceed with elimination:

First, let's multiply the second equation by 8 to match the coefficient of \( b \) in the first equation:

\[ \begin{cases} 
  a - 16b = 109 \\
  8a + 16b = -136

Now, let's add both equations together:

\[ (a - 16b) + (8a + 16b) = 109 - 136 \]
\[ 9a = -27 \]
\[ a = -27 / 9 \]
\[ a = -3 \]

With the value of \( a \) known, we can now find \( b \) easily by substituting \( a \) into one of our original equations. Let's use the second:

1. -16 → 109
2. -3 → 18
3. 2 → -17

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Thus, the function can be re-written as:

y = a + bx

To determine the values of a and b, we need to look for a pattern in the input and output values. Inspecting the input-output pairs:

- For x = -9, y = 162.
- For x = 17, y = -254.
- For x = -4, y = 82.
- For x = -18, y = 306.
- For x = -14, y = 242.

From these, one could attempt to discern if there is a constant change in y for a constant change in x.

Let's analyze the differences:

- When x changes from -9 to -4 (an increase of 5), y changes from 162 to 82 (a decrease of 80).
- When x changes from -4 to 17 (an increase of 21), y changes from 82 to -254 (a decrease of 336).

The rate of change (slope) is not constant between these points, indicating that the relationship is not strictly linear. However, looking at the change in y relative to the change in x:

- (162 - 82) / (-9 - (-4)) = 80 / 5 = 16
- (82 - (-254)) / (-4 - 17) = 336 / 21 = 16

We notice that the output changes by 16 times the difference in input values. This suggests b should be -16, since the outputs decrease as inputs increase.

With a candidate for b in hand, we can substitute one pair of inputs and outputs into the equation to solve for a:

162 = a + (-16)(-9)
162 = a + 144
a = 162 - 144
a = 18

Now that we have 'a', let's find 'b' using equation 1):
162 = 18 - 9b
-18 = -9b
b = -18 / -9
b = 2

The function that fits the given data is:
y = 18 + 2x

However, if we check this function with the input-output pairs provided, we will find it does not match the outputs given. This suggests that our earlier assumption that the relationship is linear might be incorrect. We need another method to determine the correct linear equation. Given the pattern that the sign of the output is opposite to the input and that the magnitude of the output is an increasing function of the absolute value of the input, let's explore another approach.

Let's assume a proportional relationship and find the proportionality constant 'b'. Since we have a change in sign, we should directly consider the negative sign in our equation. We will disregard 'a' for the moment and only calculate 'b'. Let's try considering the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Given the input -9 and output 162, if b is the constant of proportionality, we can write -9b = 162 which simplifies to b = -162/9 = -18.

To verify if this 'b' holds for the other input-output pairs, we can check with another pair. Taking input 17 and output -254:
17b = -254 simplifies to b = -254/17 = -14.94117647

Note that this 'b' is inconsistent with the one derived from the previous pair, which indicates that there is likely an additional term (such as 'a' in this case) affecting the outputs.

This means the function is not as straightforward as y = ax^0 + bx^1 in a trivial sense where 'a' is a simple constant and 'b' is a constant multiplier of 'x'. Instead, the function's pattern might be more complex or may not be linear at all.

Without more constraints or a pattern, we cannot definitively determine the function based on the data provided. We require either additional information about the data, more data points, or clear instructions on the generating process to provide a conclusive function.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that captures the relationship, we need to recognize the pattern that relates the input values (which we'll refer to as `x`) to the output values (which we'll refer to as `y`). Let's examine the input-output pairs provided:

1. For x = -9, y = 162
2. For x = 17, y = -254
3. For x = -4, y = 82
4. For x = -18, y = 306
5. For x = -14, y = 242

From examining the pairs, there seems to be a linear relationship because each increase in `x` corresponds to a consistent change in `y`. To describe this in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx (since x^0 is 1 and x^1 is x), we need to find the values of the coefficients `a` and `b`.

Given that this is a linear pattern, let's use two input-output pairs to solve for `a` and `b`. We can choose any two pairs, but for simplicity of calculation, let's use the pairs (-9, 162) and (-18, 306).

Using the first input-output pair (x = -9, y = 162):
162 = a + b(-9)

And using the second input-output pair (x = -18, y = 306):
306 = a + b(-18)

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. 162 = a - 9b
2. 306 = a - 18b

By solving this system, we can find the values for `a` and `b`. Let's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate `a`:

306 - 162 = (a - 18b) - (a - 9b)
144 = -18b + 9b
144 = -9b

Now solve for `b`:
b = 144 / -9
b = -16

Now we can plug the value of `b` back into one of the original equations to solve for `a`. Using the first equation:

162 = a - 9(-16)
162 = a + 144
a = 162 - 144
a = 18

Therefore, the function capturing the relationship in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = 18 + (-16)x

y = 18 - 16x

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the provided input-output pairs, we can interpret ax^0 as a constant (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 as a linear term (since x^1 is just x). The function therefore simplifies to y = a + bx, which is a straight line equation where 'a' is the y-intercept and 'b' is the slope.

We have the following input-output pairs:
(18, 350), (12, 230), (-13, -270), (4, 70), and (16, 310).

Let's consider the first two points to calculate the slope 'b'.

We use the formula for the slope of a line given two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2):

b = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)

Choosing input-output pairs (18, 350) and (12, 230):
b = (350 - 230) / (18 - 12)
b = 120 / 6
b = 20

Let's use this value of 'b' to find 'a' using one of the points. We'll use the point (18, 350):

350 = a + 20 * 18
350 = a + 360
a = 350 - 360
a = -10

Thus, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which simplifies to y = a + bx since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), we need to determine the constants a and b.

Using two points from the provided data set we can set up a system of equations to solve for a and b.

Let's use the Input/Output pairs (18, 350) and (16, 310).

From the pair (18, 350):
350 = a + 18b

From the pair (16, 310):
310 = a + 16b

This system of equations can be solved using different methods like substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

First equation: 350 = a + 18b 
Second equation: 310 = a + 16b

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:
(350 - 310) = (a - a) + (18b - 16b)
40 = 2b
b = 20

Now that we have b, we can substitute it into any of the original equations to solve for a. Let's substitute into the second equation:
310 = a + 16b
310 = a + 16(20)
310 = a + 320
a = 310 - 320
a = -10

So the function describing the relationship is:

Given the pairs:
1. (18, 350)
2. (12, 230)
3. (-13, -270)
4. (4, 70)
5. (16, 310)

For each pair (x, y), we can plug them into the equation y = a + bx:

1. 350 = a + 18b
2. 230 = a + 12b
3. -270 = a - 13b
4. 70 = a + 4b
5. 310 = a + 16b

Those are five equations, but since there are only two unknowns (a and b), we only need two to solve for a and b. Let's use the first two for convenience:

I. 350 = a + 18b
II. 230 = a + 12b

Subtracting equation II from equation I eliminates a and allows us to solve for b:

350 - 230 = (a + 18b) - (a + 12b)
120 = 6b

Thus:

b = 120 / 6
b = 20

We can then substitute b back into either equation (let's choose II) to solve for a:

230 = a + 12b
230 = a + 12(20)
230 = a + 240

Solve for a:

a = 230 - 240

5. For input 16, output 310: \(310 = a + 16b\)

We can use any two of these equations to solve for the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\). Let's use the equations from inputs 18 and 12 to set up a system of linear equations:

\[350 = a + 18b\]
\[230 = a + 12b\]

Subtract the second equation from the first to solve for \(b\):

Given the data points (18, 350), (12, 230), (-13, -270), (4, 70), and (16, 310), we will compute the slope \( b \) first.

We can use the two-point formula for finding the slope between two distinct points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\):

\[ b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

We can choose any two points to compute the slope, but for the sake of simplicity, let's choose points (18, 350) and (16, 310). Then,

\[ b = \frac{350 - 310}{18 - 16} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Since all the outputs seem to be a linear function of the inputs, we can attempt to find a pattern or use two input-output pairs to solve for a and b. Let’s take two pairs (13, 177) and (14, 191) for simplicity.

For the pair (13, 177), the equation would be:
177 = a * 13^0 + b * 13
177 = a + 13b

For the pair (14, 191), the equation would be:
191 = a * 14^0 + b * 14
191 = a + 14b

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1) a + 13b = 177
2) a + 14b = 191

To solve for a and b, we can subtract the first equation from the second:

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's first acknowledge that ax^0 is just a since x^0 = 1 for any x ≠ 0. Thus, the function form simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have the following input-output pairs:

1. When x = 13, y = 177
2. When x = 14, y = 191
3. When x = -8, y = -117
4. When x = 3, y = 37
5. When x = 7, y = 93

We need to find the constants a and b that will make the function describe all these pairs as closely as possible.

Looking at the differences in y for consecutive x values:

- From x = 13 to x = 14, the change in y is 191 - 177 = 14
- If we consider another pair, say x = 7 to x = 3, the change in y is 93 - 37 = 56 over a change in x of 4 units.
- This suggests an increase of 14 in y for every increase of 1 in x, since 56 ÷ 4 = 14.

If we assume that the relationship is linear and that this pattern holds, we can guess that b, which is the coefficient representing the change in y per unit change in x, is 14.

Now, to find a, we can use any of the points. Let's take the point (13, 177):

Given the input-output pairs:
(13, 177)

177 = a + 13b
191 = a + 14b
-117 = a - 8b
37 = a + 3b
93 = a + 7b

Let's solve these equations using any two pairs to find 'a' and 'b'. It is easier to use two subsequent input-output pairs to calculate b since a would eliminate itself when subtracting the equations from each other. Let's take the first two pairs:

191 = a + 14b (1)
177 = a + 13b (2)

Subtracting (2) from (1) gives:
191 - 177 = (a + 14b) - (a + 13b)
14 = b

Now, we substitute the value of 'b' into either of the equations to find 'a'. We'll use equation (1):

191 = a + 14b
191 = a + 14(14)
191 = a + 196
a = 191 - 196
