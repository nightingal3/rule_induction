"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify this as y = a + bx, since x^0 is always 1. We have a linear relationship between x and y.

Let's use two points to solve for a and b. We'll use the points (x1, y1) = (-10, -213) and (x2, y2) = (9, 167).

Using y = a + bx, we can create two equations based on these points:

1. -213 = a - 10b
2. 167 = a + 9b

Now, let's solve these two equations systemically. First, let's multiply the second equation by 10 to align the b terms:

10*(167) = 10a + 90b
1670 = 10a + 90b

Now subtract equation 1 from the multiplied second equation:

1670 + 213 = 10a + 90b - (a - 10b)
1883 = 9a + 100b

Now divide by 9 to solve for a:

\( \frac{1883}{9} = a + \frac{100}{9}b \)

Let's call this equation 3 for now and solve for a:

\( a = \frac{1883}{9} - \frac{100}{9}b \)

Now replace a in equation 2 with this expression:

167 = \( \frac{1883}{9} - \frac{100}{9}b \) + 9b

Multiply everything by 9 to eliminate the fraction:

1503 = 1883 - 100b + 81b

Now combine like terms and solve for b:

1503 - 1883 = -100b + 81b
-380 = -19b

b = \( \frac{380}{19} \)

b = 20

Now that we have b, let's solve for a using b = 20:

-213 = a - 10(20)

-213 = a - 200

a = -213 + 200

a = -13

Therefore, the function is y = -13 + 20x, or in the exact form requested:

y = -13x^0 + 20x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The given inputs and outputs suggest a linear relationship of the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

To determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\), we can use two pairs of input and output values to set up a system of linear equations.

Let's choose the given pairs (-10, -213) and (20, 387):

For the input -10 and output -213:

\[ -213 = a + b(-10) \]
\[ -213 = a - 10b \]
\[ a - 10b = -213 \] --- (1)

For the input 20 and output 387:

\[ 387 = a + b(20) \]
\[ 387 = a + 20b \]
\[ a + 20b = 387 \] --- (2)

Solving this system of linear equations, we can find the values for \(a\) and \(b\).

Step 1: Add equation (1) and equation (2):
\[ (a - 10b) + (a + 20b) = -213 + 387 \]
\[ 2a + 10b = 174 \]
\[ a + 5b = 87 \] --- (3)

Step 2: Now, let's subtract equation (1) from equation (3):
\[ (a + 5b) - (a - 10b) = 87 - (-213) \]
\[ a + 5b - a + 10b = 87 + 213 \]
\[ 15b = 300 \]
\[ b = 20 \]

Step 3: Plug the value of \(b\) back into equation (1) or (2) to find \(a\). We'll use equation (1):
\[ a - 10(20) = -213 \]
\[ a - 200 = -213 \]
\[ a = -213 + 200 \]
\[ a = -13 \]

So the coefficients are:
\[ a = -13 \]
\[ b = 20 \]

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\[ y = -13 + 20x \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we first note that ax^0 is a constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is simply bx. Therefore, the function we are looking for is y = a + bx.

We can use two points from the given input-output pairs to determine the values of a and b. Let's take the two points (x1, y1) = (-10, -213) and (x2, y2) = (9, 167) to form two equations:

1. For (x1, y1) = (-10, -213):
-213 = a - 10b

2. For (x2, y2) = (9, 167):
167 = a + 9b

Now, let's solve these two equations simultaneously for a and b.

From the first equation:
a = -213 + 10b  (Equation 3)

Substituting Equation 3 into the second equation:
167 = (-213 + 10b) + 9b
167 = -213 + 19b
167 + 213 = 19b
380 = 19b
b = 380 / 19
b = 20

Now we can find a by substituting b back into Equation 3:
a = -213 + 10*20
a = -213 + 200
a = -13

The function that describes the data is therefore:
y = -13 + 20x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to realize that x^0 is always 1, so ax^0 simplifies to a. Thus, the equation we are looking to describe is simply y = a + bx.

We can use two points to calculate the values of a and b. Let's take the points (x1, y1) = (-10, -213) and (x2, y2) = (9, 167) and form a system of linear equations:

For the first point (-10, -213):
-213 = a + b(-10)

For the second point (9, 167):
167 = a + b(9)

This gives us two equations:
1) a - 10b = -213
2) a + 9b = 167

Now we can solve this system of equations for a and b. We'll use the method of elimination:

If we add both equations together:
1) a - 10b = -213
2) a + 9b = 167
-----------------
2a - b = -46

Now, let's solve for a in terms of b:
a = b/2 - 23

We can now substitute this into one of the original equations to solve for b, let's use equation 2):
b/2 - 23 + 9b = 167
(b/2 + 9b) = 167 + 23
(0.5b + 9b) = 190
9.5b = 190
b = 190 / 9.5
b = 20

Now that we have b, we can solve for a:
a = (20)/2 - 23
a = 10 - 23
a = -13

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs would be:
y = -13 + 20x

Hence, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is
y = -13x^0 + 20x^1

Note: Since x^0 = 1 for all x ≠ 0, we can simplify it to:

y = a + bx

To find the constants a and b, we need to solve a system of equations using two of the given data points.

Let's choose two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), for instance (-10, -213) and (20, 387), and set up two equations:

1) -213 = a + b*(-10)
2) 387 = a + b*(20)

Now let's solve these two equations for a and b.

From equation 1):
-213 = a - 10b
a = -213 + 10b   ---(3)

Substitute the value of a from equation 3 into equation 2):
387 = -213 + 10b + 20b
387 = -213 + 30b
387 + 213 = 30b
600 = 30b
b = 600/30
b = 20

Now, let's use the value of b to find a, using equation 3:
a = -213 + 10*20
a = -213 + 200
a = -13

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:
y = -13 + 20x

We should write it explicitly in the requested form:

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first recognize that \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any \( x \neq 0 \), and \( bx^1 \) is simply \( bx \). Thus, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Given this format, \( a \) is the constant term, and when \( x = 0 \), \( y = a \), since \( b \cdot 0 = 0 \). From the data point (Input: 0, Output: -3), we can immediately determine that \( a = -3 \).

To find \( b \), we need two points to calculate the rate of change. We can use the provided data points (Input: -18, Output: 339) and (Input: 0, Output: -3).

Using these points, the rate of change \( b \) can be calculated as follows:
\( b = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \)

Taking \( (x_1, y_1) = (0, -3) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) = (-18, 339) \), we get:
\( b = \frac{339 - (-3)}{-18 - 0} \)

We have two parameters, \( a \) and \( b \), that we need to solve for. The given data points provide a system of equations; however, we only need two points to solve a linear system with two unknowns. Since we have more than two points, we will choose two and solve for \( a \) and \( b \). If the other points satisfy the resulting equation, then we have our function.

Using the data points:

1) When \( x = 0 \), \( y = -3 \), so our equation is \( -3 = a + b(0) \),

This function can be simplified to: y = a + bx, since x^0 is equal to 1 for any x.

We can use any two sets of (x, y) values to set up a system of two equations. Let's use the following two pairs: (5, -31) and (-11, 49). Plugging these into y = a + bx gives us:

For input 5:     -31 = a + 5b
For input -11:    49 = a - 11b

Now, we need to solve this system of equations for a and b.

Let's multiply the second equation by 5 to align the coefficient of b with the first equation:

5 * (49 = a - 11b)
245 = 5a - 55b

Now we have a system of equations:

Let's add the first equation to the second one to eliminate the variable a:

(245 = 5a - 55b)
+ (-31 =  a +  5b)
-----------------
214 = 6a - 50b

Now, to eliminate b, we can multiply the first equation by 50 and the second by 5 (before they were combined):

-31 * 50 = 50a + 250b
245 * 5 = 25a - 275b

Then we add the resulting equations:

(-31 * 50) + (245 * 5) = (50a + 250b) + (25a - 275b)

-1550 + 1225 = 75a - 25b

Now, let's go back to one of our original equations to solve for b. Let's use -31 = a + 5b. We'll substitute the expression for a from Equation 1 into this equation to find b:

-31 = (-325/75 + b/3) + 5b
-31 = -325/75 + b/3 + 15b/3
-31 = -325/75 + 16b/3

Now, let's solve for b:

-31 + 325/75 = 16b/3
(75 * -31 + 325) / 75 = 16b/3
(-2325 + 325) / 75 = 16b/3
-2000 / 75 = 16b/3
-2000 / 75 * 3/16 = b
b = -2000 * 3 / (75 * 16)
b = -2000 / (25 * 16)
b = -80 / 16
b = -5

Now we have the value for b, which is -5. Let's go back to Equation 1 and solve for a:

a = -325/75 + b/3
a = -325/75 - 5/3
a = (-325/75) * (3/3) - (5 * 75) / (75 * 3)
a = (-975 - 375) / 225
a = -1350 / 225
a = -6

Putting these values back into our original function, we get:

y = a + bx
y = -6 + (-5)x
y = -6 - 5x

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs given in the question is:

Output: y = -6 - 5x

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can notice that it is a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 for any x except 0.

We can use two data points to determine the coefficients a (y-intercept) and b (slope). Let's use the following two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):

Point 1: (5, -31)
Point 2: (9, -51)

Now we'll set up two equations using the general form y = a + bx:

-31 = a + 5b  -> (1)
-51 = a + 9b  -> (2)

Now subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate 'a' and solve for 'b':

(-51) - (-31) = (a + 9b) - (a + 5b)
-51 + 31 = 9b - 5b
-20 = 4b
b = -5

Now that we have 'b', we can substitute it back into equation (1) to get 'a':

-31 = a + 5(-5)
-31 = a - 25
a = -6

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we require a function of the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`. Since `x^0` is always 1 for any x except for x=0 (the result for x=0 is undefined in the context of the natural numbers), the term `ax^0` can be simplified to `a`. Therefore, the function simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

We need to determine the coefficients `a` and `b`. To do this, we can use two of the given pairs of inputs and outputs to form a system of equations that we can then solve.

Let's use the pairs (5, -31) and (9, -51):

1. For the input 5 and output -31:
-31 = a + b(5)  =>  Equation (1)

2. For the input 9 and output -51:
-51 = a + b(9)  =>  Equation (2)

We can now solve these equations simultaneously to find `a` and `b`.

From Equation (1):
a = -31 - 5b  =>  Equation (3)

Substituting Equation (3) into Equation (2) gives us:
-51 = (-31 - 5b) + 9b
-51 = -31 - 5b + 9b
-51 = -31 + 4b
-51 + 31 = 4b
-20 = 4b
b = -5

Now, we can use the value of `b` to find `a`. Substitute `b = -5` into Equation (3):
a = -31 - 5(-5)
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

Using the input 5 and output -31, we plug into the equation:

-31 = a + b(5)   ... (1)

Using the input 9 and output -51, we plug into the equation:

-51 = a + b(9)   ... (2)

Now, subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to solve for ""b"":

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are essentially looking for the equation of a line \( y = mx + b \), where \( a \) corresponds to \( b \) (the y-intercept), and \( b \) corresponds to \( m \) (the slope).

The data points given can be represented as:
(7, -98), (17, -218), (5, -74), (3, -50), (-6, 58)

We can calculate the slope \( m \) (which is \( b \) in our function) using two points. Let's use (7, -98) and (17, -218):

\( m = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) \)
\( m = (-218 - (-98)) / (17 - 7) \)
\( m = (-218 + 98) / (10) \)
\( m = (-120) / (10) \)
\( m = -12 \)

So, our slope \( b \) is -12.

Now we need to find \( a \) (the y-intercept). We can use \( a \) in the place of \( b \) in \( y = mx + b \) and solve for \( a \) from one of the points. Let's use (7, -98):

\( -98 = (-12)(7) + a \)
\( -98 = -84 + a \)
\( a = -98 + 84 \)
\( a = -14 \)

Thus the function that describes this relationship in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) is:

1. When x = 7, y = -98

3. When x = 5, y = -74
4. When x = 3, y = -50

We need two points to determine the linear equation. Let's use points (7, -98) and (17, -218). We can calculate ""b"" by finding the slope between these two points.

The slope ""b"" is given by the change in y divided by the change in x:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Using points (7, -98) and (17, -218):

b = (-218 - (-98)) / (17 - 7)

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, let's identify the coefficients 'a' and 'b' using the provided input-output pairs. Here, x^0 is always 1, so the term ax^0 simplifies to 'a'. Hence, the function can be rewritten as y = a + bx.

Let's find 'a' and 'b' by solving a system of equations using two of the given points. We'll use (7, -98) and (-6, 58):

For input 7:
-98 = a + 7b  ...(1)

For input -6:
58 = a - 6b    ...(2)

Solving these equations, we start by multiplying equation (2) by 7 and equation (1) by 6 to eliminate 'a':

(2) * 7: 406 = 7a - 42b  ...(3)
(1) * 6: -588 = 6a + 42b ...(4)

Adding equations (3) and (4), we get:
406 - 588 = (7a + 6a) + (-42b + 42b)
-182 = 13a
a = -182 / 13
a = -14

Now, we substitute 'a' back into equation (1) to find 'b':
-98 = -14 + 7b
-98 + 14 = 7b
-84 = 7b
b = -84 / 7
b = -12

Therefore, the coefficients are a = -14 and b = -12. The function describing the relationship between input (x) and output (y) is:

This gives us a linear equation of the form:

y = a + bx

We need to find the values of 'a' and 'b' that fit the given data points. To do this, we can use two of the data points to set up a system of linear equations and solve for 'a' and 'b'.

Let's take the pairs (7, -98) and (-6, 58) to set up our system of equations. Plugging these into the equation gives us:

-98 = a + b(7)   ...[1]
58 = a + b(-6)   ...[2]

Now, let's solve for 'a' and 'b'.

Multiplying equation [2] by -1 gives us:
-58 = -a - b(6)  ...[3]

Adding [1] and [3] we get:
-98 - 58 = a + b(7) - a - b(6)

a = -98 + 1092
a = 994

2. (-11, -169)
3. (20, 265)
4. (-10, -155)

These pairs suggest a linear relationship between x and y. We can figure out the coefficients a and b by substituting two of the given x,y pairs into the equation y = a + bx and solving for a and b.

Let's use the first two pairs to set up a system of linear equations:

1. -197 = a - 13b     [plugging in x = -13, y = -197]
2. -169 = a - 11b     [plugging in x = -11, y = -169]

Now we can solve for a and b. Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:

-197 + 169 = -13b + 11b

To solve the system, we can use either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply Equation 1 by 20 and Equation 2 by 13 to align the a terms:

    To define the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the data provided, we need to determine the values of a and b.

The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is always equal to 1 for any x that is not 0. We can use two points from the provided data to solve for a and b.

Let's choose two points: (-13, -197) and (20, 265).

For the first point (-13, -197):
-197 = a + b(-13)
-197 = a - 13b (1)

For the second point (20, 265):
265 = a + b(20)
265 = a + 20b (2)

Now we have a system of two equations:

(1) -197 = a - 13b
(2) 265 = a + 20b

We can solve this system through substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiply the first equation by 20 and the second by 13 to eliminate a:

(1) -3940 = 20a - 260b
(2) 3445 = 13a + 260b

Now add the two equations:

-3940 + 3445 = 20a - 260b + 13a + 260b
-495 = 33a
a = -495 / 33
a = -15

Now we can substitute the value of a into one of the original equations to find b:

265 = -15 + 20b
280 = 20b
b = 280 / 20
b = 14

Thus, the function that describes the data capturig the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) is:

y = -15 + 14x

In the exact form requested:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we need to understand that ax^0 is simply a constant term (since x^0 = 1 for any x ≠ 0), and bx^1 is a linear term since x^1 = x.

So, we are basically looking for a linear function y = a + bx that fits the data points provided. Let's denote the constant term as 'a' and the linear coefficient as 'b'. We can use two data points to solve for 'a' and 'b'.

Let's take the data points (x1, y1) = (9, 160) and (x2, y2) = (13, 228) and set up the system of linear equations:

1) For the input 9:  a + 9b = 160
2) For the input 13: a + 13b = 228

Now we'll solve this system for 'a' and 'b'.

Subtracting the first equation from the second to eliminate 'a', we get:
(13b - 9b) = (228 - 160)
4b = 68
b = 68 / 4
b = 17

Now, we can plug the value of 'b' into one of the original equations to solve for 'a':

a + 9(17) = 160
a + 153 = 160
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

Now we have the values for 'a' and 'b':
a = 7
b = 17

    To find the function that describes the data, we need to determine the coefficients ""a"" and ""b"" for the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1.

To do this, we can use any two of the provided input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations. Let's use the pairs (9, 160) and (13, 228).

Substituting these pairs into the equation y = a + bx gives us two equations:

1) For input 9 and output 160: 160 = a + 9b
2) For input 13 and output 228: 228 = a + 13b

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of ""a"" and ""b"".

Subtracting equation 1 from 2 to eliminate ""a"", we get:
228 - 160 = (a + 13b) - (a + 9b)
68 = 4b
b = 68 / 4
b = 17

Now that we have ""b"", we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for ""a"". Let's use equation 1:
160 = a + 9b
160 = a + 9(17)

We now have a system of equations based on the inputs (x) and outputs (y):

1. For input 9: y = a + 9b = 160
2. For input 13: y = a + 13b = 228
3. For input -4: y = a - 4b = -61
4. For input 15: y = a + 15b = 262
5. For input -20: y = a - 20b = -333

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. We can use any pair of these equations to solve for a and b. Let's use (1) and (3) for simpler numbers:

For (1) a + 9b = 160
For (3) a - 4b = -61

Solving for a from (3):
a = -61 + 4b

Now substituting a in (1):
-61 + 4b + 9b = 160
13b = 160 + 61
13b = 221
b = 221 / 13

The goal is to find the values of a and b that will fit these data points.

First, notice that all of these points seem to lie on a straight line if you were to plot them on a graph because the change in output looks to be roughly proportional to the change in input. To verify this and calculate the exact values of a and b, we can take two points and use them to solve a system of two equations.

Let's use the points (9, 160) and (-4, -61).

For the first point (9, 160):
160 = a + 9b (Equation 1)

For the second point (-4, -61):
-61 = a - 4b (Equation 2)

Let's solve this system of equations by using the method of substitution or elimination. First, we can solve Equation 2 for a to find it in terms of b.

a = -61 + 4b

Now we can substitute this into Equation 1 for a.

160 = (-61 + 4b) + 9b
160 = -61 + 4b + 9b
160 + 61 = 13b

    To determine a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the constants a and b using the given data points. Since ax^0 is a constant term (because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), this can be seen as y = a + bx. Finding a and b will allow us to construct the function that provides the relationship between the input x and the output y.

Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), we can formulate two equations:

1. y1 = a + bx1
2. y2 = a + bx2

Let's choose two points to work with; for example, let's use (9, 160) and (-4, -61). This gives us:

160 = a + b(9)
-61 = a + b(-4)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

1. 160 = a + 9b
2. -61 = a - 4b

To solve for a and b, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

    The given points are:

(−2, 17), (7, −145), (−10, 161), (9, −181), (−20, 341).

To express this relationship in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are looking for an equation of the line y = a + bx, where a is the y-intercept (the value of y when x is 0) and b is the slope (the change in y for a one-unit change in x).

Looking at the y-values, they are all odd, which suggests that the constant term might be an odd number. Similarly, looking at the even x-values (-2, -10, and -20) all result in positive y-values, which suggests that the slope might be negative since typically in a linear function, odd/even x-values would correspond to similar odd/even y-values.

Let's verify this by examining the change in y over the change in x between a pair of points. If this relationship is linear, the value should be the same for all pairs:

Using the points (−2, 17) and (7, −145):

Slope (b) = Δy / Δx = (−145 − 17) / (7 − (−2)) = (−162) / 9 = −18.

Now let's check this slope with another pair of points:

Using the points (7, −145) and (9, −181):

Slope (b) = Δy / Δx = (−181 − (−145)) / (9 − 7) = (−36) / 2 = −18.

The slope is consistent, which further indicates a linear relationship.

Now we just need the y-intercept (a). If we plug in one of the points into the equation y = a + bx, we can solve for a. Let's use the point (−2, 17):

17 = a − 18(−2),

1. For input -2 (x = -2, y = 17):
17 = a + b(-2)

2. For input 7 (x = 7, y = -145):

For the input -2 and output 17, the equation would be:
17 = a * (-2)^0 + b * (-2)^1
Since any number to the power of 0 is 1, this simplifies to:
17 = a - 2b

-145 = a * 7^0 + b * 7^1
This simplifies to:

Now we have a system of equations:
1) 17 = a - 2b
2) -145 = a + 7b

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:
Multiply the first equation by 7, and the second by 2 to eliminate a:

1) 7 * 17 = 7a - 14b   =>  119 = 7a - 14b
2) 2 * -145 = 2a + 14b => -290 = 2a + 14b

Now add the two equations to eliminate b:

-171 = 9a

Now, solve for a:

a = -171 / 9

    Given the function format y = ax^0 + bx^1 and the data points provided, we need to find the values of 'a' and 'b' that will make the function accurately represent the data.

The function y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is always 1.

Therefore, our goal is to find a linear relationship y = a + bx that fits the data points provided. 

Let's take two distinct input-output pairs to solve for 'a' and 'b':
Let's use the first and the fourth data points:

1. (20, -307)
2. (12, -187)

From the first data point (20, -307):
-307 = a + 20b

From the second data point (12, -187):
-187 = a + 12b

We have a system of linear equations:
-307 = a + 20b
-187 = a + 12b

Subtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate 'a', we get:
-307 - (-187) = (a + 20b) - (a + 12b)
-120 = 8b
b = -120 / 8
b = -15

Substitute 'b' into one of the original equations to solve for 'a':
-307 = a + 20(-15)
-307 = a - 300
a = -307 + 300
a = -7

The function that fits the data is therefore:
y = -7 + (-15)x

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of ""a"" and ""b"" that make the equation fit the provided input-output pairs.

Firstly, let's rewrite the function with the understood coefficients:

y = a + bx

Now, since ax^0 is just 'a' because anything raised to the power of zero is 1, we can simplify the function to:

y = a + bx

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to form a system of linear equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'. For ease of calculation, I'll choose the input-output pairs (20, -307) and (-1, 8) as they will likely give a simpler system of equations.

For input 20 and output -307:
-307 = a + b(20)         ... (1)

For input -1 and output 8:
8 = a + b(-1)            ... (2)

We have two equations and two unknowns. Let's solve the system of equations.

From equation (2), we can express 'a' in terms of 'b':
a = 8 + b                ... (3)

Now, substitute equation (3) into equation (1):
-307 = (8 + b) + b(20)
-307 = 8 + 21b

Now, isolate and find 'b':
21b = -315
b = -315 / 21
b = -15

Now, plug the value of 'b' back into equation (3) to find 'a':
a = 8 + (-15)
a = -7

Therefore, the function that fits the data given is:

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we should first understand that this equation is essentially a linear equation of the form:

y = a + bx

where a corresponds to the y-intercept and b corresponds to the slope of the line. To determine the values of a and b, we can use two points from the given data. Let's take the points (20, -307) and (-1, 8) to calculate the slope (b).

Using the slope formula, b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), we have:

b = (8 - (-307)) / (-1 - 20)
b = (8 + 307) / (-21)
b = 315 / (-21)
b = -15

Now that we have the value for b, we can find a by plugging the value of b back into the equation along with one of the points:

Let's use the point (20, -307):

-307 = a + (-15)(20)
-307 = a - 300
a = -307 + 300
a = -7

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

    Given the form you've requested for the function as y = ax^0 + bx^1, and the inputs and outputs provided, we can deduce that ax^0 is a constant term (because x^0 = 1 for all x ≠ 0), and bx^1 is a linear term with respect to x.

The function can be simplified to:

y = a + bx

We must find the appropriate values for a and b that fit the data provided. We can use any two different points to solve for a and b. Let's use the points (20, -307) and (-1, 8).

From the point (20, -307):

-307 = a + 20b ...(1)

From the point (-1, 8):

8 = a - b ...(2)

Now, we solve this system of equations.

Multiplying equation (2) by 20 gives us:

160 = 20a - 20b ...(3)

Add equation (1) to equation (3):

-307 + 160 = a + 20b + 20a - 20b
-147 = 21a
a = -7

    Given the form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we understand that:
- ax^0 is the constant term since x^0 equals 1 for any x that is not 0.
- bx^1 is the linear term since x^1 is just x.

Our goal is to find the constants a and b that best fit the provided input-output pairs. Let's denote the output as y and the input as x.

To solve for the constants a and b, we can use two of the input-output pairs (we can ignore the repeated pair of inputs and outputs for now). Let's take the following two pairs:
1. Input: -1, Output: 8
2. Input: 20, Output: -307

We can create two equations based on the form y = a + bx.

For the first pair (x=-1, y=8):
8 = a + b(-1)
8 = a - b

For the second pair (x=20, y=-307):
-307 = a + b(20)
-307 = a + 20b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:
1. 8 = a - b
2. -307 = a + 20b

This system can be solved using methods such as substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

If we add these two equations, we get:
8 + (-307) = a - b + a + 20b
-299 = 2a + 19b
-299/2 = a + 19b/2

To make it easier, let's solve for a in the first equation and then substitute it into the transformed second equation:
From the first equation:
8 + b = a

Substitute a into the transformed second equation:
-299/2 = (8 + b) + 19b/2
-299/2 = 8 + 21b/2

Now let's multiply every term by 2 to avoid fractions:
-299 = 16 + 21b

Solving for b:
-299 - 16 = 21b
-315 = 21b
b = -315 / 21
b = -15

Now we substitute b back into the first equation to solve for a:

Substituting these into the function gives us:

12 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1

Next, let's use another input-output pair (for example, the pair with input 13):

    To find a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we recognize that ax^0 is simply a (since anything raised to the 0 power equals 1), and bx^1 is bx. So our function will look like this:

y = a + bx

We need to solve for a and b using the given input-output pairs. Let's use two pairs of points to set up a system of linear equations:

For the point (-17, -325):
-325 = a + b(-17)

For the point (16, 269):
269 = a + b(16)

Now we have the system of equations:
1) a - 17b = -325
2) a + 16b = 269

We solve for a and b:

Add the two equations to eliminate a:
a - 17b + a + 16b = -325 + 269
2a - b = -56

Now let's solve for a in terms of b:
2a = b - 56
a = (b - 56) / 2

Now let's substitute a back into one of our original equations (I'll use equation 2) to find b:
a + 16b = 269
((b - 56) / 2) + 16b = 269
Multiply everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
b - 56 + 32b = 538
33b - 56 = 538
33b = 594
b = 18

Substitute b back into the equation for a:
a = (18 - 56) / 2
a = -38 / 2
a = -19

Therefore, our function is:
y = -19 + 18x

To confirm our function works for all given points:

For x = -17: y = -19 + 18(-17) = -19 - 306 = -325
For x = -5: y = -19 + 18(-5) = -19 - 90 = -109
For x = 16: y = -19 + 18(16) = -19 + 288 = 269
For x = -15 (twice): y = -19 + 18(-15) = -19 - 270 = -289

The function y = -19 + 18x appears to satisfy all provided data points.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) in the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can use two of the given input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations. Let's choose the input-output pairs (-5, -109) and (16, 269).

Remembering that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) that isn't zero, we can rewrite the function as \( y = a + bx \).

Given:
For \( x = -5 \), \( y = -109 \), we have: \( -109 = a - 5b \) ...(1)
For \( x = 16 \), \( y = 269 \), we have: \( 269 = a + 16b \) ...(2)

Now we need to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). We can do this by using the elimination or substitution method to solve the system of equations.

Using the substitution method, we will solve equation (1) for \( a \):
\( a = -109 + 5b \) ...(3)

Now we substitute the expression from equation (3) into equation (2):
\( 269 = (-109 + 5b) + 16b \)
\( 269 = -109 + 5b + 16b \)
\( 269 = -109 + 21b \)
\( 269 + 109 = 21b \)
\( 378 = 21b \)
\( b = 378 / 21 \)
\( b = 18 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can find \( a \) by substituting \( b \) back into equation (3):
\( a = -109 + 5 (18) \)
\( a = -109 + 90 \)
\( a = -19 \)

So, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is \( y = -19 + 18x \), or in the exact form requested:

    To find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) that define the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), let's examine the given input-output pairs:

1. For input -17: \(-325 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)\)
2. For input -5: \(-109 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)\)
3. For input 16: \(269 = a(16)^0 + b(16)\)
4. For input -15: \(-289 = a(-15)^0 + b(-15)\)

Given that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \neq 0 \), we can simplify the equations to:

1. \(-325 = a - 17b\)
2. \(-109 = a - 5b\)
3. \(269 = a + 16b\)
4. \(-289 = a - 15b\)

Two of the equations with the same \( x \) values (inputs -15) produce the same output, so they confirm each other but do not provide new information. We only need two unique equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \) since we have two unknowns. Let's use equations 2 and 3 to solve the system:

From equation 2: \(-109 = a - 5b\)  
From equation 3: \(269 = a + 16b\)

By adding both equations, we eliminate \( a \):

\(269 - 109 = a + 16b - (a - 5b)\)  
\(160 = 21b\)  
\(b = \frac{160}{21}\)  
\(b \approx 7.619\)

Now, we can use the value of \( b \) to solve for \( a \) using either of the two equations:

\(-109 = a - 5(7.619)\)  
\(-109 = a - 38.095\)  
\(a = -109 + 38.095\)  
\(a \approx -70.905\)

Given that we usually want the coefficients in simplest form (either as integers or simplified fractions), let's use the exact fractions to calculate:

\( b = \frac{160}{21} \)

Substituting \( b \) into equation 2:

\( -109 = a - 5(\frac{160}{21}) \)  
\( a = -109 + \frac{800}{21} \)  
\( a = -109 + 38 \frac{2}{21} \)  
\( a = -70 \frac{19}{21} \)

So the function in exact terms would be:

\( y = a + bx \)  
\( y = (-70 \frac{19}{21}) + (\frac{160}{21})x \)

However, I approximated these values to the nearest thousandth in the equations above for simplicity. It's important to use the exact values for formal purposes. Let's rewrite the function using the exact values:

Function: \( y = (-70 \frac{19}{21}) + (\frac{160}{21})x \)

\( y = (-70 \frac{19}{21}) + (\frac{160}{21})(-12) \)

First, we convert the mixed number to an improper fraction to make the calculation easier:

\( -70 \frac{19}{21} = -\frac{1489}{21} \)

Now we can continue with the calculation:

\( y = -\frac{1489}{21} + (\frac{160}{21})(-12) \)

\( y = -\frac{1489}{21} - \frac{1920}{21} \)

\( y = -\frac{1489 + 1920}{21} \)

\( y = -\frac{3409}{21} \)

We can use two pairs of input-output to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use input-output pairs (10, 142) and (-10, -158). We have:

\[ 142 = a + b \cdot 10 \]
\[ -158 = a + b \cdot (-10) \]

Let's solve these two equations for \( a \) and \( b \).

Equation (1):

\[ 142 = 10b + a \]

Equation (2):

\[ -158 = -10b + a \]

Adding Equation (1) and Equation (2) to eliminate \( a \) we get:

\[ 142 - 158 = 10b - 10b + a + a \]
\[ -16 = 2a \]
\[ a = -16 / 2 \]
\[ a = -8 \]

Now we can substitute \( a \) back into either equation to solve for \( b \). We'll use Equation (1):

\[ 142 = 10b - 8 \]
\[ 150 = 10b \]
\[ b = 150 / 10 \]

    To find a function that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we essentially need to find a linear function of x because ax^0 is a constant (since any number to the power of zero is 1) and bx^1 is simply bx. Therefore, we're looking for a function of the form:

y = a + bx

Using the points (10, 142) and (-10, -158):

1. For x = 10, y = 142:
   142 = a + b(10)

2. For x = -10, y = -158:
   -158 = a + b(-10)

Let's solve the system of linear equations:

Equation 1: 142 = a + 10b
Equation 2: -158 = a - 10b

Let's add Equation 2 to Equation 1:

(142) + (-158) = (a) + (a) + (10b) - (10b)
-16 = 2a

Divide both sides by 2 to find a:

a = -16 / 2
a = -8

Now we need to find b using a in one of the original equations. Let's use Equation 1:

142 = a + 10b
142 = -8 + 10b

Adding 8 to both sides to solve for b:

150 = 10b

Divide both sides by 10:

b = 150 / 10
b = 15

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the provided input-output pairs, we translate this form into a linear function y = b * x + a, because x^0 is always 1 and x^1 is simply x.

We have several pairs of data points, but we will only need two to determine the values of a and b for a linear function. I'll choose the pairs (-1, -8) and (5, 76) to solve for a and b.

We can set up two equations based on the two chosen data points:

For the input -1 and output -8:
-8 = b*(-1) + a (1)
-8 = -b + a

For the input 5 and output 76:
76 = b*5 + a (2)
76 = 5b + a

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Let's multiply equation (1) by 5, to facilitate the elimination method:
(1) -8 = -b + a becomes -40 = -5b + 5a

We can now add this equation to equation (2):
(-40 = -5b + 5a)
+(76 = 5b + a)
-----------------
36 = 6a

From this, we find that:
a = 36 / 6
a = 6

Now we replace a with 6 in one of the original equations to solve for b, let's use equation (1):
-8 = -b + a
-8 = -b + 6
b = 6 - (-8)
b = 6 + 8
b = 14

Therefore, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the data points given is:
y = 6x^0 + 14x^1
Which simplifies to:
y = 6 + 14x

So the output for the input -6 is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients `a` and `b` for the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1, we can use two of the given input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations. Let's use the inputs -1 and 5 with their corresponding outputs -8 and 76.

For the input -1 and output -8:
-8 = a + b(-1) -> Equation 1

For the input 5 and output 76:
76 = a + b(5) -> Equation 2

Now, we will solve the system of linear equations:

From Equation 1:
a = b - 8

Substitute a from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
76 = (b - 8) + 5b
76 = 6b - 8
84 = 6b
b = 14

Now, use b to find a using Equation 1:
a = 14 - 8
a = 6

y = 6 + 14x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) that best fit the given input-output pairs. In this form, \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \(a\) because any number to the power of zero equals 1.

Given the points (1, 2), (-19, 122), (17, -94), (15, -82), and (-6, 44), the goal is to figure out constants \(a\) and \(b\) such that \( y = a + bx \) fits the data.

We will derive this step-by-step:

From the given data points:

When \( x = 1 \), \( y = 2 \) which gives \( a + b(1) = 2 \) or \( a + b = 2 \) (Equation 1)
When \( x = -19 \), \( y = 122 \) which gives \( a + b(-19) = 122 \) or \( a - 19b = 122 \) (Equation 2)
When \( x = 17 \), \( y = -94 \) which gives \( a + b(17) = -94 \) or \( a + 17b = -94 \) (Equation 3)
When \( x = 15 \), \( y = -82 \) which gives \( a + b(15) = -82 \) or \( a + 15b = -82 \) (Equation 4)
When \( x = -6 \), \( y = 44 \) which gives \( a + b(-6) = 44 \) or \( a - 6b = 44 \) (Equation 5)

To simplify the calculation, I’ll just use two equation pairs to solve the system since more than two would be redundant due to the linear nature of the equation. I will use Equation 1 and Equation 2:

From Equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \)
From Equation 2: \( a - 19b = 122 \)

Now, we solve this system of linear equations simultaneously.

Adding the two equations:

\( (a + b) + (a - 19b) = 2 + 122 \)
\( 2a - 18b = 124 \)
\( a - 9b = 62 \) ... (Equation 6)

And subtracting the second equation from the first one:

\( (a + b) - (a - 19b) = 2 - 122 \)
\( 20b = -120 \)
\( b = -6 \)

Substituting \( b = -6 \) back into Equation 1:

\( a + b = 2 \)
\( a - 6 = 2 \)
\( a = 8 \)

So our function that describes the data is:

\( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \)
\( y = 8x^0 - 6x^1 \)
\( y = 8 - 6x \)

    To create a function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), and since we have to express it in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, first we can simplify that expression by recognizing that x^0 is always 1 (for all x ≠ 0) and x^1 is just x. Therefore, the simplified form of the function is:

y = a + bx

Where 'a' is the y-intercept of the function, representing where the line crosses the y-axis, and 'b' is the slope of the line that represents the rate of change of 'y' with respect to 'x'.

Given that the relationship between x and y is probably linear because of the form provided, we can plug in two of our points to form a system of linear equations and solve for 'a' and 'b'.

Let's select the (x, y) pairs (1, 2) and (-19, 122) to use in our equations. Hence, we will substitute and get two equations:

1. If x=1, then y=2, which gives us:
2 = a + b * 1
2 = a + b

2. If x=-19, then y=122, which gives us:
122 = a + b * (-19)
122 = a - 19b

We can solve this system of equations using methods such as substitution or elimination. We can solve equation 1 for 'a':

a = 2 - b

Substitute ‘a’ into equation 2:

122 = (2 - b) - 19b
122 = 2 - 20b
120 = -20b
b = -6

Then we can substitute the value of 'b' into equation 1 to find 'a':

a = 2 - (-6)
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

So the linear function that fits the form y = a + bx based on the points given is:

y = 8 - 6x

    To determine the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we have two constants a and b to solve for. Since \( x^0 \) is always equal to 1, the term \( ax^0 \) simplifies to a, and \( bx^1 \) simplifies to bx. So the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We need to find a and b such that this linear equation fits the given data points. We can set up a system of linear equations using two data points to solve for a and b. Let's take the first two data points for this purpose:

1) For Input: 1, Output: 2,
we get the equation \( 2 = a + b(1) \) or \( a + b = 2 \).

2) For Input: -19, Output: 122,
we get the equation \( 122 = a + b(-19) \) or \( a - 19b = 122 \).

Now we have a system of two equations:
a + b = 2
a − 19b = 122

We can solve this system of equations using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix methods. Let's use the elimination method by subtracting the second equation from the first one to eliminate a:

(a + b) − (a − 19b) = 2 − 122
a + b − a + 19b = −120
20b = −120
b = −120 / 20
b = −6

Now plug the value of b back into one of the equations to solve for a. Using the first equation \( a + b = 2 \):

a − 6 = 2
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

So the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is \( y = 8 − 6x \).

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the coefficients a and b such that the function correctly maps the inputs to the outputs given. 

Let's analyze the given data:

For the input x = 1, the output y = 2, so:
2 = a(1)^0 + b(1)^1
2 = a + b

For the input x = -19, the output y = 122, so:
122 = a(-19)^0 + b(-19)^1
122 = a - 19b

And for any linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify ax^0 to just a, because any number to the power of 0 is 1. So we can rewrite the function as y = a + bx without altering its meaning.

Now, let's use two of the given points to solve for a and b. It is a system of linear equations problem:

1. For x = 1 and y = 2:
2 = a + 1 * b
2 = a + b

2. For x = 15 and y = -82:
-82 = a + 15 * b
-82 = a + 15b

These two equations can be solved simultaneously to find the values of a and b:

First, we can subtract the first equation from the second:

-82 - 2 = (a+15b) - (a+b)
-84 = 14b
b = -6

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into the first equation to solve for a:

2 = a + (-6)
a = 8

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can note that ax^0 is equivalent to a since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, and bx^1 is equivalent to bx as any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself. So the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can form equations to find the values of a and b:

For input 1 and output 2:
2 = a + b(1) => 2 = a + b

For input -19 and output 122:
122 = a + b(-19) => 122 = a - 19b

And so on for other pairs. However, we only need two different pairs to solve for the two unknowns, a and b.

Using the first equation (2 = a + b) and the second (122 = a - 19b), we can solve for a and b:

From the first equation:
a = 2 - b

Substituting a into the second equation:
122 = (2 - b) - 19b

    To write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the values of 'a' and 'b' that fit the given input-output pairs.

Notice that the term ax^0 is a constant term because x^0 is always 1 for any x except for x = 0. Thus, ax^0 is 'a'. The term bx^1 is simply bx since x^1 is x.

So we are looking for a function:

y = a + bx

By examining the given input-output pairs, we can establish a pattern for 'b' by determining the change in output per unit change in input.

Let's calculate 'b' using the two closest inputs -16 and -17 and their corresponding outputs -275 and -292:

b = (output at x=-16 - output at x=-17) / (x=-16 - x=-17)
b = (-275 - (-292)) / (-16 - (-17))
b = (292 - 275) / (1)
b = 17 / 1
b = 17

Now let's calculate 'a' by plugging in one of the input-output pairs into the equation y = a + bx. Let's use the input x = 1 and output y = 14:

We can use two points to solve for a and b. Let's take the last two points:

1) For the input x = -17, the output y = -292.
2) For the input x = 1, the output y = 14.

This gives us two equations:

1) a - 17b = -292
2) a + 1b = 14

We can solve this linear system for a and b.

(-17b - b) = (-292 - 14)

Let's pick the points (-17, -292) and (1, 14) for this purpose. Plugging these into the equation gives us two simultaneous equations:

1. -292 = a - 17b
2. 14 = a + b

Let's solve these equations using the method of substitution or elimination. I'll use the elimination method:

We'll first rearrange the equations to line up the variables:

(-17b) + a = -292     (equation 1)
b + a = 14             (equation 2)

Now, add the two equations together to eliminate a:

(-17b + b) + (a + a) = -292 + 14
-16b + 2a = -278
8b - a = 139

Now, we can multiply equation 2 by 2, and then subtract it from the new equation we have derived:

2*(b + a) = 2*14
2b + 2a = 28

Subtract this from 8b - a = 139:

8b - a - (2b + 2a) = 139 - 28
8b - a - 2b - 2a = 111
6b - 3a = 111

The linear function can be written as:

\[ a + b(-17) = -292 \]
\[ -17b + a = -292 \] ......(1)

From the second pair (1, 14):
\[ a + b(1) = 14 \]
\[ b + a = 14 \] ......(2)

Now let's solve this system of equations. We can use the method of substitution or elimination. We’ll use the elimination method here.

Multiplying equation (2) by 17, we get:

3. For x = -16, y = -275
4. For x = -18, y = -309
5. For x = 1, y = 14

Let's look for the slope 'b' first by checking the change in output with respect to a change in input. Since we have more than two points, we can calculate the slope using any two points and verify if it remains constant across other points.

Using (x1, y1) = (-17, -292) and (x2, y2) = (-16, -275):
b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (-275 - (-292)) / (-16 - (-17)) = (17 / 1) = 17

Now, let's test this slope with another pair of points to confirm if it's the same across all provided inputs:
Using (x1, y1) = (-16, -275) and (x2, y2) = (-6, -105):
b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (-105 - (-275)) / (-6 - (-16)) = (170 / 10) = 17

Slope 'b' appears to remain consistent at a value of 17.

For x = -7 and y = 130:
130 = a + b(-7)

For x = 14 and y = -290:
-290 = a + b(14)

Now let's solve this system of equations. We can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination here.

Multiply the first equation by 2 to help eliminate the term 'a' when we add it to the second equation.

2 * (130 = a - 7b)  --> 260 = 2a - 14b
(Add equation 2 here)  --> -290 = a + 14b
----------------------------------------
(Total)                  -30 = 3a

Now we can solve for 'a' by dividing both sides by 3.

-30 / 3 = a
a = -10

With 'a' found, let's plug it into one of the original equations to solve for 'b'. Let's use the first equation:

130 = -10 - 7b
140 = -7b
b = 140 / -7
b = -20

Now that we have both a and b, we can write the function:

y = -10 + (-20)x
or simply
y = -10 - 20x

Therefore, the function in the exact form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = -10x^0 - 20x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The provided inputs and outputs suggest a linear relationship between \( x \) and \( y \). In other words, \( y \) is a linear function of \( x \), which can be described by the equation:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]
\[ y = a + bx \]

where \( a \) is the y-intercept and \( b \) is the slope of the line. To determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \), we can set up a system of equations using any two distinct pairs of inputs and outputs.

Let's use the first and the second pair:

For input -7 (output 130): \( 130 = a - 7b \) (1)
For input 14 (output -290): \( -290 = a + 14b \) (2)

We can solve this system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \):

Multiply equation (1) by 2 to eliminate \( a \) when we add the equations together:
\[ 260 = 2a - 14b \] (3)

Now add equation (2) to equation (3): 
\[ -290 + 260 = (a + 2a) + (14b - 14b) \]
\[ -30 = 3a \]

Divide by 3:
\[ a = -10 \]

Now let's substitute \( a \) back into equation (1) to find \( b \):
\[ 130 = -10 - 7b \]
\[ 140 = -7b \]
\[ b = -20 \]

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
\[ y = -10 - 20x \]

Or, to make it in the exact required form:
\[ y = -10 \cdot x^0 - 20 \cdot x^1 \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we're essentially looking for a linear equation in the form:

y = b * x + a

where ""b"" is the slope of the line and ""a"" is the y-intercept (the value of y when x is zero).

To determine the slope ""b"", we can use any two points from the input/output pairs provided. Let's use the first and the second pairs for simplicity:

Input/Output 1: (-7, 130)
Input/Output 2: (14, -290)

The slope (b) can be calculated as:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-290 - 130) / (14 - (-7))
b = (-420) / (21)
b = -20

Now that we have the slope, we can solve for ""a"", the y-intercept, using one of the original points. We'll use the first pair (-7, 130) for this calculation:

130 = -20 * (-7) + a
130 = 140 + a
a = 130 - 140
a = -10

So our function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 would be:

y = -10x^0 - 20x^1

Which simplifies to:

y = -10 - 20x

This function should describe the given input/output pairs. To check, we can substitute the input values from the pairs into our function:

For input -7:
y = -10 - 20(-7) = 130 (which matches the output for the input -7)

For input 14:
y = -10 - 20(14) = -10 - 280 = -290 (which matches the output for the input 14)

And so on for the rest of the inputs. This confirms that our derived function captures the relationship between the inputs and the outputs provided.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and the outputs, we first need to understand that ax^0 is just a constant term because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, ax^0 = a. The second term, bx^1, can be simplified to bx because any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself. 

So we're looking for a function y = a + bx.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can substitute the input values into x and the output values into y to obtain a system of equations. Since we have more than two points and we are seeking a linear relationship, we can use two points to determine our coefficients. Still, let's quickly check if the given pairs follow a linear trend:

Using the first pair (-7, 130):
130 = a + b(-7)

Using the second pair (14, -290):
-290 = a + b(14)

We now have a system of equations:
1) 130 = a - 7b
2) -290 = a + 14b

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination in this case:

Multiply equation 1) by 2 so that when added to equation 2), the a terms cancel out:
2 * (130) = 2a - 14b
260 = 2a - 14b
-290 = a + 14b

Now add this equation to equation 2):
260 = 2a - 14b
-290 = a + 14b
----------------
-30 = 3a

Solve for a:
a = -30 / 3
a = -10

Now, we can substitute a back into one of the equations to solve for b. Let's use equation 1):
130 = -10 - 7b

Solve for b:
7b = -10 - 130
7b = -140
b = -140 / 7
b = -20

Our function that best describes the data based on the given inputs and outputs is then:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we must determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Given that the form is essentially \( y = a + bx \) (since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \neq 0 \)), we can use two data points to solve for a and b.

Let's use the following two data points:

1. Input: -7, Output: 130, which gives us the equation \( 130 = a - 7b \).
2. Input: 14, Output: -290, which gives us the equation \( -290 = a + 14b \).

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( 130 = a - 7b \)
2. \( -290 = a + 14b \)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. I'll use elimination:

First, multiply both sides of the first equation by 2 to align the terms with the second equation's 'b' coefficient:

\( 260 = 2a - 14b \)

Now we add this new equation to the second equation:

\( (260 = 2a - 14b) \)
\(+\)
\( (-290 = a + 14b) \)

\( -30 = 3a \)

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( a \):
\( a = -10 \)

Now let's substitute \( a \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( b \), using the first equation:

\( 130 = -10 - 7b \)
\( 140 = -7b \)

Divide both sides by -7 to solve for \( b \):
\( b = -20 \)

Thus, we have found \( a \) and \( b \):

\( a = -10 \)
\( b = -20 \)

So, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we actually look for a simple linear equation of the form:

y = b * x + a

Where:
- b is the coefficient for the term with x (since x^1 is simply x).
- a is the constant term (since x^0 is 1).

The two data points (2, 15) and (7, 50) can be used to determine the coefficients a and b as follows:

For the input x = 2 and output y = 15:
15 = b * 2 + a

For the input x = 7 and output y = 50:
50 = b * 7 + a

We now have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of a and b.

First, rearrange the equations to better visualize them:

2b + a = 15
7b + a = 50

Now, subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

(7b + a) - (2b + a) = 50 - 15
7b - 2b = 35
5b = 35
b = 35 / 5
b = 7

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into one of the equations to find a. Let's use the first equation:

2b + a = 15
2*7 + a = 15
14 + a = 15
a = 15 - 14
a = 1

Therefore, the function that fits the given data points is:

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to solve for 'a' and 'b' using the given input-output pairs (-14, -97) and (2, 15). Here, ax^0 is a constant (since x^0 is 1 for any x not equal to zero), and bx^1 is a linear term.

Let's take the input-output pair (2, 15) to solve for 'a' and 'b':

15 = a(2^0) + b(2^1)
15 = a * 1 + 2b
15 = a + 2b

Now we take another input-output pair (-14, -97) to solve for 'a' and 'b':

-97 = a(-14^0) + b(-14^1)
-97 = a * 1 - 14b
-97 = a - 14b

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. From the first equation, we express 'a' in terms of 'b':

a = 15 - 2b

Now let's substitute this value of 'a' into the second equation:

-97 = (15 - 2b) - 14b
-97 = 15 - 16b

Solving for 'b', we get:

-97 - 15 = -16b
-112 = -16b
b = 7

Now that we have 'b', we can find 'a':

a = 15 - 2b
a = 15 - 2(7)
a = 15 - 14

\[ y = a + bx \]

From the two identical points (-14, -97), we can form one equation:

\[ -97 = a - 14b \]

From the point (2, 15), we can form another equation:

\[ 15 = a + 2b \]

Now we have a system of equations:

\[ -97 = a - 14b \]
\[ 15 = a + 2b \]

We can solve for both \(a\) and \(b\) using these equations. First, let's subtract the second equation from the first one to eliminate \(a\):

Adding equations 1) and 2) to eliminate a:

2a - 7b = -47

Dividing by 2:

a - (7/2)b = -47/2

Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to solve for b:
(-26) - (-14) = (a - a) + (5b - b)
-12 = 4b
b = -3

Now, substitute b = -3 into one of the original equations to solve for a. Using Equation 2:
-14 = a + 1(-3)
-14 = a - 3
a = -14 + 3
a = -11

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
Output: y = -11 + (-3)x
Or more simply: y = -11 - 3x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) in the form of the function `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we can see that `ax^0` simplifies to `a` (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), and `bx^1` simplifies to `bx` (since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself). Therefore, the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1` is equivalent to `y = a + bx`.

The provided data pairs are:

(5, -26)
(1, -14)
(-14, 31)
(-5, 4)
(-8, 13)

To find `a` and `b`, we can set up two equations using two data pairs and solve for `a` and `b`.

Let's use the pairs (1, -14) and (5, -26):

For the input 1:
-14 = a + b(1) -> Equation 1

For the input 5:
-26 = a + b(5) -> Equation 2

Now let's solve these equations simultaneously. Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(-26) - (-14) = (a + 5b) - (a + b)
-26 + 14 = 5b - b
-12 = 4b
b = -12 / 4
b = -3

Now we have the value for `b`, plug it into Equation 1 to find `a`:

-14 = a + (-3)(1)
-14 = a - 3
a = -14 + 3
a = -11

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = -11 + (-3)x

    To find the relationship in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b.

Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can rewrite it as y = a + bx because x^0 is always 1 for any x different from zero. Now let's use two of the given points to set up a system of linear equations to solve for a and b.

Using the points (1, -14) and (-14, 31):

1. For the input 1 and output -14:
-14 = a + b(1)
-14 = a + b

2. For the input -14 and output 31:
31 = a + b(-14)
31 = a - 14b

Now we can solve this system of equations for a and b. Let's use the substitution or elimination method. I'll choose the elimination method to solve for a and b.

Adding the two equations:
-14 + 31 = a + b + a - 14b
17 = 2a - 13b

Divide by 2:
17/2 = a - 13b/2

Express a in terms of b:
a = 17/2 + 13b/2
a = (17 + 13b)/2

Now let's substitute this expression for a back into one of our original equations. I'll use -14 = a + b.

-14 = (17 + 13b)/2 + b
-28 = 17 + 13b + 2b
-28 = 17 + 15b

Subtract 17 from both sides:
-45 = 15b

Divide by 15:
b = -3

Now that we know b = -3, let's find a using the equation a = (17 + 13b)/2.

a = (17 + 13(-3))/2
a = (17 - 39)/2
a = -22/2
a = -11

Now we have both coefficients:
a = -11
b = -3

So the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:
y = -11x^0 + (-3)x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to use the given input-output pairs to determine the coefficients `a` and `b`.

The term `ax^0` is equivalent to `a`, since `x^0` is always 1 for any x that is not zero. The term `bx^1` simplifies to `bx`. Therefore, the function looks like:

y = a + bx

Now, let's use two points to find `a` and `b`. For simplicity, I'll use the following two points:

(-9, 64) and (9, -62)

Substituting the first point into the equation, we get:

64 = a + b(-9)
64 = a - 9b ---- (1)

Now using the second point:

-62 = a + b(9)
-62 = a + 9b ---- (2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns. We can solve this system to find the values of `a` and `b`.

Adding equation (1) and equation (2) to eliminate `b`, we get:

64 + (-62) = a - 9b + a + 9b
2 = 2a
a = 2/2
a = 1

Now that we have found `a`, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find `b`. Let's use equation (1):

64 = 1 - 9b
63 = -9b
b = -63/9
b = -7

Let's use two of the input-output pairs to create equations:

1. Using the input -9 and output 64:
\(64 = a + b(-9)\)
\(64 = a - 9b\)

2. Using the input -3 and output 22:
\(22 = a + b(-3)\)
\(22 = a - 3b\)

Now, we have a system of two equations:
\(a - 9b = 64\) (1)
\(a - 3b = 22\) (2)

We can solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Subtract equation (2) from (1):
\(a - 9b - (a - 3b) = 64 - 22\)
\(a - 9b - a + 3b = 42\)
\(-6b = 42\)

Solve for \(b\):
\(b = -7\)

Now, we can substitute the value of \(b\) back into equation (2) to find \(a\):
\(a - 3(-7) = 22\)
\(a + 21 = 22\)
\(a = 22 - 21\)
\(a = 1\)

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b that will fit the data. The term ax^0 is simply a, because anything raised to the zero power is 1. The term bx^1 is simply bx, because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself. Therefore, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have a system of equations based on the inputs and outputs provided:

1. a + b(-9) = 64
2. a + b(-3) = 22
3. a + b(9) = -62
4. a + b(-5) = 36

To solve for a and b, we can use any two of these equations. Let's use for convenience the first two equations:

a - 9b = 64 (1)
a - 3b = 22 (2)

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to solve for b:

( a - 9b) - (a - 3b) = 64 - 22
a - 9b - a + 3b = 42
-6b = 42
b = 42 / -6
b = -7

So, our function will look like this: y = a + bx.

Let's use the first two equations to create our system (although in practice, one should check if additional pairs yield the same solution, ensuring consistency across all pairs):

1) 64 = a - 9b
2) 22 = a - 3b

Solving the system of equations, we'll first isolate 'a' from the second equation:

For the input -3:

Thus, we need to find the constants \( a \) and \( b \) such that:

Given two points, we can find a and b. However, since we have five points, we need to check if they lie on the same line. If they do not, we can't fit a perfect linear function in the form \( y = a + bx \), but we can still find a best-fit line if the function is meant to be an approximation. For simplicity, let's use two points to calculate \( a \) and \( b \), and then check if the line fits the other points.

Let's use the first two points (-20, 265) and (-15, 195):

For the first point:
\( 265 = a - 20b \)

For the second point:

We can solve these two equations as a linear system:

From the first equation:

Plugging this value of \( a \) into the second equation:
\( 195 = 265 + 20b - 15b \)

    To find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) for the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to understand that \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any \( x \) that isn't zero, making \( a \) a constant that represents the y-intercept and \( b \) the slope of the function.

Given that the function must be linear because it is of first order \( (bx^1) \) and has a constant term \( (ax^0) \), we can use two points from the given data to find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). For convenience, let's use the points \( (-20, 265) \) and \( (6, -99) \).

The general form of a linear equation is \( y = mx + c \), which matches the form we're using \( (y = ax^0 + bx^1) \), where \( a = c \) (the y-intercept) and \( b = m \) (the slope).

To find the slope \( b \):

\[ b = \frac{-99 - 265}{6 - (-20)} \]
\[ b = \frac{-364}{26} \]

However, since this system appears to be overdetermined (we have more equations than unknowns), a perfect solution may not exist, and we would typically use a method like least squares to approximate the best fit.

Unfortunately, as a pattern recognition system, I cannot perform these calculations dynamically or provide an exact solution without computing capabilities. Nevertheless, I can give you a method to solve it:

1. Set up the system of linear equations based on the given data points, where y = a + bx for each point:

   a - 15b = 195    (from input -15)

   a - 10b = 125    (from input -10)
   a + 6b = -99     (from input 6)

2. Use linear regression techniques to estimate a and b. This typically involves calculating the mean of the x values and the y values, the product of the x and y values, and the square of the x values. The formulas for b and a in terms of these means are:

   b = [N(Σxy) - (Σx)(Σy)] / [N(Σx^2) - (Σx)^2]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) such that our equation can correctly map the given inputs to their corresponding outputs.

Recall that \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any \( x \) that is not 0 and the term \( ax^0 \) is therefore equivalent to \( a \). Also, \( bx^1 \) is simply \( bx \). So the relationship we are looking for can be simplified to:

\( y = a + bx \).

Given the input/output pairs, we can form a system of linear equations:

1. For Input -20: \( 265 = a - 20b \)
2. For Input -15: \( 195 = a - 15b \)
3. For Input -5: \( 55 = a - 5b \)
4. For Input -10: \( 125 = a - 10b \)
5. For Input 6: \( -99 = a + 6b \)

To solve for \( a \) and \( b \), we can use any two equations to form a linear system. Let's use the equations for Input -20 and Input 6 to set up our system:

\( 265 = a - 20b \)         (1)
\( -99 = a + 6b \)         (2)

Now we solve this system of equations.

Adding (1) and (2) to eliminate \( a \), we get:
\( 265 - 99 = a - 20b + a + 6b \)
\( 166 = 2a - 14b \)
\( 83 = a - 7b \)          (3)

Now we can express \( a \) from (3) as:
\( a = 83 + 7b \)

Substituting \( a \) back into (2), we get:
\( -99 = (83 + 7b) + 6b \)
\( -99 = 83 + 13b \)
\( -99 - 83 = 13b \)
\( -182 = 13b \)
\( b = -182 / 13 \)
\( b = -14 \)

Now we can find \( a \) using the value of \( b \) and equation (3):
\( a = 83 + 7(-14) \)
\( a = 83 - 98 \)
\( a = -15 \)

So, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and the outputs is:

\( y = -15 + (-14)x \)

\( y = -15 - 14x \)

\( y = -15 + 238 \)
\( y = 223 \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the coefficients `a` and `b` for the function `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we can form a system of linear equations using the given input-output pairs. However, noticing the pattern in these pairs, we see that when the input `x` is 4, the output `y` is always 2. This suggests that there's a direct linear relationship without a constant term, because `ax^0` is a constant term and if it were not 0, we would not expect the same output for duplicate inputs (unless the linear term `bx^1` cancels it out exactly, which is less likely).

Let's confirm this by using two pairs of input-output points to create two equations:

1. Using Input: -10, Output: -54, we get:
-54 = a*(-10)^0 + b*(-10)^1
-54 = a - 10b

2. Using Input: -4, Output: -30, we get:
-30 = a*(-4)^0 + b*(-4)^1
-30 = a - 4b

Now, we can solve these two equations to find `a` and `b`. Let's denote the first equation as (i) and the second one as (ii):

(i)   a - 10b = -54
(ii)  a - 4b = -30

Subtract (ii) from (i) to eliminate `a`:

(i) - (ii): (-10b) - (-4b) = -54 - (-30)
-6b = -24

Now, solving for `b`:
b = -24 / -6
b = 4

Using `b` to solve for `a` with equation (ii):

a - 4b = -30
a - 4*4 = -30
a - 16 = -30
a = -30 + 16
a = -14

So, the function is:

y = -14x^0 + 4x^1
y = -14 + 4x

This function should be validated against all the provided data points to confirm if it accurately captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Let's do that:

For Input: -10,
y = -14 + 4*(-10) = -14 - 40 = -54 (matches the output)

For Input: 4,
y = -14 + 4*4 = -14 + 16 = 2 (matches the output)

For Input: -20,
y = -14 + 4*(-20) = -14 - 80 = -94 (matches the output)

For Input: 4 (repeated),
y = -14 + 4*4 = -14 + 16 = 2 (matches the output)

For Input: -4,
y = -14 + 4*(-4) = -14 - 16 = -30 (matches the output)

With all data points confirming our derived function, we can be confident that the function capturing the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = -14 + 4x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the values of a and b that satisfy the given input-output pairs. Since ax^0 is always equal to a (because any number to the power of zero is 1), we can simplify the function as y = a + bx.

Let's set up a system of equations using the given input-output pairs to solve for a and b:

1. For input -10 (x = -10), output is -54: 
   a + b(-10) = -54 

2. For input 4 (x = 4), output is 2: 
   a + b(4) = 2 

We can use pairs (1) and (2) to set up the system since they have unique input values.

Rearranging the equations we get:

1. -10b + a = -54 
2. 4b + a = 2 

To solve the system, subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

(-10b + a) - (4b + a) = -54 - 2
-10b + a - 4b - a = -56
-14b = -56

Divide both sides by -14 to find b:

b = -56 / -14
b = 4

Now we substitute the value of b into one of the original equations to find a:

4b + a = 2
4(4) + a = 2
16 + a = 2
a = 2 - 16
a = -14

Now we have found a and b:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Given the data points:

1. Input: -10 Output: -54 \( \Rightarrow \) -54 = a + b(-10) \( \Rightarrow \) a - 10b = -54
2. Input: 4 Output: 2 \( \Rightarrow \) 2 = a + b(4) \( \Rightarrow \) a + 4b = 2

5. Input: -4 Output: -30 \( \Rightarrow \) -30 = a + b(-4) \( \Rightarrow \) a - 4b = -30

Now, looking at the points, we can use any two to calculate \( a \) and \( b \). Points 1 and 2 look convenient for this purpose:

For point 1: a - 10b = -54
For point 2: a + 4b = 2

Now, let's solve this system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).

First, we can add the two equations together:

\( (a - 10b) + (a + 4b) = -54 + 2 \)

\( 2a - 6b = -52 \)

\( a - 3b = -26 \) (Equation 3)

Now, let's subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:

\( (a - 3b) - (a + 4b) = -26 - 2 \)

\( -7b = -28 \)

\( b = 4 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can substitute it back into Equation 2 to solve for \( a \):

a + 4(4) = 2

a + 16 = 2

a = 2 - 16

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the data, we first recognize that ax^0 is a constant term (since x^0 is always 1), and bx^1 is a linear term (since x^1 is x). Essentially, the equation we're looking for is a standard linear equation y = a + bx, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope.

Let's examine the given points to determine a and b:

Since ax^0 is simply a (because x^0 equals 1 for any non-zero x), the function simplifies to y = a + bx. Now let's use two input-output pairs to solve for a and b.

Let's use the pairs (-10, -54) and (4, 2):

1. For input -10 and output -54:
-54 = a + b(-10)

2. For input 4 and output 2:
2 = a + b(4)

Now we have a system of linear equations:
-54 = a - 10b
2 = a + 4b

Let's solve this system for a and b. We can use the method of substitution or elimination. We'll use the elimination method here:

First, we can multiply the second equation by 2.5 (to add it to the first equation and eliminate a):

2.5(2) = 2.5(a + 4b)
5 = 2.5a + 10b

Now, add this equation to the first:

-54 + 5 = a - 10b + 2.5a + 10b
-49 = 3.5a

Divide both sides by 3.5:

a = -49 / 3.5
a = -14

Since we are given a set of points, we can calculate the slope (b) using any two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) from the dataset:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the values of a and b that fit the provided data points. The term ax^0 is just a since anything to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have the following pairs of inputs and outputs that we can use to find a and b:

1. For input -11, output -20: -20 = a + b(-11)
2. For input -8, output -14: -14 = a + b(-8)
3. For input -2, output -2: -2 = a + b(-2)
4. For input -7, output -12: -12 = a + b(-7)
5. For input -17, output -32: -32 = a + b(-17)

Looking at the patterns of the inputs and outputs, it appears that the output decreases by 2 as the input increases by 1, suggesting that b is -2. We can confirm this by plugging the value into one of the data points.

Let's verify with the third data point, where input is -2 and output is -2:

-2 = a + b(-2)
-2 = a - 2b

Since we suspect that b is -2:

-2 = a - 2(-2)
-2 = a + 4
a = -2 - 4
a = -6

Now that we have the values for a and b (-6 and -2, respectively), let's plug them into the function:

y = a + bx
y = -6 + (-2)x
y = -6 - 2x

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

Output: y = -6x^0 - 2x^1

However, since x^0 = 1 for any x (except for x = 0), we can simplify the function to:

Output: y = -6 - 2x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first recognize that \( ax^0 \) is equivalent to \( a \) since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) except 0. So, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Given the provided input-output pairs, we can set up the following system of equations:

1. For input -17 (x = -17), output is -310: \( -310 = a + b(-17) \)
2. For input 17 (x = 17), output is 302: \( 302 = a + b(17) \)
3. For input 10 (x = 10), output is 176: \( 176 = a + b(10) \)
4. For input 12 (x = 12), output is 212: \( 212 = a + b(12) \)
5. For input 13 (x = 13), output is 230: \( 230 = a + b(13) \)

We notice immediately that the change from -17 to 17 (a change in 34 units) leads to an increase of 612 (from -310 to 302). So, for each unit change in x, there is an increase of 612 / 34 = 18 in y. Thus, b = 18.

Substitute b = 18 into one of the equations to find a. Using the second equation:

\( 302 = a + 18(17) \)

\( 302 = a + 306 \)

Solve for a:

\( a = 302 - 306 \)

\( a = -4 \)

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 and the data points provided, we can see that the term ax^0 is a constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is a linear term (since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself).

We can use the data points to determine the values of a and b. The most straightforward way would be to choose two data points and solve the resulting system of equations. Let's take the points (10, 176) and (12, 212) and plug them into the equation:

For x = 10, y = 176:
176 = a(10^0) + b(10^1)
176 = a + 10b  --(1)

For x = 12, y = 212:
212 = a(12^0) + b(12^1)
212 = a + 12b  --(2)

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate 'a', we get:
212 - 176 = (a + 12b) - (a + 10b)
36 = 2b => b = 18

Now we use the value of b to find a, using one of the two equations. Let's use equation (1):
176 = a + 10(18)
176 = a + 180
a = 176 - 180
a = -4

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To determine a function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 = 1 \), we need to find the constants \( a \) and \( b \). This is a simple linear equation where \( a \) represents the \( y \)-intercept and \( b \) is the slope of the line.

We can use two data points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's choose the points (10, 176) and (12, 212).

Plugging the first point into the equation \( y = a + bx \) we get:
\( 176 = a + b(10) \) 
This simplifies to:
\( 10b + a = 176 \) (1)

Using the second point (12, 212):
\( 212 = a + b(12) \)
This simplifies to:
\( 12b + a = 212 \) (2)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for \( b \) by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):

\( (12b + a) - (10b + a) = 212 - 176 \)
\( 2b = 36 \)
\( b = 18 \)

Having determined \( b \) we can now solve for \( a \):

\( 10b + a = 176 \)
\( 10(18) + a = 176 \)
\( 180 + a = 176 \)
\( a = 176 - 180 \)

Now, we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \). To do this, we can use the given input-output pairs to create a system of equations, and then solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to form two equations:

1. Using the input-output pair (10, 176):
\[ 176 = a + 10b \]

2. Using the input-output pair (12, 212):
\[ 212 = a + 12b \]

Now we solve the system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \):

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( a \):
\[ (212 - 176) = (a + 12b) - (a + 10b) \]
\[ 36 = 2b \]
\[ b = 18 \]

Next, plug the value of \( b \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( a \):

\[ 176 = a + 180 \]
\[ a = 176 - 180 \]

    Given that the function is in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, and assuming it follows a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can understand that ax^0 is a constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is the linear term since x to the power of 1 is simply x.

To determine the coefficients a and b in y = ax^0 + bx^1, we would typically need to look for a pattern or solve a system of equations based on the inputs and outputs we've been given. The 'a' term is a constant (since x^0 = 1), and the 'b' term is a slope that multiplies the input x.

Let's examine the inputs and corresponding outputs carefully:

For input -17:
y = a(1) + b(-17) => -310 = a - 17b

For input 17:
y = a(1) + b(17) => 302 = a + 17b

By adding these two equations, we can eliminate 'b' and solve for 'a':

(-310 = a - 17b) + (302 = a + 17b)
-310 + 302 = a - 17b + a + 17b
-8 = 2a
a = -4

Now that we have a, let's substitute it back into one of the equations to solve for b, using the second equation for convenience:

302 = (-4) + 17b
306 = 17b
b = 306 / 17
b = 18

So, the function that represents the relationship between inputs and outputs as best as possible given the information is:

    Given the inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of linear equations to solve for the coefficients `a` and `b` in the function `y = ax^0 + bx^1`. The superscript on `x` denotes the power of `x`, so `x^0` is always 1, and `x^1` is simply `x`.

Let's use two of the given input-output pairs to set up our equations:

For the input -16, output 297:
297 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
297 = a - 16b        (1)

For input 18, output -315:
-315 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1
-315 = a + 18b      (2)

Now we solve this system of two equations with two unknowns:

From (1), we isolate a:
a = 297 + 16b       (3)

Substitute a from (3) into (2):
-315 = (297 + 16b) + 18b
-315 = 297 + 34b
-612 = 34b
b = -612 / 34
b = -18

Now we put the value of b back into equation (3) to find a:
a = 297 + 16(-18)
a = 297 - 288
a = 9

Let's use two distinct input-output pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

Using the input-output pair (-16, 297):
\( 297 = a + b(-16) \) ...(1)

Using the input-output pair (18, -315):
\( -315 = a + b(18) \) ...(2)

Now, we'll solve these two equations simultaneously.

From equation (1):
\( a = 297 + 16b \) ...(3)

Substitute the value of \( a \) from equation (3) into equation (2):
\( -315 = 297 + 16b + 18b \)
\( -315 = 297 + 34b \)
\( b = \frac{-315 - 297}{34} \)
\( b = \frac{-612}{34} \)
\( b = -18 \)

We have two unique inputs and their corresponding outputs to solve for these two constants:

2) When x = 18, y = -315:
   -315 = a + b(18)

We can solve this system of equations for 'a' and 'b'. I'll start by rearranging the first equation to isolate 'a':

1) 297 = a - 16b
   a = 297 + 16b

Now I'll substitute this expression for 'a' into the second equation:

Let's use the pairs (-16, 297) and (18, -315).

For x = -16 and y = 297:
297 = a - 16b

For x = 18 and y = -315:

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

2) -315 = a + 18b

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Let's multiply the first equation by 18 and the second by 16 to eliminate a:

1) 18 * 297 = 18a - 16*18b => 5346 = 18a - 288b
2) 16 * (-315) = 16a + 16*18b => -5040 = 16a + 288b

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To write the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to find the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the given inputs and outputs. The term \( ax^0 \) is essentially \( a \) since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Given that our function is linear because the form \( ax^0 + bx^1 \) represents a line with \( a \) as the y-intercept and \( b \) as the slope, we can find the slope (\( b \)) by considering two points and using the slope formula:

\[ b = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \]

Choosing two data points:

\[ x_1 = -18, y_1 = -265; \]
\[ x_2 = 19, y_2 = 253; \]

\[ \Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = 253 - (-265) = 518; \]
\[ \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 19 - (-18) = 37; \]

\[ b = \frac{518}{37} = 14. \]

Now that we have \( b \), we need to find \( a \). We can substitute \( b \) (which is 14) and one of the points into the linear form to solve for \( a \).

Using the point (6, 71):

\[ 71 = a(6^0) + 14(6^1); \]

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for a and b:

Take the pair (19, 253) and (6, 71):

253 = a + 19b
71 = a + 6b

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

1) a + 19b = 253
2) a + 6b = 71

Subtract equation 2) from equation 1):

( a + 19b) - (a + 6b) = 253 - 71
a + 19b - a - 6b = 182
13b = 182

b = 14

Now we solve for a using the value of b:

a + 6b = 71

    To create the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the coefficients a and b that fit the given input-output pairs. Since ax^0 is always a (because x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0), and bx^1 is simply bx, we're actually looking for a linear function in the form y = a + bx.

Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to determine a and b:

Using Input: -18 and Output: -265, we have -265 = a + b(-18).
Using Input: 19 and Output: 253, we have 253 = a + b(19).

From these two equations, we can create a system of linear equations:

1) a - 18b = -265
2) a + 19b = 253

To solve for a and b, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a:

(2) - (1) <=> (a + 19b) - (a - 18b) = 253 - (-265)
             <=> a + 19b - a + 18b = 253 + 265
             <=> 37b = 518
             <=> b = 518 / 37
             <=> b = 14

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find a. Let's use equation (1):

a - 18b = -265
a - 18(14) = -265
a - 252 = -265
a = -265 + 252
a = -13

Now we know that a = -13 and b = 14. Thus, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we know that ax^0 is the same as a because x^0 is 1 for any non-zero x. Also, bx^1 is the same as bx because x to the power of 1 is x. So the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Now, we need to determine the coefficients a and b such that they fit the given inputs and outputs. This typically requires solving a system of equations, but given the structure of the problem and the linearity of the equation, we can intuit that 'a' will be adjusting the height (or vertical shift) of the function, and 'b' will be the slope. 

Looking at the inputs and outputs given, we can see that an increase of 1 in input leads to an increase of output that is nearly constant, this indicates a linear relationship, which is coherent with the structure of the function we are asked to fit.

To find the exact values of a and b, we need at least two points. We will use:

For Input -18, Output -265: -265 = a - 18b
For Input 19, Output 253: 253 = a + 19b

Let's solve this system of equations:

-265 = a - 18b...(1)
253 = a + 19b...(2)

By adding equation (1) and equation (2), we will eliminate a.

(-265) + 253 = (a - 18b) + (a + 19b)
-12 = 2a + b
b = -12 - 2a ...(3)

Now we'll substitute the value of b from equation (3) into either equation (1) or (2) to find a:

-265 = a - 18(-12 - 2a)
-265 = a + 216 + 36a
-265 - 216 = 37a
-481 = 37a
a = -481 / 37
a = -13

With the value of a, we can substitute it back into equation (3) to find b:

b = -12 - 2(-13)
b = -12 + 26
b = 14

We can see that the constant term `a` is -15.

Next, we need to find the coefficient `b`. We can use another input-output pair, for instance, (5, 5):

\[ 5 = a + b(5) \]
\[ 5 = -15 + 5b \]
\[ 5 + 15 = 5b \]

We can substitute the provided input-output pairs (x, y) into this equation to find a and b.

Let's use two pairs to set up our system of equations.

From the pair (0, -15):
-15 = a + b(0)
-15 = a

So we have found that a = -15.

Now let's use another pair, such as (5, 5):
5 = a + b(5)

To find a linear function that describes this data in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of the coefficients a and b.

The term ax^0 is just a, because any number to the power of 0 is 1.

So our function would look like y = a + bx.

We can use the given points to create a system of equations and solve for a and b.

Let's use the first point (0, -15) to find the value of a:

(-15) = a + b(0) which simplifies to a = -15.

Now, because we have multiple points, we'll solve for b using two different points and ensure that b is consistent across them.

Let's use the points (5, 5) and (0, -15):

5 = a + b(5)
5 = -15 + b(5)
Thus, b = (5 + 15) / 5
b = 20 / 5
b = 4.

Now, to make sure that b = 4 fits all other data points:

To determine the values of a and b, we can observe the outputs corresponding to the inputs and see if there's a consistent pattern.

Let's take two pairs of inputs and their corresponding outputs to solve for a and b:

1. When x = 9, y = 133:

2. When x = 19, y = 283:

We can now set up a system of equations to solve for a and b:

a + 19b = 283

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

    To determine the coefficients a and b for the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can notice that ax^0 is essentially a constant, because any number to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, the term ax^0 becomes just a. The second term, bx^1, simplifies to bx since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself.

Given this form, we can think of ""a"" as the y-intercept and ""b"" as the slope of the line when we are considering y as a linear function of x.

To find the exact values for a and b, we can use two of the provided input-output pairs to set up a system of equations:

Using the input-output pair (x = 9, y = 133):
1. a + b(9) = 133

Using the input-output pair (x = 19, y = 283):
2. a + b(19) = 283

We need to solve this system of equations for a and b. To simplify the system, let's multiply the equations to align the coefficients of a by the same factor and then subtract the second equation from the first:

(19 * Equation 1) - (9 * Equation 2):
19a + 19b(9) = 19 * 133
9a + 9b(19) = 9 * 283

After the calculation:
19a + 171b = 2527
9a + 171b = 2547

Subtract the second equation from the first:
(19a + 171b) - (9a + 171b) = 2527 - 2547

    To find the function of the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to determine the coefficients a and b. The term `ax^0` simplifies to `a` because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. So, the function will effectively be `y = a + bx`.

Let's analyze the given input-output pairs. Given (9, 133) and (-16, -242) for instance, we can create two equations:

1) For input 9: `133 = a + 9b`
2) For input -16: `-242 = a - 16b`

Now let's solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

If we multiply the second equation by 1/2 to make the coefficient of b in the new equation 8, we get:

3) `-121 = a/2 - 8b`

Now let's add equation 3 to equation 1:

`133 + (-121) = a + 9b + a/2 - 8b`
`12 = 3a/2 + b`
`24 = 3a + 2b` (Multiplying each term by 2)
`2b = 24 - 3a`

We need one more step to isolate a or b. Let's rearrange the original equation 1:

`133 - 9b = a`

Now, let’s substitute `a` from this equation in the equation `2b = 24 - 3a`:

`2b = 24 - 3(133 - 9b)`
`2b = 24 - 399 + 27b`
`2b - 27b = 24 - 399`
`-25b = -375`

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) provided, we can simplify the function to y = a + bx, because x^0 is always 1 regardless of the value of x.

To determine the constants a and b, we can use two pairs of inputs and outputs as a system of equations. Let's use the input-output pairs (9, 133) and (-14, -212) for this purpose.

1. For the input 9, output 133:
133 = a + b(9) … (Equation 1)

2. For the input -14, output -212:
-212 = a + b(-14) … (Equation 2)

Now, we have two equations with two unknowns, and we can solve for a and b. 

First, let's solve Equation 2 for a:

a = -212 + 14b … (Equation 2 rewritten)

Now, let's substitute the expression for a from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

133 = (-212 + 14b) + 9b
133 = -212 + 14b + 9b
133 + 212 = 23b
345 = 23b
b = 345 / 23
b = 15

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into Equation 2 to find the value of a:

-212 = a + 15(-14)
-212 = a - 210
a = -212 + 210
a = -2

So, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = a + bx => y = -2 + 15x

Now explicitly in the exact required form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which is essentially \(y = a + bx\), we can use two of the pairs of inputs and outputs to form a system of linear equations and solve for \(a\) and \(b\). 

Let's use the input-output pairs (2, 59) and (-2, -21). When we plug these into our function form \(y = a + bx\), we get the following equations:

1. \(59 = a + 2b\) (using the input 2)
2. \(-21 = a - 2b\) (using the input -2)

Now, we will solve this system of equations. Adding the two equations, we eliminate \(b\):

\(59 + (-21) = a + 2b + a - 2b\)
\(38 = 2a\)

Divide both sides by 2:

\(a = 19\)

Now we can solve for \(b\) by substituting \(a\) into any of the two equations. Let's use the first equation:

\(59 = 19 + 2b\)
\(59 - 19 = 2b\)
\(40 = 2b\)

Divide both sides by 2:

\(b = 20\)

So, the function that captures the relationship is:

    To determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) in the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we essentially need to fit a linear model to the given input-output pairs. We can solve this with a system of equations using two of the given pairs.

Let's use the pairs \( (x_1, y_1) = (2, 59) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) = (-2, -21) \).

For \( (2, 59) \),
\[ 59 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1 \]
\[ 59 = a + 2b \]  (1)

For \( (-2, -21) \),
\[ -21 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)^1 \]
\[ -21 = a - 2b \]   (2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations that we can solve simultaneously for \( a \) and \( b \):

\[ a + 2b = 59 \]
\[ a - 2b = -21 \]

We can add these two equations together to solve for \( a \):

\[ (a + 2b) + (a - 2b) = 59 - 21 \]
\[ 2a = 38 \]
\[ a = 19 \]

Now we can substitute \( a \) back into either equation (1) or (2) to solve for \( b \). Let's use (1):

\[ 19 + 2b = 59 \]
\[ 2b = 59 - 19 \]
\[ 2b = 40 \]
\[ b = 20 \]

So the coefficients are \( a = 19 \) and \( b = 20 \), and the function is:

\[ y = 19x^0 + 20x^1 \]
\[ y = 19 + 20x \]

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 which is equivalent to y = a + bx, we need to find the values of 'a' and 'b' that will fit the given input-output pairs. This is essentially the equation of a line, where 'a' is the y-intercept and 'b' is the slope.

Looking at the input-output pairs:
For x = 2,   y = 59
For x = -16, y = -301
For x = -5,  y = -81
For x = 3,   y = 79
For x = -2,  y = -21

We want to find the best 'a' and 'b' that fit these points. Since we have more than two points, this is an overdetermined system, and we usually use methods like least squares to find the best fit. However, with two points we can directly calculate an exact fit for 'a' and 'b'.

Let's use two points to calculate 'b' (slope):
Taking points (2, 59) and (-2, -21):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (59 - (-21)) / (2 - (-2))
b = (59 + 21) / (2 + 2)
b = 80 / 4
b = 20

Now that we have the slope 'b', we can find 'a' by plugging in 'b' into one of our points. Let's use point (2, 59) for convenience:

y = a + bx
59 = a + 20*2
59 = a + 40
a = 59 - 40
a = 19

Putting the 'a' and 'b' values back into the general function form, we get:

    To determine the coefficients ""a"" and ""b"" for the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which is equivalent to y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1), we need to solve a system of linear equations using the given input-output pairs.

Let's use two of the given pairs to construct our system of equations:

1. Using the input-output pair (2, 59):
   59 = a + b(2)

2. Using the input-output pair (-16, -301):
   -301 = a + b(-16)

We then have the system of equations:
1. a + 2b = 59
2. a - 16b = -301

Let's solve this system of equations for a and b.

a + 2b = 59         (Equation 1)
a - 16b = -301     (Equation 2)

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:
( a + 2b ) - ( a - 16b ) = 59 - (-301)
a + 2b - a + 16b = 59 + 301
18b = 360
b = 360 / 18
b = 20

Insert the value of b in Equation 1:
a + 2(20) = 59
a + 40 = 59
a = 59 - 40
a = 19

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we recognize that ax^0 is just a because x^0 is 1 for any x that's not 0. Essentially, the function we're looking for is a linear function of the form:

y = a + bx

Here, 'a' is the y-intercept, and 'b' is the slope. We need to find the values of 'a' and 'b' that fit the given input-output pairs. This is essentially fitting a line to the data points (2, 59), (-16, -301), (-5, -81), (3, 79), and (-2, -21).

Using two points from the data, we can solve for 'a' and 'b'. Let's choose (2, 59) and (-16, -301):

For the point (2, 59):

59 = a + 2b ... (1)

For the point (-16, -301):

-301 = a - 16b ... (2)

Now, we have to solve these two linear equations simultaneously. Multiplying equation (1) by 8 gives us:

472 = 8a + 16b ... (1')

Now add equations (1') and (2) to eliminate 'b':

472 - 301 = (8a + a) + (16b - 16b)
171 = 9a
a = 171 / 9
a = 19

Now that we have 'a', we can solve for 'b' using equation (1):

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is essentially y = a + bx (since x^0 = 1 for any x ≠ 0), we can use two of the given input-output pairs to create a system of equations and solve for the coefficients a and b.

Let's use the following two input-output pairs:
Input: 13, Output: 55
Input: -20, Output: -44

This results in two equations:
1) a + 13b = 55
2) a - 20b = -44

We can solve this system using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's solve it using the elimination method:

Multiply the first equation by 20 and the second equation by 13 to eliminate 'a':
20a + 260b = 1100
13a - 260b = -572

Adding these two equations eliminates 'a':
(20a + 13a) + (260b - 260b) = 1100 - 572
33a = 528

Now divide both sides by 33 to solve for 'a':
a = 528 / 33
a = 16

Now that we have 'a', you can substitute it back into either of our original equations to find 'b'. Let's use the first original equation:
a + 13b = 55
16 + 13b = 55

Subtract 16 from both sides:
13b = 55 - 16
13b = 39

Now divide both sides by 13 to solve for 'b':
b = 39 / 13
b = 3

Now that we have both 'a' and 'b', we can write the function:

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we recognize that ax^0 is a constant term since x^0 is always 1, and bx^1 is simply bx. Our task now is to determine the values of a and b that best fit the data provided.

Given the form y = a + bx, we need to find the values of the constants a and b that create a function that fits all the input-output pairs given. However, without additional context or constraints, we can't solve for a and b with only a single input-output pair, as multiple functions could fit any singular pair.

However, let's try solving it with the system of linear equations formed by the given pairs.

Taking two pairs, (13, 55) and (-20, -44), we can set up the following equations:

1. 55 = a + 13b
2. -44 = a - 20b

We can solve for a and b using these two equations.

Multiplying the second equation by -1, to eliminate a upon addition, gives us:
-44 = a - 20b
44 = -a + 20b

Adding this to the first equation:
55 = a + 13b
44 = -a + 20b
---------------
99 = 33b

From this, we find b:
b = 99 / 33
b = 3

To find a, we can substitute b back into either equation, let's use the first one:
55 = a + 13(3)
55 = a + 39

Solving for a:
a = 55 - 39
a = 16

Since ax^0 is essentially a constant (because x^0 is always 1), the function simplifies to y = a + bx. 

Let's use two of the given input-output pairs to determine the coefficients a and b:

Using the first pair (13, 55), we have:
55 = a + 13b

Using the second pair (-20, -44):
-44 = a - 20b

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) 55 = a + 13b
2) -44 = a - 20b

We can solve these equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiply the first equation by 20 and the second equation by 13 to eliminate a:

20 * (55) = 20a + 20 * 13b ⇒ 1100 = 20a + 260b
13 * (-44) = 13a - 13 * 20b ⇒ -572 = 13a - 260b

Add the two equations together:

1100 + (-572) = (20a + 13a) + (260b - 260b)
528 = 33a

Divide by 33:

a = 528 / 33

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we will look for the coefficients a and b in the linear function of the form:

Since \(x^0\) is always equal to 1 and \(x^1\) is just x, this simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Now we need to find the values for a and b using the given input-output pairs. Let's use two of them to set up a system of equations:

Using the input-output pair (13, 55):
\[ 55 = a + b(13) \]
\[ 55 = a + 13b \]
\[ (1) \]

Using the input-output pair (-20, -44):
\[ -44 = a + b(-20) \]
\[ -44 = a - 20b \]
\[ (2) \]

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for a and b. One way to solve this system of equations is by using the method of substitution or elimination. I'll use the elimination method here.

First, add (1) and (2) to eliminate a:

\( 55 + (-44) = (a + 13b) + (a - 20b) \)
\( 11 = 2a - 7b \)
\( 2a = 11 + 7b \)
\( a = \frac{11 + 7b}{2} \)
\[ (3) \]

Now substitute (3) back into one of the original equations to find b. Let's use equation (1):

\[ 55 = \frac{11 + 7b}{2} + 13b \]
Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 110 = 11 + 7b + 26b \]
\[ 110 = 11 + 33b \]
\[ 99 = 33b \]
\[ b = 3 \]

Now that we have b, we can use it to find a by substituting b back into equation (3):

\[ a = \frac{11 + 7(3)}{2} \]
\[ a = \frac{11 + 21}{2} \]
\[ a = \frac{32}{2} \]

3. When x = 15, y = 61
4. When x = -1, y = 13

Using points (13, 55) and (-20, -44):

(1) 55 = a + 13b
(2) -44 = a - 20b

y = a + bx

We can use any two points from the given data to solve for a and b. Let's use the points (-11, 72) and (-3, 8).

Plugging in the first point (-11, 72) into the function, we get:

72 = a + b(-11)
72 = a - 11b ...(1)

Plugging in the second point (-3, 8) into the function, we get:

8 = a + b(-3)
8 = a - 3b ...(2)

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

1) 72 = a - 11b
2) 8 = a - 3b

To solve this system, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a and solve for b:

(72 - 8) = (a - a) - (11b - 3b)
64 = -8b

Now solve for b:

b = -8

With the value for b, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to solve for a:

8 = a + 24
a = 8 - 24

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we note that the term ax^0 is always equal to a, since any number raised to the 0 power is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

With this form, we have the constant term a and the slope b as the parameters that we need to determine. We can use two points to solve for a and b in this linear equation.

Let's take two pairs of input-output to form two equations:

1) Using the input -11 and output 72:
72 = a + b(-11)

2) Using the input -3 and output 8:
8 = a + b(-3)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

1) 72 = a - 11b
2) 8 = a - 3b

To solve for a and b, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, I'll subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:

(72) - (8) = (a - 11b) - (a - 3b)
64 = -8b

Solving for b, we find:

b = -8

Let's substitute b into the second equation to solve for a:

8 = a - 3(-8)
8 = a + 24
a = -16

Now we have both a and b:

a = -16
b = 8

The resulting function is:

y = -16 + 8x

Let's test this function to confirm if it works with all provided data points:

For Input: -11
y = -16 + 8(-11) = -16 - 88 = -104 (which does not match the Output: 72)

But, it seems we made an error since it does not match for the -11 input. We need to double-check our computations.

Let's try another pair of points to calculate the coefficients again:

Using input -2 and output 0:
0 = a - 2b

Now we have this equation along with one from before (8 = a - 3b) for the system:

1) 0 = a - 2b
2) 8 = a - 3b

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a:

8 = -b
b = -8

Substituting b = -8 into equation (1):
0 = a - 2(-8)
0 = a + 16
a = -16

This is indeed the same result. However, let's test this with one of the inputs we have not used yet to ensure it's correct:

For Input: 18
y = -16 - 8(18) = -16 - 144 = -160

The set of equations created from the inputs and outputs should be satisfied by the correct coefficients a and b; however, since we made an error in the previous calculation, we must re-derive them correctly. Let's solve the equations for a and b again:

1) 72 = a - 11b
2) 8 = a - 3b

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:

64 = -8b
b = -8

Now use equation 2 to solve for a:

8 = a + 24
a = 8 - 24
a = -16

The equations give us the same a and b values, suggesting the calculations are now correct:

a = -16
b = -8

Again, let's review our steps and solve for a and b with the system of equations:

1) 72 = a - 11b
2) 8 = a - 3b

To solve for b, we can use elimination:

64 = -8b
b = -8

Substituting the value of b into the first equation:

72 = a - 11(-8)
72 = a + 88
a = 72 - 88
a = -16

So our function is:

y = -16 - 8x

To ensure that this is the correct function, let's test it with all provided data points:

For Input: -11
y = -16 - 8(-11)
y = -16 + 88
y = 72 (matches the Output)

For Input: -3
y = -16 - 8(-3)
y = -16 + 24
y = 8 (matches the Output)

For Input: -2
y = -16 - 8(-2)
y = -16 + 16
y = 0 (matches the Output)

For Input: 18
y = -16 - 8(18)
y = -16 - 144
y = -160 (matches the Output)

For Input: -7
y = -16 - 8(-7)
y = -16 + 56
y = 40 (matches the Output)

Now that all the outputs match, we have the correct function:

y = -16 - 8x

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is effectively y = a + bx (since x^0 = 1 and x^1 = x), we need to determine the values of a and b that best fit the given input-output pairs. 

Let's set up two equations using two pairs of provided inputs and outputs to solve for a and b.

1. Using the input-output pair (-11, 72):

\[ 72 = a + (-11)b \]
\[ 72 = a - 11b \]
\[ a = 72 + 11b \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \]

2. Using the input-output pair (-3, 8):

\[ 8 = a + (-3)b \]
\[ 8 = a - 3b \]
\[ a = 8 + 3b \quad \text{(Equation 2)} \]

To find the values of a and b, let's solve the system of equations by setting Equation 1 and Equation 2 equal to each other:

\[ 72 + 11b = 8 + 3b \]
\[ 11b - 3b = 8 - 72 \]
\[ 8b = -64 \]
\[ b = -64 / 8 \]
\[ b = -8 \]

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find a. Let's use Equation 2:

\[ a = 8 + 3b \]
\[ a = 8 + 3(-8) \]
\[ a = 8 - 24 \]
\[ a = -16 \]

Thus, our function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

\[ y = -16x^0 - 8x^1 \]
\[ y = -16 - 8x \]

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y), we notice that ax^0 is a constant (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is a linear term.

Given the data points:

1. (-11, 72)
2. (-3, 8)
3. (-2, 0)
4. (18, -160)
5. (-7, 40)

We are looking for values of 'a' and 'b' such that:

y = a*1 + b*x
y = a + bx

For each data point (x, y), we have an equation:

1. a - 11b = 72
2. a - 3b  = 8
3. a - 2b  = 0
4. a + 18b = -160
5. a - 7b  = 40

Now we have a system of linear equations. To find 'a' and 'b', we can solve the system using methods like substitution or elimination. However, since we're given five data points but only need two to determine the two unknown coefficients in the linear equation, we can use just two of the data points to set up two equations.

For simplicity, let's use data points 3 and 4, since one of them gives a zero value for y, which might simplify calculations.

From data point 3 (-2, 0), we get:

a - 2b = 0  -> Equation (i)

From data point 4 (18, -160), we get:

a + 18b = -160 -> Equation (ii)

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Starting from Equation (i):

a = 2b

Substitute 'a' in Equation (ii):

2b + 18b = -160
20b = -160
b = -160 / 20
b = -8

Since a = 2b, now find 'a':

a = 2*(-8)
a = -16

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -16 + (-8)x
y = -16 - 8x

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), we need to determine the values of 'a' and 'b' that would satisfy the given input-output pairs.

Given a linear function y = a + bx, we can use two points to solve the system of equations and find 'a' and 'b'. Let's take the input-output pairs (-2, 0) and (-3, 8):

For the input -2 and output 0, we have:
0 = a + b(-2)
0 = a - 2b ... (1)

For the input -3 and output 8, we have:
8 = a + b(-3)
8 = a - 3b ... (2)

Now let's solve the system of equations (1) and (2) for 'a' and 'b':

From equation (1), we get:
0 = a - 2b
a = 2b ... (3)

Now plug the value of a from (3) into equation (2):
8 = (2b) - 3b
8 = -b
b = -8

Substituting the value of 'b' into equation (3) to find 'a':

    To find a linear function that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y), we are looking for the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx, as x^0 is 1 and x^1 is x.

We can use two points to determine the linear function. Let's use the points (11, -204) and (-4, 66).

First, we can write two equations based on these points:

For the point (11, -204):
-204 = a + b(11) ...(1)

For the point (-4, 66):
66 = a + b(-4) ...(2)

Now we solve this system of two linear equations to find a and b.

Multiply the second equation by -1 to facilitate the elimination of a:
-66 = -a - 4b ...(3)

Now add equation (3) to equation (1):
-204 + 66 = a - a + 11b - 4b
-138 = 7b

Divide both sides by 7 to find b:
b = -138 / 7
b = -19.7142857...

Now that we know b, we can substitute it into one of the initial equations to find a. Let's substitute b into equation (2):

66 = a - 4(-19.7142857)
66 = a + 78.8571428

Subtracting 78.8571428 from both sides, we get:
a = 66 - 78.8571428
a = -12.8571428

So, the equation of the line is approximately:
y = -12.8571428 + (-19.7142857)x

To respect the exact form requested (y = ax^0 + bx^1) and assuming the calculation is expected to have some level of rounding for simplicity:

y ≈ -13 + (-20)x

If you require the values of a and b to be more precise, you'll have to specify the required precision or tolerance for rounding.

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the data, we will recognize that x^0 is always 1, as any non-zero number raised to the power of zero equals one. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx, where 'a' and 'b' are constants. We need to find the values of 'a' and 'b' such that the equation fits the given input-output pairs.

Let's consider two pairs of input-output values to set up a system of linear equations and solve for 'a' and 'b'.

We will use the input-output pairs (11, -204) and (-4, 66):

1. For input 11: -204 = a + b(11)
2. For input -4:   66 = a + b(-4)

Now, let's solve this system of equations for 'a' and 'b'. We can do this using substitution, elimination, or matrix methods. Here, we will use the elimination method.

-204 = a + 11b      ...(1)
  66 = a - 4b        ...(2)

Let's multiply equation (2) by 2.75 (which is 11/4) to align the coefficient of 'a' with that of 'a' in equation (1):

181.5 = 2.75a - 11b   ...(3)

Now add equation (1) to equation (3) to eliminate 'b':

-204 + 181.5 = a + 11b + 2.75a - 11b
  -22.5 = 3.75a
      a = -22.5 / 3.75

  b = -72 / -4

    To determine the coefficients `a` and `b` for the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx because any number to the power of 0 is 1, we can use the given input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations and solve for `a` and `b`.

The function simplifies to:
y = a + bx

Using the two input-output pairs, we can set up the following equations:
1) For input 11 and output -204:
-204 = a + 11b

2) For input -4 and output 66:
66 = a - 4b

Now, we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns. We can solve this system using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's use the elimination method.

Multiply the first equation by 4 and the second by 11 to eliminate `a`:
1) -204 * 4 = 4a + 44b, which becomes -816 = 4a + 44b
2) 66 * 11 = 11a - 44b, which becomes 726 = 11a - 44b

Now add the two resulting equations together to eliminate `b`:
-816 + 726 = 4a + 44b + 11a - 44b

This simplifies to:
-90 = 15a

Divide by 15 to solve for `a`:
a = -90 / 15
a = -6

Now that we have `a`, we can plug it into one of our original equations to find `b`. Let's use the second equation:
66 = a - 4b
66 = -6 - 4b

Add 6 to both sides:
66 + 6 = -4b

3. x = -17, y = 300
4. x = -15, y = 264

For x = 20, y = -366,

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to understand that \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \) (since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself). So the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We need to calculate the values of \( a \) and \( b \) using the given input-output pairs. The function will be linear, and with two parameters, we need at least two points to solve for those parameters. Taking two points: 

(1) Input: 11, Output: -204
(2) Input: 20, Output: -366

Let's substitute these points into our simplified function:

For point (1): \( -204 = a + 11b \) 
For point (2): \( -366 = a + 20b \)

We can form a system of equations and then solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

\( -204 = a + 11b \) ... (eq 1)
\( -366 = a + 20b \) ... (eq 2)

Let's solve for \( a \) and \( b \) by subtracting (eq 1) from (eq 2) to eliminate \( a \):

\( -366 - (-204) = a + 20b - (a + 11b) \)
\( -366 + 204 = 20b - 11b \)
\( -162 = 9b \)
\( b = -162 / 9 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can solve for \( a \) using either of the original equations:

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). This form is a linear equation where \( ax^0 \) is actually a constant (since any number raised to the 0th power is 1), and \( bx^1 \) is simply \( bx \). Thus, our goal is to find the function:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Given the various input-output pairs, we can use two of them to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the input-output pairs (-12, 9) and (20, -55) to set up a system of linear equations.

From the first pair (-12, 9):

\[ 9 = a + b(-12) \]
\[ 9 = a - 12b \]
\[ a - 12b = 9 \]

From the second pair (20, -55):

\[ -55 = a + b(20) \]
\[ -55 = a + 20b \]
\[ a + 20b = -55 \]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
1. \( a - 12b = 9 \)
2. \( a + 20b = -55 \)

Let's solve this system. We can do this by subtracting the second equation from the first:

\[ (a - 12b) - (a + 20b) = 9 - (-55) \]
\[ a - 12b - a - 20b = 9 + 55 \]
\[ -32b = 64 \]
\[ b = -2 \]

Now, we substitute \( b = -2 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( a \). Let's use the first equation:

\[ a - 12(-2) = 9 \]
\[ a + 24 = 9 \]
\[ a = 9 - 24 \]
\[ a = -15 \]

So the coefficients we found are \( a = -15 \) and \( b = -2 \). Therefore, the function that describes the relationship is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Let us use the general form for a linear function given:

y = ax^0 + bx^1 

This simplifies to:

y = a + bx 

We are given several input-output pairs to determine the coefficients a and b. To solve for a and b, we can use two of these pairs and set up a system of linear equations.

Let's choose the input-output pairs (-12, 9) and (20, -55):

1. For the input -12:
9 = a + b(-12)

2. For the input 20:
-55 = a + b(20)

Now we have two equations:

1. 9 = a - 12b
2. -55 = a + 20b

We will solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a:

-55 - 9 = (a + 20b) - (a - 12b)
-55 - 9 = a + 20b - a + 12b
-64 = 32b
b = -64 / 32
b = -2

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either equation to find a. Using equation 1:

9 = a - 12(-2)
9 = a + 24
a = 9 - 24
a = -15

So, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -15 + (-2)x

y = -29

Therefore, the output for the input 7 is -29.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to solve a system of linear equations using the provided input-output pairs. The function simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for all x (except when x = 0).

We can substitute each input-output pair into the equation to form a system of linear equations. Let's take two pairs of points to solve for a and b:

Let's use the points (-12, 9) and (20, -55):

For the input -12:
9 = a + b(-12)
9 = a - 12b   ... (1)

For the input 20:
-55 = a + b(20)
-55 = a + 20b  ... (2)

Now, we have a system of equations:
1) 9 = a - 12b
2) -55 = a + 20b

We can solve for a and b using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply (1) by 20 and (2) by 12:
1) 180 = 20a - 240b
2) -660 = 12a + 240b

Now add the two equations:
180 - 660 = (20a - 240b) + (12a + 240b)
-480 = 32a
a = -480 / 32
a = -15

Now we can substitute the value of a into either (1) or (2) to find b. Let's use equation (1):

9 = -15 - 12b
12b = -15 - 9
12b = -24
b = -24 / 12
b = -2

Now we have the values for a and b:
a = -15
b = -2

    The function we are seeking will be in the form of a linear equation, y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx, because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

The two coefficients we are trying to determine are a (the y-intercept) and b (the slope of the line). To find these coefficients, we can use two of the provided input-output pairs to set up a system of equations.

Let's use the input-output pairs (-12, 9) and (20, -55) to create two equations:

For the input -12 and output 9:
9 = a + b(-12)
9 = a - 12b  (Equation 1)

For the input 20 and output -55:
-55 = a + b(20)
-55 = a + 20b  (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1) 9 = a - 12b
2) -55 = a + 20b

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use elimination to solve for a and b:

Multiply Equation 1 by 20 and Equation 2 by 12 to eliminate a when we subtract one equation from the other:
1) 9(20) = a(20) - 12b(20)
2) -55(12) = a(12) + 20b(12)

This gives us:
180 = 20a - 240b  (Equation 3)
-660 = 12a + 240b  (Equation 4)

Add Equation 3 and Equation 4:
180 + (-660) = (20a + 12a) + (-240b + 240b)
-480 = 32a

Now solve for a:
a = -480 / 32
a = -15

To find b, substitute a = -15 into any of the original two equations, such as Equation 1:
9 = -15 - 12b
24 = -12b
b = 24 / -12

    To find the coefficients ""a"" and ""b"" for the function described in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we can interpret `ax^0` as `a*1` (since any number to the power of zero is 1) and `bx^1` as `b*x` (since any number to the power of 1 is itself). Thus, the function simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

Given the two points from the provided data, we can create a system of linear equations to solve for ""a"" and ""b."" Let's use the following two points from the dataset:

1. For `x = -12`, `y = 9`
2. For `x = 20`, `y = -55`

We plug these points into the equation `y = a + bx` to get two equations:

1. `9 = a - 12b`
2. `-55 = a + 20b`

Now we will solve this system of equations for ""a"" and ""b"". Multiply the first equation by 20, and the second equation by 12 to eliminate ""a"":

1. `180 = 20a - 240b`
2. `-660 = 12a + 240b`

Now, add these two equations together:

`180 - 660 = (20a - 240b) + (12a + 240b)`

This results in:

`-480 = 32a`

Solving for ""a"" gives us:

`a = -480 / 32`
`a = -15`

Now that we have the value of ""a"", we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find ""b"". We'll use the first equation:

`9 = -15 - 12b`

Solving for ""b"" gives us:

`12b = -15 - 9`
`12b = -24`
`b = -24 / 12`

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the constants a and b that fit the given input-output data pairs.

In the function, x^0 is always 1, so the term involving a is simply a constant. The function simplifies to y = a + bx. We need to find the values of a and b that will best fit the data provided.

Given the following pairs (x, y):

(-16, 82), (-11, 52), (14, -98), (-18, 94), (3, -32)

We want to find the constants a and b. We will use two pairs to set up a system of linear equations:

Let's take the pairs (-16, 82) and (14, -98):

1) For x = -16, y = 82: 82 = a + b(-16)
2) For x = 14, y = -98: -98 = a + b(14)

These equations translate to:
1) 82 = a - 16b
2) -98 = a + 14b

Now, let's solve this system of linear equations. We can use substitution or elimination. Here, we will use elimination:

Multiply the first equation by 1 and the second by 1 to allow for elimination:
82 = a - 16b
-98 = a + 14b

Now, let's add these two equations to eliminate a:
(82) + (-98) = (a - 16b) + (a + 14b)

-16 = 2a - 2b
  
Dividing both sides by 2:
-8 = a - b

Now we have an equation in terms of a and b. Let's solve for one variable, for example, b:
b = a + 8

We'll now substitute this back into one of our original equations to find the value of a. Let's use the first equation:

82 = a - 16b

Substituting b:
82 = a - 16(a + 8)
82 = a - 16a - 128
82 = -15a - 128
82 + 128 = -15a
210 = -15a

Divide both sides by -15 to solve for a:
a = -14

Now, we'll use this value of a to solve for b using the relationship we found:
b = a + 8
b = -14 + 8
b = -6

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we have to determine the values of the coefficients a and b. 

The term ax^0 is effectively a, because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

Using two sets of inputs and outputs to form a system of linear equations, we can solve for a and b. Let's use the pairs (-16, 82) and (14, -98):

For the input -16:
82 = a + b(-16)
82 = a - 16b

For the input 14:
-98 = a + b(14)
-98 = a + 14b

Now we solve this system of two equations with two unknowns.

From the first equation:
a = 82 + 16b

Substitute a from the first into the second equation:

-98 = 82 + 16b + 14b
-98 - 82 = 30b

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can find 'a' and 'b' by plugging in two of the given pairs and then solving the resulting system of equations. Let's use the first two input-output pairs for this purpose:

For input -16 and output 82:

For input -11 and output 52:

Now, we will solve the system of linear equations formed by (1) and (2) for 'a' and 'b'.

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate 'a', we get:
\( (82 - 52) = (-16b) - (-11b) \)

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we can interpret ax^0 as a constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 as a simple linear term (since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself). Therefore, the function can be simplified to y = a + bx.

We can use two distinct input-output pairs to find the values of 'a' and 'b'. Let's use:

Input: -1
Output: -7

Input: 3
Output: 9

We set up two equations based on these pairs:

For Input -1:
-7 = a + b(-1)
-7 = a - b ...(1)

For Input 3:
9 = a + b(3)
9 = a + 3b ...(2)

Now, we have two equations and two unknowns, which we can solve simultaneously. Let's multiply equation (1) by 3:

-21 = 3a - 3b ...(3)

Now add equation (2) to equation (3) to eliminate 'b':

9 + (-21) = (3a - 3b) + (a + 3b)
-12 = 4a
a = -12/4
a = -3

With the value of 'a', we can substitute it back into equation (1) or (2) to find 'b'. Let's use equation (1):

-7 = a - b
-7 = -3 - b
b = -3 + 7
b = 4

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -3 + 4x

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is essentially y = a + bx, we need to determine the values of a and b that make the function fit the given data points.

To do this, we can use two of the provided data points to set up a system of linear equations. Because ""ax^0"" simplifies to ""a"" (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), our function becomes y = a + bx.

Let's use the following two points: 
(-1, -7) and (2, 5)

This gives us two equations:

-7 = a + b(-1)
5 = a + b(2)

Now solve for a and b:

From the first equation:
-7 = a - b
a = -7 + b ... (Equation 1)

From the second equation:
5 = a + 2b

Now, we can substitute the value of a from Equation 1 into the second equation:

5 = (-7 + b) + 2b
5 = -7 + 3b
12 = 3b
b = 4

Plug the value of b back into Equation 1 to find a:

a = -7 + b
a = -7 + 4
a = -3

Thus, the function that fits the data is:

y = -3 + 4x

It can also be written as:
Output: y = -3x^0 + 4x^1 

This function should be verified against all given points to ensure it fits all the data correctly. Let's do this verification:

For Input: -18

y = -3 + 4(-1) = -3 - 4 = -7 (matches Output: -7)

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to utilize the given input-output pairs. Using ax^0 + bx^1 is equivalent to a + bx because x^0 = 1 for any x except for x = 0. 

Let's use two of the distinct pairs of points to set up a system of linear equations to solve for a and b. For simplicity, I will use the points (-1, -7) and (2, 5).

Using the point (-1, -7):
a + b(-1) = -7 ... (1)

Using the point (2, 5):
a + b(2) = 5 ... (2)

Let's solve this system of equations:

From equation (1):
a - b = -7 ... (3)

From equation (2):
a + 2b = 5 ... (4)

We can add equations (3) and (4) to eliminate variable b:
a - b + a + 2b = -7 + 5
2a = -2
a = -1

Now we substitute a back into equation (3) to find b:

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given input-output pairs, we need to determine the constants a and b. Note that ax^0 is equivalent to a for any non-zero x, since x^0 is always 1.

First, let's rewrite the function as:
y = a + bx

For each input-output pair, we can create an equation:
For input 6 and output 74: 74 = a + b(6)
For input 19 and output 191: 191 = a + b(19)
For input -11 and output -79: -79 = a + b(-11)
For input -5 and output -25: -25 = a + b(-5)
For input -10 and output -70: -70 = a + b(-10)

We could try to solve these equations as a system to find a and b, but since we are a pattern recognition system, let's look for a pattern.

Observing the difference in y when x increases by 1, for two consecutive inputs:
- From input -11 to input -10 (increase by 1), the output increases from -79 to -70 (+9).
- From input -10 to input -5 (increase by 5), the output increases from -70 to -25 (+45), which is 9 * 5.
- From input -5 to input 6 (increase by 11), the output increases from -25 to 74 (+99), which is 9 * 11.

From these calculations, we can see that each time x increases by 1, y increases by 9. This suggests that b = 9.

Now, we can determine the value of a by substituting the value of b into any of the equations above. Let's use the input 6 and output 74:
74 = a + 9(6)
74 = a + 54
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

    From the data provided, we can see that for each input x, the output y changes linearly. We will assume the relationship is indeed linear and in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since anything to the power of 0 is 1.

Given input-output pairs:
(6, 74):     74 = a + 6b
(19, 191):   191 = a + 19b
(-11, -79):  -79 = a - 11b
(-5, -25):   -25 = a - 5b
(-10, -70):  -70 = a - 10b

To find values of a and b, use any two complete input-output pairs to set up a system of equations. Let's use input 6 and input -5 for simplicity:

For input 6 (x = 6, y = 74):
74 = a + 6b

For input -5 (x = -5, y = -25):
-25 = a - 5b

Now we have two equations:
1. 74 = a + 6b
2. -25 = a - 5b

Let's solve this system using substitution or elimination method. To eliminate a, add equation 1 to the result of the equation 2 multiplied by -1:

74 = a + 6b          (x1)
+ (25 = -a + 5b)      (x-1)
---------------
99 = 11b

Solving for b:
b = 99 / 11
b = 9

Now substitute b back into either equation to solve for a. Using equation 2: 
-25 = a - 5b
-25 = a - 5(9)

    To determine the coefficients a and b such that the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 fits the provided input-output pairs, we can understand that ax^0 is a constant term because x^0 is always 1, and bx^1 is a linear term because x^1 is just x.

Given the pairs:

1. When x = 6, y = 74, we have 74 = a(6^0) + b(6),
2. When x = 19, y = 191, we have 191 = a(19^0) + b(19),
3. When x = -11, y = -79, we have -79 = a(-11^0) + b(-11),
4. When x = -5, y = -25, we have -25 = a(-5^0) + b(-5),
5. When x = -10, y = -70, we have -70 = a(10^0) + b(-10).

Now, we need to find the values of a and b.

Based on these pairs, we can start by observing the difference in output when the input increases or decreases by 1. If we look at the points (6, 74) and (19, 191), increasing x by 13 (19-6) increases y by 117 (191-74). This suggests that the linear component (b) may be equal to the difference in y divided by the difference in x:

b = (191 - 74) / (19 - 6) = 117 / 13 = 9

Now, to find the constant term a, we can substitute b back into one of the original equations:

74 = a(6^0) + b(6)
74 = a + 9 * 6
74 = a + 54

    To capture the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we first note that the given form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is 1 for any x not equal to zero.

Now we need to find the coefficients a and b that will satisfy the input-output pairs (6, 74), (19, 191), (-11, -79), (-5, -25), and (-10, -70).

1. Input: 6, Output: 74
74 = a + 6b

2. Input: 19, Output: 191
191 = a + 19b

Now let's solve this system of linear equations. It's straightforward to solve for b first by subtracting the first equation from the second one:

191 - 74 = (a + 19b) - (a + 6b)
117 = 13b
b = 117 / 13
b = 9

Then we can substitute the value of b back into one of the original equations to solve for a. We'll use the first one:

    To find the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \).

Given that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) (excluding \( x = 0 \)), we can simplify the function to:
\[ y = a + bx \]

We can use two of the given input-output pairs to form a system of equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's use the pairs (6, 74) and (-5, -25):

For the input 6 and output 74:

\[ 74 = a + 6b \]

For the input -5 and output -25:
\[ -25 = a + b(-5) \]
\[ -25 = a - 5b \]

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
\[ 74 = a + 6b \]
\[ -25 = a - 5b \]

We can solve this system using various methods such as substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

We’ll add the two equations to eliminate \( a \):

\[ (74 = a + 6b) + (-25 = a - 5b) \]
\[ 74 - 25 = a - a + 6b + 5b \]
\[ 49 = 11b \]

Now solve for \( b \):

\[ b = \frac{49}{11} \]
\[ b = \frac{49}{11} \]

We place \( b \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( a \):

\[ 74 = a + 6(\frac{49}{11}) \]
\[ 74 = a + \frac{294}{11} \]
\[ 74 - \frac{294}{11} = a \]
\[ \frac{814}{11} - \frac{294}{11} = a \]

To fit a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is the same as y = a + bx (since x^0 = 1 for any value of x that is not zero), we can look at the change in y with respect to the change in x.

Taking a pair of input-output points to determine the slope (b):

For x = -5, y = -25.
For x = -3, y = -19.

The slope (b) is given by the change in y divided by the change in x:

\[ 8 = a + 6b \] (Equation 1)

For Input -5, Output -25:
\[ -25 = a - 5b \] (Equation 2)

Solving this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \):
Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2:

\[ 8 + (-25) = a + 6b + a - 5b \]
\[ -17 = 2a + b \]
\[ b = -17 - 2a \] (Equation 3)

Plugging Equation 3 into Equation 1:

\[ 8 = a + 6(-17 - 2a) \]
\[ 8 = a - 102 - 12a \]
\[ 8 = -11a - 102 \]
\[ 110 = -11a \]
\[ a = -10 \]

Plugging value of \( a \) into Equation 3:

\[ b = -17 - 2(-10) \]
\[ b = -17 + 20 \]
\[ b = 3 \]

Now we can write the function:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]
\[ y = -10 + 3x \]

Thus the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs given is:

\[ y = -10 + 3x \]

    To find a function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the values of constants \( a \) and \( b \). Given the form, we see that \( ax^0 \) is essentially \( a \) since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) (except \( x = 0 \)), and \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \).

By looking at the given input-output pairs, we can attempt to find a relationship between them that would suggest the values of \( a \) and \( b \). 

Let's first try to deduce the slope (\( b \)), which should be constant across all pairs (assuming a linear relationship).

For the first pair, when the input increases from -14 to -10 (an increase of 4), the output increases from -52 to -40 (an increase of 12), which gives us a slope of \( 12 / 4 = 3 \).

To double-check, looking at the increase from -10 to -5, the input increases by 5, and the output from -40 to -25 increases by 15, which again gives us a slope of \( 15 / 5 = 3 \).

Let's assume for now that \( b = 3 \) and check if this works for all the given pairs:

When input \( x = 6 \), \( bx = 3 * 6 = 18 \). But the given output is 8, which suggests that there is a constant \( a \) we need to find such that \( a + 18 = 8 \). That would mean \( a = 8 - 18 = -10 \).

If we assume \( a = -10 \), let's now check whether this holds for the other input-output pairs:

- For input \( x = -5 \): \( y = -10 + (3 * -5) = -10 - 15 = -25 \), which matches the given output.
- For input \( x = -3 \): \( y = -10 + (3 * -3) = -10 - 9 = -19 \), which matches the given output.
- For input \( x = -14 \): \( y = -10 + (3 * -14) = -10 - 42 = -52 \), which matches the given output.

Hence, our function that fits all the given input-output pairs is:

\[ y = -10x^0 + 3x^1 \]

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the given data, we need to determine the values of a and b that will satisfy the equation for all input-output pairs.

The equation y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx, because x^0 = 1 for any value of x.

We can use two data points to set up a system of equations and solve for the constants a and b. Let's take the input-output pairs (9, 29) and (2, 8).

For the first pair, where input x = 9 and output y = 29:

29 = a + b(9)

For the second pair, where input x = 2 and output y = 8:

8 = a + b(2)

Now we can solve this system of two equations:

1. 29 = a + 9b
2. 8 = a + 2b

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:

29 - 8 = a + 9b - (a + 2b)
21 = 7b

Now solve for b:

b = 21 / 7
b = 3

Use this value of b in either equation to find a. We'll use the second equation (8 = a + 2b):

8 = a + 2(3)
8 = a + 6
a = 8 - 6
a = 2

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we recognize that ax^0 is a constant term because any number to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, ax^0 is a. The term bx^1 is simply bx because any number to the power of 1 is the number itself. So we are looking for y = a + bx.

We can use two points from the given data to calculate the coefficients a and b. Let us use the following two points:

Point 1: (Input: 9, Output: 29)
Point 2: (Input: 2, Output: 8)

Substitute these points into the equation y = a + bx to get two equations with two unknowns.

1) For Input 9 (x = 9), Output y = 29:
29 = a + 9b

2) For Input 2 (x = 2), Output y = 8:
8 = a + 2b

Now let's subtract the second equation from the first to solve for b:

(29 = a + 9b) - (8 = a + 2b)

Let's take two different input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations:

Using Input: 2, Output: 8, we get:
\( 8 = a + b(2) \)
\( 8 = a + 2b \)  ---(1)

Using Input: -1, Output: -1, we get:
\( -1 = a + b(-1) \)
\( -1 = a - b \) ---(2)

Now, we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

Add equation (1) and (2) to solve for \( a \):
\( 8 + (-1) = (a + 2b) + (a - b) \)
\( 7 = 2a + b \)
\( 7 = 2a + b \) ---(3)

Now, subtract equation (2) from (1) to solve for \( b \):
\( 8 - (-1) = (a + 2b) - (a - b) \)
\( 9 = 3b \)
\( b = 3 \)

    To determine the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) such that the function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\) accurately predicts the outputs for the given inputs.

Let's analyze the given pairs of input and output values:

1. For the input \(x = 9\), the output \(y = 29\).
2. For the input \(x = 2\), the output \(y = 8\).
3. For the input \(x = -1\), the output \(y = -1\).
4. For the input \(x = -6\), the output \(y = -16\).

We know that \(x^0 = 1\) for any value of \(x\), except for \(x = 0\) which is not in our list of inputs. Hence our function simplifies to \(y = a + bx\). We can use any two pairs of input and output values to solve for \(a\) and \(b\).

Using the input-output pair (2, 8):
\(8 = a + b(2)\)

Using the input-output pair (-1, -1):
\(-1 = a + b(-1)\)

We have a system of equations:
\(a + 2b = 8\)
\(a - b = -1\)

Let's solve this system of equations by first multiplying the second equation by 2, aiming to eliminate \(a\):

\(2a - 2b = -2\)

Now, subtract this result from the first equation:

\(a + 2b = 8\)
\(-(2a - 2b = -2)\)

This yields:

\(3b = 10\)

So,

\(b = \frac{10}{3}\)

Now, substitute \(b\) in one of the equations to solve for \(a\):

\(a + 2(\frac{10}{3}) = 8\)

Multiply everything by 3 to clear the fraction:

\(3a + 20 = 24\)

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\(3a = 4\)

Finally,

\(a = \frac{4}{3}\)

Thus, the function based on our findings is:

\[y = \frac{4}{3}x^0 + \frac{10}{3}x^1\]

In simplified form, it's:

\[y = \frac{4}{3} + \frac{10}{3}x\]

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the coefficients `a` and `b` that fit the given input-output pairs. Since ax^0 is the same as a (because any number to the power of 0 is 1), the function can be simplified to y = a + bx.

We can use the provided data points to determine `a` and `b`. Let's consider two points to set up a system of linear equations:

Using the point (9, 29):
29 = a + b(9)   (1)

Using the point (2, 8):
8 = a + b(2)    (2)

We'll solve this system to find `a` and `b`.

From equation (2), we can express `a` in terms of `b`:
a = 8 - 2b

Now plug this expression for `a` into equation (1):
29 = (8 - 2b) + b(9)
29 = 8 + 7b
21 = 7b
b = 3

Now we'll find `a` using the value of `b` in equation (2):

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the input and output, we need to recognize that this form is essentially a linear function. Here, ax^0 is the y-intercept (since x^0 = 1 for any x that isn't 0), and bx^1 is simply bx, the slope times the input.

So the function we're looking for is of the form y = a + bx, where ""a"" is the y-intercept and ""b"" is the slope. To find the values of ""a"" and ""b"", we can use two data points to form a system of linear equations. Let's use the following two points: (2, -17) and (5, -38).

For the point (2, -17):
-17 = a + b(2) ---(1)

For the point (5, -38):
-38 = a + b(5) ---(2)

Now we solve this system of equations. Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2), we get:

-38 + 17 = 3b
-21 = 3b
b = -21 / 3

    The relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function of the form:

We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) by plugging in two of the given input-output pairs into the equation and solving the resulting system of equations. Let's select two pairs:

For \( x = -16 \), \( y = 109 \):
\[ 109 = a - 16b \]  (1)

For \( x = 2 \), \( y = -17 \):
\[ -17 = a + 2b \]    (2)

Now, let's solve this system. We can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, elimination will be used to find the value of \( b \) first.

To eliminate \( a \), multiply equation (2) by 8 and add it to equation (1):

\[ -136 = 8a + 16b \]  (2') × 8
\[ 109 = a - 16b \]      (1)

\[ -27 = 9a \]

Using the provided input-output pairs, we have the system of equations:

1. \( a + b(-16) = 109 \)
2. \( a + b(-3) = 18 \)
3. \( a + b(2) = -17 \)
4. \( a + b(12) = -87 \)

From this system, we can solve for \( a \) and \( b \). However, since we have more than two equations for two unknowns, this is an overdetermined system and might not have an exact solution if the points do not lie perfectly on a straight line. Assuming the data might have some noise, we can use a method like least squares regression to find an approximate solution.

But let us first check if there is an exact solution by looking at pairs of equations to see if they yield the same values for \( a \) and \( b \).

Taking equations 1 and 3:
\( a - 16b = 109 \)
\( a + 2b = -17 \)

Isolating \( a \) from the second equation:
\( a = -17 - 2b \)

Substituting into the first equation:
\( -17 - 2b - 16b = 109 \)
\( -17 - 18b = 109 \)
\( -18b = 109 + 17 \)
\( -18b = 126 \)
\( b = -7 \)

Now, substitute \( b \) back to solve for \( a \):
\( a = -17 - 2(-7) \)
\( a = -17 + 14 \)
\( a = -3 \)

Now let's test with the second and third equations:
\( a - 3b = 18 \)
\( a + 2b = -17 \)

Adding these equations to eliminate \( b \):
\( 2a - b = 1 \)

With \( b = -7 \):
\( 2a + 7 = 1 \)
\( 2a = -6 \)
\( a = -3 \)

The values are consistent for both pairs of equations, therefore the function is likely to be correct. Let's verify this for all the given pairs:

1. For \( x = -16 \): \( y = -3 - 7(-16) = -3 + 112 = 109 \) (correct)
2. For \( x = -3 \): \( y = -3 - 7(-3) = -3 + 21 = 18 \) (correct)

We need to find the coefficients a and b, so let's start by setting up two equations using two pairs of input-output data.

Let's use the points (-16, 109) and (2, -17):

1. For the input -16 and output 109:
109 = a + b(-16)

2. For the input 2 and output -17:
-17 = a + b(2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1. 109 = a - 16b
2. -17 = a + 2b

We can solve this system by using simple algebraic techniques:

From equation 2, solve for a:
a = -17 - 2b

Substitute a in equation 1:
109 = (-17 - 2b) - 16b
109 = -17 - 2b - 16b
109 = -17 - 18b
109 + 17 = -18b
126 = -18b
b = -126 / 18
b = -7

Now find a using the value of b in equation 2:
-17 = a + 2(-7)
-17 = a - 14
a = -17 + 14
a = -3

Thus, the function is:

    To find a function that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the appropriate constants a and b. The term ax^0 is equivalent to a because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

So we are looking for a function of the form y = a + bx, where:

1. a is the y-intercept, the value of y when x is 0.
2. b is the slope of the line, which describes how much y changes for a unit change in x.

Let's use two points from the given data to find a and b. It is advisable to choose two points that will simplify calculations:

Using the points (2, -17) and (-3, 18):

For (2, -17): -17 = a + 2b
For (-3, 18): 18 = a - 3b

We have a system of two equations:

1. a + 2b = -17   (Equation 1)
2. a - 3b = 18    (Equation 2)

Next, let's solve this system of equations for a and b.

Add Equation 1 and Equation 2:

(a + 2b) + (a - 3b) = -17 + 18
2a - b = 1            (Equation 3)

Now let's solve Equation 1 for a:

a = -17 - 2b         (Equation 4)

Substitute the value of a from Equation 4 into Equation 3:

2(-17 - 2b) - b = 1
-34 - 4b - b = 1
-5b = 1 + 34
-5b = 35
b = -7

Now use the value of b to find a, using either Equation 1 or Equation 4:

a = -17 - 2(-7)
a = -17 + 14
a = -3

Now, we need to calculate the values of a and b that will satisfy the input-output pairs. We can do this by setting up a system of equations based on the given data and solving for a and b. Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to set up our system:

Using the input-output pair (-9, 162):
162 = a + b(-9)

Using the input-output pair (17, -254):
-254 = a + b(17)

Solving for a and b using these two equations, we first multiply the first equation by 17 and the second by 9 to eliminate a:

17(162) = 17a - 153b
9(-254) = 9a + 153b

Adding these equations gives:
17(162) + 9(-254) = (17a + 9a) + (-153b + 153b)
2754 - 2286 = 26a
468 = 26a
a = 468 / 26
a = 18

Now we solve for b using the first equation:
162 = 18 - 9b
162 - 18 = -9b
144 = -9b
b = 144 / -9
b = -16

So, the function that fits the data is y = 18 - 16x, which can be written in the exact form requested as:

Output: y = 18x^0 - 16x^1

    ","To use the function y = 18x^0 - 16x^1, which simplifies to y = 18 - 16x, we will substitute x = 18 to find the correct output:

y = 18 - 16(18)
y = 18 - 288
y = -270

Therefore, the output is:

Output: -270",-270,False,"[-16, 18]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to identify the constants \( a \) and \( b \). This form is essentially the equation of a line, given by \( y = a + bx \), where:

- \( a \) is the y-intercept (the value of \( y \) when \( x = 0 \)),
- \( b \) is the slope of the line (the rate at which \( y \) changes for each unit change in \( x \)),

Based on the input-output pairs provided, it seems that the output increases by a consistent amount as the input decreases. To find the slope \( b \), we can use the change in the output divided by the change in the input between any two data points. Let's use the first and second points:

For the input pair (-9, 17), the outputs are (162, -254). Thus, the slope \( b \) can be calculated as:

\[ b = \frac{output_2 - output_1}{input_2 - input_1} = \frac{-254 - 162}{17 - (-9)} = \frac{-416}{26} = -16 \]

The slope \( b \) is therefore -16.

Now we find \( a \) by substituting one of the input-output pairs into the equation \( y = a + bx \). Let's use the first pair:

\[ 162 = a + (-16)(-9) \]
\[ 162 = a + 144 \]
\[ a = 162 - 144 \]
\[ a = 18 \]

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

\[ y = 18 - 16x \]

So the function in the requested form (explicitly as \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \)) is:

\[ y = 18x^0 - 16x^1 \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ y = 18 - 16x \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The provided data points suggest a linear relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y). We want to find the coefficients a and b for the equation of the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

In this expression, ax^0 represents a constant term (since any number to the power of zero is one), and bx^1 represents a linear term (since x to the power of one is x). Our task is to determine the values of a and b.

Let's use two data points to solve for a and b. We'll take the first and last points provided (-9, 162) and (-14, 242):

1. For x=-9, y=162:
162 = a*(-9)^0 + b*(-9)
162 = a - 9b (since any number to the 0th power is 1)

2. For x=-14, y=242:
242 = a*(-14)^0 + b*(-14)
242 = a - 14b

Now we have a system of linear equations:
a - 9b = 162
a - 14b = 242

To solve the system, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. I will subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a and solve for b:

(162 - 242) = (a - 9b) - (a - 14b)
-80 = 5b
b = -80 / 5
b = -16

Now that we have the value for b, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for a. Let's use the first equation:

a - 9(-16) = 162
a + 144 = 162
a = 162 - 144
a = 18

The coefficients are a = 18 and b = -16. Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 18x^0 - 16x^1
y = 18 - 16x

This linear equation matches the form requested (y = ax^0 + bx^1).

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is essentially y = a + bx (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), we'll use two points to solve for the coefficients a and b.

Let's use the following two points to set up a system of linear equations:

Input: -9, Output: 162
Input: 17, Output: -254

For the first point (x1 = -9, y1 = 162), the equation is:
162 = a + b(-9)

For the second point (x2 = 17, y2 = -254), the equation is:
-254 = a + b(17)

Now we have the following system of equations:
1) a - 9b = 162
2) a + 17b = -254

We can solve for a and b using these two equations. First we'll add the equations to eliminate a:

(1) + (2): (a - 9b) + (a + 17b) = 162 - 254
2a + 8b = -92
a + 4b = -46 ...(3)

Now let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to solve for b:
(2) - (1): (a + 17b) - (a - 9b) = -254 - 162
0a + 26b = -416
b = -416/26
b = -16

With the value of b, we use equation (3) to solve for a:
a + 4(-16) = -46
a - 64 = -46
a = -46 + 64
a = 18

So the coefficients are:
a = 18
b = -16

And the function is:
y = 18x^0 - 16x^1

Simplified, that's:
y = 18 - 16x

    To find a linear function that fits the data given, we can use the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is equivalent to y = a + bx because x^0 = 1 for any x other than 0. Given this, we're looking for a linear function y = a + bx that fits the given input-output pairs.

We can use two of the input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations to solve for a and b. For convenience, let's use the input-output pairs (-9, 162) and (17, -254). Plugging these into the equation y = a + bx, we get:

1) For x = -9 and y = 162:
162 = a + b(-9)

2) For x = 17 and y = -254:
-254 = a + b(17)

Now we have two equations:

162 = a - 9b
-254 = a + 17b

a = 162 + 9b

Now, substitute this into the second equation:

-254 = (162 + 9b) + 17b
-254 = 162 + 26b
-416 = 26b
b = -16

Now that we have b, we can solve for a by plugging b back into the equation a = 162 + 9b:

We can use two input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations to solve for a and b. Let's use the input-output pairs (18, 350) and (12, 230):

1. For input x = 18, output y = 350:
   350 = a(18^0) + b(18)

Given that ax^0 is just a constant (since x^0 is always 1), we can treat a as the y-intercept of a linear equation, while b will be the slope.

Here are the steps to determine the coefficients:

1. Consider two data points to calculate the slope (b) of the line.
2. Use the slope to calculate the y-intercept (a).

Let's use the first two data points to calculate the slope (b):

18, 350 and 12, 230. 

The slope (b) is:

b = (Output2 - Output1) / (Input2 - Input1)
b = (230 - 350) / (12 - 18)
b = (-120) / (-6)
b = 20

Output: 9",9,True,"[14, -5]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we first recognize that ax^0 is equal to a because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We need to determine the coefficients a and b such that the function fits the provided input-output pairs.

Given that there are five pairs of inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of linear equations using two of the pairs and solve for a and b. Let's use the first two input-output pairs to set up our equations:

For input 13 and output 177:
177 = a + 13b

For input 14 and output 191:
191 = a + 14b

We can solve this system of equations using the elimination or substitution method. Let's use subtraction to eliminate a:

191 - 177 = (a + 14b) - (a + 13b)
14 = b

Now, we know b = 14. We can plug the value of b into one of the original equations to solve for a:

177 = a + 13(14)
177 = a + 182
a = 177 - 182
a = -5

So, the function becomes y = -5 + 14x, which simplifies to:

y = 14x - 5

To confirm that this function fits all the given input-output pairs, we can plug in the remaining inputs and check if the outputs match:

For input -8:
y = 14(-8) - 5
y = -112 - 5
y = -117 (matches the given output)

For input 3:
y = 14(3) - 5
y = 42 - 5
y = 37 (matches the given output)

For input 7:
y = 14(7) - 5
y = 98 - 5
y = 93 (matches the given output)

Since all given inputs result in the correct outputs with the derived function, we can conclude that the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is indeed:

y = 14x - 5

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function that describes the given points (input-output pairs) using the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can approach this as a simple linear regression problem, recognizing that ax^0 is equivalent to a constant term (because x^0 equals 1).

The function simplifies to:
y = a + bx

We have a system of equations with the provided input-output pairs:

1. 177 = a + 13b
2. 191 = a + 14b
3. -117 = a - 8b
4. 37 = a + 3b
5. 93 = a + 7b

We can solve this system of equations using any two pairs to find the values of a and b. Let’s use pairs (1) and (2) for a system of 2 equations:

191 = a + 14b            (2)
177 = a + 13b            (1)

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a gives:

191 - 177 = (a + 14b) - (a + 13b)
14 = b

Now that we have the value for b, plug it back into any of the original equations to find a. Let’s use equation (1):

177 = a + 13(14)
177 = a + 182
a = 177 - 182
a = -5

Therefore, the function that fits the given data points is:
y = -5 + 14x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the format y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is equivalent to y = a + bx because x^0 is always 1, we need to find the constants a and b such that y equals the Output when x is the Input.

Let's use the given input-output pairs to solve for a and b. We can set up a system of linear equations using two pairs of inputs and outputs. For example, using the inputs 13 and 14:

1. For input 13 (x = 13), output 177 (y = 177):
   177 = a + 13b
   
2. For input 14 (x = 14), output 191 (y = 191):
   191 = a + 14b

Now let's solve for a and b. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

191 - 177 = a + 14b - (a + 13b)
14 = b

Now we can substitute b back into either equation to solve for a. Using the first equation:

177 = a + 13(14)
177 = a + 182
a = 177 - 182
a = -5

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

y = -5x^0 + 14x^1
y = -5 + 14x
