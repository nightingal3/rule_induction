"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the coefficients a and b for the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first recognize that ax^0 is simply a because any number raised to the power of zero is 1. The simplified function is then:

y = a + bx

We are given a set of input-output pairs, and we will use two of them to determine a and b. Let's use the following two pairs: (-10, -213) and (20, 387). Substituting these into our equation gives us two equations:

-213 = a + b(-10)
387 = a + b(20)

Let's solve these two linear equations.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 2 to prepare to eliminate a:

-426 = 2a + b(-20)

Now, let's add this to the second equation:

387 = a + b(20)
-426 = 2a - 20b
---------------------------
-39 = 3a

Now, we can solve for a:

-39 / 3 = a
-13 = a

Now that we have a, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find b. Let's use the second equation:

387 = -13 + b(20)
400 = b(20)
b = 20

So, the coefficients are a = -13 and b = 20. The function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -13 + 20x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the data, we'll first recognize that x^0 equals 1 for all x ≠ 0, which simplifies the function to y = a + bx.

Now, we can use two data points to solve for a and b. We will choose the inputs -10 and 20, mainly because they are the extremes and will likely provide a clearer distinction between the coefficients a and b within the function.

When we use the input -10, the equation becomes:
-213 = a + b(-10)

When we use the input 20, the equation becomes:
387 = a + b(20)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1) -213 = a - 10b
2) 387 = a + 20b

To solve for a and b, we will manipulate these equations -- either by substitution or elimination. I'll use the elimination method:

First, multiply equation 1) by 2 to align the coefficients of a:
2(-213) = 2a - 20b
-426 = 2a - 20b

Now we already have equation 2) as:
387 = a + 20b

Next, we add these two equations together to eliminate b:

(-426) + 387 = (2a - 20b) + (a + 20b)
-39 = 3a

Now solve for a:
a = -39 / 3
a = -13

Now that we have a, we can solve for b. Plug the value of a into one of the initial equations, let's use equation 1):

-213 = (-13) - 10b
-200 = -10b
b = 20

Now with a and b determined, insert them into the equation y = a + bx:

Function: y = -13 + 20x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), we need to determine the values of a and b that best fit the data provided.

Since we have two unknowns (a and b), we would ideally need two data points to solve for these variables directly. However, since we have more than two data points, we need to find a best fit line through the data points. From a pattern recognition perspective, we can try to determine these two constants by looking at the given inputs and outputs.

Let's assume the relationship between the input (x) and the output (y) is linear and find the difference in y values corresponding to the change in x values.

Looking at the given data points, let's consider the change from Input -10 to Input 20, which is an increase of 30 units:
Change in x = 20 - (-10) = 30
Change in y = 387 - (-213) = 600

Thus, the change per unit x under the assumption of a linear relationship would be:
Change in y / Change in x = 600 / 30 = 20

This suggests that b, the coefficient of the linear term (bx^1), might be 20. Next, we need to find the constant term a.

If we plug in the value of b into our linear relationship using one of our data points (let's use the point (4, 67)), we get:
67 = a + 20 * 4
67 = a + 80
a = 67 - 80
a = -13

So our proposed linear function is:
y = -13 + 20x

Now, to validate this, we can apply this function to the other given data points and see if the outputs match.

For Input: -10
y = -13 + 20*(-10) = -13 - 200 = -213 (matches the given Output)

For Input: 9
y = -13 + 20*9 = -13 + 180 = 167 (matches the given Output)

For Input: -3
y = -13 + 20*(-3) = -13 - 60 = -73 (matches the given Output)

For Input: 20
y = -13 + 20*20 = -13 + 400 = 387 (matches the given Output)

    To determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) for the function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\) because \(x^0 = 1\) for any \(x\) that is not zero, we can use two of the given data points to create a system of linear equations and solve for \(a\) and \(b\).

Using the data points:
1) When \(x = -10\), \(y = -213\)
2) When \(x = 20\), \(y = 387\)

We can set up the following system of equations:
1) \(-213 = a + b(-10)\)
2) \(387 = a + b(20)\)

Now we can solve this system. Multiply the first equation by 2 to set up for elimination of \(a\):
1) \(-426 = 2a - 20b\)
2) \(387 = a + 20b\)

Add both equations together to eliminate \(a\):
\(-426 + 387 = 2a - 20b + a + 20b\)

This simplifies to:
\(-39 = 3a\)
\(a = -13\)

Now, plug \(a = -13\) into one of the original equations to solve for \(b\). We'll use the second equation:
\(387 = -13 + 20b\)
\(400 = 20b\)

    To create the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we want to find the constants a and b that fit the provided input-output pairs. We know that x^0 is always 1, so ax^0 simplifies to a. Then our function has the simple linear form:

y = a + bx

Now, let's use two of the given input-output pairs to calculate the values for a and b. It's best to pick two pairs that have different sign inputs to easily solve for both a and b, so let's use the pairs (-10, -213) and (9, 167):

For the input -10:
-213 = a + b(-10)
-213 = a - 10b  ...(1)

For the input 9:
167 = a + b(9)
167 = a + 9b  ...(2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations. Let's solve it using the method of substitution or elimination. First, let's try elimination by adding both equations to eliminate a:

(-213 = a - 10b) + (167 = a + 9b)
-213 + 167 = a - a + -10b + 9b
-46 = -b
b = 46

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either equation to find a. Let's use equation (2):

167 = a + 414
a = 167 - 414

    To find a function that describes the relationship between the given inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we essentially need to determine the constants a and b that would fit a linear relation y = a + bx.

Given that ax^0 is really just a (since x^0 is 1 for any value of x), our task simplifies to finding the right values of a and b for a linear equation y = a + bx.

Looking at one of the data points where x is 0:

Input: 0
Output: -3

Plugging into y = a + bx gives us -3 = a + b(0),
which simplifies to -3 = a.

Now we know that a = -3. The function simplifies to y = -3 + bx.

Let's use another point to find b. Starting with an Input that is easy to work with,

Input: -3
Output: 54

Plugging these values into the equation y = -3 + bx,

54 = -3 + b(-3).

Adding 3 to both sides gives

57 = -3b,
which means that

b = -57 / -3,
b = 19.

So now we have determined that a = -3 and b = 19, meaning the function that fits the data provided is:

y = -3 + 19x,

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first simplify the expression ax^0 + bx^1 into a + bx because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Next, we need to determine the values for coefficients a and b from the given input-output pairs. We can set up a system of linear equations using two of the provided data points to solve for a and b. Let's use the following points for our calculations: (0, -3) and (-18, 339).

Using the point (0, -3):
-3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)
-3 = a + 0
-3 = a         ...(Equation 1)

Using the point (-18, 339):
339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, essentially, we are looking for a linear function where ax^0 is a constant (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is simply bx (because any number to the power of 1 is itself). Therefore, the function will be of the form:

y = a + bx

We can find the values of a and b by solving a system of linear equations given the input-output pairs. However, as we are working with more than two pairs, it is an overdetermined system. Instead, we can use two of the input-output pairs to derive a system of two equations and then check if the resulting function fits the rest of the data points.

Let's use the following two pairs as they have an input of 0, which will make one equation simpler:
1. Input: 0, Output: -3
2. Input: -18, Output: 339

y = a + b(0) => -3 = a (This tells us that a must be -3)

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to form two equations using the given input-output pairs. Since ax^0 is a constant (because any number to the power of 0 is 1), we can simplify this to y = a + bx. We need to solve for a and b. 

Let's use two of the given points to form the equations. We can use (5, -31) and (9, -51):

1. -31 = a + b(5)
2. -51 = a + b(9)

Let's solve this system of linear equations, by subtracting the first equation from the second one:

-51 - (-31) = a + 9b - (a + 5b)
-51 + 31 = a + 9b - a - 5b
-20 = 4b
b = -20 / 4
b = -5

Now that we have b, let's solve for a using one of the equations. Let’s use the first equation:

-31 = a + (-5)(5)
-31 = a - 25
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -6x^0 - 5x^1

y = -6 - 5x.

    Given the inputs and outputs, we can try to find a linear relationship of the form:

\[ y = a(x^0) + b(x^1) \]

Here, \( x^0 \) is always 1 regardless of the value of \( x \) (since any number to the power of zero equals one), so this simplifies our function to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

We can plug in the given input-output pairs to generate a system of equations:

1. \( -31 = a + b(5) \) => \( -31 = a + 5b \)
2. \( -51 = a + b(9) \) => \( -51 = a + 9b \)
3. \( 49 = a + b(-11) \) => \( 49 = a - 11b \)
4. \( 14 = a + b(-4) \) => \( 14 = a - 4b \)
5. \( 54 = a + b(-12) \) => \( 54 = a - 12b \)

We have a system of five equations but since our model is linear and has only two parameters, we only need two equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the first two equations:

From equation 1:
\[ a = -31 - 5b \]

Substitute \( a \) from equation 1 into equation 2:
\[ -51 = (-31 - 5b) + 9b \]
\[ -51 = -31 + 4b \]
\[ 4b = -51 + 31 \]
\[ 4b = -20 \]
\[ b = -5 \]

Now we can substitute \( b \) back into the equation for \( a \):

\[ a = -31 - 5(-5) \]
\[ a = -31 + 25 \]
\[ a = -6 \]

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

\[ y = -6 + (-5)x \]

    To find the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 = 1 for any x except 0, we can use two of the given points to form a system of linear equations and solve for a and b.

Let's use the points (7, -98) and (-6, 58):

For x = 7, y = -98:          -98 = a + 7b   ... (1)
For x = -6, y = 58:           58 = a - 6b   ... (2)

Now we solve this system of equations:

From (1) we get: a = -98 - 7b
Substituting a in (2) gives us: 58 = -98 - 7b - 6b
Combining like terms results in: 156 = -13b
Dividing both sides by -13 gives us: b = -12

Now that we have b, we can use either (1) or (2) to solve for a. Let's use (1):

-98 = a + 7(-12)
-98 = a - 84
Adding 84 to both sides yields: a = -14

Now that we have a = -14 and b = -12, the function that describes the relationship is:

y = -14x^0 - 12x^1

    To determine the coefficients a and b that define the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we must remember that x^0 is always 1 for any x except for x=0 (by convention, 0^0 is undefined). Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We can use any two unique input-output pairs to solve for a and b.

Let's take the input-output pairs (7, -98) and (17, -218) for our calculations:

For the 1st pair with input 7:
y = a + b(7); 
-98 = a + 7b.  ... [Equation 1]

For the 2nd pair with input 17:
y = a + b(17); 
-218 = a + 17b. ... [Equation 2]

Now, we have a system of two linear equations with two variables (a and b). We can solve these equations for a and b.

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(-218) - (-98) = (a + 17b) - (a + 7b);
-218 + 98 = a + 17b - a - 7b;
-120 = 10b;
b = -120 / 10; 
b = -12.

Now that we have b, we can find a by plugging b back into one of the equations. Let's use Equation 1:

-98 = a + 7(-12);
-98 = a - 84;
a = -98 + 84;
a = -14.

Thus, the function describing the relationship between the inputs and outputs as provided is:

    To find the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that would cause the function to produce the given outputs for the given inputs. Let's write down what we know using the formula given:

1. \( -98 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1 \) which simplifies to \( -98 = a + 7b \)
2. \( -218 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1 \) which simplifies to \( -218 = a + 17b \)
3. \( -74 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1 \) which simplifies to \( -74 = a + 5b \)
4. \( -50 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1 \) which simplifies to \( -50 = a + 3b \)
5. \( 58 = a(-6)^0 + b(-6)^1 \) which simplifies to \( 58 = a - 6b \)

We can use two sets of these equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). For simplicity, let's pick equations (4) and (5) to solve for the constants:

\( -50 = a + 3b \)
\( 58 = a - 6b \)

We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using the method of simultaneous equations. By adding these two equations together, we can solve for \( a \):

\( (58) + (-50) = (a - 6b) + (a + 3b) \)
\( 8 = 2a - 3b \)
\( 8 + 3b = 2a \)
\( 4 + \frac{3}{2}b = a \)   ...(Equation 6)

Now, let's solve for \( b \):
Substitute Equation 6 into either equation (4) or (5), we use (4) for this example:

\( -50 = (4 + \frac{3}{2}b) + 3b \)
\( -50 = 4 + \frac{9}{2}b \)
\( -54 = \frac{9}{2}b \)
\( b = -54 * \frac{2}{9} \)
\( b = -12 \)

Now we can find \( a \) using \( b \):
\( a = 4 + \frac{3}{2}(-12) \)
\( a = 4 - 18 \)
\( a = -14 \)

Let's use the points (7, -98) and (17, -218). Plugging these into the function form:

-98 = a + 7b     (1)
-218 = a + 17b    (2)

We can solve this system of equations by using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use the elimination method:

First, let's organize the equations:

a + 7b = -98    (1)
a + 17b = -218  (2)

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

a + 17b - (a + 7b) = -218 - (-98)
a + 17b - a - 7b = -218 + 98
10b = -120

Now solve for b:

b = -120 / 10
b = -12

Now that we have b, we can plug it into equation (1) or (2) to solve for a. Let's use equation (1):

    To determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) in the linear equation \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we can use a pair of input-output values to form two equations and solve for \(a\) and \(b\). The general form of the equation will be \(y = a + bx\), since \(x^0\) is 1 for any \(x\) and \(x^1\) is just \(x\).

Let's use the input-output pairs (7, -98) and (-6, 58) to form the system of equations:

1. Using input 7: \(-98 = a + 7b\)
2. Using input -6: \(58 = a - 6b\)

Now, we need to solve for \(a\) and \(b\).

Let's multiply equation 2 by 7 to make it easier to eliminate \(a\):

\(7 \cdot 58 = 7a - 42b\)

\(406 = 7a - 42b\)

Now, multiply equation 1 by 6:

\(6 \cdot -98 = 6a + 42b\)

\(-588 = 6a + 42b\)

Adding these two new equations together eliminates \(b\):

\(406 - 588 = (7a - 42b) + (6a + 42b)\)

\(-182 = 13a\)

\(a = -182 / 13\)

\(a = -14\)

Now let's solve for \(b\) by substituting \(a = -14\) into the first original equation:

\(-98 = -14 + 7b\)

\(-98 + 14 = 7b\)

\(-84 = 7b\)

\(b = -84 / 7\)

\(b = -12\)

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of the coefficients a and b based on the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) that best fit the given input-output pairs.

First, let's simplify the equation:

\( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any non-zero \( x \), and \( x^1 = x \).

Now we need to find values for \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a + bx \) produces the given outputs for the corresponding inputs.

Given the following pairs:

1. For input \( x = -13 \), the output \( y = -197 \),
2. For input \( x = -11 \), the output \( y = -169 \),
3. For input \( x = 20 \), the output \( y = 265 \),
4. For input \( x = -10 \), the output \( y = -155 \),
5. For input \( x = 7 \), the output \( y = 83 \),

Let's plug the first pair into the equation to see if we can find a pattern:

\( y = a + bx \) -> \( -197 = a + b(-13) \)

If we do the same for the second pair:

\( y = a + bx \) -> \( -169 = a + b(-11) \)

We can set these two equations and try to eliminate one of the variables \( a \) or \( b \) to solve for the other.

However, we have more pairs to consider, and it looks like there's a consistent difference between the x and y values of these pairs. If you look at the difference in output when the input increases by one unit:

Between the first and fourth points:
From input -13 to -10 (a change of +3), the output goes from -197 to -155 (a change of +42).

Between the second and fifth points:
From input -11 to +7 (a change of +18), the output goes from -169 to +83 (a change of +252).

This suggests a linear relationship between the input and output, as a consistent change in input results in a consistent change in output. Let's find the change in the output per unit change in input:

From -13 to -10 (input change of +3), the output changes +42; thus, per unit input, the output changes by \( \frac{+42}{+3} = +14 \).

From -11 to +7 (input change of +18), the output changes +252; thus, per unit input, the output changes by \( \frac{+252}{+18} = +14 \).

It seems that \( b = +14 \) because for each increase of 1 in the input, the output increases by 14.

Now, let's find \( a \) using one of our points. I'll use the point (-10, -155):

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the provided data points, we need to determine the coefficients a and b. Given the form of the function, we know that:

- ax^0 is equivalent to a since x^0 is 1 for any x not equal to 0.
- bx^1 is simply bx, as x^1 is x.

So, we need to find a and b that will satisfy the equation y = a + bx for each input-output pair given. This form is equivalent to a linear equation y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.

Looking at the outputs, there's a pattern suggesting a linear relationship where the difference between each x and y pair seems constant. This indicates that the function might be of the form y = mx + c, and in this case, our comparison to y = ax^0 + bx^1 suggests that b is the slope (like m) and a is the y-intercept (like c).

Let's use two data points to determine the slope (b):

Using points (-13, -197) and (-11, -169), we can find b:
b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-169 - (-197)) / (-11 - (-13))
b = (28) / (2)
b = 14

We'll now find values for a and b that allow this linear function to fit the given input-output pairs. We need to solve the system of equations for two pairs of inputs and outputs to find a and b.

-169 = -197 + 2b

Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. Now let's use the provided points to determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\).

Let's start by looking at the patterns in the outputs in relation to the inputs:

For input 7, output 83:

Thus, b = 14.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first recognize that any term with x^0 is simply a constant term because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. This means that a is the y-intercept. The term bx^1 is simply bx since anything raised to the power of 1 is itself. So we're looking for a function:

y = a + bx

From the given data points, we will find two equations involving a and b and solve them. Let's use two of the provided input-output pairs to create two equations:

Using the input-output pair (9, 160): 
1. 160 = a + 9b

Using the input-output pair (-20, -333):
2. -333 = a - 20b

Now we will solve this system of equations. Multiply the first equation by 20 and the second equation by 9 to eliminate variable a:

20 * 160 = 20a + 180b      ==> 3200 = 20a + 180b
9 * -333 = 9a - 180b       ==> -2997 = 9a - 180b

Now add these two equations:

3200 + (-2997) = (20a + 180b) + (9a - 180b)
203 = 29a

Divide both sides by 29 to solve for a:

a = 203 / 29
a ≈ 7

Plug the value of a into one of the original equations to solve for b. We'll use the first equation:

160 = 7 + 9b
153 = 9b
b = 153 / 9
b = 17

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which is equivalent to \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 = 1 \) and \( x^1 = x \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that will fit the given inputs and outputs.

Firstly, since this is a linear equation, it would be helpful to determine the differences between outputs for a one-unit increase in the input. However, because our inputs are irregularly spaced, we can't directly compute a common difference between consecutive outputs.

Thus, to determine \( a \) and \( b \), we can use a pair of inputs and outputs as a system of two linear equations:

1. \( 160 = a + 9b \)
2. \( 228 = a + 13b \)

Now, we can solve this system for \( a \) and \( b \). Subtract the first equation from the second equation to solve for \( b \):

\( 228 - 160 = a + 13b - (a + 9b) \)
\( 68 = 4b \)
\( b = 17 \)

Now, we can substitute the value of \( b \) into one of our original equations to solve for \( a \):

\( 160 = a + 9 \cdot 17 \)
\( 160 = a + 153 \)
\( a = 160 - 153 \)
\( a = 7 \)

Using our determined values for \( a \) and \( b \), we can write the function:

\[ \text{Output: } y = 7 + 17x \]

This function should fit the given data points. Let's verify with one of the inputs:

Using \( x = 9 \):
\[ y = 7 + 17 \cdot 9 \]
\[ y = 7 + 153 \]
\[ y = 160 \]

Which matches with the given output for the input of 9. Thus, the function:

    To determine the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the data, we need to first note that the term ax^0 will be equal to a, since any number (except zero) to the zeroth power is 1. The function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We will now use two pairs of inputs and outputs to calculate the coefficients a and b. Ideally, we'd use a system of linear equations to solve for a and b. Let's take the first two input-output pairs (9, 160) and (13, 228).

Using the input x = 9 and output y = 160, we have:
160 = a + b(9)

Using the input x = 13 and output y = 228, we have:
228 = a + b(13)

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1) a + 9b = 160
2) a + 13b = 228

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
(228 - 160) = (a + 13b) - (a + 9b)
68 = 4b
b = 68 / 4
b = 17

We can now substitute the value of b back into either equation to solve for a. Using equation 1):

Let's call the inputs x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5 and the outputs y1, y2, y3, y4, and y5. We can set up a system of linear equations:

1. a + 9b = 160
2. a + 13b = 228
3. a - 4b = -61
4. a + 15b = 262
5. a - 20b = -333

Using equation 3 and equation 5, we can solve for a and b:

a - 4b = -61   -> a = -61 + 4b (equation 6)
a - 20b = -333 -> We can substitute a from equation 6 into this equation:

(-61 + 4b) - 20b = -333

-61 - 16b = -333
16b = 333 - 61
16b = 272
b = 272 / 16
b = 17

Note that this solution assumes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is linear and uses only two points to derive a and b. It will be a precise description if the actual relationship is linear and the points are indeed on that same line; otherwise, it's an approximation based on two points selected.

Multiplying the first equation by 7 (to align the terms for the elimination method) gives:

    To find a function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are essentially looking for an equation of a line, which can be typically represented as:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Here, \( a \) is the y-intercept (the constant term) and \( b \) is the slope of the line. We need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that best fit the provided data points. Given that there are multiple data points, we will use two of them to calculate the slope \( b \) and then find \( a \).

Let's use the data points (20, -307) and (-1, 8) to calculate the slope \( b \):

\[ b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{8 - (-307)}{-1 - 20} = \frac{8 + 307}{-21} = \frac{315}{-21} = -15 \]

Now that we have \( b \), we'll use one of the data points to solve for \( a \). Let's use the point (-1, 8):

\[ 8 = a + (-15)(-1) \]
\[ 8 = a + 15 \]
\[ a = 8 - 15 \]
\[ a = -7 \]

Therefore, the function that fits the given data points is:

\[ y = -7x^0 - 15x^1 \]

\[ y = -7 - 15x \]

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we need to recognize that ax^0 is just a constant term (since any number to the zero power is 1), and bx^1 simplifies to bx (since any number to the first power is the number itself). This means we are looking for a linear function in the form y = a + bx, where 'a' is the y-intercept and 'b' is the slope of the line.

Given the data points:
(x1, y1) = (20, -307)
(x2, y2) = (-1, 8)

We can use these two points to calculate the slope (b):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (8 - -307) / (-1 - 20)
b = (8 + 307) / (-21)
b = 315 / -21
b = -15

Now that we have b, we can use one of the points to solve for 'a'. It's generally best to use the original points to minimize error accumulation. We'll use the point (20, -307):

-307 = a + (-15)(20)
-307 = a - 300
a = -307 + 300
a = -7

So our function is y = -7 - 15x. However, this does not fit the form you asked for (y = ax^0 + bx^1). To fit the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we rewrite it as:

y = -7x^0 - 15x^1

y = -7 + (-15)x

    Given that the function should be in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, recognize that ax^0 is a constant term since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, ax^0 simplifies to a. So the function is now:

y = a + bx

To find a and b, we will use two different inputs and their corresponding outputs to set up a system of linear equations.

Let's use the points (20, -307) and (-1, 8):

For the point (20, -307):
-307 = a + 20b      (1)

For the point (-1, 8):
8 = a - b           (2)

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations for a and b.

a = 8 + b          (3)

-315 = 21b
b = -315 / 21
b = -15

a = 8 - 15
a = -7

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to determine the constants 'a' and 'b'. This form essentially represents a linear equation:

y = a + bx

Given that x^0 is always equal to 1 for any non-zero 'x', we need to solve for 'a' and 'b' such that our equation fits the given input-output pairs. As there are five points and we are looking for a linear relationship, there could be some error if the points do not lie perfectly on a straight line, but we will assume that they do for simplicity.

Using the two different input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations:

1) From the input 20 and output -307:
-307 = a + 20b

2) From the input -1 and output 8:
8 = a - 1b

Now we have a system of two equations:

-307 = a + 20b  ...(1)
8 = a - b  ...(2)

We can now solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply equation (2) by 20 to match the b coefficient of equation (1):

20*8 = 20a - 20b
160 = 20a - 20b

Now add this new equation to equation (1) to eliminate b:

-307 = a + 20b
160 = 20a - 20b
-----------------
-147 = 21a

Now we solve for 'a':

a = -147 / 21
a = -7

Now that we have 'a', we can use either of the two equations to solve for 'b'. Let's use equation (2):

8 = a - b
8 = -7 - b
b = -7 - 8
b = -15

So the term \(ax^0\) effectively represents a constant term \(a\). The \(bx^1\) term is just \(bx\) since \(x^1 = x\). Thus, we are looking for a function in the form:

Given that, we can try to determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) using the provided input-output pairs. Let's take two pairs to set up a system of equations:

Taking the inputs \(x = 0\) and \(x = 13\):

1. For \(x = 0\) and \(y = 12\), we have:

    To find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) for the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can start by acknowledging \( ax^0 \) is the same as \( a \) because any number to the power of zero is 1.

So our function is \( y = a + bx \), and we need to find values for \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the given input-output pairs.

Looking at the pairs:

1. For Input: 13, Output: -66, the function becomes \( -66 = a + 13b \).

4. For Input: 0, Output: 12, the function becomes \( 12 = a \).

We have five equations, but we only need two of them to solve for \( a \) and \( b \) since it is a system of linear equations. Since we have the value of \( a \) directly from the input 0 (equation 4 tells us that \( a = 12 \)), we can plug this into any of the other equations to solve for \( b \).

Let's use the first equation where the input is 13:
\( -66 = 12 + 13b \) 
\( -66 - 12 = 13b \) 
\( -78 = 13b \) 
\( b = -78 / 13 \)

    The given points suggest a linear relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y). The function of a line in the slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-intercept. Comparing this to the requested format y = ax^0 + bx^1, we see that:

- ax^0 corresponds to the y-intercept, since x^0 is always 1, so a is the y-intercept.
- bx^1 corresponds to the slope, since x^1 is simply x, so b is the slope.

Given the input-output pairs, we have enough information to calculate the slope (b) and y-intercept (a). Using two points, for instance (13, -66) and (-20, 132), we can find the slope (b) by:

b = (Output2 - Output1) / (Input2 - Input1)
b = (132 - (-66)) / (-20 - 13)
b = (132 + 66) / (-33)
b = 198 / -33
b = -6

Now that we have the slope, we can substitute one of the points along with the slope into the equation to find a (the y-intercept):

    To find a function that represents the given input-output pairs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 = 1 for any x ≠ 0, we need to establish the values for a and b that will satisfy the equations for each pair.

Let's establish a system of equations using two of the input-output pairs. It's often simplest to use the pair with an input of zero, since that will give us the value of a directly. Using the input 0, output 12:

12 = a + b(0)
12 = a

Now we know that a is 12. We can substitute this value into another pair to solve for b. For ease, let's use the pair with input 11, output -54:

-54 = 12 + b(11)
-54 - 12 = b(11)
-66 = b(11)
b = -66 / 11

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we need to determine the coefficients a and b.

Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, simplifies to y = a + bx since anything raised to the power of zero is 1.

Here are the given input-output pairs laid out:

(13, -66): -66 = a + b(13)
(-20, 132): 132 = a + b(-20)
(18, -96): -96 = a + b(18)
(0, 12): 12 = a + b(0) -> (since b(0) is zero, this directly gives us a)
(11, -54): -54 = a + b(11)

From the (0, 12) input-output pair, we can immediately determine that a = 12 since b(0) is 0. Now, let's substitute a = 12 into the other equations to determine b:

(13, -66): -66 = 12 + b(13)
(-20, 132): 132 = 12 + b(-20)
(18, -96): -96 = 12 + b(18)
(11, -54): -54 = 12 + b(11)

Now, let's solve for b using one of the equations. We'll choose the equation from the input of 13 for simplicity:

-66 = 12 + b(13)
-66 - 12 = b(13)
-78 = b(13)
b = -78 / 13
b = -6

To ensure this is correct, we should verify that this value of b works for the other given points:

For (-20, 132):
132 = 12 - 6(-20)
132 = 12 + 120
132 = 132 (which is correct)

This reduces the function to one with an intercept (a) and a slope (b). Given a set of inputs and outputs, we can try to determine a and b.

Looking at the data, it seems that each input-output pair (x, y) fits a linear pattern. If we have two distinct points, we can determine the slope (b) of this linear function by:

\[ b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Once we have b, we can plug one of the points back into the equation \( y = b \cdot x + a \) to solve for a.

Let's take the first two points to calculate b:

1. For the first point (-17, -325), we have:
   \( x_1 = -17, y_1 = -325 \)

2. For the second point (-5, -109), we have:

Substituting these into the slope formula gives us:

\[ b = \frac{-109 + 325}{-5 + 17} \]
\[ b = \frac{216}{12} \]
\[ b = 18 \]

\(-325 = a - 17b\)

For the second point:
\(-109 = a + b(-5)\)

2) \( a - 5b = -109 \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can start by simplifying the expression. Since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, ax^0 simplifies to a. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

To determine the constants a and b, we need to use the input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations.

Using the input-output pairs (-17, -325) and (-5, -109), we can set up the following equations:

1) For the input x = -17 and output y = -325:
-325 = a + b(-17)  ... (i)

2) For the input x = -5 and output y = -109:
-109 = a + b(-5)   ... (ii)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables (a and b). We need to solve this system to find the values of a and b.

Let's subtract equation (ii) from equation (i) to solve for b:

(-325) - (-109) = a - a + b(-17) - b(-5)
-325 + 109 = -12b
-216 = -12b
b = -216 / -12
b = 18

Now that we have the value for b, we can solve for a using either original equation. Substituting b into equation (ii):

-109 = a + 18(-5)
-109 = a - 90
a = -109 + 90
a = -19

So, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = -19 + 18x

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can recognize that ax^0 is the same as a because any number (except zero) raised to the power of 0 is 1. Hence, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given this form, we can solve for a and b using two of the input/output pairs:

1. Using the first input/output pair (-17, -325):
   -325 = a + b(-17)

2. Using the second input/output pair (-5, -109):
   -109 = a + b(-5)

We now have a system of linear equations. Let's solve for a and b using these equations:

-325 = a - 17b
-109 = a - 5b

To solve for b, we can subtract the second equation from the first:

-325 - (-109) = a - 17b - (a - 5b)
-325 + 109 = -17b + 5b
-216 = -12b
b = 18

Now, we can solve for a by substituting the value of b into one of the original equations:

-325 = a - 17b
-325 = a - 17(18)
-325 = a - 306
a = -325 + 306

    To determine the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) as expressed by a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the constants a and b that will fit the data points provided. Note that ax^0 is just a since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

The general linear function is:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = a + bx

This function implies that for each unit increase in x, y increases by b units, and a is the y-intercept. Let's look at the provided data points to see if we can determine a pattern.

Given two points (x1, y1) = (10, 142) and (x2, y2) = (-10, -158), we can create a system of two linear equations to solve for a and b:

1) 142 = a + 10b
2) -158 = a - 10b

Now, let's solve this system for a and b.

Add the two equations to eliminate b:

142 = a + 10b
-158 = a - 10b
---------------
-16 = 2a
 
Divide by 2 to solve for a:
a = -16 / 2
a = -8

Now that we have the value of a, we can substitute it into either equation to find b.

Using equation 1):

142 = a + 10b
142 = -8 + 10b
150 = 10b
b = 150 / 10
b = 15

    To find the linear function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using the given input-output pairs. The form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any x except zero.

Given at least two points, we can find the slope (\( b \)) of the function:

Using Input (10) and Output (142):
\( 142 = a + b \cdot 10 \) (1)

And using Input (-10) and Output (-158):
\( -158 = a + b \cdot (-10) \) (2)

Now, we can solve these two equations as a system to isolate \( a \) and \( b \).

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to get:
\( 142 - (-158) = a - a + b \cdot 10 - b \cdot (-10) \)
\( 300 = 20b \)
\( b = 15 \)

Now we substitute \( b \) back into equation (1) to solve for \( a \):
\( 142 = a + 15 \cdot 10 \)
\( 142 = a + 150 \)
\( a = 142 - 150 \)
\( a = -8 \)

Let's use two of the given data points to solve for 'a' and 'b':

Using the points (10, 142) and (-10, -158):

1. For input 10, output is 142:
   142 = a + 10b

2. For input -10, output is -158:
   -158 = a - 10b

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

Equation 1: a + 10b = 142
Equation 2: a - 10b = -158

We can solve this system of equations by adding both equations together to solve for 'a':

(a + 10b) + (a - 10b) = 142 - 158
2a = -16
a = -16 / 2
a = -8

Now that we have a value for 'a', we can plug it back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find the value for 'b'. We'll use Equation 1:

We can write down the equations for each of the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

For input 10: 
142 = a + 10b

For input 15:
217 = a + 15b

For input -10:
-158 = a - 10b

For input -4:
-68 = a - 4b

For input 13:
187 = a + 13b

We now have a set of five equations with two unknowns. This system is overdetermined, meaning that there are more equations than unknowns. In such cases, we can either find an exact solution if one exists or determine an approximate solution using a method such as least squares.

However, since this is a pattern recognition task we only need to find values for a and b that fit all given points. For simplicity, let's use the first and third equations to solve for a and b, because they involve the same absolute input value (10 and -10), which will simplify the math:

(1) 142 = a + 10b
(3) -158 = a - 10b

By adding equation (1) and equation (3), we can solve for a:

(1) + (3): 142 - 158 = a + 10b + a - 10b
-16 = 2a
a = -8

    To find a function of the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we are essentially seeking a linear function in the form of \(y = a + bx\), because \(x^0 = 1\) for any x except for x=0, so \(ax^0\) simplifies to \(a\), and \(bx^1\) simplifies to \(bx\). This is a standard linear equation where \(a\) is the y-intercept and \(b\) is the slope.

Given the five points, we can find two that we can use to calculate the slope \(b\) of this function:

Let's use the points (10, 142) and (-10, -158):

\( b = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \)
\( b = \frac{142 - (-158)}{10 - (-10)} \)
\( b = \frac{142 + 158}{10 + 10} \)
\( b = \frac{300}{20} \)
\( b = 15 \)

Now that we have the slope, we can solve for \(a\) using one of the points:

The term bx^1 is simply bx, since any number raised to the power of 1 is that number itself. We thus have a straight line where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope.

We can determine the slope (b) by finding the change in y divided by the change in x between two data points. Let's use the first two points (-1, -8) and (5, 76):

Change in y = 76 - (-8) = 84
Change in x = 5 - (-1) = 6

So the slope (b) is:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

which simplifies to:

y = a + bx

where a and b are constants, x is the input, and y is the output.

To find a and b, we can use two points from the given data to set up a system of equations and solve for a and b. Let's use the points (1, 2) and (-19, 122):

1) Using the point (1, 2):
2 = a + b(1)
2 = a + b

2) Using the point (-19, 122):
122 = a + b(-19)
122 = a - 19b

Now we have a system of two equations:

a + b = 2
a - 19b = 122

We can solve this system by subtracting the second equation from the first:

a + b - (a - 19b) = 2 - 122
a + b - a + 19b = -120
20b = -120

Now, solving for b:

b = -120 / 20
b = -6

Plugging the value of b back into one of the original equations to solve for a. Using a + b = 2:

a + (-6) = 2
a - 6 = 2
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

Now we have the values for a and b:

a = 8
b = -6

The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = 8 - 6x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that captures the relationship between the input \( x \) and the output \( y \), we can recognize that \( ax^0 \) is a constant term (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1) and \( bx^1 \) is simply \( bx \). Hence, we are looking for a linear function:

\( y = a + bx \)

Where \( a \) is the y-intercept and \( b \) is the slope of the line.

Let's use two points to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). We'll take (1, 2) and (-19, 122) as our points.

Point 1: Input \( x_1 = 1 \), Output \( y_1 = 2 \)
Point 2: Input \( x_2 = -19 \), Output \( y_2 = 122 \)

Using the two points, we can set up the following system of linear equations:

1) \( 2 = a + b \cdot 1 \)
2) \( 122 = a + b \cdot (-19) \)

Solving the system, we can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( b \):

\( (2 - 122) = (a - a) + b \cdot (1 - (-19)) \)

\( -120 = 20b \)

\( b = -6 \)

We can then plug \( b \) into equation 1 to solve for \( a \):

\( 2 = a - 6 \cdot 1 \)

\( a = 8 \)

Thus, our function is:

\( y = 8 - 6x \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). This form is essentially a linear equation \( y = a + bx \), because \( x^0 \) equals 1 for all x (except for x=0, where it is undefined), and \( x^1 \) equals \( x \).

Given the inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's take two distinct pairs of inputs and outputs to set up our equations:

Let's use the pairs (1, 2) and (-19, 122) to set up the system. For the input-output pair (1, 2), we have:
2 = a(1)^0 + b(1)^1
2 = a + b

And for the pair (-19, 122), we have:
122 = a(-19)^0 + b(-19)^1
122 = a - 19b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1) a + b = 2
2) a - 19b = 122

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Adding equations 1) and 2) to eliminate \( b \), we get:
( a + b ) + ( a - 19b ) = 2 + 122
2a - 18b = 124

Now divide the entire equation by 2:
a - 9b = 62

Now let's solve for \( a \) in equation 1) and then substitute it in the above equation:
a = 2 - b

Substitute this into a - 9b = 62:
(2 - b) - 9b = 62
2 - 10b = 62
-10b = 62 - 2
-10b = 60
b = -6

Now we have the value for \( b \). Let's substitute it back into equation 1) to find \( a \):
a + (-6) = 2
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

Thus, the coefficients of our function are \( a = 8 \) and \( b = -6 \). And our final function in the desired form is:

\( y = 8(-20)^0 - 6(-20)^1 \)

\( y = 8(1) - 6(-20) \)

\( y = 8 + 120 \)

\( y = 128 \)

Therefore, the output for an input of -20 is 128.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can interpret ax^0 as a (because anything raised to the power of zero is 1), and bx^1 as bx (because anything raised to the power of one is itself). Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can create two equations using two points from the given input-output pairs to solve for a and b:

1. Using the input-output pair (1, 2):
2 = a + b(1)
2 = a + b

2. Using the input-output pair (-6, 44):
44 = a + b(-6)
44 = a - 6b

With these two equations, we can set up a system to solve for a and b:

(1) a + b = 2
(2) a - 6b = 44

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

(a + b) - (a - 6b) = 2 - 44
a + b - a + 6b = -42
7b = -42
b = -42 / 7
b = -6

Now using the value of b in equation (1):

a + (-6) = 2
a - 6 = 2
a = 8

Now we have the values for a and b, so the function is:

y = 8 + (-6)x

    To find a function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \), we need to find the constants \( a \) and \( b \).

Given the set of input-output pairs:

- For input \( x = 1 \), the output \( y = 2 \), which gives us equation (1): \( 2 = a + b \times 1 \).
- For input \( x = -19 \), the output \( y = 122 \), which gives us equation (2): \( 122 = a - 19b \).
- For input \( x = 17 \), the output \( y = -94 \), which gives us equation (3): \( -94 = a + 17b \).
- For input \( x = 15 \), the output \( y = -82 \), which gives us equation (4): \( -82 = a + 15b \).
- For input \( x = -6 \), the output \( y = 44 \), which gives us equation (5): \( 44 = a - 6b \).

We can solve the system of linear equations for \( a \) and \( b \) using any two equations. Let's use equations (1) and (2) for simplicity.

Equation (1): \( 2 = a + b \)      ... (1)
Equation (2): \( 122 = a - 19b \) ... (2)

We can solve these simultaneously. Multiply equation (1) by 19:

\( 38 = 19a + 19b \) ... (1') and then add it to equation (2):

\( 122 = a - 19b \)  ... (2)
---------------------
\( 160 = 20a \)

This leads to \( a = \frac{160}{20} \), so \( a = 8 \).

Now that we have \( a \), we can substitute it into equation (1) to find \( b \):

\( 2 = 8 + b \)

    To describe the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) as y = ax^0 + bx^1, we essentially have to find the coefficients a and b that fit the data provided. Since ax^0 is just a (because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), we are actually looking for the equation:

y = a + bx

Now, let's use two points to solve for the coefficients a and b. We'll take the points (-17, -292) and (1, 14) for this purpose.

Substituting these points into the equation gives us two equations:

-292 = a + b(-17)  [1]
14 = a + b(1)      [2]

Now, we can solve these equations to find the values of a and b.

From [2]:
14 = a + b
b = 14 - a           [3]

Now, substituting b from [3] into [1]:
-292 = a - 17(14 - a)
-292 = a - 238 + 17a
-292 = 18a - 238
-292 + 238 = 18a
-54 = 18a
a = -54 / 18
a = -3

Now, put the value of a into [3] to find b:

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we should identify the constants a and b that fit the data provided.

First, let's simplify the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1 is equivalent to y = a + bx, because any number to the power of 0 is 1.

Now, let's use two data points to solve for a and b. It's typically best to use two points that are far apart to reduce potential rounding inaccuracies. We'll use the inputs -17 and 1.

Let's plug them into the equation:

For the input -17 (where x = -17 and y = -292):
-292 = a + b(-17), which gives us equation (1).

For the input 1 (where x = 1 and y = 14):
14 = a + b(1), which simplifies to a + b, which gives us equation (2).

Now we have two equations:

1) -292 = a - 17b
2) 14 = a + b

Next, let's solve the system of equations. We can subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

-292 - 14 = a - 17b - (a + b)
-306 = -18b
b = 17

Now we can substitute b back into equation (2) to find a:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we need to determine the values of a and b that will satisfy the relationship between the given inputs (x) and outputs (y).

Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we know that x^0 is always 1, so the equation can be rewritten as y = a + bx. Therefore, we are looking for the values of a and b for which the equation y = a + bx can generate the outputs when given the corresponding inputs.

Let's start by viewing the input-output pairs as coordinates (x, y) and setting up a system of equations.

Using the first input-output pair (-17, -292) and the second input-output pair (-6, -105), we have:
-292 = a + b(-17)
-105 = a + b(-6)

Now we can solve this system of two linear equations to find the values of a and b. First, let's arrange the equations:

1) a - 17b = -292
2) a - 6b = -105

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate a:

(1) - (2): (a - 17b) - (a - 6b) = (-292) - (-105)
-17b + 6b = -292 + 105
-11b = -187

Now solve for b:

b = -187 / -11
b = 17

To find a and b, we can set up a system of linear equations using the provided inputs and outputs. Since we have more than two points, the system might be overdetermined, but we can still attempt to find a and b that will fit all the data points provided.

Using the first two data points:

For input -7 (output 130):
130 = a - 7b.

For input 14 (output -290):
-290 = a + 14b.

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) a - 7b = 130
2) a + 14b = -290

We can solve this system by multiplying the first equation by 2 and then adding it to the second equation to eliminate a:

2 * (a - 7b) = 2 * 130 -> 2a - 14b = 260
(2a - 14b) + (a + 14b) = 260 - 290
3a = -30.

Solving for a gives us:

a = -30 / 3
a = -10.

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b. Using the first equation:

-7b = 130 + 10
-7b = 140

Add equation (3) to equation (2):

4. For input 16, output -330 (we will use this twice since it is repeated):
   \( y = a(16)^0 + b(16)^1 \)
   \( -330 = a + 16b \)

To find the constants \(a\) and \(b\), we only need two unique equations. Let's take the equations from inputs -7 and 14.

From input 14:
\( -290 = a + 14b \)
So,
\( a = -290 - 14b \) ---(Equation 1)

From input -7:
\( 130 = a - 7b \)
Substitute \(a\) from Equation 1 into this:
\( 130 = (-290 - 14b) - 7b \)
\( 130 = -290 - 14b - 7b \)
\( 130 + 290 = -21b \)
\( 420 = -21b \)
\( b = -20 \)

Now that we have \(b\), we can solve for \(a\) using Equation 1:
\( a = -290 - 14(-20) \)
\( a = -290 + 280 \)
\( a = -10 \)

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) is:
\[ y = -10x^0 - 20x^1 \]
\[ y = -10 - 20x \]

    To find a function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we can note that this is a linear function of the form y = b * x + a (since x^0 = 1), where a and b are constants that we want to determine.

Given the data points:

1. When x = -7, y = 130
2. When x = 14, y = -290
3. When x = -12, y = 230
4. When x = 16, y = -330
5. Repeat of (4)

Let's use the first two data points to determine the constants a and b.

From the first data point (x = -7, y = 130):
130 = b * (-7) + a .... (1)

From the second data point (x = 14, y = -290):
-290 = b * 14 + a .... (2)

Now we have a system of equations:

1) -7b + a = 130
2) 14b + a = -290

To solve for b and a, multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate a when subtracting it from the second equation:

-14b + 2a = 260
Adding to the second equation:
(14b + a) + (-14b + 2a) = -290 + 260
3a = -30
a = -30 / 3
a = -10

Now plug the value of a into one of the equations to find b. Using equation (1):

-7b - 10 = 130
-7b = 140
b = 140 / -7
b = -20

So, the function that describes the data is:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -10 * 1 + (-20) * x
y = -10 - 20x

This function can now be tested against all data points to determine if it accurately represents the relationships for those inputs and outputs.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to solve the system of equations given by the input-output pairs. Since ax^0 is a constant term (because x^0 = 1 for any x), we can denote it simply as a. Our function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's take two different inputs to create two equations and solve for a and b.

Using the input-output pairs (14, -290) and (-7, 130), we get two equations:

1. For x = 14: y = a + b(14) = -290
2. For x = -7: y = a + b(-7) = 130

These equations are:

1. a + 14b = -290
2. a - 7b = 130

We can now solve this system of equations. First, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a.

a + 14b - (a - 7b) = -290 - 130
a + 14b - a + 7b = -420
21b = -420
b = -420 / 21
b = -20

Now we will substitute the value of b into one of the equations to solve for a. We'll use equation 2 for this purpose.

a - 7(-20) = 130
a + 140 = 130
a = 130 - 140
a = -10

Thus, the coefficients are a = -10 and b = -20. The function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is then:

We are given a set of input-output pairs as follows:

1. Input: -14, Output: -97
2. Input: 7, Output: 50
3. Input: 2, Output: 15

The equation we are looking for will thus look like this:

y = a + bx

Let's substitute the given input-output pairs into this equation to create a system of equations.

For the input -14, output -97:

-97 = a - 14b

For the input 7, output 50:

50 = a + 7b

For the input 2, output 15:

15 = a + 2b

We can use any two equations to solve for a and b. I'll use the last two for simplicity:

(1) 50 = a + 7b
(2) 15 = a + 2b

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

50 - 15 = a + 7b - (a + 2b)
35 = 5b

Now, divide both sides by 5:

b = 7

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into equation (2) to solve for a:

15 = a + 2b
15 = a + 2(7)
15 = a + 14

Subtract 14 from both sides to solve for a:

a = 1

    Given the data, we're looking to establish a linear relationship in the form of:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

which simplifies to

\[ y = a + bx \]

where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants that we need to determine. Since \( ax^0 = a \cdot 1 \), \( ax^0 \) represents the y-intercept term and \( bx^1 = bx \) is the slope term.

We have pairs of data points to work with:

1. (-14, -97)
2. (7, 50)
3. (2, 15)

We can use any two distinct points to calculate the constants \( a \) and \( b \). We'll use the first and third points to find \( b \) first:

Point 1: \( x_1 = -14, y_1 = -97 \)
Point 3: \( x_2 = 2, y_2 = 15 \)

Apply the slope formula \( b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \):

\[ b = \frac{15 - (-97)}{2 - (-14)} \]
\[ b = \frac{15 + 97}{2 + 14} \]
\[ b = \frac{112}{16} \]
\[ b = 7 \]

Now that we know \( b \), we can use it to find \( a \). Take point 3 to solve for \( a \):

\[ 15 = a + 7 \cdot 2 \]
\[ 15 = a + 14 \]
\[ a = 15 - 14 \]

Given the input-output pairs:
\[
\begin{align*}

\]

We can see that the first and third pairs give us enough variation to determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\). Let's use these two points to write down a system of equations:

For \(x = -14\), \(y = -97\):
\[
-97 = a + b(-14)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-97 = a - 14b \tag{1}
\]

For \(x = 2\), \(y = 15\):
\[
15 = a + b(2)
\]
Which simplifies to:
\[
15 = a + 2b \tag{2}
\]

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find \(a\) and \(b\). Adding (1) and (2) together to eliminate \(a\), we get:
\[

\[
-82 = 2a - 12b
\]
Dividing by 2:
\[
-41 = a - 6b \tag{3}

Now, if we subtract equation (2) from (3), we get:
\[
-41 - 15 = (a - 6b) - (a + 2b)

\[
-56 = -8b

Dividing by -8:
\[
b = 7

\[

Let's take the pairs (-14, -97) and (2, 15) for our calculation.

For the first pair, where the input is -14 and the output is -97, we get:  
\( -97 = a + b(-14) \)  
\( -97 = a - 14b \) ... (1)

\( 15 = a + 2b \) ... (2)

Now we can solve the system of equations (1) and (2) for \( a \) and \( b \).

    To find the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can set up a system of linear equations using the given pairs of (x, y).

Let's use two points (x1, y1) = (-14, -97) and (x2, y2) = (2, 15) to find coefficients a and b. Plugging these into the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1 yields two equations:

For (x1, y1) = (-14, -97):

-97 = a - 14b

15 = a + 2b

We now have a system of two linear equations:
1) -97 = a - 14b
2)  15 = a +  2b

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. I'll use the elimination method:

Multiply the second equation by 7 to align with the b term in the first:
14) 105 = 7a + 14b

Now, we add equations 1 and 14 to eliminate b:
1) -97 =  a - 14b
14) 105 = 7a + 14b
-----------------
  8 = 8a

Divide both sides by 8 to solve for a:
a = 8 / 8
a = 1

Using any two of these equations, we can solve for a and b. Let's use the first two equations:

1. \( a + 5b = -26 \)
2. \( a + 1b = -14 \)

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:

\( (a + 5b) - (a + b) = -26 - (-14) \)
\( 4b = -12 \)
\( b = -3 \)

Now that we have b, we can plug it into one of the equations to solve for a. Using the second equation:

\( a - 3 = -14 \)
\( a = -11 \)

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

\( y = -11 + (-3)x \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function that matches the given inputs and outputs in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand this represents a linear function where:

- ax^0 is the y-intercept (because x^0 is always 1, so this is just a constant term a)
- bx^1 is the slope times the input value (since x^1 is just x, this simplifies to bx)

To find a and b, we will use two of the given data points to create a system of linear equations.

Using the data points:

1) Input: -9, Output: 64
2) Input: -3, Output: 22

For the first data point, when the input is -9:
64 = a(-9)^0 + b(-9)
64 = a + (-9b)

For the second data point, when the input is -3:
22 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)
22 = a + (-3b)

Now we have a system of linear equations:
a - 9b = 64
a - 3b = 22

We can solve this system by subtracting the second equation from the first to find b, and then use either equation to solve for a. Let's do this step by step:

a - 9b - (a - 3b) = 64 - 22
a - 9b - a + 3b = 42
-6b = 42
b = 42 / -6
b = -7

Now we'll use b = -7 in one of the original equations to find a. We'll use the second equation for convenience:

a - 3(-7) = 22
a + 21 = 22
a = 22 - 21
a = 1

Putting these together, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = 1x^0 + (-7)x^1
y = 1 - 7x

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs for the given data points is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we will perform a linear regression on the data provided using the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is essentially y = a + bx, where 'a' is the y-intercept and 'b' is the slope of the line.

Let's visualize the input-output pairs as coordinates (x, y):

(-9, 64)
(-3, 22)
(9, -62)
(-5, 36)
(-16, 113)

We will now use the two-point formula for a line to calculate the slope (b):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

However, since there are multiple points, we cannot determine the slope with just two points without additional information. The slope needs to be consistent for all points if they are to lie on a straight line. In practice, we would use linear regression techniques to find the best-fitting line for these points.

For simplicity and due to the lack of computing capability here, we can calculate the slope (b) by picking two data points and then check if the resulting line fits all other points.

Let's use (-9, 64) and (-3, 22):

b = (22 - 64) / (-3 + 9) = -42 / 6 = -7

Now let's test this slope with the rest of the data points to see if we have a consistent line. To calculate the y-intercept (a), use one of the points:

y = a + bx
64 = a - 7(-9)
64 = a + 63
a = 64 - 63
a = 1

Now we have a potential function:

y = 1 - 7x

Let's verify this function with another data point (9, -62):

-62 = 1 - 7(9)
-62 = 1 - 63
-62 = -62

The function matches this point. Let's quickly check all other points as well:

(-5, 36):
36 = 1 - 7(-5)
36 = 1 + 35
36 = 36  (matches)

(-16, 113):
113 = 1 - 7(-16)
113 = 1 + 112
113 = 113 (matches)

The function y = 1 - 7x fits all the given data points, so we can consider this function as a reasonable model for the relationship between the inputs and outputs:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we need to find the coefficients a and b.

First, let's recall that x^0 is always equal to 1. Therefore, the function can be simplified to:

y = a + bx

Given the pairs of input (x) and output (y), we need to find a and b such that:

y = a + bx

For the first pair of input/output (-9, 64), the equation becomes:

64 = a - 9b

For the second pair (-3, 22):

22 = a - 3b

Now we have two equations with two variables:

1) 64 = a - 9b
2) 22 = a - 3b

We can solve for a and b using these two equations. First, by subtracting the second equation from the first, we eliminate a and can solve for b:

(64 - 22) = (a - a) - (9b - 3b)
42 = -6b
b = -7

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using either equation 1 or 2:

Using equation 2:
22 = a - 3(-7)
22 = a + 21
a = 1

So the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = 1 - 7x

Please note that the provided function y = 1 - 7x must be validated by checking if it works correctly for the other given points. Let's do that:

For x = -16:
y = 1 - 7(-16)
y = 1 + 112
y = 113 (matches the given output)

For x = -5:
y = 1 - 7(-5)
y = 1 + 35
y = 36 (matches the given output)

For x = 9:
y = 1 - 7(9)
y = 1 - 63
y = -62 (matches the given output)

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), it's important to note that \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any x except for x=0 (which is undefined in this context). Thus, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Given this form, we need to determine the values of a and b which best fit the provided data. We will use two points from the given data to solve for a and b. Let's choose the first two points for convenience:

For Input -9, Output 64:
\( 64 = a + b(-9) \)

For Input -3, Output 22:
\( 22 = a + b(-3) \)

These are two simultaneous equations we can solve for a and b. Let's call the first equation (1) and the second equation (2).

From equation (2):
\( a = 22 + 3b \)

Now substitute this expression for a into equation (1):
\( 64 = (22 + 3b) + b(-9) \)
\( 64 = 22 + 3b - 9b \)
\( 64 = 22 - 6b \)
\( 6b = 22 - 64 \)
\( 6b = -42 \)
\( b = -7 \)

Now, we place the value of b into a's equation:
\( a = 22 + 3(-7) \)
\( a = 22 - 21 \)
\( a = 1 \)

So the function that fits the data is:

    To find the function that best describes the relationship between the given inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can observe that the requested function must be linear since it has been restricted to the form of:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

where \( a \) is the y-intercept and \( b \) is the slope of the line. Given that we have multiple points, we can compute the differences between points to estimate the slope and then find the intercept.

Taking the first two given points (-9, 64) and (-3, 22):

The slope \( b \) can be estimated by:

\[ b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

\[ b = \frac{22 - 64}{-3 - (-9)} \]

\[ b = \frac{-42}{6} \]

\[ b = -7 \]

Now, we can use one of the points to solve for \( a \). Let's use the first point (-9, 64):

\[ y = a + bx \]

\[ 64 = a - 7(-9) \]

\[ 64 = a + 63 \]

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to recognize the pattern between the given inputs and outputs. 

Let's recall that \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any x ≠ 0, so we essentially need to find values for a and b such that:

\( y = a + bx \)

Given the data points:

1. For input -20, output 265:
\[ a - 20b = 265 \]

2. For input -15, output 195:
\[ a - 15b = 195 \]

3. For input -5, output 55:
\[ a - 5b = 55 \]

4. For input -10, output 125:
\[ a - 10b = 125 \]

5. For input 6, output -99:
\[ a + 6b = -99 \]

Using any two of these equations, we can solve for a and b. For simplicity, we can use the pair of equations that likely makes the arithmetic easiest, such as the equations from inputs -5 and 6:

\[ a - 5b = 55 \]
\[ a + 6b = -99 \]

By solving this simple system of equations, we get:

Adding both equations, we obtain:

\[ 2a + b = -44 \]

Now, we need to pick another equation to solve for one of the variables. We’ll use the equation from the input -5:

\[ a - 5b = 55 \]

Now we multiply this equation by 2 to help eliminate one of the variables when added to the previous sum:

\[ 2a - 10b = 110 \]

Adding this to \( 2a + b = -44 \), we get:

\[ 4a - 9b = 66 \]

\( (2a + b = -44) \times 2 \) gives us:

\[ 4a + 2b = -88 \]

Now subtracting \( 4a - 9b = 66 \) from \( 4a + 2b = -88 \), we eliminate a:

\( (4a + 2b) - (4a - 9b) = -88 - 66 \)

We get:

\( 11b = -154 \)

Dividing by 11:

\( b = -14 \)

Now we can solve for a using one of the original equations:

\[ a - 5b = 55 \]

\[ a - 5(-14) = 55 \]

\[ a + 70 = 55 \]

\[ a = 55 - 70 \]

\[ a = -15 \]

3. For x = -5, y = 55
4. For x = -10, y = 125
5. For x = 6, y = -99

We can already see that the output appears to increase as the input becomes less negative, and decreases as the input becomes positive, suggesting that b is negative. To calculate a and b explicitly, we could use a method such as linear regression. However, we can also make use of two data points and solve the resulting linear system to get the values for a and b.

Let's take two points to calculate the slope (b):

Using points (x1, y1) = (-20, 265) and (x2, y2) = (6, -99),

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-99 - 265) / (6 - (-20))
b = (-364) / (26)

1. When \(x = -20\), \(y = 265\):

2. When \(x = 6\), \(y = -99\):
\(-99 = a + b(6)\)

The system of equations to solve is:
\(265 = a - 20b\)

We can solve this by using substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method:

Add both equations to eliminate \(a\):
\(265 + (-99) = a - 20b + a + 6b\)
\(166 = 2a - 14b\)

Divide the entire equation by 2:
\(83 = a - 7b\)

Now let's isolate \(a\) in the second original equation:
\(-99 = a + 6b\)
\(a = -99 - 6b\)

Substitute the expression for \(a\) into \(83 = a - 7b\):
\(83 = (-99 - 6b) - 7b\)
\(83 = -99 - 13b\)
\(83 + 99 = -13b\)
\(182 = -13b\)
\(b = -182 / 13\)

We can subtract the pair (-5, 55) from (-10, 125) to eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( b \):

For \( (-10, 125) \), we have

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given points, we can recognize that ax^0 is the same as a coefficient without an x variable next to it (since anything to the power of 0 is 1), indicating it's the y-intercept of the function, and bx^1 is simply b times x. Thus, we are looking for a linear function of the form:

y = a + bx

Given the points, we can plug each pair into this equation to create a system of equations. However, because we have more than two points, we have an overdetermined system, meaning we have more equations than unknowns. We can still attempt to find the best possible values for a and b that fit all given points, essentially solving a linear regression problem.

To simplify the computation, we can notice that the relationship between the inputs and outputs seems to be linear since they change at a constant rate. We can therefore pick two points to determine the function. Let's use the first and last points:

Now let's solve for a and b by using the method of substitution or elimination. I’ll use elimination in this case. Multiply the second equation by 20, and the first equation by 6 to eliminate a:

-99 * 20 = 20a + 120b  (2') --> -1980 = 20a + 120b
265 * 6 = 6a - 120b   (1') --> 1590 = 6a - 120b

Adding equations (1') and (2') gives:

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given input-output pairs, we need to determine the constants a and b such that the function describes the relationship correctly. As ax^0 is just a (since anything to the power of zero is 1), we are essentially looking for a function of the form y = a + bx.

Let's use two distinct input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations that we can solve for a and b. We'll use the pairs (-10, -54) and (4, 2).

Equation 1 (using input -10 and output -54):
-54 = a + b(-10)

Equation 2 (using input 4 and output 2):
2 = a + b(4)

Now, let's solve this system of equations. First, rearrange the equations to isolate a on one side:

Equation 1: a = -54 + 10b
Equation 2: a = 2 - 4b

Now, set the expressions for a from both equations equal to each other:

-54 + 10b = 2 - 4b

Adding 4b to both sides and adding 54 to both sides to solve for b:

14b = 56

b = 56 / 14
b = 4

Now that we have b, we can solve for a by substituting b = 4 into either Equation 1 or Equation 2. Let's use Equation 2:

2 = a + 4(4)
2 = a + 16

Subtracting 16 from both sides to solve for a:

a = 2 - 16
a = -14

Now we have the constants a and b, and the function that describes the data is:

y = -14 + 4x

So, in the exact form requested:

Output: y = -14x^0 + 4x^1

    To find a linear function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can treat this like a traditional y=mx+b equation, where \( ax^0 \) represents the y-intercept (because \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any x other than 0) and \( bx^1 \) is just bx (since \( x^1 \) is x).

Given the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]
\[ y = a + bx \]

We have two pairs of inputs and outputs that we can use to solve for a and b:

Let's take the pairs x = -10 & y = -54 and x = 4 & y = 2.

For the pair (x = -10, y = -54):
\[ -54 = a + b(-10) \]
\[ -54 = a - 10b \]

For the pair (x = 4, y = 2):
\[ 2 = a + b(4) \]
\[ 2 = a + 4b \]

Now we have a system of equations:

\[ -54 = a - 10b \]
\[ 2 = a + 4b \]

We can solve this system of equations by using the method of substitution or elimination. I'll use the elimination method:

1. Multiply the second equation by 2.5 to align the a coefficients:

\[ 5 = 2.5a + 10b \]

2. Add the modified second equation to the first one:

\[ -54 = a - 10b \]
\[ 5 = 2.5a + 10b \]
\-------------------
\[ -49 = 3.5a \]

3. Solve for a:

\[ a = -49 / 3.5 \]
\[ a = -14 \]

4. Substitute the value of a into either of the two original equations to solve for b. Let's use the second equation:

\[ 2 = -14 + 4b \]
\[ 4b = 16 \]
\[ b = 4 \]

So the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can first simplify this to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x except for \( x = 0 \).

We have the following pairs of inputs and outputs:
1. \( x = -10 \), \( y = -54 \)
2. \( x = 4 \), \( y = 2 \)
3. \( x = -20 \), \( y = -94 \)
4. \( x = -4 \), \( y = -30 \)

Let's consider the first two data points to solve for coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). We can set up two equations based on our function \( y = a + bx \).

For \( x = -10 \), \( y = -54 \):
\[ -54 = a + b(-10) \]
\[ -54 = a - 10b \]

For \( x = 4 \), \( y = 2 \):
\[ 2 = a + b(4) \]
\[ 2 = a + 4b \]

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1. \( a - 10b = -54 \)
2. \( a + 4b = 2 \)

Let's solve this system:

From the second equation:
\[ a = 2 - 4b \]

Substitute into the first equation:
\[ (2 - 4b) - 10b = -54 \]
\[ 2 - 14b = -54 \]
\[ -14b = -54 - 2 \]
\[ -14b = -56 \]
\[ b = \frac{-56}{-14} \]
\[ b = 4 \]

Now we'll find \( a \) using the second equation with \( b = 4 \):
\[ a = 2 - 4(4) \]
\[ a = 2 - 16 \]
\[ a = -14 \]

So our function is:
\[ y = -14 + 4x \]

To verify the correctness, we can check the rest of the data points:
For \( x = -20 \): \( y = -14 + 4(-20) = -14 - 80 = -94 \), which matches.

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we need to find the values of `a` and `b` in the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Firstly, ax^0 is always a since any number to the zeroth power is 1. Hence, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs:

1) When x = -10, y = -54,
-54 = a + b(-10)

2) When x = 4, y = 2,
2 = a + 4b

3) When x = -20, y = -94,
-94 = a + b(-20)

4) When x = -4, y = -30,
-30 = a + b(-4)

From the first and third inputs, we can create two equations:
-54 = a - 10b
-94 = a - 20b

If we subtract the first equation from the third equation:
-94 - (-54) = (a - 20b) - (a - 10b)
-40 = -10b
b = 4

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute b into the second equation:
2 = a + 4(4)
2 = a + 16
a = 2 - 16
a = -14

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

To confirm this is valid with all given data:
For x = -10, y = -14 + 4(-10) = -14 - 40 = -54

We have a system of two linear equations:
1) a - 10b = -54
2) a +  4b = 2

Solving this system, we can substitute equation 2 in equation 1 to eliminate a:

a = 2 - 4b
(2 - 4b) - 10b = -54
2 - 14b = -54
-14b = -54 - 2
-14b = -56
b = -56 / -14
b = 4

    In order to find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the given inputs (x) and outputs (y), one can note that ax^0 is equivalent to a, because any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can use two points to determine the values of a and b. Let's pick two points from the provided data:

Point 1 (x1, y1): (-11, -20)
Point 2 (x2, y2): (-2, -2)

Now let's set up two equations based on the points:

-20 = a + b(-11)
-2 = a + b(-2)

The system of equations can then be solved as follows:

-20 = a - 11b
-2 = a - 2b

Solving for a and b, let's subtract the second equation from the first:

-20 - (-2) = (a - a) - 11b - (-2b)
-18 = -9b
b = 2

Now let's use the value of b to solve for a using the second equation:

The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's take two pairs from the provided data set to form a system of equations:

Pair 1 (Input: -11, Output: -20):
-20 = a + b(-11)

Pair 2 (Input: -2, Output: -2):
-2 = a + b(-2)

From Pair 1:
-a = b(11) - 20    ...(1)

From Pair 2:
-a = b(2) - 2      ...(2)

Set equations (1) and (2) equal to each other and solve for b:

    To find the coefficients `a` and `b` that describe the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to understand that `ax^0` is a constant term because `x^0` equals `1` for any `x`, and `bx^1` simplifies to `bx`. So we are looking for a linear function of the form `y = a + bx`.

We can find `a` and `b` by setting up a system of equations using the input-output pairs we've been given. However, since this is a linear function with only two unknowns, we only need two input-output pairs to solve for the coefficients. Let's use the pairs (-11, -20) and (-2, -2).

First pair (-11, -20): `-20 = a + b(-11)`

Now let's solve this system of equations. First, let's solve the second equation for `a`:

`-2 = a - 2b`
`a = -2 + 2b`  (Equation 1)

Now let's substitute Equation 1 into the first equation:

`-20 = -2 + 2b - 11b`
`-20 = -2 - 9b`

Given the pattern of the inputs and outputs, we see that the output increases by a roughly constant amount as the input increases, which suggests a linear relationship y = a + bx.

We need two points to determine the line. Let's pick the inputs and outputs (10, 176) and (17, 302):

1. For input 10:

2. For input 17:

To solve for a and b, we use the two equations we have:

From equation 1:

Since we have more than two pairs of points and we are trying to fit them into a linear equation, we can attempt to find a pattern or use the pairs to set up a system of equations to solve for a and b. However, we should first check if a linear relationship exists.

Noticing that the increase in input from 10 to 13 results in a consistent increase in the output:

- From 10 to 12, the input increase is 2, and the output increase is 212 - 176 = 36.
- From 12 to 13, the input increase is 1, and the output increase is 230 - 212 = 18.

The change in output is exactly half when the input change is halved, which suggests a linear relation.

These points are symmetric about the y-axis. The difference in x for these two points is 34 (17 - (-17) = 34), and the difference in y is 612 (302 - (-310) = 612). This gives us the slope b:

b = (difference in y) / (difference in x) = 612 / 34 = 18

Now we have the slope b = 18. We can insert this value back into the equation with one of the points to find a. Using x = 10 and y = 176:

176 = a + 18(10)
176 = a + 180
a = 176 - 180
a = -4

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the constants `a` and `b` in a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx (because any number to the power of 0 is 1), we need to use the input-output pairs provided.

Let's take two points to determine the linear function:

Using the input-output pair (10, 176) and (12, 212):
(1) 176 = a + 10b
(2) 212 = a + 12b

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values for `a` and `b`.

Let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
212 - 176 = (a + 12b) - (a + 10b)
36 = 2b
b = 18

Now that we have b, we can solve for a by substituting b back into one of the equations:

a = 176 - 180

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) such that the function accurately maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs.

Given the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we note that \( x^0 \) is always 1, so the term \( ax^0 \) simplifies to just \( a \). Then, \( bx^1 \) is simply \( bx \) since any number raised to the power of 1 is itself. This simplifies our function to:
\[ y = a + bx \]

Let's find the coefficients by using the given input-output pairs. We can use two pairs to set up a system of linear equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Using the input-output pairs (10, 176) and (17, 302), we get:
1. \( 176 = a + 10b \)
2. \( 302 = a + 17b \)

Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( b \):
\( 302 - 176 = a + 17b - (a + 10b) \)
\( 126 = 7b \)
\( b = 126 / 7 \)
\( b = 18 \)

Now, using the value of \( b \), we can plug it back into either equation 1 or 2 (let's use equation 1) to find \( a \):
\( 176 = a + 10 \cdot 18 \)
\( 176 = a + 180 \)
\( a = 176 - 180 \)
\( a = -4 \)

    To find the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use two of the input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations. Since ax^0 is just a (because any number to the power of zero is 1), the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's use the following two points: (18, -315) and (-16, 297). This gives us two equations:

1. For the input 18: -315 = a + 18b
2. For the input -16: 297 = a - 16b

We can solve this system of equations to find a and b.

For the first equation:
-315 = a + 18b -> a = -315 - 18b ----(3)

Substitute a from equation (3) into the second equation:
297 = (-315 - 18b) - 16b
297 = -315 - 18b - 16b
297 = -315 - 34b
297 + 315 = -34b
612 = -34b
b = -612 / 34
b = -18

Now, we can substitute b back into equation (3) to find a:
a = -315 - 18(-18)
a = -315 + 324
a = 9

So the coefficients are a = 9 and b = -18. The function is:

Firstly, we note that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) (except for \( x = 0 \)), which simplifies our equation to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Now, let's use the two distinct pairs of inputs and outputs to set up a system of equations:

Using the input \( x = -16 \) and output \( y = 297 \):
\[ 297 = a - 16b \] (1)

Using the input \( x = 18 \) and output \( y = -315 \):
\[ -315 = a + 18b \] (2)

Now, we will solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's first add both equations to eliminate \( a \):

\[ (297) + (-315) = (a - 16b) + (a + 18b) \]
\[ -18 = 2a + 2b \]
\[ -9 = a + b \] (3)

Now, let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

\[ (297) - (-315) = (a - 16b) - (a + 18b) \]
\[ 612 = -34b \]
\[ b = \frac{612}{-34} \]
\[ b = -18 \]

Now we'll plug the value of \( b \) back into equation (3) to find \( a \):

    To determine the coefficients ""a"" and ""b"" in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is equivalent to y = a + bx, we need to use two data points to solve for these unknowns. Let's use the following two data points:

1. Input: -16, Output: 297, which gives us equation (1): 297 = a + b(-16)
2. Input: 5, Output: -81, which gives us equation (2): -81 = a + b(5)

Now we can solve this system of linear equations to find values for a and b.

Starting with equation (1):
297 = a - 16b

And equation (2):
-81 = a + 5b

We can use the method of elimination or substitution. I'll use elimination:

Multiply equation (2) by 3 to align the a terms, and then add the equations to solve for b:
-243 = 3a + 15b          (Multiplied equation (2) by 3)
297 = a - 16b              (Equation (1))

Adding these two equations, we get:
54 = 4a - b
54 + b = 4a
(54 + b) / 4 = a

Now we can rewrite equation (1) using the expression for a:
297 = (54 + b) / 4 - 16b
Multiplying through by 4 to clear the fraction we get:
1188 = 54 + b - 64b
1134 = -63b
b = -1134 / -63
b = 18

Substitute b back into one of the original equations to solve for a:

    To determine the coefficients `a` and `b` in the function `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we can set up a system of equations based on the input-output pairs provided. Note that `x^0` is always 1 for any x except for x=0 (which does not affect our calculation since we have no such inputs), so we can simplify this to `y = a + bx`.

Given the pairs:
1. When x = -16, y = 297
2. When x = 18, y = -315
3. When x = -5, y = 99
4. When x = 5, y = -81

We have four equations:
1. a - 16b = 297
2. a + 18b = -315
3. a - 5b = 99
4. a + 5b = -81

We can solve the system of equations using any two pairs since the relationship is linear. For simplicity, let's use the third and fourth pair because the coefficients for b have the same absolute value:

From (3) a - 5b = 99
From (4) a + 5b = -81

Add these two equations:
(3) + (4) => a - 5b + a + 5b = 99 - 81
=> 2a = 18
=> a = 9

Substitute the value of `a` back into equation (3):

9 - 5b = 99
-5b = 99 - 9
-5b = 90
b = -18

Now we have determined the coefficients `a` and `b`. So, the function is:

y = a + bx

Now we need to find the constants a and b. Let's use two of the data points to set up a system of linear equations. For example, let's use the data points (-16, 297) and (18, -315):

1) 297 = a + b(-16)
2) -315 = a + b(18)

Now we have a system of two equations that we can solve for a and b.
Stacking these equations:

297 = a - 16b    ---(1)
-315 = a + 18b   ---(2)

Adding up (1) and (2) to eliminate a:

For the input -18 and output -265, the equation is:
-265 = a + b(-18)

For the input 19 and output 253, the equation is:

Now we have two equations:
1) -265 = a - 18b
2) 253 = a + 19b

We can solve this system of equations using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution in this case. Let's solve the first equation for a:

a = -265 + 18b

Now we can substitute this expression for a into the second equation:

Combine like terms:

Add 265 to both sides to isolate the term with b:

Divide both sides by 37 to solve for b:

2a + b = -12  
2a = -12 - b  
a = (-12 - b)/2  ...(3)

Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the slope of the line (b) can be calculated using the formula:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

We can use any two points from the given data to find the slope (b). Let's take (x1, y1) = (-18, -265) and (x2, y2) = (19, 253):

b = (253 - (-265)) / (19 - (-18))
b = (253 + 265) / (19 + 18)
b = 518 / 37

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can create a system of equations to solve for a and b. However, since we only need two points to define a line, we'll take two pairs of input-output to create two equations and solve for a and b.

1. Using the pair (-18, -265):
-265 = a*(-18)^0 + b*(-18)

-265 = a - 18b

2. Using the pair (19, 253):

-12 = 2a + b
b = -12 - 2a

We can substitute b in either I or II to find a. Let's use II:

Add the two equations to eliminate 'a':

a - 18b + a + 19b = -265 + 253
2a + b = -12

Now let's isolate 'b':

b = -12 - 2a

We need one more equation to find 'a'. Let's multiply the first equation by 19 and the second by 18 to line up the terms for elimination:

19(a - 18b) = 19(-265)
18(a + 19b) = 18(253)

Which gives us:

19a - 342b = -5035
18a + 342b = 4554

Now we can add these two equations:

19a - 342b + 18a + 342b = -5035 + 4554
37a = -481

Now divide by 37:

a = -481 / 37
a = -13

Now, let's substitute 'a' back into the expression we created for 'b':

b = -12 - 2(-13)
b = -12 + 26
b = 14

Thus, the linear function that best describes the data provided is:

y = -13 + 14x

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \). The function can be simplified to \( y = a + bx \), since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) except for \( x = 0 \), in which case the definition is more subtle but conventionally \( 0^0 \) is considered to be 1 in the context of polynomials and mathematical functions.

The given inputs and outputs can be written as a system of equations:

1. For input 0: 
   \( -15 = a + b(0) \)
   \( -15 = a \)

2. Choose another point to find \( b \), for example, input -5:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y), we will use the given input-output pairs to determine the coefficients a and b.

Firstly, note that x^0 is equal to 1 for any non-zero x, and a is the y-intercept of the function. Therefore, with the given pairs, we can figure out the value of a.

Let's take the first input-output pair (0, -15) to determine the value of a:

Input: 0
Output: -15

y = ax^0 + bx^1
-15 = a * 1 + b * 0
-15 = a

So, a = -15.

Now, we want to find b, which is the slope of the function. We can use any other given input-output pair to calculate b. Let's choose the pair (-4, -31):

Input: -4

y = ax^0 + bx^1
-31 = (-15) * 1 + b * (-4)

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, let's interpret the elements of the function:

- bx^1 is simply bx because any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself.

Given the data, we want to determine the values of a and b that make the function y = a + bx fit the data well.

Let's start by plugging the points we know into the function y = a + bx and form a system of equations:

1. For Input 0, Output -15:
-15 = a + b(0)
-15 = a (because b(0) is 0)

2. We can use this value of a to simplify our investigation because it seems that a doesn't change with different inputs. So, the function simplifies to y = -15 + bx.

    To find a function of the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1` that best fits the given data points, we need to determine the coefficients `a` and `b`. The `ax^0` is equivalent to `a` since anything raised to the power of zero is one. Hence, the function simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

1. When `x = 0`, `y = -15`, therefore `a = -15` since `b*0 = 0`.
2. When `x = -5`, `y = -35`, we have `a - 5b = -35`.

    To develop a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we should observe that ax^0 is always a (since any nonzero number to the power of 0 is 1). The term bx^1 is simply bx because any number to the power of 1 is the number itself. So, we are essentially looking for a function of the form:

y = a + bx

We have a set of inputs (x) and outputs (y), and we can use two of those points to solve for a and b.

Let's use the inputs -5 and 5, which correspond to outputs -35 and 5, respectively:

For x = -5, y = -35:
-35 = a + b(-5)

For x = 5, y = 5:
5 = a + 5b

Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1. -35 = a - 5b
2. 5 = a + 5b

Solving these equations simultaneously, we can add them to eliminate b:

-35 + 5 = a - 5b + a + 5b

    To determine the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the values of a and b that will fit the given input/output pairs provided. The term ax^0 is equivalent to a, since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function takes the simpler form y = a + bx.

Given the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can set up a system of equations to find the coefficients a and b. I'll use two pairs of input and output to create two equations.

Using the input-output pair (9, 133) and (19, 283), we can set up the following equations:

1) For x = 9, y = 133: 133 = a + 9b
2) For x = 19, y = 283: 283 = a + 19b

Let's solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. First, solve one of the equations for a. We will solve the first equation for a:

a = 133 - 9b (equation 3)

Now substitute a in the second equation with the expression found from equation 3:

283 = (133 - 9b) + 19b
283 = 133 - 9b + 19b
283 - 133 = 10b
150 = 10b
b = 15

Now that we have the value of b, we can find a using the equation 3:

    To find the function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we have to recognize that `ax^0` is a constant term (since any number raised to the power of zero is one). So `ax^0` is equivalent to some constant 'c', and the function simplifies to `y = c + bx`. We need to find the values of 'c' and 'b' that best match the given data.

Given the inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations to solve for 'c' and 'b':

For input 9 and output 133:
1) 133 = c + 9b 

For input 19 and output 283:
2) 283 = c + 19b 

We can use any two equations to solve for 'c' and 'b'. Let's use equations 1 and 2.

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate 'c':

(283 - 133) = (c + 19b) - (c + 9b)
150 = 10b
b = 15

Now that we have 'b', we can solve for 'c' using either equation 1 or 2. Let's use equation 1:

133 = c + 135
c = 133 - 135
c = -2

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we first need to understand that ax^0 is always equal to a since any number to the zeroth power is 1. So what we're really looking for is a function that has the form y = a + bx. 

Given this form, we have the constants a and b to determine. We can find these constants by setting up a system of linear equations using the input-output pairs. We can pick two pairs to set up our system of equations because we have two unknowns:

Let's use the input-output pairs (2, 59) and (-2, -21):

1) From the pair (2, 59), the equation is:
   59 = a + 2b
2) From the pair (-2, -21), the equation is:
   -21 = a - 2b

We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations together to eliminate b:

59 = a + 2b
-21 = a - 2b
-------------
38 = 2a

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for a:
a = 19

Now that we know the value of a, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find b. Using the first equation:

59 = 19 + 2b
40 = 2b

Divide both sides by 2:
b = 20

So the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = 19 + 20x.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the inputs and outputs, we can see that the relationship between them forms a linear equation of the form:

y = ax + b

Where a and b are constants that we need to determine. Using the given pairs of input-output values, we can form the following system of equations:

For input 2: \( 59 = 2a + b \)  
For input -16: \( -301 = -16a + b \)  
For input -5: \( -81 = -5a + b \)  
For input 3: \( 79 = 3a + b \)  
For input -2: \( -21 = -2a + b \)

However, to precisely determine the values for 'a' and 'b', we only need two distinct equations from the above list. Therefore, let's use the first and the last pair given in the question as our system of two equations:

\( 59 = 2a + b \) ... [1]
\( -21 = -2a + b \) ... [2]

Adding equation [1] and [2] to eliminate 'b' and solve for 'a':

\( 59 - 21 = 2a + b - (-2a - b) \)
\( 38 = 4a \)
\( a = 38 / 4 \)
\( a = 9.5 \)

Now that we've calculated 'a', we can substitute it back into either equation [1] or [2] to find 'b'. Let's substitute 'a' back into equation [1]:

\( 59 = 2 * 9.5 + b \)
\( 59 = 19 + b \)
\( b = 59 - 19 \)
\( b = 40 \)

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we observe that ax^0 is the same as a (since anything to the power of 0 is 1), so the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

We need to find values for a (the y-intercept) and b (the slope) that would best fit the provided data points. Given that we have the following pairs of x (input) and y (output):

1. (13, 55)
2. (-20, -44)
3. (15, 61)
4. (-1, 13)
5. (-14, -26)

We can select any two points to calculate the slope (b) using the formula:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Substitute the values from any two data points into the formula for b. Let’s use points (13, 55) and (-20, -44):

b = (55 - (-44)) / (13 - (-20))
b = (55 + 44) / (13 + 20)
b = 99 / 33
b = 3

Now that we know b = 3, we can substitute b back into the equation y = a + 3x with any data point to find a. Let's use the point (13, 55):

55 = a + 3*13
55 = a + 39
55 - 39 = a
a = 16

    To find the relationship in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify this to y = a + bx, because any number to the power of 0 is 1. 

We can now use the given input-output pairs to generate a system of linear equations and solve for a and b. Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to create two equations:

Using input 13 and output 55:
55 = a + 13b

Using input -20 and output -44:
-44 = a - 20b

We now have a system of two equations:
1) 55 = a + 13b
2) -44 = a - 20b

We can solve this system for a and b using methods like substitution or elimination. I'll choose the elimination method:

Multiply equation 1) by 20, and equation 2) by 13 to eliminate a when we add the equations together:

20 * 55 = 20a + 20 * 13b
13 * -44 = 13a - 13 * 20b

Which gives us:

1100 = 20a + 260b
-572 = 13a - 260b

Now, adding these two equations together to eliminate b:

1100 + (-572) = (20a + 13a) + (260b - 260b)
528 = 33a
a = 528 / 33
a = 16

Now, let's find b using equation 1):

55 = 16 + 13b
39 = 13b
b = 39 / 13
b = 3

Now that we have values for a and b, we can write the function:

Therefore, for the input -4, the output is 4.

Output: 4",4,True,"[3, 16]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we essentially need to find a line in the form y = a + bx that fits the given points as closely as possible.

The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is equivalent to the standard linear equation y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 for any x except for x = 0 (by definition, any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 is 1), and x^1 is just x.

Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), we can calculate the slope (b) of the line using the formula

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

However, to have the best fit line, we would typically need to use a method like least squares regression, but with just two points from the list, we can calculate the slope directly. Let's choose the first two points for this calculation.

Using the points (13, 55) and (-20, -44), we can calculate b as follows:

b = (55 - (-44)) / (13 - (-20))
b = (55 + 44) / (33)
b = 99 / 33
b = 3

Now that we have the slope, we can use one of the points to solve for a. Let's use the point (13, 55):

55 = a + 3(13)
55 = a + 39
a = 55 - 39
a = 16

So the function that fits the points given is y = 16 + 3x or in the form requested:

Output: y = 16x^0 + 3x^1

Let's test this function with the given points to ensure that it is consistent:

For x = 13, y = 16 + 3(13) = 16 + 39 = 55. This matches the output given.
For x = -20, y = 16 + 3(-20) = 16 - 60 = -44. This matches the output given.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we should recognize that \( ax^0 \) is a constant term since any number to the power of 0 is 1, and \( bx^1 \) is a linear term since any number to the first power is the number itself.

Now, we have to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) from the given input-output pairs. Given that the equation simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) (since \( x^0 \) is equal to 1), we can use two of the input-output pairs to setup a system of linear equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's use the following two pairs:
1. Input: 13, Output: 55
2. Input: -20, Output: -44

This gives us the system:
1. \( a + 13b = 55 \)
2. \( a - 20b = -44 \)

Now we can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using these two equations. If we add the two equations, we get:

\( 2a - 7b = 11 \)

Now let's multiply the second equation by 2, so we can eliminate \( a \) by subtracting this new equation from the doubled first one:

\( 2a - 40b = -88 \)
\( 2a + 26b = 110\)

Subtract the first from the second:

\( 66b = 198 \)

Dividing both sides by \( 66 \) gives us \( b \):

\( b = 3 \)

Now we can substitute \( b = 3 \) into one of the original equations to find \( a \). Using the first equation:

\( a + 13b = 55 \)
\( a + 13(3) = 55 \)
\( a + 39 = 55 \)

For input 13, output 55:

\[ a + 13b = 55 \]

For input -20, output -44:

\[ a - 20b = -44 \]

Now, we have the following system of equations:

\[ a + 13b = 55 \]
\[ a - 20b = -44 \]

We can solve this system for \(a\) and \(b\) using methods such as substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

Adding the two equations to eliminate \(a\):

\[ (a + 13b) + (a - 20b) = 55 - 44 \]
\[ 2a - 7b = 11 \]
\[ a - \frac{7}{2}b = \frac{11}{2} \]

Now let's solve one of the original equations for \(a\):

\[ a + 13b = 55 \]
\[ a = 55 - 13b \]

Substitute this into the equation we just derived:

\[ 55 - 13b - \frac{7}{2}b = \frac{11}{2} \]
\[ 55 - \frac{26b}{2} - \frac{7b}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \]
\[ 55 - \frac{33b}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \]
\[ 110 - 33b = 11 \]
\[ -33b = 11 - 110 \]
\[ -33b = -99 \]
\[ b = 3 \]

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits this data, we notice that the term ax^0 is essentially a constant (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is simply bx (since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself). Thus, the form we are looking for simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Now we need to solve for a and b given the inputs and outputs.

Let's set up a system of linear equations using two data points to solve for the values of a and b.

We can choose any two points, but to simplify calculations, let's use these two:

Input: 11 Output: -204
Input: 20 Output: -366

Plugging these into the equation y = a + bx gives us:

-204 = a + 11b  (1)
-366 = a + 20b  (2)

Now we can solve this system of linear equations for a and b. Let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a:

(-366) - (-204) = (a + 20b) - (a + 11b)

This simplifies to:

-366 + 204 = 9b
-162 = 9b
b = -162 / 9
b = -18

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find a. Let's use equation (1):

-204 = a + 11(-18)
-204 = a - 198
a = -204 + 198
a = -6

So, the function that fits the data points is:

y = -6 + (-18)x

or simply:

y = -6 - 18x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    ","To find the output using the function y = -6 - 18x for the given input of 7, we substitute x with 7 in the function:

y = -6 - 18(7)
y = -6 - 126
y = -132

So, the correct output is:

Output: -132",-132,True,"[-18, -6]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is essentially y = a + bx (since x^0 = 1 for all x except x = 0), we can use two points from the given data to solve for the coefficients a and b. Let's use the points (11, -204) and (20, -366).

We will set up two equations using these points and the form y = a + bx:

For the point (11, -204), we substitute x with 11 and y with -204:
-204 = a + 11b

For the point (20, -366), we substitute x with 20 and y with -366:
-366 = a + 20b

Now we solve this system of linear equations for a and b. We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

(-366 = a + 20b) - (-204 = a + 11b)
-366 + 204 = 20b - 11b
-162 = 9b
b = -162 / 9
b = -18

Now we substitute b back into one of the equations to solve for a. We'll use -204 = a + 11b:

-204 = a + 11(-18)
-204 = a - 198
a = -204 + 198
a = -6

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we need to determine the correct values for the coefficients a and b.

Since ax^0 is simply a (because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We are given a set of input-output pairs to work with:

1. x = 11, y = -204
2. x = -4, y = 66
3. x = -17, y = 300
4. x = -15, y = 264
5. x = 20, y = -366

To determine a and b, we should set up a system of equations using two of the given points to solve for a and b. Normally, this would involve a process of substitution or elimination. However, since the desired form includes a general term (a) and a term linearly dependent on x (bx), we need the solution to work for all the given points.

One way to approach this is by recognizing that for any input x and output y, the following must hold: y - bx = a.

Using that approach, let's substitute our given points to find a:

For x = 11, y = -204: -204 - b(11) = a
For x = -4, y = 66:      66 - b(-4) = a
For x = -17, y = 300:   300 - b(-17) = a
For x = -15, y = 264:   264 - b(-15) = a
For x = 20, y = -366:  -366 -  b(20) = a

Now we need to find a value of b that when substituted in the above equations results in the same value for a for all given points. Using two points, e.g., points (11, -204) and (-4, 66), we can set up the following system of linear equations:

-204 = a + 11b
66 = a - 4b

Solve for a from the first equation:

a = -204 - 11b

Substitute a into the second equation:

66 = (-204 - 11b) - 4b

Combine like terms:

66 = -204 - 11b - 4b
66 = -204 - 15b

Add 204 to both sides:

66 + 204 = -15b
270 = -15b

Divide both sides by -15:

270 / -15 = b
b = -18

Now that we have the value of b, let's find a by plugging it back into one of the earlier equations for a:

a = -204 - 11b
a = -204 - 11(-18)
a = -204 + 198
a = -6

So our function looks like this:

y = a + bx
y = -6 - 18x

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    The task is to find a linear function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x.

Given the inputs and outputs, we can create a system of equations to solve for a and b. Let's use two of the given input-output pairs to form the equations:

Let's choose the first two data points for this:

1. Using input 11 (x = 11) and output -204 (y = -204):
\[ -204 = a + b(11) \]

2. Using input -4 (x = -4) and output 66 (y = 66):
\[ 66 = a + b(-4) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
\[ -204 = a + 11b \]
\[ 66 = a - 4b \]

Let's solve this system using substitution or elimination. We'll use the elimination method by choosing to eliminate a:

\[ (1) \times 1: -204 = a + 11b \rightarrow a = -204 - 11b \]
\[ (2) \times 1: 66 = a - 4b \]

Substitute a from equation (1) into equation (2):

\[ 66 = (-204 - 11b) - 4b \]
\[ 66 = -204 - 11b - 4b \]
\[ 66 = -204 - 15b \]
\[ 66 + 204 = -15b \]
\[ 270 = -15b \]
\[ b = -\frac{270}{15} \]
\[ b = -18 \]

Now let's find a using equation (1) with our value of \( b = -18 \):

\[ a = -204 - 11(-18) \]
\[ a = -204 + 198 \]
\[ a = -6 \]

Therefore, our function is:

\[ y = -6 + (-18)x \]

or simply:

\[ y = -6 - 18x \]

    To find the coefficients a and b for the linear function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to recognize that ax^0 is simply a, because any number to the power of zero is 1. So the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have been given a set of input-output pairs (x, y):

(11, -204), (-4, 66), (-17, 300), (-15, 264), (20, -366)

We have two unknowns, a and b, and we need at least two distinct input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations to solve for these unknowns. Let's take two pairs of points to form two equations. I'll take the first two pairs:

Using (11, -204):
-204 = a + b(11) ... [1]

Using (-4, 66):
66 = a + b(-4) ... [2]

Now let's solve these two equations simultaneously.

From equation [2]:

a = 66 + 4b ... [3]

Now we can substitute a from [3] into [1]:

-204 = (66 + 4b) + 11b
-204 = 66 + 15b
-204 - 66 = 15b
-270 = 15b
b = -270 / 15
b = -18

Now we have the slope b; let's substitute b into [3] to find a:

a = 66 + 4(-18)

    To determine the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we are looking at a linear model in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since ax^0 is equivalent to a, because any number to the power of 0 is 1, the model simplifies to y = a + bx.

We're given five data points: (-12, 9), (20, -55), (-4, -7), (-10, 5), and (8, -31). We can use two of them to find the values of a and b as follows:

For the pair (x1, y1) = (-12, 9) and (x2, y2) = (20, -55), we can set up the following two equations:
1) 9 = a + b(-12)
2) -55 = a + b(20)

Let's solve these equations simultaneously for a and b.

From equation 1:
9 = a - 12b
a = 9 + 12b -- (3)

Now let's replace a in equation 2 with the expression found in equation 3:
-55 = 9 + 12b + b(20)
-55 = 9 + 32b
-55 - 9 = 32b
-64 = 32b
b = -2

Now that we have b, let's solve for a using equation 3:
a = 9 + 12b
a = 9 + 12(-2)
a = 9 - 24
a = -15

The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is therefore y = -15 + (-2)x, but since we need to keep it in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, the simplified function would be:

y = -15x^0 - 2x^1

    The provided input-output pairs can be used to derive a function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \neq 0 \).

Given this form, we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \) such that the function closely represents the data provided. Using two input-output pairs, we can set up a system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's use the input-output pairs (-12, 9) and (20, -55):

1. For input -12 and output 9: \( 9 = a + b(-12) \)
2. For input 20 and output -55: \( -55 = a + b(20) \)

Let's solve these two equations for \( a \) and \( b \):

From equation 1:
\( 9 = a - 12b \) ... (1)

From equation 2:
\( -55 = a + 20b \) ... (2)

We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):

\( -55 - 9 = (a + 20b) - (a - 12b) \)
\( -64 = 32b \)
\( b = -64 / 32 \)
\( b = -2 \)

Substitute \( b \) back into equation (1) to solve for \( a \):

\( 9 = a - 12(-2) \)
\( 9 = a + 24 \)
\( a = 9 - 24 \)
\( a = -15 \)

Therefore, the function that fits the given points is:

\( y = -15 + (-2)x \)
\( y = -2x - 15 \)

However, this function only exactly fits the two points we used to derive it. To ensure it fits all provided points, we need to test the remaining points. If they do not match, it indicates that a linear function might not perfectly describe the relationship between the inputs and outputs, and a more complex function may be necessary.

Testing the remaining points:

For input -4 and output -7:
\( y = -2(-4) - 15 \)
\( y = 8 - 15 \)
\( y = -7 \) (matches)

For input 8 and output -31:
\( y = -2(8) - 15 \)
\( y = -16 - 15 \)

\( (-12, 9) \)
\( (20, -55) \)

For the point (-12, 9):
\( 9 = a + b(-12) \) ... [1]

For the point (20, -55):
\( -55 = a + b(20) \) ... [2]

Solving these two equations should give us the values for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's solve for \( b \) first by multiplying equation [1] by 20 and equation [2] by 12 and then subtracting one from the other to eliminate \( a \):

\( 20(9) = 20a - 12b \)
\( 12(-55) = 12a + 240b \)

Now add the equations:

\( 180 - 660 = 20a - 12b + 12a + 240b \)
\( -480 = 32a + 228b \)
\( -480 = 32a + 228b \)

Now we divide by 228 to solve for \( b \):

\( b = \frac{-480}{228} \)

However, we notice that we are missing a clear solution for our simultaneous equations since we would need two of them to get a single solution for \( a \) and \( b \). 

To find the precise values, we have to really solve the system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's properly solve [1] and [2] together:

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, first we must understand that ax^0 is a constant term because any number raised to the 0th power is 1. So ax^0 simplifies to a. Then, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can set up a system of equations using the given input-output pairs to find the values of a and b. However, since there are more than two points, we could potentially be dealing with an overdetermined system, and there may not exist a single solution for a consistent linear relationship. Typically, we could use least squares regression to find the best fit for these data points, but here we will try to find a single solution if it exists.

Let's use two of the given points to set up a system of equations and solve for a and b:

Using the first given point (-12, 9):
9 = a + b(-12)

Using the second given point (20, -55):
-55 = a + b(20)

We now have a system of two linear equations:
1) 9 = a - 12b
2) -55 = a + 20b

We can solve this system via substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply equation 1) by -1 to get:
-1) -9 = -a + 12b

Now add equation -1) and 2) together:
-55 - 9 = a + 20b - a + 12b

b = -64 / 32
b = -2

Now plug the value of b back into equation 1):

a = 9 - 24
a = -15

So we have found a and b to be -15 and -2, respectively. The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = -15x^0 - 2x^1

y = -15 - 2x

Now, let's check this formula with the other given points:

For x = -4:
y = -15 - 2(-4) = -15 + 8 = -7 (matches the given)

For x = -10:

We now have a system of two equations:
(1) 9 = a - 12b
(2) -55 = a + 20b

We can solve this system by using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution in this case.

From (1), we can derive:
a = 9 + 12b ... (3)

Next, we substitute (3) into (2):

From the point (14, -98), we substitute x = 14 and y = -98 into the equation y = a + bx:
-98 = a + b(14)

Now we have two equations:
1) 82 = a - 16b
2) -98 = a + 14b

We can solve for a and b using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

First, we'll add the two equations together to eliminate a:
(82 = a - 16b) +
(-98 = a + 14b)
___________________
-16 = -2b

Divide both sides by -2 to solve for b:
b = 8

Now that we have b, we can substitute back into either equation to find a. We'll use equation 1):
82 = a - 16(8)
82 = a - 128

Add 128 to both sides to solve for a:
a = 82 + 128
a = 210

So, the function that describes the data is y = 210 + 8x.

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we recognize that this is a linear equation with ax^0 representing the y-intercept (since x^0 is always 1) and bx^1 representing the slope times x.

So, we have:

y = a + bx

To find the values of a and b, we need at least two data points. We'll take two given points to calculate a and b. Let's use the inputs -16 (with output 82) and 14 (with output -98):

Point 1 (x₁, y₁): (-16, 82)
Point 2 (x₂, y₂): (14, -98)

We have the following two equations based on the points:

1. 82 = a - 16b
2. -98 = a + 14b

Now, we can solve for a and b using these two linear equations. Let's multiply the second equation by 16 and the first by 14 to eliminate a:

14 * 82 = 14a - 14*16b
16 * (-98) = 16a + 16*14b

1148 = 14a - 224b
-1568 = 16a + 224b

Adding these two equations to cancel out b:

1148 - 1568 = 14a - 224b + 16a + 224b
-420 = 30a

Divide by 30 to solve for a:

a = -420 / 30
a = -14

Now, substitute the value of a into one of the original equations to solve for b:

82 = -14 - 16b

Add 14 to both sides:

82 + 14 = -16b
96 = -16b

Divide by -16:

b = 96 / -16
b = -6

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship is:

y = -14 + (-6)x
y = -14 - 6x

Or written in the desired format:

Output: y = -14x^0 - 6x^1

So, for an input of 15, the correct output would be:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use a pair of input-output points to solve a system of linear equations.

The term ax^0 is a because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1, so this term represents the y-intercept. The term bx^1 is simply bx, representing the slope times the input x.

Let's choose two points to create our system of equations. For example, using the points (-16, 82) and (14, -98):

1. From the point (-16, 82):   
82 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)  
82 = a - 16b  

2. From the point (14, -98):  
-98 = a(14)^0 + b(14)  
-98 = a + 14b  

Now, we have the system of equations:  
a - 16b = 82  
a + 14b = -98  

To solve this system, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:

(a - 16b) - (a + 14b) = 82 - (-98)  
a - a - 16b - 14b = 82 + 98  
-30b = 180  
b = 180 / (-30)  
b = -6  

Now substitute the value of b back into either of the original equations to find a. If we use the first equation:

a - 16(-6) = 82  
a + 96 = 82  
a = 82 - 96  
a = -14  

Therefore, the function that describes this relationship is:

y = -14x^0 - 6x^1  
Since x^0 = 1, we can simplify this to:  
y = -14 - 6x

    To determine the coefficients a and b for a linear function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), we can use two data points to solve a system of linear equations.

Let's use the following two points: (-16, 82) and (14, -98).

Point 1: Input: -16, Output: 82
\[ 82 = a - 16b \]

Point 2: Input: 14, Output: -98
\[ -98 = a + 14b \]

Now we have the following system of equations:
\[ a - 16b = 82 \]
\[ a + 14b = -98 \]

We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) by either elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

Adding the two equations, we eliminate \( a \):
\[ a - 16b + a + 14b = 82 - 98 \]
\[ 2a - 2b = -16 \]
\[ a - b = -8 \]

Now, we can rearrange one of the original equations to express a in terms of b, using the first equation for simplicity:
\[ a = 82 + 16b \]

Substitute this expression into the modified equation:
\[ 82 + 16b - b = -8 \]
\[ 82 + 15b = -8 \]
\[ 15b = -8 - 82 \]
\[ 15b = -90 \]
\[ b = -90 / 15 \]
\[ b = -6 \]

Now substitute b back into the expression of a:
\[ a = 82 + 16(-6) \]
\[ a = 82 - 96 \]
\[ a = -14 \]

Thus, the coefficients are a = -14 and b = -6, and the linear function describing the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
\[ y = -14x^0 - 6x^1 \]

Which simplifies to:
\[ y = -14 - 6x \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy the given input-output pairs.

The form can be simplified to \( y = a + bx \), since any number to the power of 0 is 1.

Given the pairs:
1. For \( x = -16 \), \( y = 82 \),
2. For \( x = -11 \), \( y = 52 \),
3. For \( x = 14 \), \( y = -98 \),
4. For \( x = -18 \), \( y = 94 \),
5. For \( x = 3 \), \( y = -32 \).

We can choose two pairs to form a system of linear equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the pairs \((-16, 82)\) and \((14, -98)\) for this example.

From the first pair \((-16, 82)\):
\[ 82 = a + (-16)b \] 
\[ 82 = a - 16b \]

From the second pair \((14, -98)\):
\[ -98 = a + (14)b \]
\[ -98 = a + 14b \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 82 = a - 16b \)
2. \( -98 = a + 14b \)

We can solve this system of equations through various methods such as substitution, elimination, or using matrices. Let's solve it using elimination:

Multiply the first equation by 14 and the second equation by 16 to eliminate \( a \) when we subtract the equations:
1. \( 14 \times 82 = 14a - 16 \times 14b \)
2. \( 16 \times -98 = 16a + 16 \times 14b \)

Solving for each:
1. \( 1148 = 14a - 224b \)
2. \( -1568 = 16a + 224b \)

Add the two equations:
\[ 1148 - 1568 = (14a - 16a) + (-224b + 224b) \]
\[ -420 = -2a \]

From this equation, solve for \( a \):
\[ a = \frac{-420}{-2} \]
\[ a = 210 \]

To find \( b \), substitute \( a \) into one of the original equations:
\[ 82 = 210 - 16b \]
\[ -128 = -16b \]
\[ b = \frac{-128}{-16} \]
\[ b = 8 \]

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of a and b such that the function accurately maps the given inputs to the corresponding outputs. Here, ax^0 is simply a because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1, and bx^1 is bx since anything raised to the power of 1 is itself. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's use two of the provided input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations and solve for a and b:

Using the input-output pair (x = -1, y = -7):
-7 = a + b(-1)  (Equation 1)

Using the input-output pair (x = 2, y = 5):
5 = a + b(2)    (Equation 2)

Let's solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. I'll choose the substitution method here.

From Equation 1:
a = -7 + b     (Equation 3)

Now, we'll plug Equation 3 into Equation 2:
5 = (-7 + b) + 2b
5 = -7 + b + 2b
5 = -7 + 3b
3b = 5 + 7
3b = 12
b = 12 / 3
b = 4

Now, we know b, we can find a by plugging the value of b back into Equation 3:
a = -7 + b
a = -7 + 4
a = -3

Having values for both a and b, we can now write the function as:
y = a + bx
y = -3 + 4x

In the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, this is:
y = -3x^0 + 4x^1

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can notice that ax^0 is always a because x^0 is always 1 for any x that is not zero. Therefore, ax^0 represents a constant term, while bx^1 is the term that varies with x.

Looking at the input-output pairs given, since the function must be linear (as implied by the form y = ax^0 + bx^1), we can try to determine the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a) of the line.

Let's consider two different pairs of (x, y) to calculate the slope (b):

Using input-output pairs (3, 9) and (2, 5):

9 = a*3^0 + b*3
5 = a*2^0 + b*2

We can simplify this to:

9 = a + 3b
5 = a + 2b

Now let's solve this system of equations by subtracting the second equation from the first:

(9 - a) - (5 - a) = 3b - 2b
4 = b

With b determined as 4, we can substitute it back into one of the above equations to solve for a:

5 = a + 2*4
5 = a + 8
a = 5 - 8
a = -3

So the function that best captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -3x^0 + 4x^1

Simplified, this is:

y = -3 + 4x

Each of the given input-output pairs (x, y) should satisfy this relationship, and we can check this quickly:

For x = -18:
y = -3 + 4(-18)
y = -3 - 72
y = -75 (matches the output)

For x = -1:
y = -3 + 4(-1)
y = -3 - 4

y = -3 + 12
y = 9 (matches the output)

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the values of a and b that fit the given inputs and outputs. The term ax^0 is equivalent to a since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have the following pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y):

1. For x = -18: y = -75
2. For x = -1: y = -7
3. For x = 3: y = 9

For x = -1 and y = -7:

For x = 3 and y = 9:
9 = a + b(3)    =>  a + 3b = 9   ...(2)

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

(a + 3b) - (a - b) = 9 - (-7)
a + 3b - a + b = 9 + 7

b = 4

To solve for a and b, we need to set up a system of equations using the provided data points. We will use (x, y) pairs (-1, -7) and (2, 5) because they are enough to define a linear function.

For the first pair (-1, -7):

This simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

since anything to the zero power is 1.

Let's substitute each input-output pair into the equation to create a system of equations:

1. When x = -18, y = -75:
\[ -75 = a + b(-18) \]

2. When x = -1, y = -7:

Note that we do not use the input-output pair (-18, -75) for the second time, as it provides no new information because it's identical to the first one.

We need to solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. However, since we have more equations than unknowns, the system may be over-determined, and a perfect solution may not exist. This is a common situation where we may use methods like Least Squares to find the best fit for the given data.

For simplicity, let's use the last two equations, as they have closer x values:

3. \( 9 = a + 3b \)

4. \( 5 = a + 2b \)

Now, let's solve this smaller system:

Subtract the fourth equation from the third:

\( 9 - 5 = a + 3b - a - 2b \)
\( 4 = b \)

Now that we have the value for b, we can substitute it back into either the third or the fourth equation to find a. Using the fourth equation:

\( 5 = a + 2(4) \)
\( 5 = a + 8 \)
\( a = 5 - 8 \)
\( a = -3 \)

2. \( -79 = a - 11b \)

We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) by eliminating one of the variables. Let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

Input: 6, Output: 74 -> 74 = a(6)^0 + b(6)^1
Input: 19, Output: 191 -> 191 = a(19)^0 + b(19)^1
Input: -11, Output: -79 -> -79 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1
Input: -5, Output: -25 -> -25 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1
Input: -10, Output: -70 -> -70 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1

Since x^0 is always 1, we can simplify the above equations to:
74 = a + 6b 
191 = a + 19b 
-79 = a - 11b 
-25 = a - 5b
-70 = a - 10b

To solve this system, let's use the first and last equations as they have the smallest absolute values of x, which might make calculations easier:

74 = a + 6b  (Equation 1)
-70 = a - 10b (Equation 2)

Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2 eliminates `a`:

74 + (-70) = a - a + 6b - 10b
4 = -4b
b = -1

Now that we have the value for `b`, we can substitute it back into Equation 1 to find `a`:

74 = a + 6(-1)
74 = a - 6
a = 74 + 6
a = 80

Now that we have both `a` and `b`, we can write the function:

y = 80x^0 - 1x^1
or, simply
y = 80 - x

This function describes the relationship between inputs and outputs for the given data points.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which is equal to \( y = a + bx \), we need to solve for constants \( a \) and \( b \) using the given input-output pairs.

Let's use two of the provided input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations:

1. Using the input-output pair (6, 74):
\[ 74 = a + 6b \]

2. Using the input-output pair (19, 191):
\[ 191 = a + 19b \]

Now, let's solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

From the first equation:
\[ a = 74 - 6b \]

Substitute the expression for \( a \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 191 = (74 - 6b) + 19b \]
\[ 191 = 74 + 13b \]
\[ 13b = 191 - 74 \]
\[ 13b = 117 \]
\[ b = 117 / 13 \]
\[ b = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( b \) back into the expression for \( a \):
\[ a = 74 - 6 \times 9 \]
\[ a = 74 - 54 \]
\[ a = 20 \]

So, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
\[ y = 20 + 9x \]
\[ \text{or} \]
\[ y = 20x^0 + 9x^1 \] 

Now let's verify this function with the remaining data points:

For \( x = -11 \):
\[ y = 20 + 9(-11) \]
\[ y = 20 - 99 \]
\[ y = -79 \]

For \( x = -5 \):
\[ y = 20 + 9(-5) \]
\[ y = 20 - 45 \]
\[ y = -25 \]

For \( x = -10 \):
\[ y = 20 + 9(-10) \]
\[ y = 20 - 90 \]
\[ y = -70 \]

The provided function correctly describes all given data points.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To describe the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) as given in the examples, we have to determine the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx (since any number raised to the 0 power is 1).

Using the given pairs of inputs and outputs to create equations:

1) For input 6, output 74:
74 = a + 6b

2) For input 19, output 191:
191 = a + 19b

3) For input -11, output -79:
-79 = a - 11b

4) For input -5, output -25:
-25 = a - 5b

5) For input -10, output -70:
-70 = a - 10b

Let's solve the system using two of the equations to find a and b. We can use the first two equations:

74 = a + 6b
191 = a + 19b

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:
191 - 74 = a + 19b - (a + 6b)
117 = 13b
b = 117 / 13
b = 9

Now we'll use the value of b to find a using the first equation:
74 = a + 6(9)
74 = a + 54
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

Now we have found the coefficients a and b:
a = 20

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we must determine the constants a and b.

First, recall that x^0 is always 1, so ax^0 is essentially just a. Therefore, we are looking for a linear function of the form:

y = a + bx

Let's examine the given input-output pairs to find the values of a and b:

1. Input: 6, Output: 8
2. Input: -5, Output: -25
3. Input: -3, Output: -19
4. Input: -10, Output: -40
5. Input: -14, Output: -52

Using the first pair (6, 8), we can create the equation:

8 = a + 6b

Now, let's use another pair to create a second equation. It's best to use a pair with a negative input to help solve for b since the difference in inputs will give us a coefficient for b that will be easy to work with. We'll choose the pair (-5, -25):

-25 = a - 5b

We now have a system of two equations:

1. 8 = a + 6b
2. -25 = a - 5b

We can solve this system by adding the two equations together to eliminate a:

8 + (-25) = (a + 6b) + (a - 5b)
-17 = 2a + b

Now, solve for a:

b = -17 - 2a

We need a second equation for a and b, let's use another pair of inputs and outputs for this. Let's use the pair (-3, -19):

-19 = a - 3b

Now we have a new system of equations with the first one we've found:

1. -17 = 2a + b
2. -19 = a - 3b

We can multiply the second equation by 2 so we can eliminate a:

-38 = 2a - 6b

Now we'll subtract the first equation from this result:

-38 - (-17) = (2a - 6b) - (2a + b)
-21 = -7b

Dividing both sides by -7 gives us:

b = 3

Knowing b, we can now go back to one of the original equations to find a, let's use the first one:

-17 = 2a + 3

Subtract 3 from both sides to get:

-20 = 2a

Now divide by 2:

a = -10

Therefore, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -10x^0 + 3x^1

y = -10 + 3x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the values of a and b that define the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first recognize that x^0 is always 1. Given this, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We need to solve for the constants a and b using the given input-output pairs.

Let's consider the two input-output pairs (-5, -25) and (6, 8):

For input x = -5, output y = -25:
-25 = a + b(-5)

For input x = 6, output y = 8:
8 = a + b(6)

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) a - 5b = -25
2) a + 6b = 8

We can solve this system of equations for a and b. Let's start by adding these two equations:

(1) + (2): a - 5b + a + 6b = -25 + 8
2a + b = -17

Now, let's multiply equation (1) by 6 and equation (2) by 5 and subtract the second from the first to solve for b:

6*(1): 6a - 30b = -150
5*(2): 5a + 30b = 40

Subtract 5*(2) from 6*(1):

6a - 30b - (5a + 30b) = -150 - 40
6a - 30b - 5a - 30b = -190
a - 60b = -190

Since we already have the equation 2a + b = -17, let's solve for b from this equation:

a = -17 - b
2(-17 - b) + b = -17
-34 - 2b + b = -17
-34 - b = -17
b = -34 + 17
b = -17

Now that we have the value for b, let's substitute it back into one of the original equations to find a:

a + 6(-17) = 8
a - 102 = 8
a = 8 + 102
a = 110

Therefore, the constants are a = 110 and b = -17.

    To find the function that fits the given data points, we can use the given input-output pairs to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) in the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \).

Given that \( x^0 = 1 \), we can simplify the function to \( y = a + bx \).

Let's use two of the input-output pairs to set up a system of equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

From the input-output pair (6, 8):
\( 8 = a + b(6) \)   (1)

From the input-output pair (-5, -25):
\( -25 = a + b(-5) \)  (2)

Let's solve this system of equations:

Multiply equation (2) by -1 to facilitate elimination:
\( 25 = -a + 5b \)   (2') 

Add equation (1) and equation (2'):
\( 8 + 25 = a + b(6) - a + 5b \)
\( 33 = 6b + 5b \)
\( 33 = 11b \)
\( b = 3 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find \( a \). Let's use equation (1):
\( 8 = a + 3(6) \)
\( 8 = a + 18 \)
\( a = 8 - 18 \)
\( a = -10 \)

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we must first understand what the provided terms mean:

- \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \) since any number to the power of one is the number itself.

So the function we're trying to find is essentially \( y = a + bx \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants we need to determine.

Given the input-output pairs, we can substitute the inputs (x values) into the equation \( y = a + bx \) and solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's use two of the given pairs to set up a system of equations:

For the input 6 (output 8):

\( 8 = a + b(6) \) (1)

For the input -5 (output -25):

\( -25 = a + b(-5) \) (2)

We now have two equations with two unknowns:

\( 8 = a + 6b \) (1)

\( -25 = a - 5b \) (2)

By solving this system (for example, by adding these two equations to eliminate \( a \)), we get:

\( (8) + (-25) = (a) + (6b) + (a) - (5b) \)

\( -17 = 2a + b \)

From equation (2), we also have:

\( a = -25 + 5b \)

By substituting \( a \) from the second equation into the first, we can find \( b \):

\( -17 = 2(-25 + 5b) + b \)

\( -17 = -50 + 10b + b \)

\( -17 + 50 = 11b \)

\( 33 = 11b \)

\( b = 3 \)

    To derive the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, first, recall that x^0 is always 1 for any x except for x = 0.

Looking at the given input-output pairs:

1. For x = 9, y = 29
2. For x = 2, y = 8
3. For x = -1, y = -1
4. For x = -6, y = -16

We can hypothesize that the outputs seem to be 3x + b where b is a constant term that we need to figure out. Substituting the values of x and y from one of the pairs into the hypothesized equation will allow us to solve for b. Let's use the first pair (x = 9, y = 29):

y = 3x + b

29 = 3(9) + b

29 = 27 + b

b = 29 - 27

b = 2

Now that we have the value for b, the function is:

y = 3x + 2

But you've asked for it explicitly in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. In this case, a = b = 2 and x^0 = 1 (since any number raised to the power 0 is 1), and bx^1 = 3x. Thus the function is:

y = 2x^0 + 3x^1

or simply

y = 2 + 3x

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which is basically y = a + bx since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), we'll need to determine the values of a and b that best fit the given data points.

We are given the following pairs of (x, y):

(-16, 109)
(-3, 18)
(2, -17)
(12, -87)
(5, -38)

Let's use two of these points to solve for a and b. I’ll choose the points (-16, 109) and (2, -17) to set up two equations:

For the point (-16, 109):
109 = a + b(-16)
109 = a - 16b    ...(1)

For the point (2, -17):
-17 = a + b(2)
-17 = a + 2b    ...(2)

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

109 - (-17) = (a - 16b) - (a + 2b)
109 + 17 = -18b
126 = -18b
b = -126 / 18
b = -7

Now we have the value for b, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find a. I’ll substitute it into equation (2):

-17 = a + 2(-7)
-17 = a - 14
a = -17 + 14
a = -3

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that best captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs given in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we will first note that `x^0` is always equal to 1 for any value of x (except for x=0). Thus, `ax^0` simplifies to `a`. Therefore, the function is simply `y = a + bx`. 

So, we need to solve for the coefficients `a` and `b` such that the linear function fits the data points provided. This requires solving a system of linear equations based on the input-output pairs given. For this dataset, the system would be as follows:

1. \( a - 16b = 109 \) (from input -16, output 109)
2. \( a - 3b = 18 \) (from input -3, output 18)
3. \( a + 2b = -17 \) (from input 2, output -17)
4. \( a + 12b = -87 \) (from input 12, output -87)
5. \( a + 5b = -38 \) (from input 5, output -38)

To solve for `a` and `b`, we can use any two of the equations from the above system. Let's use equations 2 and 3 for convenience:

\[ \begin{align*}
a - 3b &= 18 \quad \quad (2) \\
a + 2b &= -17 \quad \quad (3)
\end{align*} \]

Adding the two equations, we get:

\[ \begin{align*}
(1 + 1)a + (-3 + 2)b &= 18 - 17 \\
2a - b &= 1
\end{align*} \]

Let's call this equation (6):

\[ \begin{align*}
2a - b &= 1 \quad \quad (6)
\end{align*} \]

Now, by multiplying equation 2 by 2, we get:

\[ \begin{align*}
2a - 6b &= 36 \quad \quad (2\text{ multiplied by }2)
\end{align*} \]

Now let's subtract equation (6) from this new equation:

\[ \begin{align*}
(2a - 6b) - (2a - b) &= 36 - 1 \\
-5b &= 35 \\
b &= -7
\end{align*} \]

Now that we have `b`, we can substitute it back into equation (6):

\[ \begin{align*}
2a - (-7) &= 1 \\
2a + 7 &= 1 \\
2a &= -6 \\
a &= -3
\end{align*} \]

So the coefficients are `a = -3` and `b = -7`, and the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs would be:

\[ y = -3x^0 - 7x^1 \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ y = -3 - 7x \]

    To find a function that describes this relationship in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) such that they fit the given data points as well as possible.

The form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 \) is 1 for any \( x \) that isn't 0.

Using two of the given data points, we can set up a system of linear equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's use the points (-3, 18) and (2, -17):

For the point (-3, 18):
\( 18 = a + b(-3) \)
\( 18 = a - 3b \) ... [1]

For the point (2, -17):
\( -17 = a + b(2) \)
\( -17 = a + 2b \) ... [2]

To solve for \( a \) and \( b \), we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we will use elimination:

Multiply equation [1] by 2 and [2] by 3:
\( 36 = 2a - 6b \) ... [1']
\( -51 = 3a + 6b \) ... [2']

Add [1'] and [2'] to eliminate \( b \):
\( 36 - 51 = 2a - 6b + 3a + 6b \)
\( -15 = 5a \)

Divide by 5:
\( a = \frac{-15}{5} \)
\( a = -3 \)

Now that we have \( a \), substitute it back into [1] to find \( b \):
\( 18 = -3 - 3b \)
\( 21 = -3b \)
\( b = \frac{21}{-3} \)
\( b = -7 \)

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs using the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x is the input and y is the output, we need to determine the values of a and b that fit the given data pairs. We observe that ax^0 is effectively a, since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1, thus the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

For each data pair, we can write an equation:

1. For input -16 and output 109:

109 = a + b(-16)

2. For input -3 and output 18:

18 = a + b(-3)

4. For input 12 and output -87:

-87 = a + b(12)

5. For input 5 and output -38:

-38 = a + b(5)

Now, we need to solve these equations for a and b. To find a common pattern to determine a and b, let's arrange the equations:

a - 16b = 109
a - 3b = 18
a + 2b = -17
a + 12b = -87
a + 5b = -38

Let's consider two of the equations and solve them simultaneously to find a and b. To make it simple, choose two equations where the coefficients of 'a' are the same (they are in all equations) and the coefficients of 'b' are one positive and one negative for easier elimination, for example:

a + 2b = -17
a - 3b = 18

By subtracting the second equation from the first, we eliminate 'a' and can find 'b':

(a + 2b) - (a - 3b) = -17 - 18
a - a + 2b + 3b = -35
5b = -35
b = -35/5
b = -7

Now that we know 'b', we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find 'a'. Let’s use the equation a + 2b = -17:

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we essentially need to find the constants \( a \) and \( b \) for the equation:

\[ y = a + bx \]

First, let's recognize that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x, so our equation simplifies to \( y = a + bx \). We need to find a way to calculate \( a \) and \( b \) given our input-output pairs. This form of the equation is a linear equation where \( a \) is the y-intercept and \( b \) is the slope of the line.

Given at least two points, we can find the slope \( b \). Let's take two points from the data provided:

\( (x_1, y_1) = (-3, 18) \)
\( (x_2, y_2) = (2, -17) \)

The formula for the slope \( b \) is:

\[ b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]
\[ b = \frac{-17 - 18}{2 - (-3)} \]
\[ b = \frac{-35}{5} \]
\[ b = -7 \]

Now that we have the slope, we can calculate \( a \) by substituting the slope and one of the points into the equation:

\( y = a + bx \)

Let's use the point \( (x_1, y_1) = (-3, 18) \):

\( 18 = a + (-7) \cdot (-3) \)
\( 18 = a + 21 \)

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data points, we can interpret ax^0 as a constant term (since x^0 is always 1) and bx^1 as a linear term with respect to x. Thus, the function can be rewritten as y = a + bx, where we need to determine the constants a and b.

Let's consider two data points to solve for a and b:
Using points (-9, 162) and (17, -254), we have the following two equations:
1) For x = -9, y = 162: a - 9b = 162
2) For x = 17, y = -254: a + 17b = -254

Now we will solve this system of linear equations for a and b.

Adding the two equations:
(a - 9b) + (a + 17b) = 162 - 254
2a + 8b = -92
a + 4b = -46  ...(3)

Subtracting the first equation from the second:
(a + 17b) - (a - 9b) = -254 - 162
26b = -416
b = -416 / 26
b = -16

Substitute b into equation (3) to find a:

    To find the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, let's use two of the given input-output pairs to solve for `a` and `b`. The form provided simplifies to `y = a + bx`, because `x^0` is 1 for any `x` that isn’t 0, and `x^1` is simply `x`.

Let's use the input-output pairs (17, -254) and (-9, 162). Plugging these into `y = a + bx`, we have:

For `x = 17, y = -254`:  
`-254 = a + 17b`  
`-254 = a + 17b` ... (1)

For `x = -9, y = 162`:  
`162 = a - 9b`  
`162 = a - 9b` ... (2)

Now, let's solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination.

First, let's align the equations below each other:

`-254 =  a + 17b` ... (1)  
` 162 =  a - 9b` ... (2)

Now let's opt for the elimination method by adding both equations so we can cancel out `a`:

`-254 + 162 = (a + 17b) + (a - 9b)`  
`-92 = 2a + 8b` 

Divide the entire equation by 2 to find `a`:

`-46 = a + 4b` ... (3)

Now we need to solve for `a` or `b`. Since we can’t find a singular solution directly from equation (3), we need to either subtract equation (2) from equation (1) or use another approach to solve this system.

Subtract equation (2) from (1):

`(-254) - (162) = (a + 17b) - (a - 9b)`  
`-416 = 26b`  
`b = -416 / 26`  
`b = -16`

Now we have the value for `b`. Let's substitute `b` back into equation (3) to find `a`:

`-46 = a + 4(-16)`  
`-46 = a - 64`  
`a = 18`

The term `ax^0` is effectively `a` since any number raised to the 0 power is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

Now let's take two input-output pairs to solve for `a` and `b`. It's easier to choose pairs that will simplify our calculations. Let's use the following two pairs: 

Input: -9, Output: 162

Let these correspond to two equations:

1) For Input -9, Output 162: `162 = a + b(-9)`
2) For Input -18, Output 306: `306 = a + b(-18)`

Let's solve these equations simultaneously for `a` and `b`. 

By dividing the second equation by 2, we can directly compare it with the first one:
`153 = a + b(-9)`

Now we subtract this new equation from the first one:
`162 = a + b(-9)`
`-153 = -a - b(9)`
----------------
`9 = -18b`

This simplifies to:
`b = -9/18`
`b = -0.5`

`162 = a - 0.5*(-9)`
`162 = a + 4.5`
`a = 162 - 4.5`
`a = 157.5`

Now we have the values for `a` and `b`:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can notice a pattern that seems to be consistent with a linear relationship. The general form of a linear equation in slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since we need to express it in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, it matches with the linear equation where a is the y-intercept (b in y = mx + b) and b is the slope (m in y = mx + b).

With the provided data points, we can see that as the input (x) changes, the output (y) changes by a consistent factor that corresponds to the slope. We can determine the slope by examining the changes in y with respect to changes in x. Let's take two data points to calculate the slope (b):

Using the points (-9, 162) and (17, -254):
The change in y (Δy) is -254 - 162 = -416.
The change in x (Δx) is 17 - (-9) = 26.
The slope (b) = Δy / Δx = -416 / 26 = -16.

Now we have the slope, so our preliminary function looks like y = -16x + a.

Next, we need to find the y-intercept (a). We can use any of the given points to solve for a. Let's use the point (-9, 162):

By looking at the given pairs of input and output, we can see that the output is negative when the input is positive, and the output is positive when the input is negative.

Given that x^0 is always 1 for any x that is not 0, the term a*x^0 can be simplified to just a, since it doesn't depend on x.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to recognize that ax^0 is simply a constant term because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. 

We need to solve the linear system to find the values of a and b that fit the given pairs of inputs and outputs. We can use two of the pairs to set up two equations and then solve for a and b.

Let's pick the first two data points to set up our equations:

Using Input: 18, Output: 350
350 = a + b(18)

Using Input: 12, Output: 230
230 = a + b(12)

We now have the following system of equations:

1) a + 18b = 350
2) a + 12b = 230

To solve for a and b, we will subtract the second equation from the first:

(1) - (2) gives us:
(18b - 12b) = (350 - 230)
6b = 120
b = 120 / 6
b = 20

Now, using the value of b to find a, we plug b into the second equation:

a + 12(20) = 230
a + 240 = 230
a = 230 - 240
a = -10

Therefore, the function that fits the data points is:
y = -10 + 20x

Which in the form requested (Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1) is:

    To find a linear function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) (the y-intercept) and \( b \) (the slope).

Given is a set of input-output pairs. To find the best fit line, we can use two points to calculate the slope \( b \). Let's choose the points (18, 350) and (12, 230):

First, calculate the slope \( b \):

\[ b = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{350 - 230}{18 - 12} = \frac{120}{6} = 20 \]

Now that we have \( b \), we need to find \( a \). We can use one of the given points to solve for \( a \). Let's use the point (18, 350):

\[ 350 = a + 20 \times 18 \]

\[ 350 = a + 360 \]

\[ a = 350 - 360 \]

\[ a = -10 \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To establish a relationship between the input (x) and output (y) values in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are looking for a linear function where \( ax^0 \) is essentially a constant (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), and \( bx^1 \) is a linear term.

The general form of a linear equation is \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope of the line and \( b \) is the y-intercept. This corresponds to \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), where \( a \) is \( b \) from the slope-intercept form (the constant term or y-intercept), and \( b \) is \( m \) (the slope).

To find this function, we can use two points to calculate the slope \( m \). Let's take the input-output pairs (12, 230) and (18, 350):

\( m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) \)

Plugging in our values, we get:

\( m = (350 - 230) / (18 - 12) \)
\( m = 120 / 6 \)
\( m = 20 \)

Now we know our function has the form \( y = 20x + b \). To find \( b \), we can substitute one of the points into the equation. Using (12, 230):

\( 230 = 20(12) + b \)
\( 230 = 240 + b \)
\( b = 230 - 240 \)
\( b = -10 \)

Our function is now complete:

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is equivalent to y = a + bx (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), we need to determine the values of the constants a and b that make the equation true for all the given inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Let's assume our function is of the form y = a + bx. We can use two of the input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations and solve for a and b.

Using the input-output pairs (12, 230) and (18, 350):

1. For input 12: 
230 = a + 12b

2. For input 18: 
350 = a + 18b

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:

350 - 230 = a + 18b - (a + 12b)
120 = 6b
b = 120/6
b = 20

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find a:

230 = a + 12(20)
230 = a + 240
a = 230 - 240
a = -10 

Therefore, our function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

The term ax^0 is just 'a' because any number raised to the zero power is 1. So, we can simplify the function to y = a + bx.

We can use two data points to form a system of linear equations to find 'a' and 'b'. Let's use the data points (18, 350) and (12, 230):

1) For x = 18, y = 350: 350 = a + 18b
2) For x = 12, y = 230: 230 = a + 12b

Now, we have a linear system of two equations that we can solve:

350 = a + 18b ...(1)
230 = a + 12b ...(2)

Subtract the second equation from the first:

350 - 230 = a + 18b - (a + 12b)
120 = 6b

Now, solve for b:
