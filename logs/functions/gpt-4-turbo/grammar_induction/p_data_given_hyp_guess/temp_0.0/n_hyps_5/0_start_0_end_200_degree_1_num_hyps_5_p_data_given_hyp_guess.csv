"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which is equivalent to \(y = a + bx\), we can use any two distinct input-output pairs to find the coefficients \(a\) (intercept) and \(b\) (slope).

Let's take the input-output pairs (4, 67) and (20, 387) to calculate the coefficients.

For the first pair (4, 67):
\(67 = a + 4b\)  (1)

For the second pair (20, 387):
\(387 = a + 20b\)   (2)

Now, we'll solve the system of equations to find \(a\) and \(b\).

Starting with equation (2) and subtracting equation (1) from it, we get:
\(387 - 67 = a + 20b - (a + 4b)\)

This simplifies to:
\(320 = 16b\)

Now, divide both sides by 16 to find \(b\):
\(b = 320 / 16\)
\(b = 20\)

Now that we have \(b\), we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find \(a\).

\(67 = a + 4(20)\)
\(67 = a + 80\)

Subtract 80 from both sides to solve for \(a\):
\(a = 67 - 80\)
\(a = -13\)

Therefore, our function is:
\(y = a + bx\)
\(y = -13 + 20x\)

    ","To find the output for the input 15 using the function \(y = -13 + 20x\), we substitute \(x\) with 15:

\(y = -13 + 20(15)\)
\(y = -13 + 300\)
\(y = 287\)

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\) because \(x^0=1\) for any \(x\neq0\), we need to determine the constants \(a\) and \(b\). We will use two pairs of given input-output values to find these two unknowns.

Let's use the following two points for our calculations:

1. Input: 4, Output: 67 -> (x1, y1) = (4, 67)
2. Input: 9, Output: 167 -> (x2, y2) = (9, 167)

Now, we have two equations based on the form of the function:

\(y1 = a + bx1\)
\(y2 = a + bx2\)

Substituting the known values, we get:

\(67 = a + 4b\)  (1)
\(167 = a + 9b\) (2)

We can solve this system of equations by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate \(a\):

\(167 - 67 = a + 9b - (a + 4b)\)
\(100 = 5b\)
\(b = \frac{100}{5} = 20\)

Now that we have \(b\), we can substitute it back into equation (1) or (2) to find \(a\). Using equation (1):

\(67 = a + 4(20)\)
\(67 = a + 80\)
\(a = 67 - 80\)
\(a = -13\)

Thus, our function is:

\(y = a + bx\)
\(y = -13 + 20x\)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients a and b for the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which is actually a linear function y = a + bx, since x^0 = 1 for any x ≠ 0), we need to find a pattern or solve a system of equations using the given input-output pairs.

The form ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

We can use two of the given input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations and solve for a and b. Let's choose the pairs (-10, -213) and (20, 387) to set up our equations:

1. For input -10: 
\[ -213 = a + b(-10) \]
\[ -213 = a - 10b \]
2. For input 20:
\[ 387 = a + b(20) \]
\[ 387 = a + 20b \]

Now we have the following two equations:

1. \( a - 10b = -213 \)
2. \( a + 20b = 387 \)

We can solve for a and b by, for example, subtracting the first equation from the second:

\[(a + 20b) - (a - 10b) = 387 - (-213)\]
\[a + 20b - a + 10b = 387 + 213\]
\[30b = 600\]
\[b = \frac{600}{30}\]
\[b = 20\]

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either equation to find a. Let's use the first equation:

\[ a - 10b = -213 \]
\[ a - 10(20) = -213 \]
\[ a - 200 = -213 \]
\[ a = -213 + 200 \]
\[ a = -13 \]

The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs based on the two points we chose is then:

\[ y = -13 + 20x \]

    The given form is a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which can simplifies to y = a + bx. We have pairs of inputs and outputs which we need to use to calculate the values of a and b. We need at least two points to determine a unique linear function. We will take two pairs of input and output values and form a system of linear equations to solve for a and b.

Let's use the following two points: (x1, y1) = (-10, -213) and (x2, y2) = (20, 387).

From the given points with the function y = a + bx, we get two equations:
1) -213 = a - 10b
2) 387 = a + 20b

We can solve this system of equations for a and b. Let's solve the first equation for a:

-213 = a - 10b
a = -213 + 10b  ...(3)

Now let's substitute (3) into the second equation:

387 = (-213 + 10b) + 20b
387 = -213 + 10b + 20b
387 = -213 + 30b
387 + 213 = 30b
600 = 30b
b = 20

Now let's find a using equation (3) with b = 20:

a = -213 + 10b
a = -213 + 10(20)
a = -213 + 200
a = -13

Thus we have:

a = -13
b = 20

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we need to understand that ax^0 is just a since x^0 = 1 for all x, and bx^1 is simply bx. So effectively, we are looking for a function of the form:

y = a + bx

Let's use two input-output pairs to solve for a and b:

Let's take (x1, y1) = (-10, -213) and (x2, y2) = (20, 387) for our calculations.

Using the first pair (-10, -213):
-213 = a + b(-10)

Using the second pair (20, 387):
387 = a + b(20)

Now we solve this system of equations for a and b.

The first equation becomes:
a = -213 + 10b  ...(1)

Substitute a from equation (1) into the second equation:
387 = (-213 + 10b) + 20b
387 = -213 + 30b
387 + 213 = 30b
600 = 30b
b = 600 / 30
b = 20

Now let's substitute b back into equation (1) to find a:
a = -213 + 10(20)
a = -213 + 200
a = -13

So, the function with these values for a and b is:
y = -13 + 20x

To check if this function is a good fit for the other given points, substitute each input (x) into the equation and see if you get the corresponding output (y).

For x = 9, y should be close to 167:
y = -13 + 20(9) = -13 + 180 = 167

For x = 4, y should be close to 67:
y = -13 + 20(4) = -13 + 80 = 67

For x = -3, y should be close to -73:
y = -13 + 20(-3) = -13 - 60 = -73

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we interpret \(ax^0\) as the constant term (since \(x^0\) is always 1) and \(bx^1\) as the linear term. Our goal is to determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\).

Since we are given a set of inputs and corresponding outputs, we can set up a series of linear equations using the input-output pairs to solve for the values of \(a\) and \(b\). Let's use two of the provided pairs:

For Input 0, Output -3:
\[-3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1\]
\[-3 = a \cdot 1 + b \cdot 0\]
So, \(-3 = a\).

We have found the value of \(a\). Now let's find \(b\). We can take any input-output pair where the input is not 0, let’s take Input -18, Output 339:
\[339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1\]
Substituting \(a = -3\):
\[339 = (-3)(-18)^0 + b(-18)\]
\[339 = -3 \cdot 1 - 18b\]
\[339 = -3 - 18b\]
\[342 = -18b\]
\[b = -\frac{342}{18}\]
\[b = -19\]

Therefore, substituting \(a = -3\) and \(b = -19\) into the function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we obtain:
\[y = -3x^0 - 19x^1\]
\[y = -3 - 19x\]

    To write the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which is effectively y = a + bx since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), we need to identify the constants a and b that best fit the data points provided.

Given the data points:

(-18, 339), (0, -3), (5, -98), (-3, 54), and (-16, 301)

We can set up a system of linear equations based on the data points. However, with five points, we have more equations than we need for just two unknowns. This means we may not be able to get a perfect fit for all points with a single linear equation.

For simplicity, let's use just two data points to find a and b. To simplify the calculation, we'll use the points where the input is 0 and where the input is 5, since the equation when input is 0 gives us the value of 'a' directly.

For the point (0, -3):
y = -3 = a * 0^0 + b * 0^1
-3 = a

For the point (5, -98):
y = -98 = a * 5^0 + b * 5^1
-98 = a + 5b

We already know that a = -3 from the first point, so we can solve the second equation for b:

-98 = -3 + 5b
-98 + 3 = 5b
-95 = 5b
b = -95 / 5
b = -19

Thus, the equation that fits the points (0, -3) and (5, -98) is:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -3 + (-19)x

Let's check this equation with the other points:

For the input of -18:
y = -3 - 19(-18) = -3 + 342 = 339 (perfect match)

For the input of -3:
y = -3 - 19(-3) = -3 + 57 = 54 (perfect match)

For the input of -16:
y = -3 - 19(-16) = -3 + 304 = 301 (perfect match)

It seems that the linear equation perfectly fits all the provided points. This could mean the data was generated by this linear relationship. However, since we did not use a least squares approach that accounts for all points, it's quite lucky that all points fit the equation perfectly—usually, it's recommended to use a more robust fitting method for more data points.

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that this is a linear function where ax^0 = a (because any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 = bx. So our function is of the form:

y = a + bx

We have two unknowns in this equation: a and b. We can use two points to solve for a and b. Let's choose the easiest ones to work with, which are: Input 0, Output -3 and any other point (let's use Input -18, Output 339):

1. For Input 0, to get Output -3:
-3 = a + b(0)
-3 = a

Now we have the value of a, which is -3.

2. For Input -18, to get Output 339:
339 = a + b(-18)

We already know a = -3, so we can plug that in:
339 = -3 - 18b

Now let's solve for b:
339 + 3 = -18b
342 = -18b
b = 342 / -18

So, our function will look like \( y = a + bx \).

Given the inputs and outputs, we need to find values for \( a \) and \( b \) that work for all given pairs of input (x) and output (y). We are looking for a linear function since the form described is that of a line.

\[ 339 = a + b(-18) \]
\[ 339 = a - 18b \]
\[ 18b = a - 339 \]
\[ b = \frac{a - 339}{18} \]

Let's choose two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for 'a' and 'b':

- Subtracting the first equation from the second:

-20 = 4b
b = -20 / 4
b = -5

1) -31 = a + 5b
2) 49 = a - 11b

We can solve for a and b by using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use subtraction to eliminate a and solve for b:
49 - (-31) = (a - 11b) - (a + 5b)
49 + 31 = -11b - 5b
80 = -16b
b = -5

Now that we have b, we can substitute it into one of the equations to solve for a. Using equation 1):
-31 = a + 5(-5)
-31 = a - 25
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

Thus, the coefficients we found are a = -6 and b = -5. Plugging these values into the function form we get:
y = -6x^0 + (-5)x^1
y = -6 + (-5)x

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = -6 - 5x

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is equivalent to y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1, we need to determine the values of a and b that best fit the given input-output pairs.

Let's set up two of the provided pairs as simultaneous equations to solve for a and b:

1. Using Input: 5, Output: -31
-31 = a + 5b

2. Using Input: 9, Output: -51
-51 = a + 9b

Now, we can solve this system of equations for a and b.

Let's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

(-51) - (-31) = (a + 9b) - (a + 5b)
-20 = 4b
b = -20 / 4
b = - 5

Now that we have the value for b, we can solve for a by substituting b back into one of the equations:

-31 = a + 5(-5)
-31 = a - 25
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

    The function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 translates to y = a + bx, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the line.

Given the inputs and outputs, we can substitute them into the general form of the equation to find out what the constants a and b are. 

Let's work with two points to find the slope (b):

Using inputs 5 and 9 and their respective outputs -31 and -51, we have:

-31 = a + 5b (1)
-51 = a + 9b (2)

Let's solve these equations simultaneously:

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

(-51) - (-31) = (a + 9b) - (a + 5b)
-20 = 4b
b = -5

Now, we know the slope (b) is -5. Let's find a by substituting b back into either equation (1) or (2). Using equation (1):

-31 = a + 5(-5)
-31 = a - 25
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that maps each input to its corresponding output, we should recognize that ax^0 (since anything raise to the power of 0 is 1) is simply a constant term, a. And bx^1 is just bx since anything raised to the power of 1 is the value itself.

We are thus looking for a linear equation of the form:
\[ y = a + bx \]

where \( a \) is the y-intercept of the equation (the value of y when x is 0), and \( b \) is the slope of the line, which represents how much y changes for a change in x.

Using any two points, let's calculate the slope first (I'll use points (7, -98) and (-6, 58)):

\[ b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{58 - (-98)}{-6 - 7} = \frac{58 + 98}{-13} = \frac{156}{-13} = -12 \]

Now that we know the slope is -12, we plug it into one of the points to get 'a'. I will use the point (7, -98):

\[ -98 = a + (-12)(7) \]
\[ -98 = a - 84 \]
\[ a = -98 + 84 \]
\[ a = -14 \]

So the function that describes the data is:
\[ y = -14 - 12x \]

Let's verify this function using all the given input-output pairs:
- For x = 7:  y = -14 - 12(7) = -14 - 84 = -98 (which matches the output)
- For x = 17: y = -14 - 12(17) = -14 - 204 = -218 (which matches the output)
- For x = 5:  y = -14 - 12(5) = -14 - 60 = -74 (which matches the output)

    To determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) for the function in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we need to find a pattern from the given inputs and outputs. The form of the function simplifies as follows since \(x^0 = 1\) for any \(x\):

\[y = a + bx\]

Let's use two of the given input-output pairs to solve for \(a\) and \(b\):

Using the input-output pair (7, -98), we have:

\[-98 = a + 7b\]  (1)

Using the input-output pair (17, -218), we have:

\[-218 = a + 17b\]  (2)

Now, we can solve the system of linear equations to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\). Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) gives:

\[-218 - (-98) = (a + 17b) - (a + 7b)\]
\[-120 = 10b\]
\[b = -12\]

Substitute \(b = -12\) into equation (1) to solve for \(a\):

\[-98 = a + 7(-12)\]
\[-98 = a - 84\]
\[a = -98 + 84\]
\[a = -14\]

So the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We have pairs of inputs and outputs that we can use to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use two of those pairs to create a system of linear equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Take two pairs of inputs and outputs:

1) x = 7, y = -98
2) x = 17, y = -218

Using these pairs in the function \( y = a + bx \):

1) -98 = a + b(7)
2) -218 = a + b(17)

Now, we can solve this system of equations. First, make Equation (1) ""a"" subject:

a = -98 - 7b  -------- (3)

Substitute equation (3) in equation (2):

-218 = (-98 - 7b) + b(17)

Combine like terms:

-218 = -98 - 7b + 17b
-218 = -98 + 10b
-218 + 98 = 10b
-120 = 10b

Divide by 10 to solve for b:

b = -120 / 10
b = -12

Now, place the value of b back into equation (3):

a = -98 + 84
a = -14

So the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and the outputs in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) is:

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we first need to recognize that ax^0 is the same as a because any number to the power of zero is one.

Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. Now we need to determine the coefficients a and b.

Let's use two points to calculate the slope (b):

Using the inputs and outputs (x1, y1) = (7, -98) and (x2, y2) = (17, -218), we calculate the slope b like so:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-218 - (-98)) / (17 - 7)
b = (-218 + 98) / (10)
b = -120 / 10
b = -12

Now, we have the slope of the line, which is b = -12. Next, we need to find a. We can plug in the values of any point into the equation y = a + bx and solve for a. Using the point (7, -98):

    To find a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we actually want a function of the form y = a + bx, because x^0 is 1 for all x ≠ 0, so ax^0 = a.

We can use two points to determine the function. Let's use the points (7, -98) and (17, -218). Plugging them into the function we get two equations:

1. For input 7: -98 = a + b * 7
2. For input 17: -218 = a + b * 17

Now we will solve these two equations to find the values for a and b:

From equation 1:
-98 = a + 7b  =>  a = -98 - 7b           ... (3)

Now substitute a from equation (3) into equation 2:
-218 = (-98 - 7b) + 17b
-218 = -98 - 7b + 17b
-218 = -98 + 10b
-218 + 98 = 10b
-120 = 10b

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the coefficients a and b that apply to all given input-output pairs.

The term ax^0 is equal to a since any value to the power of zero is 1. So this is effectively a constant term in the equation. The term bx^1 is simply bx since any value to the power of 1 is the value itself.

Given the pairs:
- When x = -13, y = -197
- When x = -11, y = -169
- When x = 20, y = 265
- When x = -10, y = -155
- When x = 7, y = 83

We can see a pattern here where the output y is related to the input x by a difference that seems to be a constant increment.

To verify this, let's calculate the difference between y and x for a few pairs:

For x = -13, y - x = -197 - (-13) = -184
For x = -11, y - x = -169 - (-11) = -158
For x = 20, y - x = 265 - 20 = 245
For x = -10, y - x = -155 - (-10) = -145
For x = 7, y - x = 83 - 7 = 76

The differences do not all match, which means we have made a mistake. We need to find a consistent relationship between x and y.

Instead, let's try another method. We can look at how y changes as x changes. Let's compare the outputs for points that are close to one another:

From x = -11 to x = -10, y goes from -169 to -155. The change in x is 1, and the change in y is 14.
From x = -10 to x = 7, y goes from -155 to 83. The change in x is 17, and the change in y is 238.

Although we could continue with this, the simplest method to solve for two unknowns (a and b) is to use two pairs of inputs and outputs and create a system of linear equations. Let's use the pairs where x = -10 and x = 7.

For x = -10, y = -155 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1 => a - 10b = -155 ...(1)
For x = 7, y = 83 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1 => a + 7b = 83 ...(2)

Now we need to solve this system of equations for a and b. We can subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

a + 7b - (a - 10b) = 83 - (-155)
a + 7b - a + 10b = 83 + 155
17b = 238
b = 238 / 17
b = 14

Now, let's put the value of b back into equation (1) to solve for a:

b = 14

Now we have the value for \(b\) and can plug it back into Equation 4 to find \(a\):

a = 265 - 20(14)
a = 265 - 280
a = -15

Therefore, the function that fits the data is:

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we recognize that ax^0 is a constant term (since anything raised to the power of zero is one), and bx^1 is simply bx as anything raised to the power of one is itself. We will try to find the values of a and b given the input-output pairs.

Let's analyze the input-output pairs for any patterns:

For an input x = -13, the output y is -197:
y = a(-13)^0 + b(-13)
y = a + b(-13)
-197 = a - 13b    ...(1)

For an input x = -11, the output is -169:
y = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)
y = a + b(-11)
-169 = a - 11b    ...(2)

For an input x = 20, the output is 265:
y = a(20)^0 + b(20)
y = a + b(20)
265 = a + 20b    ...(3)

For an input x = -10, the output is -155:
y = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)
y = a + b(-10)
-155 = a - 10b    ...(4)

For an input x = 7, the output is 83:
y = a(7)^0 + b(7)
y = a + b(7)
83 = a + 7b    ...(5)

I will now perform computations on the input-output pairs to determine consistent values for a and b.

Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

(-197) - (-169) = (a - 13b) - (a - 11b)
-28 = -13b + 11b
-28 = -2b
b = 14    ...(6)

With b determined, let's use it in equation (5):
83 = a + 7b
83 = a + 7(14)
83 = a + 98
a = 83 - 98
a = -15

So, the values for a and b are:
a = -15
b = 14

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we need to determine the values of a and b that will make our function capture the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y). In the given form, ax^0 is simply a constant term (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is a linear term in x.

The function can be simplified to:

y = a + bx

To find a and b, we need to set up a system of equations using the provided input-output pairs. However, since we only have two coefficients (a and b) to determine, we only need two input-output pairs to solve for a and b. Let's use the first two pairs:

For input 9 (output 160):
160 = a + 9b

For input 13 (output 228):
228 = a + 13b

Now we solve this system of linear equations. Let's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

228 - 160 = a + 13b - (a + 9b)
68 = 4b
b = 68 / 4
b = 17

Now we substitute b back into one of the original equations to find a. Let's use the first equation:

160 = a + 9(17)
160 = a + 153
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

Thus, we find that a = 7 and b = 17. The function that describes the data is:

    To create a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the data provided. The term \( ax^0 \) is equivalent to \( a \) since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x except for x=0, and the term \( bx^1 \) is simply \( bx \). So the function will look like \( y = a + bx \).

We can determine \( a \) and \( b \) by plugging in the inputs and outputs into the equation and solving for these constants. We need at least two points to determine a linear function (as we have two unknowns); fortunately, five sets of points are given. However, since the values could be rounded or imprecise, using more points will give a more accurate determination of \( a \) and \( b \) using a method such as least squares regression. But here, we'll mainly use the standard algebraic method for two points.

Let's use the first two points (9, 160) and (13, 228) to set up a system of equations:

1. \( 160 = a + 9b \)
2. \( 228 = a + 13b \)

To solve for \( a \) and \( b \), we can use the subtraction method. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

\( 228 - 160 = (a + 13b) - (a + 9b) \)
\( 68 = 4b \)
\( b = 17 \)

Now, using the value of \( b \) in the first equation:

\( 160 = a + 9 \times 17 \)
\( 160 = a + 153 \)
\( a = 160 - 153 \)
\( a = 7 \)

So the function is:
\( y = 7 + 17x \)

However, to confirm that our function is correct, we can plug in the other points to see if they fit:

For x = -4:
\( y = 7 + 17 \times (-4) \)
\( y = 7 - 68 \)
\( y = -61 \) (which fits the given data)

For x = 15:
\( y = 7 + 17 \times (15) \)
\( y = 7 + 255 \)
\( y = 262 \) (which fits the given data)

For x = -20:
\( y = 7 + 17 \times (-20) \)
\( y = 7 - 340 \)
\( y = -333 \) (which fits the given data)

All the given points fit the derived function, which supports our solution. Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we should recognize that x^0 is 1 for any x that isn't 0. Therefore, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can use the given input-output pairs to determine the constants a and b. Let's consider two pairs of inputs and outputs to form a system of equations:

For the input 9 (output 160): 160 = a + 9b
For the input 13 (output 228): 228 = a + 13b

b = 68 / 4
b = 17

For the point (9, 160):

    To write a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are essentially creating a linear equation of the form \( y = b_0 + b_1x \), where \( b_0 \) is the y-intercept and \( b_1 \) is the slope of the line. Let's use two given data points to calculate the coefficients:

1. Let's use the points (9, 160) and (13, 228) to find the slope \( b_1 \):

\[ b_1 = \frac{output_2 - output_1}{input_2 - input_1} 
= \frac{228 - 160}{13 - 9}

Now that we have the slope, let's solve for \( b_0 \) using the slope and one of the points:

2. Using the point (9, 160) and the slope \( b_1 = 17 \):

\[ y - y_1 = b_1(x - x_1) \]
\[ y = b_1(x - x_1) + y_1 \]

We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of a the same:

\( 119 = 7a - 14b \)
\( -290 = 2a + 14b \)

Now, we add the equations together to eliminate \( b \):

\( 119 + (-290) = (7a + 2a) + (-14b + 14b) \)
\( -171 = 9a \)

Now we solve for \( a \):

\( a = -171 / 9 \)
\( a = -19 \)

Now that we have \( a \), we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for \( b \). We'll use the first equation:

\[y = a + bx\]

Now, we can use two points from the given input-output pairs to solve for the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\). Let's take the two points (-2, 17) and (7, -145) for our calculation. We can set up two equations in two unknowns:

For the input -2 and output 17:

\[17 = a - 2b\]

For the input 7 and output -145:

    The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. We are thus trying to find a linear relationship of the form y = a + bx that can best explain the input-output pairs provided.

To define the function, we need to determine the constants a and b that will satisfy the relationship for each pair of values. We have five input-output pairs, which will be used to solve for a and b. 

It is best to use two points to determine the equation of a line. Let's use the input-output pairs (-2, 17) and (7, -145):

For input -2:

-290 = 2a + 14b (4)

Add equations (3) and (4) to eliminate b:

119 - 290 = 7a - 14b + 2a + 14b
-171 = 9a

Divide both sides by 9 to solve for a:

a = -171 / 9
a = -19

Substitute a = -19 into (1) to solve for b:

17 = -19 - 2b

Add 19 to both sides:

1) 17 = a + b(-2)  ->  17 = a - 2b
2) -145 = a + b(7)  ->  -145 = a + 7b

Let's subtract the first equation from the second one to eliminate a:

You can either solve this system using various methods of algebra, such as substitution or elimination. Alternatively, as this system is over-determined (we have more equations than unknowns), a numerical approach, such as least squares regression, could also be used to find an approximate solution.

However, in this case, given we are looking for an exact solution and given that the equations are linear, a more systematic approach can reveal a pattern.

If you observe carefully, every time the input decreases by 1, the output decreases by a constant rate. From (2) to (1), we see that decreasing the x value by 9 increases the y value by 162. From (3) to (1), the x value decreases by 8, and the y value increases by 144. Clearly, the rate of decrease in y value is 18 per each single decrease in x-value.

Let's calculate b using this rate of change:

b = Δy / Δx
b = 18 (since the output changes by 18 for each 1 unit decrease in input)

Now, let's substitute b = 18 into one of the equations to solve for a.

a - 2(18) = 17

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we have to determine the coefficients a and b. In this form, a and b are constants, x is the input, and y is the output. The term ax^0 is simply a, because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Given that the form of the function must be y = a + bx, we can use two of the input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations to solve for a and b. Let's use the following two pairs for our calculations: (x₁, y₁) = (20, -307) and (x₂, y₂) = (12, -187).

For the first pair (20, -307):
-307 = a + 20b  ... (1)

For the second pair (12, -187):
-187 = a + 12b  ... (2)

Now we can solve this system of linear equations. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

(-307) - (-187) = (a + 20b) - (a + 12b)
-120 = 8b
b = -120 / 8
b = -15

Now that we have the value for b, we can solve for a using one of the initial equations (we'll use equation (1)):

-307 = a + 20(-15)
-307 = a - 300
a = -307 + 300
a = -7

Now we have the values for a and b, so the function can be written as:

y = -7 + (-15)x
Or simplifying it to match the format you requested:
y = -7x^0 - 15x^1 

Or simply:
y = -7 - 15x

    To determine the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to understand what the terms represent:

- x is the input variable.
- y is the output variable.
- ax^0 is a constant term (since any number to the power of zero is 1, this effectively means a).
- bx^1 is a linear term (since any number to the power of one is itself, this effectively means bx).

Since we're looking for a linear relationship between x and y, we need to calculate the coefficients a and b for our function y = a + bx. We can find a and b using two points from the given data. Let's use the following two points: (x1, y1) = (20, -307) and (x2, y2) = (-1, 8).

Now we have two equations based on the general form y = a + bx:

1. -307 = a + 20b
2. 8 = a - 1b

We can solve these two linear equations to find the values of a and b.

First, let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate the a term:

-307 - 8 = a + 20b - (a - 1b)
-315 = 21b

Now we solve for b:

b = -315 / 21
b = -15

Now that we have b, we can use it to solve for a using either of the original equations. We'll use equation 2:

8 = a - 1(-15)
8 = a + 15
a = 8 - 15
a = -7

So, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) for the linear function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can use two data points from the given set of inputs and outputs. The equation can be simplified to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) that is not zero.

Let's use the points (20, -307) and (-1, 8):

For the first point (20, -307):

1. -307 = a + 20b

For the second point (-1, 8):

2. 8 = a - b

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1. -307 = a + 20b
2. 8 = a - b

Solving these two equations simultaneously allows us to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \). We can start by solving equation 2 for \( a \):

2. 8 = a - b
a = 8 + b

Then we plug this expression for \( a \) into equation 1:

1. -307 = (8 + b) + 20b
-307 = 8 + 21b
-315 = 21b
b = -15

Now use the value of \( b \) to solve for \( a \):

a = 8 + b
a = 8 - 15
a = -7

Our final function is then:

y = -7x^0 - 15x^1

    To get the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that will best fit the given input-output pairs.

Given that we have several pairs of data points, we can use two of them to solve the equation system to obtain \( a \) and \( b \). Let's take the first two non-repeating data points:

For Input \( x = 20 \) and Output \( y = -307 \):
\[ -307 = a + 20b \]

For Input \( x = -1 \) and Output \( y = 8 \):
\[ 8 = a - b \]

Now, we can solve this system of equations. From the second equation, we can express \( a \) in terms of \( b \):
\[ a = 8 + b \]

Substituting this into the first equation:
\[ -307 = (8 + b) + 20b \]
\[ -307 = 8 + 21b \]
\[ -315 = 21b \]
\[ b = -315 / 21 \]
\[ b = -15 \]

Now, substituting \( b \) back into the equation for \( a \):
\[ a = 8 + b \]
\[ a = 8 - 15 \]
\[ a = -7 \]

So the function that fits the data points given is:

Let's use the pairs (20, -307) and (-1, 8).

From the input 20 and output -307, we get:
-307 = a + 20b

From the input -1 and output 8, we get:
8 = a - b

We can now solve this system of equations. First, we'll rewrite them:

1) a + 20b = -307
2) a - b = 8

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:

(1) - (2) -> (a + 20b) - (a - b) = ( - 307 ) - ( 8 )
             a + 20b - a + b = -307 - 8
             21b = -315

Now solve for b:

b = -315 / 21
b = -15

Plug the value of b back into one of the original equations to solve for a:

a - b = 8
a - (-15) = 8
a + 15 = 8

Solve for a:

a = 8 - 15

    To write a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we must find values for a and b that create a linear equation which models the given input-output pairs.

Since ax^0 is always a because any number to the power of 0 is 1, our equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can use the pairs of inputs and outputs to form equations and then solve for a and b. Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to create a system of linear equations.

For example, using the pairs (13, -66) and (0, 12), we have:

-66 = a + b(13)  [1]
12 = a + b(0)    [2]

From equation [2], it's immediately apparent that a = 12 because when x = 0, bx^1 will be 0 (because anything times 0 is 0), so y = a.

Now substituting a = 12 into equation [1]:

-66 = 12 + b(13)
-66 = 12 + 13b
-66 - 12 = 13b
-78 = 13b
b = -78 / 13
b = -6

Now we have our values for a and b:

a = 12
b = -6

So the function, in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, is:

y = 12x^0 - 6x^1
Which simplifies to:
y = 12 - 6x

We can check this function with the other given pairs to ensure it fits:

Given the pairs of input and output, we create the following equations:

1. When x = 13, y = -66:
   \[ -66 = a + 13b \]

2. When x = -20, y = 132:
   \[ 132 = a - 20b \]

3. When x = 18, y = -96:
   \[ -96 = a + 18b \]

4. When x = 0, y = 12 (here, since \( x^0 = 1 \) and \( x^1 = 0 \), this simplifies to \( y = a \)):
   \[ 12 = a \]

5. When x = 11, y = -54:
   \[ -54 = a + 11b \]

Now we already know that a = 12 from equation 4. We can substitute this value into one of the other equations to find b. Let's use it in the first equation:

\[ -66 = 12 + 13b \]
\[ -66 - 12 = 13b \]
\[ -78 = 13b \]
\[ b = \frac{-78}{13} \]
\[ b = -6 \]

Now, we plug the values of a and b back into the original form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \):

So, we are looking for a function in the form of y = a + bx.

Let's use two data points to solve for a and b as a system of linear equations:

1) Using the input-output pair (0, 12):
12 = a + b(0)
From this, we can see that a = 12 since b(0) will be zero irrespective of the value of b.

2) Now let's use another pair, for example, (13, -66):

Now we have the following system of linear equations:

1) a - 17b = -325
2) a + 16b = 269

To solve for a and b, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Let's utilize the elimination method:

Adding equation 1) and equation 2) gives us:

(a - 17b) + (a + 16b) = -325 + 269
2a - b = -56

Now, let's isolate b in terms of a:

b = 2a + 56

Let's substitute b back into one of the original equations to find a. We can use equation 2):

Let's take two point pairs (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) from the given data to create the equations. We'll use the points (-17, -325) and (16, 269).

Substituting the first point into the function form, we get:

-325 = a + b(-17)

Substituting the second point into the function form, we get:
y2 = a(16)^0 + b(16)
269 = a + 16b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1) -325 = a - 17b
2) 269 = a + 16b

We can solve this system by adding the two equations together to eliminate a:

-325 + 269 = a - 17b + a + 16b
-56 = 2a - b

Now, divide by 2 to solve for a:

-28 = a - (1/2)b

Let's express b in terms of a using equation 2:

b = (269 - a)/16

Substitute b back into the equation we derived for a:

-28 = a - (1/2)((269 - a)/16)
-28 = a - (269/32) + (a/32)
-28 = (32a + a - 269) / 32
-28 = (33a - 269) / 32

Multiply both sides by 32 to get rid of the denominator:

-896 = 33a - 269

Add 269 to both sides:

-627 = 33a

-109 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)
-109 = a - 5b

Now we have a system of linear equations:

-325 = a - 17b
-109 = a - 5b

Let's subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:

-325 - (-109) = (-17b) - (-5b)
-216 = -12b

Solving for b gives us b = 18.

Now, let's find a using b = 18 and the second equation:

-109 = a - 5(18)
-109 = a - 90

Adding 90 to both sides:

-19 = a

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) is:

y = -19x^0 + 18x^1
y = -19 + 18x

    To write the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which is equivalent to y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0), we will need to find the values for a and b that fit the given input-output pairs.

Given the input-output pairs (-17, -325), (-5, -109), (16, 269), (-15, -289), and (-15, -289), we need to find the constants a and b.

First, let's substitute one of the input-output pairs into the equation y = a + bx.

For the input x = -17 and output y = -325:
-325 = a - 17b ... (1)

Next, let's use another pair, for example, x = 16 and y = 269:
269 = a + 16b ... (2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
-325 = a - 17b ... (1)
269 = a + 16b ... (2)

Let's solve this system by adding equation (1) to (2) to eliminate a:
-325 + 269 = a - 17b + a + 16b
-56 = 2a - b

We can simplify this to:
b = 2a + 56 ... (3)

Now, substituting (3) into equation (2):
269 = a + 16(2a + 56)
269 = a + 32a + 896
33a = 269 - 896
33a = -627
a = -627 / 33
a = -19

Now we can use the value of a to solve for b using equation (3):
b = 2(-19) + 56
b = -38 + 56
b = 18

Therefore, the function that fits the given data points is:
y = -19x^0 + 18x^1

Or simplifying (since x^0 is 1):
y = -19 + 18x

    Given the relation you have suggested in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, this implies that the function is linear, where ax^0 is the constant term (because any number to the power of 0 equals 1), and bx^1 is the x term (since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself).

Let's calculate the two coefficients based on the given input-output pairs:

Using the input-output pairs (-17, -325) and (16, 269), we can create a system of equations to solve for a and b.

For the input -17:

y = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1
-325 = a + b(-17)

For the input 16:

y = a(16)^0 + b(16)^1
269 = a + b(16)

Now we have the system of equations:

1) a - 17b = -325
2) a + 16b = 269

Let's solve this system:

Add the two equations to eliminate a:

(1) + (2): a - 17b + a + 16b = -325 + 269
2a - b = -56

a - b/2 = -28

Solve for b first by subtracting the first equation from the second:

(2) - (1): a + 16b - (a - 17b) = 269 - (-325)
33b = 594
b = 594/33
b = 18

Now solving for a using the first equation:

a - 17(18) = -325
a - 306 = -325
a = -325 + 306
a = -19

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can treat it as a linear equation y = a + bx, because x^0 is 1 for all x except for x = 0 (although by convention 0^0 is usually treated as equal to 1 in mathematics), and x^1 is just x. So essentially, we need to find the constants a and b that define the line that best fits the given input-output pairs.

Assuming the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) is indeed linear, we can use two points to find the exact line. Let's take the first two points given:

For input 10 (x1), output is 142 (y1): y1 = a + b*x1 ⇒ 142 = a + 10b
For input 15 (x2), output is 217 (y2): y2 = a + b*x2 ⇒ 217 = a + 15b

We can solve these two equations to find a and b.

First, subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

217 - 142 = (a + 15b) - (a + 10b)
75 = 5b
b = 75 / 5
b = 15

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to find a. We'll use the first equation:

142 = a + 10*15
142 = a + 150
a = 142 - 150
a = -8

Hence, the function is y = a + bx, with a = -8 and b = 15. So the function in the exact form requested would be:

Let's use the points (10, 142) and (-10, -158).

For the point (10, 142):
142 = a + 10b

For the point (-10, -158):
-158 = a - 10b

Now we have two simultaneous linear equations:

1) 142 = a + 10b
2) -158 = a - 10b

Let's solve this system of equations for a and b:

Adding 1) and 2) to eliminate a, we get:

    To find the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) for the function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\) as \(x^0 = 1\) for any \(x\) that is not zero, we have to solve a system of linear equations using the given input-output pairs.

First, we recognize that we essentially need to find a line of best fit for the given points (10, 142), (15, 217), (-10, -158), (-4, -68), and (13, 187). The general equation of a line in this form is:

\[ y = a + bx \]

where \(y\) is the output, \(x\) is the input, \(a\) is the y-intercept (value of \(y\) when \(x=0\)), and \(b\) is the slope of the line (change in \(y\) for a unit change in \(x\)).

Let's plug one of the input-output pairs into the equation to determine the relationship between \(a\) and \(b\):

Using the pair (10, 142):
\[ 142 = a + b(10) \]
\[ 142 = a + 10b \]

Using the pair (15, 217):
\[ 217 = a + b(15) \]
\[ 217 = a + 15b \]

We can find \(b\) by subtracting the first equation from the second one:

\( (217 - 142) = (a + 15b) - (a + 10b) \)

\( 75 = 5b \)

\( b = 15 \)

Now that we have \(b\), let's plug it back into the first equation to find \(a\):

\( 142 = a + 10(15) \)

\( 142 = a + 150 \)

\( a = 142 - 150 \)

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data points, we will need to determine the values of a and b that make the equation consistent with the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

Since ax^0 is always a because x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. 

Now let's determine a and b using the given input and output values. We can set up a system of linear equations using two of the given data points to solve for a and b.

Let's take two data points:

1) For Input 10, Output 142:
142 = a + b(10)

2) For Input -10, Output -158:
-158 = a + b(-10)

1) a + 10b = 142
2) a - 10b = -158

We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations together to find the value of a, and then we can use the value of a to determine b.

Adding 1) and 2) together:
a + 10b + a - 10b = 142 - 158
2a = -16
a = -16 / 2
a = -8

Now that we have a, we can solve for b using either equation 1) or 2). We'll use equation 1):

To solve for 'a' and 'b', it will be helpful to have two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

Let's use the following two points from the provided data:
Point 1 (x1, y1): (10, 142)
Point 2 (x2, y2): (-10, -158)

First, let's write down the equations with the two points.

For Point 1:
y1 = a + bx1
142 = a + b(10)

We can find the coefficient \( b \) (slope of the line) by taking two input-output pairs and calculating the change in output divided by the change in input:

Using the input-output pairs (5, 76) and (3, 48):

\( b = \frac{{\text{Change in Output}}}{{\text{Change in Input}}} \)
\( b = \frac{{76 - 48}}{{5 - 3}} \)
\( b = \frac{{28}}{{2}} \)

    To find the function that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we should start by noting that the function is linear in form, given the requested form y = ax^0 + bx^1. This simplifies to y = a + bx, because x^0 = 1 for any x that is not zero.

The function is a straight line, and we need to determine the constants 'a' and 'b'. Based on the data we have, we can form a system of linear equations and solve for 'a' and 'b'. However, since the data points provided do not align perfectly on a straight line, it is reasonable to assume this system of equations might be overdetermined, so we might need to use a method like least squares regression to approximate the values of 'a' and 'b'. But let's try to see whether a straightforward solution is possible.

We will try to find a pattern in the outputs for corresponding inputs that we can use to determine 'a' and 'b'. Let's explore the differences between successive outputs and inputs:

Output difference between inputs 5 and 3:
76 - 48 = 28

Input difference between inputs 5 and 3:
5 - 3 = 2

Output difference between inputs 3 and -1:
48 - (-8) = 56

Input difference between inputs 3 and -1:
3 - (-1) = 4

We notice that an input difference of 2 corresponds to an output difference of 28, which suggests that for every 1 increase in input, the output increases by 14. This indicates that 'b' is likely 14.

We can then plug in one of the input-output pairs to solve for 'a'. Let's use the input-output pair (3, 48):

48 = a + 14*3
48 = a + 42
a = 48 - 42
a = 6

Thus, our function is likely:

To clarify, ax^0 is always a, since any number to the power of zero is 1, and bx^1 is simply b times x.

We have pairs of inputs and outputs, which we can treat as (x, y) coordinates:

(-1, -8), (5, 76), (3, 48), (8, 118), (13, 188)

Using two points from the data, we can solve for a and b. For simplification, let's use the first two points (-1, -8) and (5, 76).

Setting up the equations by plugging the x and y values into y = a + bx:

For the input -1 (x = -1, y = -8):
-8 = a + b(-1)  ... (1)

For the input 5 (x = 5, y = 76):

Now we can solve these two equations as a system of linear equations.

From equation (1), we get:

1) For the point (5, 76):

2) For the point (-1, -8):
-8 = a + b(-1)

Now we have two equations:

(1) 76 = 5b + a
(2) -8 = -b + a

Let's solve for a and b using these two equations.

Multiplying the second equation by 5 to align terms with the first equation for elimination:

(2) becomes -40 = -5b + 5a

Adding (1) and (2):

(1) 76 = 5b + a
(2) -40 = -5b + 5a
-------------------
      36 = 6a

Now, divide both sides by 6 to solve for a:

    ","To find the output for the input -16, we use the function y = 6 + 14x.

y = -218

    To find a linear function that fits the given inputs and outputs in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\), we need to determine the constants \(a\) and \(b\).

Given a line, we know there are infinitely many ways to describe it with different points, but we only need two unique points to find the specific line described by these data points. Let's pick two data points to calculate \(a\) and \(b\):

Let's choose the points \((1, 2)\) and \((-19, 122)\).

For the first point (1, 2):

\(2 = a(1)^0 + b(1^1)\)
\(2 = a + b\)

For the second point (-19, 122):

\(122 = a(-19)^0 + b(-19^1)\)
\(122 = a - 19b\)

Now we have a system of two equations that we can solve for \(a\) and \(b\):

1. \(2 = a + b\)
2. \(122 = a - 19b\)

Let's solve this system by using the first equation to express \(a\) in terms of \(b\), and then substitute that into the second equation.

From equation 1:
\(a = 2 - b\)

Substitute \(a\) into equation 2:
\(122 = (2 - b) - 19b\)
\(122 = 2 - 20b\)
\(120 = -20b\)
\(b = -6\)

Now that we have \(b\), we can substitute it back into the equation for \(a\):

\(a = 2 - (-6)\)
\(a = 2 + 6\)
\(a = 8\)

Thus, the function in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), or \(y = a + bx\), with the given points is:

\(y = 8 - 6x\)

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of a and b that satisfy the given input-output pairs as closely as possible.

Let's organize the data into coordinate pairs, with the inputs as x-values and the corresponding outputs as y-values:

(1, 2)
(-19, 122)
(17, -94)
(15, -82)
(-6, 44)

Now, since the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx (because x^0 is always 1), we can frame this as a simple linear relationship where ""a"" is the y-intercept and ""b"" is the slope.

By examining the points, we can quickly see a pattern that suggests the linear relationship between x and y:

For example, if we take the pair (1, 2) and (-6, 44):
The difference in y is 44 - 2 = 42
The difference in x is -6 - 1 = -7

Using the slope formula (change in y)/(change in x), the slope ""b"" would be 42 / -7 = -6.

Testing this with another pair such as (1, 2) and (15, -82):
The difference in y is -82 - 2 = -84
The difference in x is 15 - 1 = 14

The slope ""b"" here would be -84 / 14 = -6, which confirms the slope we calculated previously.

Now, let's calculate ""a"" using one of the points, say (1, 2):

2 = a + (-6)*1
2 = a - 6
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

So, the function that describes the data in the form requested is:

y = 8x^0 - 6x^1
which simplifies to
y = 8 - 6x.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we first need to understand what the given coefficients and powers represent:

- \(ax^0\) is a constant term because \(x^0 = 1\) for any value of \(x\), other than 0. So this term will just be a constant value, which we denote as \(a\).
- \(bx^1\) is a linear term since \(x^1 = x\). It represents a term that will scale with the value of \(x\). We denote the coefficient of this term as \(b\).

Given this form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can rewrite it to a more familiar linear function form: y = a + bx.

Now our task is to find the values of a and b that best fit the given five data points: (1, 2), (-19, 122), (17, -94), (15, -82), and (-6, 44). The best way to accomplish this with five distinct data points, which do not fall perfectly on a straight line, would be to use a method like least squares regression. However, here you are asking for a pattern recognition solution, which might suggest a simplified approach that works with the provided data.

Observing the inputs (x) and outputs (y) given, there's no immediate apparent linear relation given the large changes in output for small changes in input. However, we can find a linear equation that exactly fits two points and provides an approximate fit for the others if the data is in fact linear. Since the exact calculation for a least squares regression might be too complex for this format, let's simplify the process by selecting two points through which to pass our linear function and see if it satisfies the other points or comes close to them. To illustrate this, we'll use the first two points:

Using the points (1, 2) and (-19, 122), we can set up two equations:

1. For the point (1, 2), the equation is 2 = a + 1*b
2. For the point (-19, 122), the equation is 122 = a - 19*b

Now we solve this system of two linear equations for a and b:

From the first equation, we have: a = 2 - b
Substituting a in the second equation:

122 = (2 - b) - 19*b
122 = 2 - 20*b
20*b = 2 - 122
20*b = -120
b = -120 / 20
b = -6

Using b to find a:
a = 2 - (-6)
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

So our function, based on these two points, would be y = 8 - 6x, which is written in the ""y = ax^0 + bx^1"" form as y = 8x^0 - 6x^1.

To verify if our function seems reasonable for the remaining points:

For x = 17, y should approximately be 8 - 6(17) = 8 - 102 = -94 (which matches the given output).
For x = 15, y should approximately be 8 - 6(15) = 8 - 90 = -82 (which matches the given output).
For x = -6, y should approximately be 8 - 6(-6) = 8 + 36 = 44 (which matches the given output).

So the approximate function that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs is:

y = 8x^0 - 6x^1

or simplifying it to common algebraic notation:

y = 8 - 6x

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we'll need to determine the values of the coefficients a and b. Since ax^0 is just a (because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can use two of the given data points to set up a system of equations to solve for a and b. Let's use these two points: (1, 2) and (-19, 122).

From the point (1, 2):
2 = a + b(1)
2 = a + b

From the point (-19, 122):
122 = a + b(-19)
122 = a - 19b

Now we can solve this system of equations. Let's multiply the first equation by 19 to help eliminate b:

From 2 = a + b, multiplying by 19 gives:
38 = 19a + 19b

Now we can subtract the second equation from this new equation:

(38 = 19a + 19b) - (122 = a - 19b)
38 - 122 = 19a - a + 19b + 19b
-84 = 18a + 38b
-84/18 = a + (38b/18)
-4.666... = a + 2.111...b

Now we have a single equation with both variables, which is more complicated to solve due to the decimals involved. Instead, let's approach it with a different strategy.

Let's subtract the first equation from the second:

(122 - 2) = (a - a) + b(-19 - 1)
120 = -20b
b = -6

Now that we have the value for b, we can substitute it back into the first equation (2 = a + b) to find a:

2 = a + (-6)
2 + 6 = a
a = 8

The function is therefore:
y = 8 - 6x

So in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, it would be:
y = 8x^0 - 6x^1

This may not provide a perfect fit for all data points, but it's the best linear approximation based on the two points we chose. It's also important to note that if this were a real-world scenario, there may not be a linear relationship that fits all data points exactly, and other statistical methods would be employed to find the best fit.

    To find the function that best describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) in the given form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we observe that \( ax^0 \) is just \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 regardless of the value of \( x \), and \( bx^1 \) is simply \( bx \) since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself.

Given this form, our function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \). Now we need to find \( a \) and \( b \) that match the data points provided.

To solve for \( a \) and \( b \), we have to set up a system of linear equations using two of the given points. It's often easiest to choose the simplest points to work with. For this, we'll use:

Input: 1
Output: 2

and

Input: -19
Output: 122

This gives us the two following equations:

For input 1: \( 2 = a + b(1) \) (which simplifies to \( 2 = a + b \))

For input -19: \( 122 = a + b(-19) \) (which simplifies to \( 122 = a - 19b \))

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find \( a \) and \( b \). Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:

\( 2 - 122 = (a - a) + (b - (-19b)) \)
\( -120 = 20b \)
\( b = -6 \)

Now substitute \( b \) back into the first equation to find \( a \):

\( 2 = a - 6(1) \)
\( 2 = a - 6 \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we need to determine the coefficients a and b.

Let's denote:
- x as the input
- y as the output
- ax^0 as the constant term a (since any number to the power of 0 is 1)
- bx^1 as the term with the input variable (which is just bx since any number to the power of 1 is itself)

Since the input-output pairs given form a straight line when plotted, we can find the coefficients a and b through two points. Let's use two points from the given data to construct two equations and solve for a and b:

(1) y1 = ax^0 + bx^1, where x = -17 and y = -292
=> -292 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)
=> -292 = a - 17b

(2) y2 = ax^0 + bx^1, where x = 1 and y = 14
=> 14 = a(1)^0 + b(1)
=> 14 = a + b

Now, we have two simultaneous equations:
1. -292 = a - 17b
2. 14 = a + b

Let's solve for a and b:

Adding equation 1 and 2 to remove b we get:
-292 + 14 = a - 17b + a + b
-278 = 2a - 16b
-278 / 2 = a - 8b
-139 = a - 8b

Now we have:
3. -139 = a - 8b

Subtract equation 3 from equation 2:
14 - (-139) = a + b - (a - 8b)
153 = 9b
b = 153 / 9
b = 17

Using b = 17 in equation 2:
14 = a + 17
a = 14 - 17
a = -3

Thus, the function capturing the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 which simplifies to y = a + bx since any number to the power of 0 is 1, we will use two of the given points to solve for a and b.

Let's choose the points (-17, -292) and (1, 14).

Firstly, using the point (1, 14), we can write:
14 = a + b(1)
=> a + b = 14 (1)

Next, using the point (-17, -292), we write:
-292 = a + b(-17)
=> a - 17b = -292 (2)

Now we have a system of two equations (1) and (2):
(1) a + b = 14
(2) a - 17b = -292

To solve this system, we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:
(1) a + b = 14
-(2) a - 17b = -292
-------------------
=>  0 + 18b = 306
=>  18b = 306
=>  b = 306 / 18
=>  b = 17

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into equation (1) to solve for a:
a + b = 14
a + 17 = 14

Let's substitute these points into the equation:

For (-17, -292): -292 = a + b(-17)
For (1, 14):      14 = a + b(1)

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1) -292 = a - 17b
2) 14 = a + b

Let's solve for a and b. We can do this by using the method of substitution or elimination. I'll use elimination for simplicity:

Adding equation 1) and equation 2) to eliminate a:
-292 + 14 = a - 17b + a + b
-278 = 2a - 16b
-139 = a - 8b

Let's multiply equation 2) by 8:
112 = 8a + 8b

-139 = a - 8b

Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can then solve for a and b using the given input-output pairs. However, since we only have one function and multiple inputs, we need to create a system of linear equations based on those pairs.

Let's take two of the input-output pairs to create our equations:

For input -17, output -292:
-292 = a + b(-17)   ... (1)

For input -6, output -105:
-105 = a + b(-6)   ... (2)

Now we can solve this system of equations for a and b. Let's multiply equation (2) by a figure that allows us to eliminate one of the variables when adding it to equation (1). Multiplying equation (2) by \( \frac{17}{6} \) might make the elimination process easier:

\( \frac{17}{6} \) * (-105) = \( \frac{17}{6} \) * a + \( \frac{17}{6} \) * b(-6)

This simplifies to:

- \frac{17}{6} * 105 = \frac{17}{6} * a - 17b   ... (3)

Adding equations (1) and (3):

-292 + ( - \frac{17}{6} * 105 ) = a - 17b + \frac{17}{6} * a - 17b
-292 - \frac{17}{6} * 105 = a(1 + \frac{17}{6}) - 34b

We now have an equation with a and b but this process seems overly complex considering the form of our desired function and the inputs. Let's take a step back and look for a pattern instead.

After observing the inputs and outputs, we notice that:
- As the input decreases by 1 (from -16 to -17), the output decreases by 17 (from -275 to -292).
- As the input increases by 1 (from -17 to -16), the output increases by 17 (from -292 to -275).

This implies that b, the coefficient of x, is likely 17 since bx would increase or decrease by 17x when x changes.

Using points (-17, -292) and (1, 14):

1. -292 = a + b(-17)
2. 14 = a + b(1)

Let's solve these two equations simultaneously. First, rearrange them to express a:

1. a = -292 - b(-17)
2. a = 14 - b

Now, set the two equations for a equal to each other and solve for b:

-292 - b(-17) = 14 - b
-292 + 17b = 14 - b
18b = 306
b = 306 / 18
b = 17

Next, use the value of b to find a using either of the two a equations; we'll use the second one for simplicity:

From equation (1): \( a = -290 - 14b \)
Substituting the value of a from equation (1) into equation (2), we get:

\( 130 = -290 - 14b - 7b \)
\( 130 = -290 - 21b \)

Now we can substitute the value of b into equation (1) to find a:
\( -290 = a + b(14) \)
\( -290 = a - 20(14) \)
\( -290 = a - 280 \)
\( a = -290 + 280 \)
\( a = -10 \)

Therefore, the function that describes this data is:
\( y = a + bx \)
\( y = -10 - 20x \)

Hence, the explicit function is:

    The requested form of the function is a linear function, commonly expressed as y = ax + b, where a and b are real-valued constants. The expression y = ax^0 + bx^1 is simply another way to write a linear function since x^0 is equal to 1, and x^1 is just x. Thus, the function takes the form:

y = a + bx

However, let's rewrite the function to the conventional form for clarity:

y = bx + a

Now we need to find the values of a and b that fit the data provided. Let's analyze the inputs and outputs we have:

For the input x = -7, the output y = 130.
For the input x = 14, the output y = -290.
For the input x = -12, the output y = 230.
For the input x = 16, the output y = -330.

We can use any two distinct data points to solve for a and b. Let's take the first two:

1. For x = -7, y = 130:
130 = b(-7) + a
130 = -7b + a  ...(1)

2. For x = 14, y = -290:
-290 = b(14) + a
-290 = 14b + a  ...(2)

Now we can solve these two equations as a system of linear equations to find the values of a and b.

Let's multiply equation (1) by 2 to help eliminate a when subtracted from equation (2):

2(130) = 2(-7b) + 2a
260 = -14b + 2a

Now subtract equation (1) multiplied by 2 from equation (2):

-290 - 260 = 14b - (-14b) + a - 2a
-550 = 0b - a
a = 550

Now we can use the value of a in either equation (1) or (2) to find b:

Using equation (1):
130 = -7b + 550
-7b = 130 - 550
-7b = -420
b = 60

Hence, the values of a and b that fit our data are a = 550 and b = 60. The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = 60x + 550

    To find the values for \( a \) and \( b \) in the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first notice that \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \), since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \). 

Given two distinct points from the data set, we can solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the points (14, -290) and (-7, 130) to form two simultaneous equations.

From the point (14, -290):
\[ -290 = a + b(14) \]
\[ -290 = a + 14b \]
\[ (1) \]

From the point (-7, 130):
\[ 130 = a + b(-7) \]
\[ 130 = a - 7b \]
\[ (2) \]

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we first multiply equation (2) by 2 to eliminate \( a \) when subtracted from equation (1):

\[ 260 = 2a - 14b \]
\[ (3) \]

Now subtract (3) from (1) to eliminate \( a \):
\[ -290 - 260 = a + 14b - 2a + 14b \]
\[ -550 = -a + 28b \]
\[ a - 28b = 550 \]
\[ (4) \]

Now add (2) and (4) to solve for \( a \):
\[ a - 7b + a - 28b = 130 + 550 \]
\[ 2a - 35b = 680 \]
\[ (5) \]

Divide (5) by 2:
\[ a - 17.5b = 340 \]
\[ (6) \]

Let's now solve for \( b \) using equation (2) and (6):
(2) \( 130 = a - 7b \)
(6) \( 340 = a - 17.5b \)

Multiply (2) by 2.5 to match the \( a \) term in (6):
\[ 325 = 2.5a - 17.5b \]
\[ (7) \]

Now subtract (7) from (6):
\[ 340 - 325 = a - 17.5b - (2.5a - 17.5b) \]
\[ 15 = -1.5a \]
\[ a = -10 \]
\[ (8) \]

Substitute \( a = -10 \) into (2) to find \( b \):
\[ 130 = -10 - 7b \]
\[ 140 = -7b \]
\[ b = -20 \]
\[ (9) \]

Putting the values of \( a \) and \( b \) into our function:
\[ y = -10 + (-20)x \]
\[ y = -10 - 20x \]
\[ y = -20x - 10 \]

So, the function that describes the data given is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants a and b. Since ax^0 is simply a (because any number to the power of 0 is 1), the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have two unknowns (a and b) and multiple inputs and corresponding outputs to find a pattern. Let's use two of the given (input, output) pairs to create a system of linear equations. I will choose the pairs (input: -7, output: 130) and (input: 14, output: -290).

Substituting the first pair into the equation y = a + bx gives us:
130 = a - 7b

Substituting the second pair into the equation y = a + bx gives us:
-290 = a + 14b

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1) 130 = a - 7b
2) -290 = a + 14b

We can solve for a and b using these equations. First, let's multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate a:
2 * 130 = 2a - 2 * 7b 
260 = 2a - 14b

Let’s subtract the second equation from this result:
260 = 2a - 14b
-(-290 = a + 14b)

Adding these equations gives us:
260 + 290 = 2a - 14b + (a + 14b)
550 = 3a

Now divide by 3 to solve for a:
550 / 3 = a
a ≈ 183.33

Now plug the value of a into one of the original equations to solve for b. We'll use equation 1:
130 = 183.33 - 7b

Subtract 183.33 from both sides to solve for b:
-53.33 = -7b

Now divide by -7:
b ≈ 7.619

These values of a and b are approximations based on rounding the division of 550 / 3. The actual computation will provide:
a = 550 / 3 
b = 53.33 / 7 

Calculating the exact values:
a ≈ 183.333...
b ≈ 7.61857...

Now we can write our function:
y ≈ 183.333... + 7.61857...x

However, if we check these values against the other provided data points, they will not match because a linear function is not capable of perfectly mapping the provided inputs to outputs, as the actual relationship in the data might be nonlinear or follow a different pattern. Nonetheless, for the specific points used to derive the constants, the function would be approximate.

 If we take into account that we need integers for the coefficients (as the outputs for the inputs are exact integers), it seems we have made a mistake since our ""b"" should be a negative value to fit the increasing negative outputs as x becomes positive. Let's solve the system of equations properly:

1) 130 = a - 7b
2) -290 = a + 14b

Multiply equation (1) by 2 and subtract equation (2) from the multiplied equation:
260 = 2a - 14b (by multiplying equation 1 by 2)
-290 = a + 14b (equation 2)

260 - (-290) = (2a - a) + (-14b - 14b)
550 = a - 28b

Now we can take equation (1) and solve for a:
130 = a - 7b
a = 130 + 7b

Substitute this into the modified equation:
550 = (130 + 7b) - 28b
550 = 130 - 21b
420 = -21b
b = -20

Now plug the value of b into the equation for a:
a = 130 + 7(-20)
a = 130 - 140
a = -10

So the function that properly captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = -10 + (-20)x
or, simplifying the terms:
y = -10 - 20x

    To determine the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first note that ax^0 simplifies to a, since any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function we are looking for takes the form y = a + bx, where a and b are constants that we need to find.

Given the function's form, we can use any two points to determine the constants a and b. We'll use the first two points provided: (-7, 130) and (14, -290).

We will set up a system of two equations with these two points, as follows:

1) For input -7:

130 = a + b*(-7)

2) For input 14:

-290 = a + b*14

We can now solve this linear system. First we simplify:

1) 130 = a - 7b
2) -290 = a + 14b

We can solve for a by adding these two equations:

3) (130) + (-290) = (a - 7b) + (a + 14b)

Which simplifies to:

-160 = 2a + 7b

Now divide by 2:

-80 = a + 7/2*b

We can call this Equation 4. Now, we can also isolate a from Equation 1:

a = 130 + 7b

We'll call this Equation 5. Now, we will substitute Equation 5 into Equation 4:

-80 = (130 + 7b) + 7/2*b

And we simplify that to:

-80 = 130 + 7b + 7/2*b

Subtract 130 from both sides:

-210 = 7b + 7/2*b

Multiply every term by 2 to clear the fraction:

-420 = 14b + 7b

Combine like terms:

-420 = 21b

Now divide by 21:

b = -20

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into Equation 5 to find a:

a = 130 + 7*(-20)

a = 130 - 140

a = -10

The two constants in our function are therefore a = -10 and b = -20. Our function is:

y = -10 + (-20)x

Or simplified:

y = -10 - 20x

Please note that due to the nature of numerical patterns and without a specific rule governing the relationship between inputs and outputs, multiple functions can fit the same set of points.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 which goes through the points provided, we need to solve for the constants a and b. Note that ax^0 is just a, because any non-zero number raised to the power of zero is 1.

Now let's substitute the inputs and outputs into the equation y = a + bx to create a system of equations. We can take two points to determine the values of a and b. For simplicity, we will use:

For input 2, output 15:
15 = a + 2b  (Equation 1)

For input 7, output 50:
50 = a + 7b  (Equation 2)

We can solve this system of linear equations to find a and b.

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate a and solve for b:

(50 = a + 7b) - (15 = a + 2b)
35 = 5b
b = 35 / 5
b = 7

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into Equation 1 to solve for a:

15 = a + 2(7)

a = 15 - 14

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we can use the given pairs of inputs and outputs to determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1.

The term ax^0 is actually just a, as anything raised to the power of zero is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We need to find the values of a and b that satisfy the given input-output pairs.

For Input: 2, Output: 15:
15 = a + 2b

50 = a + 7b

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) 15 = a + 2b
2) 50 = a + 7b

Let's solve this system by using equation 1 to express a in terms of b, and then substitute that into equation 2.

From equation 1:
a = 15 - 2b

Substitute this expression for a into equation 2:
50 = (15 - 2b) + 7b
50 = 15 + 5b
5b = 50 - 15
5b = 35
b = 7

Now we can find a using the value of b:
a = 15 - 2b
a = 15 - 2(7)
a = 15 - 14
a = 1

First, we substitute x = 2 and y = 15 into the simplified equation:

Now, we substitute x = 7 and y = 50 into the simplified equation:

For x = -14, y = -97:
-97 = a + b*(-14)

    Given the data points:

1. (5, -26)
2. (1, -14)
3. (-14, 31)
4. (-5, 4)
5. (-8, 13)

We are looking for a function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) which translates to \( y = a + bx \). We can set up a system of linear equations with the given data points and solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

For the first point (5, -26), the equation would be:
-26 = \( a + 5b \)

For the second point (1, -14):
-14 = \( a + b \)

To determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \), we can use two of the provided points to form a system of linear equations and solve. Let's use the first two points for this purpose.

From point (1, -14):
\( -14 = a + 1 \cdot b \)
\( -14 = a + b \) ...[i]

From point (5, -26):
\( -26 = a + 5 \cdot b \)
\( -26 = a + 5b \) ...[ii]

Now, let's subtract equation [i] from equation [ii]:

\( -26 - (-14) = (a + 5b) - (a + b) \)
\( -12 = 4b \)
\( b = -3 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can substitute that back into equation [i] to find \( a \):

\( -14 = a + (-3)(1) \)
\( -14 = a - 3 \)
\( a = -11 \)

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to figure out the values of 'a' and 'b' that will best fit the given data.

Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify this to y = a + bx, as x^0 is always 1. Consequently, we have a linear function of x. Now we just need to solve for 'a' and 'b'.

We can start by setting up two equations using two of the data points to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Let's use the inputs 5 and 1:

For input 5 (x = 5), output y = -26:
-26 = a + 5b  [Equation 1]

For input 1 (x = 1), output y = -14:
-14 = a + 1b  [Equation 2]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
-26 = a + 5b
-14 = a + 1b

Next, we solve for 'b' by subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate 'a':
-26 - (-14) = (a + 5b) - (a + 1b)
-12 = 4b
b = -3

Now we solve for 'a' by substituting 'b' into Equation 2:
-14 = a + 1(-3)
-14 = a - 3
a = -11

Therefore, the linear function that fits the data points given is:
y = -11 + (-3)x

    To determine the coefficients a and b for the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that ax^0 is another way to say ""a times 1"" (since any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 equals 1), which is simply ""a"". Therefore, this term represents the y-intercept, while bx^1 is the slope times the input x. Given that x^1 is simply x, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Now, we will use two of the provided input-output pairs to solve for a and b.

Let's use the input-output pairs (x1, y1) = (1, -14) and (x2, y2) = (5, -26) to form two equations:

1. For (x1, y1) = (1, -14): -14 = a + b(1)
2. For (x2, y2) = (5, -26): -26 = a + b(5)

Now we can solve for a and b:

1. -14 = a + b
2. -26 = a + 5b

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2 gives:

-26 - (-14) = (a + 5b) - (a + b)
-12 = 4b
b = -3

Now put the value of b back into one of the equations to solve for a:

-14 = a + b
-14 = a - 3
a = -14 + 3
a = -11

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the input x and the output y is:

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for all x not equal to zero, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b. The given pairs of inputs and outputs represent linear equations using the values of x (input) and y (output). Let's use two pairs of input/output to create a system of linear equations.

Let's pick two points to construct our two unknowns, a and b. We can choose the points (-9, 64) and (-3, 22) for instance.

From the first point (-9, 64):
64 = a + b(-9) ... (1)

From the second point (-3, 22):
22 = a + b(-3) ... (2)

Now, let's solve the system of equations for a and b. We have two equations:

1) 64 = a - 9b
2) 22 = a - 3b

We can solve this system by subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:

64 - 22 = a - 9b - (a - 3b)
42 = -6b
b = -7

Now that we have b, we can plug it back into one of the original equations to find a. Let's use equation (2):

\( 64 = a + (-9)b \) ... [1]

For the second data point \( (-3, 22) \), the relation is:
\( 22 = a + (-3)b \) ... [2]

Now, let's solve these two equations for \( a \) and \( b \).

From equation [2], we can express \( a \) in terms of \( b \):
\( a = 22 + 3b \) ... [3]

We can substitute [3] into [1] to solve for \( b \):
\( 64 = (22 + 3b) - 9b \)
\( 64 = 22 - 6b \)
\( 42 = -6b \)
\( b = -7 \)

    To find the function that best captures the relationship between the inputs (x values) and outputs (y values), we need to determine the coefficients `a` and `b` in the linear function y = ax^0 + bx^1. Note that ax^0 is equal to a (since anything raised to the power of zero is 1) and bx^1 is just bx. So we are essentially looking for a function of the form:

2. a - 15b = 195
3. a - 5b = 55
4. a - 10b = 125
5. a + 6b = -99

To find `a` and `b`, we will pick two equations from the above and solve them using linear algebra techniques. Let's use equations 3 and 5 for our calculation:

a - 5b = 55
a + 6b = -99

Now, let's solve this system using subtraction. By subtracting the first equation from the second, we eliminate `a`:

Now, let's solve for `b`:

b = -14

Now that we have `b`, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for `a`. Let's use equation 3:

1. \(265 = a + b(-20)\)
2. \(-99 = a + b(6)\)

Solving this system of equations will give us the values for \(a\) and \(b\).

From equation 1, we get:
\(265 = a - 20b\) (equation 3)

From equation 2, we get:
\(-99 = a + 6b\) (equation 4)

Let's solve these equations by the method of elimination or substitution. First, let's add equation 3 to equation 4 to eliminate \(a\):

\(265 + (-99) = a - 20b + a + 6b\)
\(166 = 2a - 14b\)
\(83 = a - 7b\) (equation 5)

Now let's express \(a\) from equation 4 in terms of \(b\):

Substitute equation 6 into equation 5:

\(83 = (-99 - 6b) - 7b\)
\(83 = -99 - 6b - 7b\)
\(83 = -99 - 13b\)
\(83 + 99 = -13b\)

We have a system of equations that we can use to solve for a and b. However, we're looking for a pattern recognition solution. Given the data is not likely to be a perfect match for a linear relationship due to potential errors in data collection or measurement, we need to identify the pattern that most accurately reflects the relationship.

We can attempt this by first checking if the changes between inputs and outputs follow a constant rate, which would allow for a linear pattern. Let's try this.

Between the first two inputs and outputs:
- Change in input from -20 to -15: increase of 5
- Change in output from 265 to 195: decrease of 70

The ratio of change in output to change in input is -70/5 = -14, so for these two points, b could potentially be -14.

Let's check this against another pair:
- Change in input from -15 to -10: increase of 5
- Change in output from 195 to 125: decrease of 70

Here, the ratio is again -70/5 = -14, which seems to fit the pattern so far.

Now let's check one more to see if the pattern holds:
- Change in input from -10 to -5: increase of 5
- Change in output from 125 to 55: decrease of 70

Yet again, we have a consistent ratio of -70/5 = -14.

For the last increment from a negative to a positive input:
- Change in input from -5 to 6: increase of 11
- Change in output from 55 to -99: decrease of 154

The ratio here is -154/11 = -14, which surprisingly fits the pattern again.

Given the consistency across all these points, we can reasonably conjecture that b = -14.

Plugging the value of b into one of the input-output pairs to solve for a:
For x = -20, y = 265, we have:
265 = a - 20(-14)
265 = a + 280
a = 265 - 280
a = -15

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

However, since the system may not necessarily have a unique solution (as we have more equations than variables), we can use two of these equations to solve for 'a' and 'b' and then check to make sure that the values of 'a' and 'b' work for the other three points:

Let's use the first equation and the last equation to establish a system:

1) 265 = a - 20b
2) -99 = a + 6b

We can solve this system through subtraction. Subtract the second equation from the first one to get:

265 - (-99) = a - 20b - (a + 6b)
364 = -26b
b = -364 / 26
b = -14

Now that we have b, substitute b into one of the original equations to find a. Let's use the first one:

265 = a - 20(-14)
265 = a + 280
a = 265 - 280
a = -15

Now we need to see if the values of 'a' and 'b' calculated work for the other three points:

For input -15, output supposed to be 195:
195 = -15 - 14(-15)
195 = -15 + 210
195 = 195 (works)

For input -5, output supposed to be 55:
55 = -15 - 14(-5)
55 = -15 + 70
55 = 55 (works)

For input -10, output supposed to be 125:
125 = -15 - 14(-10)
125 = -15 + 140
125 = 125 (works)

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -15 + -14x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    To write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of coefficients a and b that best fit the given input-output pairs. This form is equivalent to a linear equation y = b*x + a, as x^0 is 1 for all x except when x = 0 (but that's not a concern for linear equations).

Given the points: (-20, 265), (-15, 195), (-5, 55), (-10, 125), (6, -99), we will solve for a and b using two points, then we will verify if the same a and b values work for the other points.

Let's use the points (-20, 265) and (6, -99) to set up a system of equations:

For the input -20 and output 265:
265 = b*(-20) + a (1)
265 = -20b + a

For the input 6 and output -99:
-99 = b*6 + a (2)
-99 = 6b + a

Now we have a system of two equations:

-20b + a = 265
6b + a = -99

Let's solve this system for a and b:

First, we will use the elimination method to eliminate a by subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):

(-20b + a) - (6b + a) = 265 - (-99)
-20b + a - 6b - a = 264 + 99
-26b = 364
b = -364/26
b = -14

Now we substitute b back into either equation (1) or (2) to solve for a. Using equation (1):

265 = -20*(-14) + a
265 = 280 + a
a = 265 - 280
a = -15

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -15x^0 + (-14)x^1
y = -15 + -14x

y = -15 - 14*(-15)
y = -15 + 210
y = 195 (matches the given output)

For point (-5, 55):

For point (-10, 125):
y = -15 - 14*(-10)
y = -15 + 140

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the data, we will treat this as a simple linear regression problem with the equation y = a + bx. Since x^0 is always 1, ax^0 is equivalent to a constant a. We are given several (x, y) pairs, and our goal is to find the values of a and b that best fit these points.

Although we are not provided with statistical tools or methods to compute the exact values of a and b in this system, we can use the data points to estimate the values by looking at the pattern in changes in y relative to changes in x.

From the given data, we have:
y = -54 when x = -10
y = 2 when x = 4
y = -94 when x = -20
y = 2 when x = 4 (repeated, so we do not really need this one again)
y = -30 when x = -4

Now let's look at the differences in y when x changes:

For a change in x from -10 to 4 (an increase of 14), y increases from -54 to 2 (an increase of 56).
For a change in x from -20 to -10 (an increase of 10), y increases from -94 to -54 (an increase of 40).

From these, we notice that an increase in x by 14 causes an increase in y by 56, implying that for each increment of 1 in x, y should increase by 56/14 = 4 (assuming a linear relationship). Hence, our b (the coefficient of x) seems to be 4.

To find a, we can substitute one pair of values into the equation y = a + 4x:

Using x=-10 and y=-54:
-54 = a + 4(-10)
-54 = a - 40
a = -54 + 40
a = -14

Therefore, our function that seems to capture the relationship between x and y given the points is:

y = -14 + 4x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to find the constants a and b in the function of the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

First, given that \( x^0 \) is always 1, we can simplify this to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

With two distinct pairs of input and output values, we can form a system of linear equations to solve for a and b. Using the pairs (-10, -54) and (4, 2):

For Input -10, Output -54:
\[ -54 = a + b(-10) \]
\[ a - 10b = -54 \]     (Equation 1)

For Input 4, Output 2:
\[ 2 = a + b(4) \]
\[ a + 4b = 2 \]    (Equation 2)

Now we can solve this system of equations. Multiply Equation 2 by 2.5 (to add to Equation 1 and eliminate a):

\( 2.5 \cdot (a + 4b) = 2.5 \cdot 2 \)
\[ 2.5a + 10b = 5 \]     (Equation 3)

Add Equation 1 and Equation 3:

\[ a - 10b + 2.5a + 10b = -54 + 5 \]
\[ 3.5a = -49 \]
\[ a = \frac{-49}{3.5} \]
\[ a = -14 \]

Now use the value of a to find b using Equation 2:

\[ -14 + 4b = 2 \]
\[ 4b = 16 \]
\[ b = 4 \]

Putting these into the original function form yields:

\[ y = (-14)x^0 + 4x^1 \]
\[ y = -14 + 4x \]

Therefore, the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\[ y = -14 + 4x \]

    Given the function form y = ax^0 + bx^1, let's find the coefficients a and b that best describe the data provided.

This function is actually a linear equation y = a + bx, since x^0 = 1 for any x except x = 0.

Let's use two data points to determine a and b. We can use (-10, -54) and (4, 2) for instance:

From the point (-10, -54):
-54 = a + b(-10)
-54 = a - 10b   ... (1)

From the point (4, 2):
2 = a + b(4)
2 = a + 4b      ... (2)

Now let's solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

From equation (2) we can express a as:
a = 2 - 4b

Now substituting a into equation (1), we get:
-54 = (2 - 4b) - 10b
-54 = 2 - 4b - 10b
-54 = 2 - 14b
-56 = -14b
b = 56 / 14
b = 4

Now we can find a using the value of b:

    To find a linear function that describes the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b.

First, note that ax^0 is equal to a, because any number to the power of 0 is 1.

Therefore, the function simplifies to:
y = a + bx

To find coefficients a and b, we can use two of the input-output pairs (also known as points) to set up a system of linear equations. It is best to choose two points with different x values to ensure a valid solution. Let's use the points (-10, -54) and (4, 2):

For the point (-10, -54):
-54 = a + b(-10)

For the point (4, 2):
2 = a + b(4)

We now have a system of equations:
1) -54 = a - 10b
2) 2 = a + 4b

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination method. Let's go with the elimination method:

First, let's reorganize the equations to align the a's and b's vertically:
a - 10b = -54       (Eq. 1)
a + 4b = 2            (Eq. 2)

Now, let's subtract Eq. 2 from Eq. 1 to eliminate a:

a - a - 10b - 4b = -54 - 2
-14b = -56

Now, solve for b:

b = -56 / -14
b = 4

Now that we have the value for b, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for a. Let's use Eq. 2 for that:

a + 4(4) = 2
a + 16 = 2
a = 2 - 16
a = -14

We can use two pairs of inputs and outputs to set up a system of equations to solve for ""a"" and ""b"". Let's use the following two pairs: (x₁, y₁) = (-10, -54) and (x₂, y₂) = (4, 2).

Plugging in the first pair into the simplified function gives:
$$
-54 = a + b(-10)

$$
-54 = a - 10b

Plugging in the second pair gives:

$$
2 = a + 4b

Now we have two equations:
1) \( a - 10b = -54 \)
2) \( a + 4b = 2 \)

Let's solve this system of equations. First, we can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate ""a"":
$$
a - 10b - (a + 4b) = -54 - 2

$$
a - 10b - a - 4b = -56

1) For the first point (-11, -20):
-20 = a + b(-11)

From equation 2), we isolate a:

a = -2 + 2b             (3)

Substitute a from equation 3) into equation 1):

-20 = (-2 + 2b) + b(-11)
-20 = -2 + 2b - 11b

    To find the linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data points, we will need to translate this into a more familiar form, y = b0 + b1x, where b0 is the y-intercept and b1 is the slope of the function. This is equivalent to y = a + bx in the instructions given.

The slope b1 can be computed using two data points:

Let's take the two inputs -11 and -17 with their corresponding outputs -20 and -32:

x1 = -11, y1 = -20
x2 = -17, y2 = -32

We use the slope formula (difference in y divided by the difference in x):

b1 = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) 
b1 = (-32 - (-20)) / (-17 - (-11)) 
b1 = (-32 + 20) / (-17 + 11) 
b1 = -12 / -6 
b1 = 2

Now let's calculate the y-intercept b0 using one of the points. We'll use x1 = -11 and y1 = -20:

y1 = b0 + b1 * x1

-20 = b0 - 22
b0 = -20 + 22

    In order to determine the function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we will need to identify the values for `a` and `b` that satisfy the input-output pairs given. The equation simplifies to `y = a + bx`, since `x^0` is 1 for all x not equal to zero.

We can use two of the provided input-output pairs to set up a system of equations and solve for `a` and `b`. Let's use the input-output pairs (-11, -20) and (-2, -2).

For the first pair where x=-11 and y=-20:
-20 = a + b(-11)

For the second pair where x=-2 and y=-2:
-2 = a + b(-2)

We now have a system of two equations:
1) -20 = a - 11b
2) -2 = a - 2b 

Let's solve this system using substitution or elimination. First, we can solve equation 2 for `a`:

a = -2 + 2b

Now plug this into equation 1:
-20 = (-2 + 2b) - 11b
-20 = -2 + 2b - 11b
-18 = -9b
b = 2

Now we can find `a` by putting `b` back into the equation from second pair:
-2 = a - 2b
-2 = a - 2(2)
-2 = a - 4
a = -2 + 4
a = 2

So, the function that fits the given input-output pairs is:

    Let's determine the coefficients `a` and `b` in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 for the given input-output pairs.

x^0 is simply 1 for all x (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), so the term ax^0 is just a constant a.

Given the pairs:

- When x = -11, y = -20, we have: -20 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11) => -20 = a - 11b
- When x = -8, y = -14, we have: -14 = a(-8)^0 + b(-8) => -14 = a - 8b
- When x = -2, y = -2, we have: -2 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2) => -2 = a - 2b
- When x = -7, y = -12, we have: -12 = a(-7)^0 + b(-7) => -12 = a - 7b
- When x = -17, y = -32, we have: -32 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17) => -32 = a - 17b

From the above equations, we can subtract the second equation from the first to find b:

(-20 - (-14)) = (a - a) - 11b + 8b
-6 = -3b
b = -6 / -3
b = 2

Now, using b = 2, let's solve for a using the third equation:

-2 = a - 2b
-2 = a - 2(2)
-2 = a - 4
a = -2 + 4
a = 2

Therefore, the coefficients we found are a = 2 and b = 2, and the function in the specified format is:

y = 2x^0 + 2x^1

y = 2 + 2x

Now that we have a, we can use it to solve for b using either equation. Let's use the second one:

a - 2b = -2
2 - 2b = -2
-2b = -2 - 2
-2b = -4
b = -4 / -2
b = 2

So, the function is:
y = 2 + 2x

This can also be confirmed by checking if it satisfies the rest of the given points. For instance:

For input -8:
y = 2 + 2(-8) = 2 - 16 = -14 (matches the given output)

For input -7:
y = 2 + 2(-7) = 2 - 14 = -12 (matches the given output)

For input -17:
y = 2 + 2(-17) = 2 - 34 = -32 (matches the given output)

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to understand the expression:

- \( ax^0 \) is a constant term because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So \( ax^0 = a \).
- \( bx^1 \) is a linear term because any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself. So \( bx^1 = bx \).

This form of the function is essentially a linear equation: \( y = a + bx \).

To determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \), we need at least two data points. Let's use the following two points:

1. Input: 10, Output: 176
2. Input: 17, Output: 302

Let's establish two equations:

1. \( 176 = a + 10b \)
2. \( 302 = a + 17b \)

Solving this system of equations:

From equation (1):
\( a = 176 - 10b \)  ---(3)

Substitute (3) into equation (2):
\( 302 = (176 - 10b) + 17b \)
\( 302 = 176 + 7b \)
\( 7b = 302 - 176 \)
\( 7b = 126 \)
\( b = 126 / 7 \)
\( b = 18 \)

Now, we find \( a \) using the value of \( b \) in equation (3):
\( a = 176 - 10 * 18 \)
\( a = 176 - 180 \)
\( a = -4 \)

Our function is therefore:
\( y = -4 + 18x \)

    To identify the relationship in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0, we can use two data points to solve for a and b. Let’s take the points (17, 302) and (-17, -310).

Using the first point (17, 302):
302 = a + b(17)

Using the second point (-17, -310):
-310 = a + b(-17)

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

1) 302 = 17b + a
2) -310 = -17b + a

Let's first multiply equation 2 by 1 to get rid of a:

1) 302 = 17b + a
2) 310 = 17b - a

Adding both equations now gives:

612 = 34b

Divide by 34 to solve for b:

b = 612 / 34
b = 18

Now, we substitute b back into one of the one equations to solve for a:

302 = 17(18) + a
302 = 306 + a
a = 302 - 306
a = -4

    To express the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the constants a and b that represent the y-intercept and the slope of the line, respectively.

Given that x^0 is always 1, the term ax^0 collapses to just a. Hence, we need to rewrite the equation as y = a + bx, which is the standard form of a linear equation.

Now let's use two data points to solve for a and b. It's usually easiest to use points with the smallest absolute values to reduce arithmetic complexity. We will use the points (10, 176) and (12, 212) for this purpose. This gives us two equations:

1) When x = 10, y = 176; hence, a + 10b = 176.
2) When x = 12, y = 212; hence, a + 12b = 212.

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

(a + 12b) - (a + 10b) = 212 - 176
a + 12b - a - 10b = 36
2b = 36
b = 36 / 2
b = 18.

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either equation to solve for a. Let's use the first equation:

a + 10b = 176
a + 10(18) = 176
a + 180 = 176
a = 176 - 180
a = -4.

So, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data points is:

y = -4x^0 + 18x^1

To conform strictly to the requested form, recognizing that x^0 = 1, the equation simplifies to:

y = -4 + 18x.

    Given the data provided, we can observe that to find the coefficients a and b for the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find a pattern that fits the provided input-output pairs. Let's analyze the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

Input: -17 | Output: -310 | Expected: y = a(-17)^0 + b(-17) = a - 17b
Input:  17 | Output:  302 | Expected: y = a(17)^0 + b(17) = a + 17b

Input:  13 | Output:  230 | Expected: y = a(13)^0 + b(13) = a + 13b

One approach to determine the coefficients is to use two input-output pairs with contrasting x values, allowing us to solve the equations simultaneously. Let's use the pairs (17, 302) and (-17, -310):

For 17: 302 = a + 17b
For -17: -310 = a - 17b

Now add the two equations to eliminate variable a:

302 + (-310) = (a + 17b) + (a - 17b)
-8 = 2a

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for a:

a = -4

Now, substitute the value of a in one of the equations to find b. Using 302 = a + 17b:

302 = -4 + 17b
306 = 17b

Divide both sides by 17 to solve for b:

b = 306 / 17
b = 18

So the coefficients a and b are -4 and 18, respectively. The function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

    To determine the coefficients `a` and `b` for a linear model of the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we can observe two points and solve for `a` and `b`. The given model simplifies to `y = a + bx`, as `x^0` is `1` for any `x` that is not zero. Let's take two inputs and their corresponding outputs to create a system of equations:

Using input 10 and output 176:
\[ 176 = a + b(10) \]
\[ 176 = a + 10b \]

Using input 17 and output 302:
\[ 302 = a + b(17) \]
\[ 302 = a + 17b \]

Now we can solve this system of equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:

\[ 302 - 176 = a + 17b - (a + 10b) \]
\[ 126 = 7b \]
\[ b = \frac{126}{7} \]
\[ b = 18 \]

Then we can substitute `b` back into one of the equations to find `a`. Using `b = 18` in the first equation:

\[ 176 = a + 10(18) \]
\[ 176 = a + 180 \]
\[ a = 176 - 180 \]
\[ a = -4 \]

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to understand what ax^0 and bx^1 represent.

In the expression ax^0, any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, so ax^0 simplifies to a. Thus, ax^0 represents the y-intercept of the function.

In the expression bx^1, since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself, bx^1 simplifies to bx. Therefore, bx^1 represents the slope of the function.

Given this, y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx.

Now we need to use the given input-output pairs to determine the specific values of a and b.

We have two unique inputs and outputs to work with: (-16, 297) and (18, -315). Let's use these points to create two equations:

For the first point:
297 = a + b(-16)
297 = a - 16b  (equation 1)

For the second point:
-315 = a + b(18)
-315 = a + 18b  (equation 2)

Now, to find a and b, we can solve these two simultaneous equations.

From equation 1:
a = 297 + 16b

Substitute this value of a into equation 2:
-315 = (297 + 16b) + 18b
-315 = 297 + 34b
-315 - 297 = 34b
-612 = 34b
b = -612 / 34
b = -18

Now, we use the value of b to find a:
a = 297 + 16(-18)
a = 297 - 288
a = 9

    The function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) is given in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. The term ax^0 represents the y-intercept (since x^0 is always 1), and bx^1 represents the slope of the line multiplied by the input value.

Given the data points:

1. When x = -16, y = 297
2. When x = 18, y = -315
3. When x = -16, y = 297 (repeated)
4. When x = -5, y = 99
5. When x = 5, y = -81

First, let's verify it's a straight-line relationship since we've been asked to produce a linear function. The slope (b) should be the same between each pair of points.

Calculating the slope between points (1) and (2):

\( b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \)
\( b = \frac{-315 - 297}{18 - (-16)} \)
\( b = \frac{-612}{34} \)
\( b = -18 \)

Let's test the same slope with points (4) and (5):

\( b = \frac{-81 - 99}{5 - (-5)} \)
\( b = \frac{-180}{10} \)
\( b = -18 \)

The slope, b, is consistent for both sets of points checked and is -18. Now, let's find the y-intercept, a, using one of the data points. Since ax^0 is always a (because x^0 = 1), we can use the value when x = 0, or solve for a with any given point by rearranging the formula:

\( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \)
\( y = a + bx \)

For example, using the point (x = -16, y = 297):

\( 297 = a + (-18)(-16) \)
\( 297 = a + 288 \)
\( a = 297 - 288 \)

For the input -16:

First, we observe the form a function should take. The general form we're looking for simplifies to:

y = a + bx     because     x^0 = 1 for all x except for x = 0.

Given the pairs (-16, 297), (18, -315), (-16, 297), (-5, 99), and (5, -81), we can set up a system of equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'. 

However, we have an issue with the repeated input of -16 giving the output 297 consistently, which suggests these data points do not contain any errors, and we are actually examining a linear relationship. But we won't use this point twice.

Setting up the system with the remaining four unique points:

For x = -16, y = 297, we get:
297 = a + b(-16)

For x = 18, y = -315, we get:
-315 = a + b(18)

For x = -5, y = 99, we get:
99 = a + b(-5)

For x = 5, y = -81, we get:
-81 = a + b(5)

We now have four equations, but only two of them will be independent because a line can be defined with just two points. We'll take two equations and solve for 'a' and 'b':

Using equations 1 and 2 for the points (-16, 297) and (18, -315):

297 = a - 16b
-315 = a + 18b

Adding these two equations to eliminate 'a', we get:

Let's solve this system of equations. First, we can add equations (1) and (2) together to eliminate a:

-265 + 253 = (a - 18b) + (a + 19b)
-12 = 2a + b
b = -12 - 2a

Now that we have b in terms of a, we can substitute this expression for b back into either equation (1) or (2) to solve for a. Let's use equation (2):

253 = a + 19(-12 - 2a)
253 = a - 228 - 38a
253 + 228 = -37a
481 = -37a
a = -481 / 37
a = -13

Now let's find b:

b = -12 - 2(-13)
b = -12 + 26
b = 14

Thus, our function that describes the data is:

y = -13 + 14x

So the final form following the requested notation will be:

Output: y = -13x^0 + 14x^1

    ","To find the output for the input 13 using the function y = -13 + 14x, we substitute x with 13:

y = -13 + 14(13)
y = -13 + 182
y = 169

Therefore, the output is:

Output: 169",169,True,"[14, -13]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the input (x) and the output (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we must first understand what each term represents:

- y is the output.
- x is the input.
- a is the coefficient that multiplies the x^0 term (which is always 1, so a is effectively the y-intercept of the function).
- b is the coefficient that multiplies the x^1 term (which is x itself, so b is the slope of the function).

Given this form, we can rewrite the function as y = a + bx, which is a linear function with a slope of b and a y-intercept of a.

We can use two of the given input-output pairs to determine the values of a and b by setting up a system of linear equations. Let's consider the input-output pairs (19, 253) and (-18, -265):

1. For input 19, output 253:
   253 = a + 19b

2. For input -18, output -265:
   -265 = a - 18b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, which can be solved simultaneously.

From equation 1:
a = 253 - 19b

Substitute a in equation 2 using the expression derived from equation 1:
-265 = (253 - 19b) - 18b
-265 = 253 - 19b - 18b
-265 - 253 = -37b
-518 = -37b
b = 518 / 37
b = 14

Now that we have b, we can find a by substituting b back into equation 1:
a = 253 - 19b
a = 253 - 19 * 14
a = 253 - 266
a = -13

Therefore, the function that appears to describe the relationship between input x and output y is:
y = -13 + 14x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To define the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants a and b that best describe the given input and output pairs. This form is a linear equation where ax^0 is a constant term (because x^0 is always 1) and bx^1 is a variable term (which simplifies to bx). So the function we're looking for is of the form y = a + bx.

Let's consider two input-output pairs to determine a and b:

Using the pair (19, 253) as (x1, y1) and the pair (-18, -265) as (x2, y2), we can create a system of linear equations:

1. For (x1, y1): 253 = a + 19b
2. For (x2, y2): -265 = a - 18b

Solving this system, let's multiply the first equation by 18 and the second equation by 19 to eliminate 'a':

1. 18 * 253 = 18a + 18 * 19b
2. 19 * (-265) = 19a - 19 * 18b

By doing so, we get:

1. 4554 = 18a + 342b
2. -5035 = 19a - 342b

Adding these two equations:

4554 - 5035 = 18a + 342b + 19a - 342b
-481 = 37a

Now, divide by 37 to solve for 'a':

a = -481 / 37
a ≈ -13

Now, using the value of 'a' in one of our previous equations to solve for 'b', let's use the first equation:

253 = a + 19b
253 = -13 + 19b

Now solve for 'b':

19b = 253 + 13
19b = 266
b = 266 / 19
b ≈ 14

Now we have the constants a and b, and our function can be written as:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -13 + 14x

This linear function describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs given the data points you have provided. However, please note that the precision of 'a' and 'b' depends on whether these data points perfectly align with a linear relationship.

    To determine a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we recognize that this form is essentially a linear equation:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = a + bx (since any number to the power of 0 is 1)

This is a simple linear relationship y = a + bx, where ""a"" is the y-intercept when x=0, and ""b"" is the slope of the line.

Given the input-output pairs:
(-18, -265), (19, 253), (-15, -223), (6, 71), (17, 225)

We can determine the slope ""b"" by dividing the change in output by the change in input between two pairs of data points. For simplicity, let's take the second and the fifth data points:

Slope (b) = (Output2 - Output5) / (Input2 - Input5)
           = (253 - 225) / (19 - 17)
           = 28 / 2
           = 14

Now that we have the slope, we need to find ""a"", the y-intercept. We can substitute one pair of x and y along with the slope into the linear equation to solve for ""a"":

y = a + bx

Let's use the data point (6, 71):
71 = a + 14*6

a = 71 - 84

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the coefficients a and b that fit the given data points.

The term ax^0 is equivalent to a since anything raised to the power of zero is one. So, ax^0 is simply a constant term a. The term bx^1 is the same as bx, because anything raised to the power of one is itself. So, our function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Let us use two data points to calculate the values of a and b. We can use the points (0, -15) and (-5, -35).

For the first point (0, -15):

-15 = a + b(0)
-15 = a

So our constant term a is -15.

Let's now use the second point (-5, -35) to find b:

-35 = a + b(-5)
-35 = -15 + (-5)b
-20 = -5b
b = 4

Now we have both our coefficients a and b. The function that describes the data is:

y = -15 + 4x

1. For x = 0 and y = -15:

Looking at the input and output pairs, notice that as the input changes, the output changes in a linear fashion. This suggests that one way to approach this problem is to calculate the slope of the line (b), which is the change in y divided by the change in x.

Let's take a pair of points to calculate the slope (b):

Using the points (9, 133) and (19, 283):
b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (283 - 133) / (19 - 9)
b = 150 / 10
b = 15

Now that we have b, we can use one of the points to solve for a.

Using the point (9, 133):

Given the input-output pairs, we can see that each output y is a linear transformation of the input x. Let's find the constants a and b by using two pairs of inputs and outputs to set up two equations and solve for a and b.

Let's take the pairs (9, 133) and (-14, -212) to form the two equations:

-1 * (-212) = -1 * (a - 14b)
212 = -a + 14b

Now let's add this equation to equation 1:

y = -2 - 180
y = -182

    The function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 is essentially a linear equation. Here ax^0 is a constant term (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 simplifies to bx.

Given the data points, we want to find values for a and b such that y = a + bx fits the data provided. Let's use two of the given points to solve for a and b. We'll use the points (2, 59) and (-16, -301).

From the first point (2, 59):
1. 59 = a + 2b

From the second point (-16, -301):
2. -301 = a - 16b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

59 = a + 2b
-301 = a - 16b

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b that satisfy both equations simultaneously.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 8 to align the coefficient of b with the second equation:

8(59) = 8a + 16b
472 = 8a + 16b

Now we have:

472 = 8a + 16b
-301 = a - 16b

If we add these two equations:

472 - 301 = (8a + a) + (16b - 16b)
171 = 9a

Now solve for a:

a = 171 / 9
a = 19

Now that we have a, we can use it in the first equation to solve for b:

59 = 19 + 2b
59 - 19 = 2b
40 = 2b
b = 20

Now we can write the function:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = 19 + 20x

Therefore the function is y = 19 + 20x.

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first recognize that ax^0 is equal to a, since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function reduces to y = a + bx.

We can use any two pairs of inputs and outputs to set up a system of linear equations to solve for a and b. Let's use the following two pairs: (2, 59) and (-2, -21).

If we plug in x = 2 and y = 59, we get:
59 = a + b(2)   ----> Equation 1

If we plug in x = -2 and y = -21, we get:
-21 = a + b(-2)  ----> Equation 2

Now, let's solve these two equations simultaneously. First, we can add Equation 2 to Equation 1 to eliminate a:

59 + (-21) = a + 2b + a - 2b
38 = 2a

Divide both sides by 2:

a = 19

Now we can plug a back into Equation 1 or 2 to solve for b. Let's use Equation 1:

59 = 19 + b(2)
59 - 19 = 2b
40 = 2b

Divide both sides by 2:

b = 20

Thus, ax^0 simplifies to a, and the function can be rewritten as y = a + bx.

Now, we will use two points from the provided data to calculate a and b. Let's use the points (2, 59) and (-16, -301).

For the first point (2, 59):
59 = a + b(2)

For the second point (-16, -301):
-301 = a + b(-16)

We now have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1) 59 = a + 2b
2) -301 = a - 16b

We can solve this system using various methods like substitution, elimination, matrix methods, etc. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiply the first equation by 8 to align the b terms:

8(59) = 8a + 16b
472 = 8a + 16b

Now the system looks like this:

3) 472 = 8a + 16b
2) -301 = a - 16b

Add equation 2 to equation 3 to eliminate b:

(472) + (-301) = (8a + 16b) + (a - 16b)
171 = 9a

Solve for a:

a = 171 / 9
a = 19

Now that we have the value for a, we can plug it into one of the original equations to solve for b. Let's use equation 1):

59 = 19 + 2b

Subtract 19 from both sides:

40 = 2b

Now solve for b:

b = 40 / 2
b = 20

Now we can write the function as:

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we should note that \( x^0 \) is always 1 and \( bx^1 \) is simply \( bx \). Therefore, the function is linear: \( y = a + bx \). To determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \), we can use two of the provided input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations.

Let's use the input-output pairs (2, 59) and (-16, -301):

1. For the input 2:
   \( 59 = a + b(2) \) ... [Equation 1]

2. For the input -16:
   \( -301 = a + b(-16) \) ... [Equation 2]

Now we solve this system for \( a \) and \( b \):

From Equation 2:
\( a = -301 + 16b \) ... [Equation 3]

Substitute Equation 3 into Equation 1:
\( 59 = (-301 + 16b) + 2b \)
\( 59 = -301 + 18b \)
\( 18b = 59 + 301 \)
\( 18b = 360 \)
\( b = 360 / 18 \)
\( b = 20 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can find \( a \) using either Equation 1 or Equation 2. Using Equation 1:
\( 59 = a + 20(2) \)
\( 59 = a + 40 \)
\( a = 59 - 40 \)

For input 2 and output 59:
59 = a(2^0) + b(2^1)
59 = a + 2b  ...(1)

For input -2 and output -21:

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are looking for a linear relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). The term ax^0 is constant (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), and the term bx^1 is linear, so we are essentially seeking a function of the form y = a + bx.

Given the data points (x, y):

(13, 55)
(-20, -44)
(15, 61)
(-1, 13)
(-14, -26)

We need to find constants a and b such that y = a + bx describes these points as accurately as possible.

To achieve this, we can safely use two points to derive the linear equation, and then check to ensure that the derived equation fits the rest of the data points.

Let's take the first two data points (13, 55) and (-20, -44) to calculate the slope (b):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-44 - 55) / (-20 - 13)
b = (-99) / (-33)
b = 3

Now we have the slope of our function, so we can rewrite the formula as:
y = a + 3x

To find a, let's insert the values from one of the points we used to find b. We'll use (13, 55):

55 = a + 3(13)
55 = a + 39
55 - 39 = a
16 = a

Now we have the value for a. The function that fits the given data points is:

Let's use the inputs and outputs to set up equations for a and b:

For input 13 and output 55:
55 = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1
55 = a + 13b

For input -20 and output -44:
-44 = a(-20)^0 + b(-20)^1
-44 = a - 20b

Let's solve this system of linear equations:

From the first equation:
a = 55 - 13b

Substituting the value of a from the first equation into the second equation:
-44 = (55 - 13b) - 20b
-44 = 55 - 13b - 20b
-44 = 55 - 33b
-44 - 55 = -33b
-99 = -33b
b = 3

So, our aim is to find the values of a and b that satisfy:

We now have a system of two linear equations. We can solve for a and b using various methods, like substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's use elimination in this case.

First, multiply both sides of the second equation by -1 to make future elimination easier:

44 = -a + 20b

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that captures the given data points, we recognize that \( ax^0 \) is equivalent to \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any value of \( x \) (except when \( x = 0 \)). Therefore, our function simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Now, we are given a series of input-output pairs to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Let's set up two equations using two different data points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Using the input-output pair (-3, 8):

1. \( 8 = a + b(-3) \)

Using the input-output pair (18, -160):

2. \( -160 = a + b(18) \)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1. \( 8 = a - 3b \)
2. \( -160 = a + 18b \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. I'll do this by multiplying the first equation by 18 to align the a terms:

\( 18 \times 8 = 18a - 54b \) \( \rightarrow \) \( 144 = 18a - 54b \)

Now subtracting the second equation from this one:

\( 144 - (-160) = (18a - a) + (-54b - 18b) \)

This simplifies to:

\( 304 = 17a - 72b \)

Now we have a new simplified system:

1. \( 8 = a - 3b \)
2. \( 304 = 17a - 72b \)

Multiplying the first equation by 17 to prepare for elimination with the second equation, we get:

\( 17 \times 8 = 17a - 51b \) \( \rightarrow \) \( 136 = 17a - 51b \)

Now let's subtract this equation from our new second equation:

\( 304 - 136 = (17a - 17a) + (-72b - (-51b)) \)

This simplifies to:

\( 168 = -21b \)

Solving for b:

\( b = \frac{-168}{-21} \)
\( b = 8 \)

Now that we've got b, plug it back into the first original equation ( \( 8 = a - 3b \) ):

\( 8 = a - 3(8) \)
\( 8 = a - 24 \)
\( a = 8 + 24 \)
\( a = 32 \)

Now that we have a and b, we can write the function:

\[ y = 32 + 8x \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can first recognize that ax^0 is just a, because any number to the power of zero is 1. Hence, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. This is a linear function with a being the y-intercept and b being the slope.

Since we have multiple input-output pairs, we can use any two of them to solve for a and b. Let's use the pairs (-11, 72) and (18, -160).

Using the first pair (-11, 72), we plug the values into the equation y = a + bx:
72 = a + b(-11)
72 = a - 11b (Equation 1)

Now, using the second pair (18, -160):
-160 = a + b(18)
-160 = a + 18b (Equation 2)

We have a system of two linear equations, which we can solve for a and b using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

Multiply Equation 1 by 18 and Equation 2 by 11 to eliminate a:
18 * 72 = 18a - 198b
11 * -160 = 11a + 198b

Which gives us:
1296 = 18a - 198b
-1760 = 11a + 198b

Now we add the two equations together:
1296 - 1760 = (18a - 198b) + (11a + 198b)
-464 = 29a
a = -464 / 29
a = -16

Now we'll solve for b using a:
72 = -16 - 11b
88 = -11b
b = -88 / -11
b = 8

So the linear function that describes this data is y = -16 + 8x.

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we see that it represents a linear function where ax^0 is the y-intercept (since x^0 is always 1 regardless of the value of x), and bx^1 is the slope.

The function y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We have a set of input-output pairs that we can use to determine the coefficients a and b. We can use two pairs to set up a system of linear equations to solve for a and b.

Taking the input-output pairs (-11, 72) and (18, -160), we can plug them into the formula to get two equations:

1) 72 = a + b(-11)
2) -160 = a + b(18)

Now we will solve this system of linear equations. Let's multiply the first equation by 18 and the second by 11 to make the coefficients of 'a' equal:

18) 1296 = 18a - 198b
11) -1760 = 11a + 198b

Adding these two equations will help to eliminate 'b' and solve for 'a':

1296 + (-1760) = 18a + 11a
-464 = 29a
a = -464 / 29
a = -16

Now, let's use the value of 'a' in one of the original equations to find 'b':

72 = -16 - 11b

b = 8

    To find the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to determine the values of the coefficients `a` and `b`. This linear function is essentially `y = a + bx`, where `x` is the input and `y` is the output.

We can use two points to determine the linear relationship between `x` and `y`. Given:

1. When `x = 11`, `y = -204`
2. When `x = -4`, `y = 66`

Let's use these two points to find `a` and `b`.

For the first point, substituting the values gives us:
-204 = a + 11b ---- (1)

For the second point, we get:
66 = a - 4b ---- (2)

Now, we need to solve this system of equations to find `a` and `b`. Let's multiply equation (2) by -1 to help eliminate `a`:

-66 = -a + 4b ---- (3)

Now add equations (1) and (3) to eliminate `a`:
-204 - 66 = (a - a) + (11b + 4b)
-270 = 15b
b = -270 / 15
b = -18

Now we have the value for `b`, let's substitute `b` = -18 into equation (1) to find `a`:

-204 = a + 11(-18)
-204 = a - 198
a = -204 + 198
a = -6

    Given the data points and the requested form of the function as y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are looking for a linear equation with 'a' as the y-intercept and 'b' as the slope.

We can use two data points to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Let's choose the points (11, -204) and (-4, 66), although any two distinct points could be used.

Now, applying these points to the equation:

For the point (11, -204):
-204 = a(11)^0 + b(11)
-204 = a + 11b

For the point (-4, 66):
66 = a(-4)^0 + b(-4)
66 = a - 4b

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. a + 11b = -204
2. a - 4b = 66

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate 'a' and solve for 'b':
(1) - (2) => (a + 11b) - (a - 4b) = -204 - 66
15b = -270

Now solve for 'b':
b = -270 / 15
b = -18

Use 'b' to solve for 'a' in either equation, let's use equation 2:
a - 4(-18) = 66
a + 72 = 66
a = 66 - 72
a = -6

Now we have the values for 'a' and 'b':

    To determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that describe the relationship between the input \( x \) and the output \( y \) in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can rewrite the equation in simpler terms as:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Here, \( a \) is the \( y \)-intercept and \( b \) is the slope of the line. Given the equation's form, we can recognize it as a linear equation.

Let's use two data points to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \). We will pick the points (11, -204) and (-4, 66) for this calculation.

Now, we have two equations based on the general form \( y = a + bx \):

\[ -204 = a + b(11) \]
\[ 66 = a + b(-4) \]

Let's solve these two equations simultaneously to find \( a \) and \( b \).

From equation (2):
\[ 66 = a - 4b \]
\[ a = 66 + 4b \]

Plug the expression for \( a \) from equation (2) into equation (1):
\[ -204 = 66 + 4b + 11b \]
\[ -204 = 66 + 15b \]
\[ -204 - 66 = 15b \]
\[ -270 = 15b \]
\[ b = -18 \]

Now, we’ll substitute \( b \) back into the equation for \( a \):
\[ a = 66 + 4(-18) \]
\[ a = 66 - 72 \]
\[ a = -6 \]

Therefore, the function that describes the data relationship is:

With this form, we can use two points to solve for \(a\) and \(b\). Let's take the input-output pairs (11, -204) and (-4, 66).

Setting up our equations:

From the input-output pair (11, -204):
-204 = a + 11*b  ---> Equation (1)

From the input-output pair (-4, 66):
66 = a - 4*b  ---> Equation (2)

Now to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\), we solve this system of linear equations.

Multiply Equation (2) by 2.75 (to use the method of elimination with Equation (1)):
181.5 = 2.75a - 11*b  ---> Equation (3)

Now we will add Equation (3) and Equation (1) to eliminate \(b\) and solve for \(a\):

-204 + 181.5 = a + 11*b + 2.75a - 11*b
-22.5 = 3.75a
a = -22.5 / 3.75
a = -6

Now use the value of \(a\) in either Equation (1) or (2) to solve for \(b\). Using Equation (2):

72 = 4*b
b = 72 / 4
b = 18

To determine the values for a and b, we can use two of the given input-output pairs to solve the system of equations. Let's use the pairs (11, -204) and (-4, 66).

From the first pair (11, -204), we have:
-204 = a + b(11)

From the second pair (-4, 66), we have:
66 = a - 4b

We now have a system of two equations:
1. -204 = a + 11b
2. 66 = a - 4b

We can solve for a and b by using substitution or elimination. I'll use the elimination method here:

Multiply the second equation by 11 to align the a coefficients:
11*(66) = 11a - 44b
726 = 11a - 44b

Now we have:
-204 = a + 11b
726 = 11a - 44b

Adding these two equations to eliminate a gives us:
-204 + 726 = (a - 11a) + (11b - 44b)
522 = -10a - 33b

Now divide by -33 to solve for b:
522 / -33 = (-10a - 33b) / -33
-15.8181818182 = 0.30303030303a + b

Let's rename -15.8181818182 as B to simplify our next step, where B is the value we're trying to solve for:
B = 0.30303030303a + b

Now let's substitute the value of b from equation 2 to find a:
66 = a - 4b
66 = a - 4(B - 0.30303030303a)
66 = a - 4B + 1.21212121212a
66 = 2.21212121212a - 4B

Now we replace B with -15.8181818182 and solve for a:
66 = 2.21212121212a - 4(-15.8181818182)
66 = 2.21212121212a + 63.2727272728

Subtract 63.2727272728 from both sides to isolate a:
66 - 63.2727272728 = 2.21212121212a
2.7272727272 = 2.21212121212a

Divide by 2.21212121212 to solve for a:
2.7272727272 / 2.21212121212 = a
a ≈ 1.233

Now use either equation to solve for b:
66 = a - 4b

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can use the given function form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

which simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Since ax^0 is equal to a (because anything to the power of 0 is 1), we need to determine the values of a and b that best fit the given data. Since we only have two parameters and five data points, we're facing an over-determined system that might not have an exact solution but can be approximated using methods like least squares.

However, for the purpose of this exercise, let's try to find a and b by considering two points and solving the system of linear equations given by the function. We can pick any two pairs of input-output to form the system. Let's choose the first and second pairs of data for this:

For input -12 and output 9:
9 = a - 12b

For input 20 and output -55:
-55 = a + 20b

Now we have two equations:

1) 9 = a - 12b
2) -55 = a + 20b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. Let's do this step by step:

From equation 1:
a = 9 + 12b

Substitute a into equation 2:
-55 = (9 + 12b) + 20b
-55 = 9 + 32b
-55 - 9 = 32b
-64 = 32b
b = -64 / 32
b = -2

Now, let's find a using the value of b in equation 1:
a = 9 + 12(-2)
a = 9 - 24
a = -15

Finally, we have the function:
y = -15 + (-2)x
or
y = -15 - 2x

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, using the given points, is:
y = -15 - 2x

    Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we are tasked to find a linear function of the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

We will use two pairs of input-output to solve for the constants 'a' and 'b'. Let's use the first two pairs (-12, 9) and (20, -55). 

For the first pair (-12, 9):

\[ 9 = a - 12b \] ...(1)

For the second pair (20, -55):

\[ -55 = a + 20b \] ...(2)

Now, we will solve this system of equations for 'a' and 'b'. Multiply equation (1) by 20 and equation (2) by 12:

\[ 20 \times 9 = 20a - 240b \] ...(3)

\[ 12 \times -55 = 12a + 240b \] ...(4)

Adding equations (3) and (4) to eliminate 'b':

\[ (20 \times 9) + (12 \times -55) = 20a - 240b + 12a + 240b \]
\[ 180 - 660 = 32a \]
\[ -480 = 32a \]
\[ a = -480 / 32 \]
\[ a = -15 \]

Now, let's substitute 'a' back into equation (1):

\[ 9 = -15 - 12b \]
\[ 12b = -15 - 9 \]
\[ 12b = -24 \]
\[ b = -24 / 12 \]
\[ b = -2 \]

So the constants 'a' and 'b' are -15 and -2 respectively. The function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    The given data points suggest a linear relationship between input (x) and output (y). In general, a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 for any x.

Let's use two points to solve for a and b in the equation y = a + bx. We can pick any two points, but let's use:

Point 1 (x₁, y₁): (-16, 82)
Point 2 (x₂, y₂): (14, -98)

We will plug these points into the equation y = a + bx to form two equations:

1) 82 = a + b(-16)
2) -98 = a + b(14)

Let's solve this system of equations for a and b.

From equation (1): 82 = a - 16b
From equation (2): -98 = a + 14b

Now let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:

82 - (-98) = (a - 16b) - (a + 14b)
82 + 98 = -16b - 14b
180 = -30b
b = -6

Now that we have the value for b, we can solve for a by plugging b into either equation (1) or (2). Let's use equation (1):

82 = a - 16b
82 = a - 16(-6)
82 = a + 96
a = 82 - 96
a = -14

Now we have both a and b. Thus, the function that fits the data is:

y = -14 + (-6)x
Or, simply:
y = -14 - 6x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to recognize that this is a linear equation, which can be simplified to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 \) is equal to 1 for any x that is not 0 (it’s a property of exponents).

Given this simplified linear form, we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that will best fit the provided input-output pairs. These pairs give us a system of equations:

1. \( 82 = a - 16b \)
2. \( 52 = a - 11b \)
3. \( -98 = a + 14b \)
4. \( 94 = a - 18b \)
5. \( -32 = a + 3b \)

To solve for \( a \) and \( b \), we can use methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. For this example, let's use the substitution method, looking at the first two equations to start:

From Equation 1:
\( 82 = a - 16b \)
\( a = 82 + 16b \)

Substituting \( a \) from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\( 52 = (82 + 16b) - 11b \)
\( 52 = 82 + 5b \)
\( 5b = 52 - 82 \)
\( 5b = -30 \)
\( b = -6 \)

Now that we have \( b = -6 \), we can substitute back into Equation 1 to find \( a \):
\( a = 82 + 16(-6) \)
\( a = 82 - 96 \)
\( a = -14 \)

Therefore, the function that fits the given input-output pairs in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) is:

    To find the function of the form:

where \( y \) is the output and \( x \) is the input, we recognize that \( ax^0 \) is simply \( a \) (since anything raised to the power of zero is 1), and \( bx^1 \) is \( bx \) (as anything raised to the first power is itself). Therefore, our function simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Let's use two data points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). We'll take the first two points (-16, 82) and (-11, 52):

1. For x = -16 and y = 82:

\[ 82 = a - 16b \] (Equation 1)

2. For x = -11 and y = 52:

\[ 52 = a - 11b \] (Equation 2)

Now we are going to solve these two equations simultaneously. First, we can subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate \( a \):

(82 - 52) = (a - a) - 16b + 11b

\[ 30 = -5b \]

\[ b = \frac{30}{-5} \]

\[ b = -6 \]

Now that we have \( b \), we can substitute it back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find \( a \). Let's use Equation 2:

\[ 52 = a + 66 \]

\[ a = 52 - 66 \]

\[ a = -14 \]

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the coefficients a and b. This form is essentially equivalent to y = a + bx, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope. Given that we have a linear function and multiple input-output pairs, we can use two of the pairs to solve for a and b.

Let's use the input-output pairs (-16, 82) and (14, -98):

For the first pair:
82 = a * (-16)^0 + b * (-16)
82 = a + b * (-16)
82 = a - 16b          [Equation 1]

For the second pair:
-98 = a * 14^0 + b * 14
-98 = a + b * 14
-98 = a + 14b          [Equation 2]

Now we can set up a system of linear equations with Equation 1 and Equation 2, and solve for a and b:

Equation 1: 82 = a - 16b
Equation 2: -98 = a + 14b

Adding the two equations together will allow us to solve for b:
(82) + (-98) = (a - 16b) + (a + 14b)
-16 = 2a - 2b
-8 = a - b
a - b = -8              [Equation 3]

Now, let's subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:
Equation 1 - Equation 2:
82 - (-98) = (a - 16b) - (a + 14b)
180 = -30b
b = -180 / 30
b = -6

Now that we have b, we can substitute it into Equation 3 to find a:
a - (-6) = -8
a + 6 = -8
a = -8 - 6

    To determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) in the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for all non-zero x, I will use the provided input-output pairs to form linear equations. After forming the equations, I will solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Taking two pairs of inputs and outputs, for instance:

1. Using the input -16 and output 82:
\[ 82 = a - 16b \]

2. Using the input -11 and output 52:
\[ 52 = a - 11b \]

I'll now solve this system of linear equations to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \).

By multiplying the second equation by 16 and the first equation by 11 (to align the \( a \) terms for elimination), I get:
\[ (16 \times 52) = 16a - (16 \times 11)b \]
\[ (11 \times 82) = 11a - (11 \times 16)b \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ 832 = 16a - 176b \]
\[ 902 = 11a - 176b \]

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
\[ -70 = 5a \]
\[ a = -14 \]

Now plug in the value of \( a \) into one of the initial equations:

\[ 16b = -14 - 82 \]

To solve these equations simultaneously, we can add equation (1) to equation (2) to eliminate a:

\[ 2a + b = -2 \]

We can't determine unique solutions for \( a \) and \( b \) with just this equation because we need another independent equation or check for compatibility and consistency. However, we can utilize more points to define the relationship.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \). This form is actually a linear equation, which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), because \( x^0 \) equals 1 for any x other than 0.

Given the provided input-output pairs, we can set up a system of equations to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use two of the distinct points to set up our system. We'll use (x1, y1) = (-1, -7) and (x2, y2) = (3, 9).

For the first point:
-7 = a + b(-1) ............(1)

For the second point:
9 = a + b(3) ................(2)

Now let's solve this system of equations for a and b.

From equation (1):
a - b = -7 ............(1a)

From equation (2):
a + 3b = 9 ............(2a)

Next, we can add equations (1a) and (2a) to eliminate b:

(a - b) + (a + 3b) = -7 + 9
2a + 2b = 2
a + b = 1 ............(3)

Now we can subtract equation (1a) from equation (3):

(a + b) - (a - b) = 1 - (-7)
2b = 8
b = 4

Now that we have the value for b, we can substitute it back into either equation to find a. Using equation (1a):

a - 4 = -7
a = -7 + 4
a = -3

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

\( y = -3x^0 + 4x^1 \)

Or simply:

\( y = -3 + 4x \)

    To create a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, we can recognize that the \( x^0 \) term simplifies to 1 for any value of \( x \) (since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, the function can be simplified to \( y = a + bx \).

Let's use two data points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). We can use:

1. Input: 6, Output: 74
2. Input: -5, Output: -25

Using point 1, \( 74 = a + b(6) \).
Using point 2, \( -25 = a + b(-5) \).

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\( 74 = a + 6b \) (Equation 1)
\( -25 = a - 5b \) (Equation 2)

We can solve these equations for \( a \) and \( b \) by subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1, to eliminate \( a \) and find \( b \):

\( 74 - (-25) = a + 6b - (a - 5b) \)
\( 74 + 25 = a + 6b - a + 5b \)
\( 99 = 11b \)
\( b = 99 / 11 \)
\( b = 9 \)

Now we can substitute \( b \) back into one of the equations to find \( a \). Let's use Equation 1:

\( 74 = a + 6(9) \)
\( 74 = a + 54 \)
\( a = 74 - 54 \)
\( a = 20 \)

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first recognize that \( ax^0 \) is essentially \( a \) since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) (except for \( x = 0 \), where it is undefined, but this edge case does not affect our linear function). Our goal is thus to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( y = a + bx \).

Given the inputs and outputs, we can create a system of linear equations corresponding to the data points provided:

1. For input \( x = 6 \), output \( y = 74 \):
\[ 74 = a + 6b \]

2. For input \( x = 19 \), output \( y = 191 \):
\[ 191 = a + 19b \]

We can see that between the inputs \( x = 6 \) and \( x = 19 \), the output increases by \( 191 - 74 = 117 \), while the input increases by \( 19 - 6 = 13 \). This suggests that our slope \( b \) might be \( 117 / 13 = 9 \).

If we assume \( b = 9 \), we can use any of the data points to solve for \( a \). Using the data point (6, 74):

\[ 74 = a + 6(9) \]
\[ 74 = a + 54 \]
\[ a = 74 - 54 \]
\[ a = 20 \]

This gives us the tentative function \( y = 20 + 9x \). Let's check this function against the other provided data points.

For input \( x = -11 \):
\[ y = 20 + 9(-11) \]
\[ y = 20 - 99 \]

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we need to determine the constants a and b.

The term ax^0 is simply a because anything raised to the power of 0 equals 1. So the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can solve for a and b using any two input-output pairs. Let's start by using the input-output pairs (6, 74) and (19, 191):

1. For the input 6: y = a + b*6, we know y = 74.
So, 74 = a + 6b.

2. For the input 19: y = a + b*19, we know y = 191.
So, 191 = a + 19b.

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:
(1) 74 = a + 6b
(2) 191 = a + 19b

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to solve for b:
(191 - 74) = (a + 19b) - (a + 6b) => 117 = 13b => b = 9.

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using either of the original equations. Let's use equation (1):

74 = a + 6*9
74 = a + 54
a = 74 - 54
a = 20.

So the function is y = 20 + 9x, which can also be written as y = 20x^0 + 9x^1.

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the provided data points, we need to determine the values of coefficients a and b.

Firstly note that x^0 is always 1, regardless of the value of x, so the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given the format of our desired function, we can systematize our approach by examining the differences in output as the input changes. This will help us identify a pattern to derive b since b will be the scaling factor for the x term.

Let's look at the differences between consecutive inputs and outputs from the data provided:

From Input: 6 to Input: 19 (a change of 19 - 6 = 13 in input), the Output changes from 74 to 191 (a change of 191 - 74 = 117 in output).

From Input: -11 to Input: -5 (a change of -5 - (-11) = 6 in input), the Output changes from -79 to -25 (a change of -25 - (-79) = 54 in output).

From Input: -5 to Input: -10 (a change of -10 - (-5) = -5 in input), the Output changes from -25 to -70 (a change of -70 - (-25) = -45 in output).

Let's analyze these differences:

For the change from 6 to 19 (13 units) in input, the output changes by 117 units, which suggests a change of 117 / 13 = 9 per unit change in input.

For the change from -11 to -5 (6 units) in input, the output changes by 54 units, which also suggests a change of 54 / 6 = 9 per unit change in input.

For the change from -5 to -10 (-5 units) in input, the output changes by -45 units, which again suggests a change of -45 / -5 = 9 per unit change in input.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the coefficient b as 9.

Now, let's find the coefficient a by substituting one of the data points [(x1, y1) = (6, 74)] into the equation y = a + bx and solve for a.

74 = a + 9*6

Let's use two of the given points to set up two equations to solve for a and b. I'll choose the points (6, 74) and (-11, -79). This gives us:

1. \( 74 = a + 6b \)  (using input 6)
2. \( -79 = a - 11b \) (using input -11)

Now we solve this system of equations for a and b:

From Equation 1:
\( a = 74 - 6b \)

Substitute the expression for a from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\( -79 = (74 - 6b) - 11b \)
\( -79 = 74 - 6b - 11b \)
\( -79 = 74 - 17b \)
\( -79 - 74 = -17b \)
\( -153 = -17b \)
\( b = 153 / 17 \)
\( b = 9 \)

    To find the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use two of the given input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations.

Let's choose the following pairs of (x, y): (6, 8) and (-5, -25).

Plugging these into the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we get two equations:

1) For (x, y) = (6, 8):
8 = a(6^0) + b(6^1)
8 = a + 6b

2) For (x, y) = (-5, -25):
-25 = a(-5^0) + b(-5^1)
-25 = a - 5b

Now, we will solve this system of linear equations:

From equation 1)
a = 8 - 6b

Plug the expression for a from equation 1) into equation 2):

-25 = (8 - 6b) - 5b
-25 = 8 - 6b - 5b
-25 = 8 - 11b
-25 - 8 = -11b

    We are given a set of points (x,y) and we need to determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

The term ax^0 is just a, since anything raised to the power of zero is one. Thus, our function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's use the point (6, 8) to create our first equation:
8 = a + b(6)

And the point (-5, -25) to create the second equation:
-25 = a + b(-5)

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1) 8 = a + 6b
2) -25 = a - 5b

We can solve for a and b using these two equations. Let's multiply the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of a have the same absolute value but opposite signs:
1) 8 = a + 6b
2) -25 = a - 5b

Now we will add both equations to eliminate a:
(8) + (-25) = (a + 6b) + (a - 5b)
-17 = 2a + b
b = -17 - 2a

We can now substitute b back into the first equation to find a:

11a = 110
a = 10

Now we have the value of a, we can substitute it back into the equation for b:

    To determine the coefficients for the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find values for a and b that will best fit the given input-output data. The term ax^0 is essentially a constant function, as x^0 equals 1 for any value of x except for x=0, so ax^0 = a. The term bx^1 is a linear function with a slope of b, as x^1 equals x. Therefore, the function we're looking for is y = a + bx.

We're given the following set of data points (x, y):

(6, 8)
(-5, -25)
(-3, -19)
(-10, -40)
(-14, -52)

We can substitute each pair of inputs and outputs into the function and solve for a and b.

Starting with the input x = 6 and output y = 8:

8 = a + 6b (1)

Now, choose another point—for example, x = -5 and y = -25:

-25 = a - 5b (2)

We now have a system of linear equations:

(1) 8 = a + 6b
(2) -25 = a - 5b

We can solve this system by first subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):

8 - (-25) = (a + 6b) - (a - 5b)
33 = 11b
b = 3

Now that we have the value for b, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find a. We'll use equation (1):

8 = a + 6(3)
8 = a + 18
a = 8 - 18
a = -10

So the coefficients are a = -10 and b = 3. The function, therefore, is:

y = -10 + 3x

We can verify this function against one of the points we have not used yet to ensure it fits. For instance, using x = -14, the output should be -52:

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we must identify values for a and b that fit the data. In the given form, ax^0 is a constant because any number to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, ax^0 can be simplified to a. The term bx^1 can be simplified to bx since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself. Hence, we can rewrite the function as y = a + bx.

Now, let's analyze the data to detect the pattern:

When input x = 6, output y = 8, we get the equation 8 = a + 6b.
When input x = -5, output y = -25, we get the equation -25 = a - 5b.
When input x = -3, output y = -19, we get the equation -19 = a - 3b.
When input x = -10, output y = -40, we get the equation -40 = a - 10b.
When input x = -14, output y = -52, we get the equation -52 = a - 14b.

We need to find the values of a and b that can satisfy all these equations. Looking at the outputs, we can see that they are decreasing by a factor that is four times the input. More formally, from the pairs (-5, -25) and (-3, -19), we can see that a decrease in input by 2 ((-3) - (-5)) corresponds to a decrease in output by 12 (-19 - (-25)), suggesting that b might be -6 (because 12 / 2 = 6, and the output decreases as the input decreases, indicating a negative slope).

Let's verify this hypothesis by checking whether b = -6 fits all data points:

For x = 6, y should be 8:
a + 6(-6) = a - 36
a = 8 + 36
a = 44

Checking this a value with another data point, say x = -5 and y = -25:
44 - 5(-6) = 44 + 30
44 + 30 = 74 (which does not equal -25, so this hypothesis is incorrect)

The pattern is not immediately obvious, but we can solve the system of equations for a and b using two points:

Let's use (6,8) and (-5, -25) to set up two equations:

8 = a + 6b
-25 = a - 5b

We'll solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. I'll use elimination:

Multiplying the second equation by 1 to align the a terms:

8 = a + 6b
-25 = a - 5b

Next, we add the two equations to eliminate a:

(8) + (-25) = (a + 6b) + (a - 5b)
-17 = 2a + b

Now, we need another equation to eliminate one of the variables. Let's use the point (-3, -19):

-19 = a - 3b

So now we have two equations:

-17 = 2a + b
-19 = a - 3b

We will solve this new system again using elimination or substitution. Let's multiply the second equation by 2 so the coefficients of a match:

-17 = 2a + b
-38 = 2a - 6b

Now subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:

(17) - (-38) = (2a + b) - (2a - 6b)
21 = 7b

b = 21/7
b = 3

Now that we have b, let's find a using one of the above equations. Using the equation -17 = 2a + b:

-17 = 2a + 3
-20 = 2a
a = -10

We have determined that a = -10 and b = 3. Plugging these into our general form y = a + bx:

y = -10 + 3x

Let's check this function against the given data points for validation:

If x = 6, y = -10 + 3(6) = -10 + 18 = 8 (matches given data)
If x = -5, y = -10 + 3(-5) = -10 - 15 = -25 (matches given data)

    To determine the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we should recognize that ax^0 is a constant term (since x^0 = 1 for all x ≠ 0) and bx^1 is simply bx (since x^1 = x).

First, let's identify the pattern in the inputs and outputs provided:

When x = 6, y = 8.
When x = -5, y = -25.
When x = -3, y = -19.
When x = -10, y = -40.
When x = -14, y = -52.

One possible approach is to look for a linear relationship, given that the function is linear (ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to a + bx, which is a linear function). By inspection, it seems as though the output is decreased by 4 for every unit decrease in input below 6. We can try b = -4 to see if this works for every point.

Let's test x = 6:
If b = -4, then y = a + (-4)(6) = a - 24.
Since at x = 6, the output y = 8, we get:
8 = a - 24
a = 8 + 24
a = 32

So our proposed function is y = 32 - 4x.

However, to be sure, we need to test this function with all the other given points:

For x = -5:
y = 32 - 4(-5) = 32 + 20 = 52 (which does not match the output of -25)

Hence, our initial guess was incorrect. Let's look at another approach.

The change in y for a given change in x is inconsistent, which suggests that the relationship is not purely linear. However, since the form we are trying to fit is linear, we'll need to use the points to solve for the coefficients a and b.

Using the first point (6, 8) and the second point (-5, -25), we can create two equations:

For the point (6, 8):
8 = a + 6b

For the point (-5, -25):
-25 = a - 5b

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:

1) 8 = a + 6b
2) -25 = a - 5b

We can solve this system using various methods such as substitution or elimination. We'll use the elimination method to find a and b.

Multiplying the second equation by 6 and the first equation by 5, to eliminate a, we get:

-150 = 6a - 30b
40 = 5a + 30b

Now add these two equations:

-110 = 11a

Solving for a, we get:

a = -110 / 11
a = -10

Now we use the value of a to solve for b in either equation 1 or 2. We'll use equation 1:

8 = -10 + 6b

To confirm this, we need to check it against all the provided inputs and outputs:

For x = 6, y = -10 + 3(6) = -10 + 18 = 8 (matches)
For x = -5, y = -10 + 3(-5) = -10 - 15 = -25 (matches)
For x = -3, y = -10 + 3(-3) = -10 - 9 = -19 (matches)
For x = -10, y = -10 + 3(-10) = -10 - 30 = -40 (matches)
For x = -14, y = -10 + 3(-14) = -10 - 42 = -52 (matches)

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that ax^0 is simply a constant because x^0 = 1 for any x that is not 0. So, we can rewrite the function as y = a + bx. Here, ""a"" is the y-intercept of the function when x=0, and ""b"" is the slope of the function.

Given the pairs (x, y):

1) When x = 9, y = 29
2) When x = 2, y = 8
3) When x = -1, y = -1
4) When x = -6, y = -16

We can find the slope ""b"" by picking two points and using the formula for the slope of the line:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Using points (2, 8) and (-1, -1):

b = (8 - (-1)) / (2 - (-1)) = 9 / 3 = 3

Now that we have the slope, we can find ""a"" by plugging the value of ""b"" and one pair of (x, y) into the equation y = a + bx. Using the point (2, 8):

8 = a + 3(2)
8 = a + 6
a = 8 - 6
a = 2

So the function that relates x to y is:

y = 2 + 3x

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we want to form a linear equation where ""a"" and ""b"" are constants. Note that x^0 is always equal to 1 for any x except for x=0, hence it represents a constant term in the function (similar to 'c' in the more typical mx + c linear function).

Given the data points:

- When x = 9, y = 29
- When x = 2, y = 8
- When x = -1, y = -1
- When x = -6, y = -16 (this point is given twice, but it doesn't change the function)

To find the best fit linear equation, we can use the first two points to construct two equations and solve for ""a"" and ""b"":

From the point (9, 29):

29 = a(9^0) + b(9)
29 = a + 9b
a = 29 - 9b  ...(1)

From the point (2, 8):

8 = a(2^0) + b(2)
8 = a + 2b
a = 8 - 2b  ...(2)

Now, if we equate equations (1) and (2), we get:

29 - 9b = 8 - 2b
21 = 7b
b = 3

Now, we can substitute b back into either equation (1) or (2) to find ""a"":

a = 29 - 9b
a = 29 - 9(3)
a = 29 - 27
a = 2

So, the linear equation that fits the given points is:

y = 2x^0 + 3x^1
y = 2 + 3x

Therefore the function in the requested format is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to find the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the given input-output pairs. Since \( x^0 \) is always 1 and \( x^1 \) is simply \( x \), the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We have the following points to consider:

1. \( (x, y) = (9, 29) \) 
2. \( (x, y) = (2, 8) \)
3. \( (x, y) = (-1, -1) \)
4. \( (x, y) = (-6, -16) \)

Note that the last point is repeated, so we only need to consider it once. We need to find \( a \) and \( b \) such that the function \( y = a + bx \) passes through these points.

From the third point, where \( x = -1 \) and \( y = -1 \), it's clear that \( b \) should be -1 because:
\[ -1 = a + b(-1) \rightarrow a - b = -1 \]

Considering this result, let's find the value of \( a \) using the second point, where \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 8 \):
\[ 8 = a + b(2) \]
\[ 8 = a + 2(-1) \]
\[ 8 = a - 2 \]
\[ a = 10 \]

Using this value for \( a \), let's verify it using the first point, where \( x = 9 \) and \( y = 29 \):
\[ 29 = 10 - 1(9) \]
\[ 29 = 10 - 9 \]
\[ 29 = 1 \] which is incorrect.

Since our deduced values of \( a \) and \( b \) do not satisfy all the given points (they only satisfy for \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 2 \)), we need to find the correct \( a \) and \( b \) that work for all the given points.

Another approach to find \( a \) and \( b \) is to set up a system of linear equations using two of the points and solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

Using the points (2, 8) and (-1, -1), we can set up the following linear system:

For point (2, 8):
\[ 8 = a + b(2) \]
\[ 8 = a + 2b \]
For point (-1, -1):
\[ -1 = a + b(-1) \]
\[ -1 = a - b \]

By adding both equations, we get:
\[ 8 + (-1) = a + 2b + a - b \]
\[ 7 = 2a + b \]

We now have a system of equations:
\[ 8 = a + 2b \]
\[ 7 = 2a + b \]

Multiplying the second equation by 2 to align the terms with the first equation:
\[ 14 = 4a + 2b \]

Subtracting this new equation from the first one to eliminate \( b \):
\[ 8 - 14 = a + 2b - 4a - 2b \]
\[ -6 = -3a \]
\[ a = 2 \]

Now we can find \( b \) using the value of \( a \) in one of the original equations:
\[ 7 = 2(2) + b \]
\[ 7 = 4 + b \]
\[ b = 3 \]

Thus, the function that describes the data is:
\[ y = 2x^0 + 3x^1 \]
\[ y = 2 + 3x \]

    To write a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the constants 'a' and 'b' that best fit the given input-output pairs. The term ax^0 simplifies to a because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

The equation simplifies to:
y = a + bx

Let's use the given input-output pairs to determine 'a' and 'b'.

For the input 9, the output is 29:
29 = a + b*9    (1)

For the input 2, the output is 8:
8 = a + b*2     (2)

For the input -1, the output is -1:
-1 = a + b*(-1) (3)

For the input -6, the output is -16 (this pair is given twice, but we only need to use it once):
-16 = a + b*(-6)(4)

We have four equations, but since they are all linear, any two of them should suffice to find 'a' and 'b'. We can start with equations (2) and (4):

8 = a + 2b
-16 = a - 6b

Let's solve this system of equations:

Multiply the first equation by 3 to match the 'a' in the second equation:
24 = 3a + 6b       (5)

Now, sum equation (5) with equation (4):
24 - 16 = 3a + 6b + a - 6b
8 = 4a

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for 'a':
a = 2

With the value of 'a', we can substitute it back into equation (2) to solve for 'b':
8 = 2 + 2b
6 = 2b
b = 3

Now that we've found 'a' and 'b', we can write the function:

    To derive the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we look for the constants a and b that will fit the given input-output pairs.

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for a and b.

For the input 9 and output 29:
29 = a*9^0 + b*9^1
29 = a + 9b

For the input 2 and output 8:
8 = a*2^0 + b*2^1
8 = a + 2b

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns:
1) a + 9b = 29

Subtracting the second equation from the first will eliminate a and solve for b:
(1) - (2): (a - a) + (9b - 2b) = (29 - 8)

Given this form, we can use two of the provided input-output pairs to solve for the coefficients 'a' and 'b'. Let's take the pairs (-3, 18) and (2, -17) for calculation.

We have two equations:

1) For input x = -3:  
18 = a + b(-3)

2) For input x = 2:  
-17 = a + b(2)

Let's solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

From the first equation:
18 = a - 3b  =>  a = 18 + 3b  ...(1)

Substitute the value of a from equation (1) to the second equation:
-17 = (18 + 3b) + 2b
-17 = 18 + 5b
5b = -17 - 18
5b = -35
b = -35 / 5

To find the values of a and b, we can use two of the given data points to set up a system of linear equations. Let's use the points (2, -17) and (5, -38).

Substituting the first point into the equation, we get:
-17 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1
-17 = a + 2b

Now, substituting the second point into the equation, we get:
-38 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-38 = a + 5b

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1) a + 2b = -17
2) a + 5b = -38

We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Subtract equation 1) from equation 2) to eliminate a:

    To find the function of the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we first note that \(ax^0\) is equivalent to \(a\) since anything raised to the power of zero is 1. So, the function simplifies to \(y = a + bx\). Our task now is to determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\).

From the given inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations:

1. \(a + b(-16) = 109\)
2. \(a + b(-3) = 18\)
3. \(a + b(2) = -17\)
4. \(a + b(12) = -87\)
5. \(a + b(5) = -38\)

We can simplify these equations to find \(a\) and \(b\).

Let's use equations (3) and (5) to form a small system of 2 equations, as they seem to have inputs with smaller absolute values which might be easier to work with:

- \(a + 2b = -17\)
- \(a + 5b = -38\)

Now, we subtract equation (i) from equation (ii) to solve for \(b\):

\(a + 5b - (a + 2b) = -38 - (-17)\)

Simplifying the left side:

\(5b - 2b = 3b\)

And the right side:

\(-38 + 17 = -21\)

So we have:

\(3b = -21\)

Dividing both sides by 3:

\(b = -21 / 3\)

\(b = -7\)

Now that we have \(b\), we can substitute it back into one of our two-variable equations to solve for \(a\). We'll use equation (i):

\(a + 2(-7) = -17\)

\(a - 14 = -17\)

Adding 14 to both sides:

Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx (since x^0 = 1 and x^1 = x).

Now we have a system of equations:
1) 109 = a - 16b

Let's solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. I'll go with the elimination method.

If we multiply the second equation by 8, we get:

We can set up two equations based on two of the points to solve for a and b (we could use more data points and apply a least squares approach to find a best fit line, but for the sake of simplicity, I'll be using only two points to find an exact solution assuming all the points lie on the same line).

Using the first and third data points (-16, 109) and (2, -17), we have:

1. For input -9 (output 162):
162 = a - 9b

2. For input 17 (output -254):

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. a - 9b = 162
2. a + 17b = -254

We'll solve this system for a and b:

Adding the two equations together eliminates a, so we get:
a - 9b + a + 17b = 162 - 254
2a + 8b = -92
a + 4b = -46  (Divided everything by 2)

Now, let's express a from equation 1 and substitute it into this new equation:

13b = -46 - 162
13b = -208
b = -208 / 13

    To find a function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we recognize that `ax^0` is equivalent to `a` since any number raised to the power of zero is 1. The function simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

Given this, we need to find the values of `a` and `b` that will produce the desired outputs for the provided inputs.

Let's consider two of the provided input-output pairs to setup our system of linear equations:

Using Input: -9, Output: 162:
1) \( a - 9b = 162 \)

Using Input: 17, Output: -254:
2) \( a + 17b = -254 \)

Now we will solve this system of equations for `a` and `b`.

We can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use elimination:

Multiply equation (1) by 17 and equation (2) by 9 to eliminate `a` when we subtract them:

\( 17a - 153b = 2754 \)
\( 9a + 153b = -2286 \)

Adding both equations we get:
\( 17a - 153b + 9a + 153b = 2754 - 2286 \)
\( 26a = 468 \)

Divide both sides by 26:
\( a = 468 / 26 \)
\( a = 18 \)

We can now plug this value of `a` back into one of our original equations to find `b`. Let's use equation (1):

\( 18 - 9b = 162 \)
\( -9b = 162 - 18 \)
\( -9b = 144 \)

Divide both sides by -9:
\( b = 144 / -9 \)
\( b = -16 \)

Therefore, the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1` that describes the data is:

y = 18x^0 - 16x^1

Which simplifies to:
y = 18 - 16x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can observe the patterns in the input (x) and output (y) values. Noting that \( x^0 \) is always 1, we can simplify the function to:

\( y = a + bx \)

We can then use two sets of input-output pairs to create a system of equations to solve for a and b. Let's use the input-output pairs (-9, 162) and (17, -254):

1. For input -9 and output 162:
\( 162 = a + b(-9) \)
\( 162 = a - 9b \)

2. For input 17 and output -254:
\( -254 = a + b(17) \)
\( -254 = a + 17b \)

Now we have a system of two equations:
\( a - 9b = 162 \)
\( a + 17b = -254 \)

Let's solve this system for a and b. First we will add the two equations together to eliminate a:

\( a - 9b + a + 17b = 162 - 254 \)
\( 2a + 8b = -92 \)
\( a + 4b = -46 \)            ..........(3)

Now, we subtract the first equation from the third equation to isolate b:

\( a + 4b - (a - 9b) = -46 - 162 \)
\( a + 4b - a + 9b = -208 \)
\( 13b = -208 \)
\( b = -208 / 13 \)
\( b = -16 \)

Next, we substitute b back into either of the original equations to find a. Let's use \( a - 9b = 162 \):

\( a - 9(-16) = 162 \)
\( a + 144 = 162 \)
\( a = 162 - 144 \)
\( a = 18 \)

    To find a function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), we can use two data points to solve for coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). The linear function \( y = a + bx \) suggests a straight-line relationship between the input \( x \) and the output \( y \).

Let's take two data points to determine the coefficients:

1. Using the point (-9, 162):
\[ 162 = a + b(-9) \]
\[ 162 = a - 9b \] 
\( \text{(Equation 1)} \)

2. Using the point (17, -254):
\[ -254 = a + b(17) \]
\[ -254 = a + 17b \] 
\( \text{(Equation 2)} \)

Now, let's solve this system of linear equations. Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

\[ -254 - 162 = (a + 17b) - (a - 9b) \]
\[ -416 = 26b \]
\[ b = -416 / 26 \]
\[ b = -16 \]

Next, substitute \( b = -16 \) into Equation 1:

\[ 162 = a - 9(-16) \]
\[ 162 = a + 144 \]
\[ a = 162 - 144 \]
\[ a = 18 \]

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants a and b such that the function fits the given input-output pairs. In this linear form, x is the input, y is the output, a represents the y-intercept (the constant term), and b represents the slope of the line. The term ax^0 will always be equal to a, as any number raised to the zero power is 1.

Given the points:
(-9, 162), (17, -254), (-4, 82), (-18, 306), (-14, 242)

We can see a linear pattern where the output changes consistently with the input.

We can pick two points to calculate the slope b. For simplicity and to decrease the risk of arithmetic mistakes, I'll take two points with relatively small input values, (-9, 162) and (-4, 82), and find the slope (b):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (82 - 162) / (-4 + 9)
b = (-80) / (5)
b = -16

Now we know our function is:

y = a + (-16)x

To find the constant a, let's use the point (-9, 162) and substitute x and y values into the formula:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of a and b that make the function consistent with the provided data points.

The given function can also be expressed as y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 for any value of x (except x = 0, where it is undefined, but for practical purposes and in algebra, we define 0^0 as 1).

Let's use two data points to calculate a and b. The function will be:

y = a + bx

We can set up a system of linear equations using two (x, y) points to solve for a and b. Let's use the following points:

Point 1 (x1, y1): (18, 350)
Point 2 (x2, y2): (12, 230)

Plugging these into y = a + bx we get two equations:

350 = a + 18b
230 = a + 12b

Now, let's solve for a and b. Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:

350 - 230 = (a + 18b) - (a + 12b)
120 = 6b

Divide both sides by 6:

b = 120 / 6
b = 20

Now solve for a using one of the original equations. Let's use the second equation:

230 = a + 12b
230 = a + 12(20)
230 = a + 240

Subtract 240 from both sides:

a = 230 - 240
a = -10

Now we have both constants:

a = -10
b = 20

\(120 = 6b\)

    The relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) is described by a linear equation in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the coefficients a and b, we need at least two points to solve the system of equations. We can take (x1, y1) = (18, 350) and (x2, y2) = (12, 230).

Now plug these points into the equation format:

y1 = a(18)^0 + b(18)
350 = a(1) + b(18)
350 = a + 18b     (Equation 1)

y2 = a(12)^0 + b(12)
230 = a(1) + b(12)
230 = a + 12b     (Equation 2)

Now we can solve these two equations to find a and b:

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate a:

(350 - 230) = (a - a) + 18b - 12b

Now we can plug these into the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1:
1) 177 = a(13)^0 + b(13)

14 = b

Now, substitute b back into one of the equations to solve for a:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) in the function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\), we need to analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. \( 13, 177 \)
2. \( 14, 191 \)
3. \( -8, -117 \)
4. \( 3, 37 \)
5. \( 7, 93 \)

Let's first notice the pattern in the change of output with respect to the change in input. For instance, when the input increases from 13 to 14 (an increase of 1), the output increases from 177 to 191 (an increase of 14). This gives us an indication that \(b\), the coefficient of the term \(bx\), might be 14.

Testing our hypothesis with this value of \(b\), if we take two consecutive inputs from the data, such as:

Input: 7, Output: 93
Input: 8, Output should be \(93 + 14 = 107\)

Now let's check against the actual third data point:
Input: -8, Output: -117

If we use the \(b\) value of 14, we predict the output for \(x = -8\) as:
\(y = a + 14(-8)\)
\(y = a - 112\)

For this equation to be correct with the known output, \(a - 112 = -117\), then \(a = -117 + 112\), which gives us \(a = -5\).

We need to test this \(a\) value against all given data points to ensure it fits:

For \(x = 3\), if \(y = -5 + 14x\), then \(y = -5 + 14(3)\) equals \(y = -5 + 42\) which is \(y = 37\). This matches the given output.

For \(x = 7\), if \(y = -5 + 14x\), then \(y = -5 + 14(7)\) equals \(y = -5 + 98\) which is \(y = 93\). This also matches the given output.

Given that \( a = -5 \) and \( b = 14 \), the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs would be:

Output: \( y = -5 + 14x \)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we'll need to consider that \( ax^0 \) is essentially a constant term (since \( x^0 \) is always 1), and \( bx^1 \) is the linear term (since \( x^1 \) is simply \( x \)).

Given that the function form is \( y = a(1) + bx \) or simplified, \( y = a + bx \), we'll need two points to calculate the coefficients 'a' and 'b'.

I will use the points (13, 177) and (14, 191) to calculate the coefficients.

Let's form the linear equations:

For the input 13:
\( 177 = a + 13b \) (Equation 1)

For the input 14:
\( 191 = a + 14b \) (Equation 2)

Now we can solve these equations simultaneously by subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate 'a':

\( 191 - 177 = (a + 14b) - (a + 13b) \)
\( 14 = b \)

Now we have the value for 'b'. Substitute 'b' back into Equation 1 to solve for 'a':

\( 177 = a + 13 * 14 \)
\( 177 = a + 182 \)
\( a = 177 - 182 \)
\( a = -5 \)

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\( y = -5 + 14x \)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: 13
Output: 177

Input: 14
Output: 191

Input: -8
Output: -117

Input: 3
Output: 37

Input: 7
Output: 93


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: -13
    ","To find the output for the input -13 using the function \( y = -5 + 14x \), we substitute -13 for x:

\( y = -5 + 14(-13) \)
\( y = -5 - 182 \)
\( y = -187 \)

Therefore, the output is:

Output: -187",-187,True,"[14, -5]"
