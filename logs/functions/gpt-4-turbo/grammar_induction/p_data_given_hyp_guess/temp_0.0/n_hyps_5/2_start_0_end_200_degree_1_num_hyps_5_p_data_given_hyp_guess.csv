"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To identify the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which is equivalent to \( y = a + bx \), we can first observe that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any value of \( x \), so the term \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \). Let's set up two equations using two of the input-output pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

Let's take the input-output pairs \((4, 67)\) and \((20, 387)\).

For the input 4 and output 67:
\[ 67 = a + 4b \] (1)

For the input 20 and output 387:
\[ 387 = a + 20b \] (2)

Now we can solve these two linear equations to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the method of substitution or elimination. The elimination method will work well here:

Multiply equation (1) by 5, so that the coefficients of \( b \) in both equations are the same:
\[ 5 \times 67 = 5a + 20b \]
\[ 335 = 5a + 20b \] (3)

Now we subtract equation (3) from equation (2) to eliminate \( b \) and solve for \( a \):
\[ 387 - 335 = (a + 20b) - (5a + 20b) \]
\[ 52 = a - 5a \]
\[ 52 = -4a \]
\[ a = -13 \]

Now that we have \( a \), we can substitute it into equation (1) to solve for \( b \):
\[ 67 = (-13) + 4b \]
\[ 67 + 13 = 4b \]
\[ 80 = 4b \]
\[ b = 20 \]

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:
\[ y = -13 \times x^0 + 20 \times x^1 \]
\[ y = -13 + 20x \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the inputs and outputs, we're looking for a linear relationship of the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants. Plugging in the provided data points allows us to form a system of linear equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's take two points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). I'll choose the inputs -10 (output -213) and 20 (output 387) to create two equations.

For input -10:

\[ -213 = a + b(-10) \]
\[ -213 = a - 10b \]

For input 20:

\[ 387 = a + b(20) \]
\[ 387 = a + 20b \]

Now we'll solve this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \). Adding the two equations to eliminate \( a \), we get:

\[ -213 + 387 = a - 10b + a + 20b \]
\[ 174 = 2a + 10b \]
\[ 87 = a + 5b \]

Next, let's isolate \( a \) in the first equation:

\[ -213 + 10b = a \]

We can now substitute this into the second equation to solve for \( b \):

\[ 87 = (-213 + 10b) + 5b \]
\[ 87 = -213 + 15b \]
\[ 300 = 15b \]
\[ b = 20 \]

Now let's substitute \( b \) back into the equation we found for \( a \):

\[ a = -213 + 10b \]
\[ a = -213 + 10(20) \]
\[ a = -213 + 200 \]
\[ a = -13 \]

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

\[ y = -13 + 20x \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we first need to recognize the pattern. 

The term ax^0 is constant because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So, ax^0 is actually ""a,"" which is the y-intercept of the line. The term bx^1 is the slope times the input value (since x^1 is just x); therefore, bx is the variable part of our linear function.

Given the linear nature of the data points, let's turn the pairs into equations using the form y = a + bx, where:

1) For Input: -10, Output: -213
-213 = a + b(-10)

2) For Input: 9, Output: 167
167 = a + b(9)

3) For Input: 4, Output: 67
67 = a + b(4)

4) For Input: -3, Output: -73
-73 = a + b(-3)

5) For Input: 20, Output: 387
387 = a + b(20)

Let's solve these equations using any two pairs to calculate the values of a and b (the y-intercept and the slope of the function, respectively). I will use the pairs (-10, -213) and (20, 387):

From the first pair,
-213 = a - 10b (1)

From the second pair,
387 = a + 20b (2)

By adding equations (1) and (2), we can eliminate ""a"" and solve for ""b"":
(387 - 213) = (a + 20b) - (a - 10b)
174 = 30b
b = 174 / 30
b = 29 / 5
b = 5.8

Now we put the value of b back into either equation (1) or equation (2), let's use equation (2):
387 = a + 20(5.8)
a = 387 - 116
a = 271

Thus, the function that fits the data is:
y = 271 + 5.8x

Rewriting it to match the requested format:
y = 271x^0 + 5.8x^1

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\) because \(x^0 = 1\) for any \(x\) that is not 0, we can use two points to solve for \(a\) and \(b\). Since we are given more than two points, I'll use the first two points provided.

Let \(y = a + bx\)

Using Input: -10, Output: -213, gives us the equation:
-213 = a + b(-10)

Using Input: 9, Output: 167, gives us the equation:
167 = a + b(9)

We have a system of equations:
1) -213 = a - 10b
2) 167 = a + 9b

Solving for \(a\) and \(b\):
From equation 2, express \(a\) as:
a = 167 - 9b

Substitute \(a\) from the above in equation 1:
-213 = (167 - 9b) - 10b
-213 = 167 - 19b
-380 = -19b
b = 20

Now, solve for \(a\) using b = 20 in the second equation:
167 = a + 9(20)
167 = a + 180
a = -13

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the given data, let's first understand the components:

- ax^0 is essentially a constant term because any number (except zero) raised to the power of 0 is 1. So, ax^0 is simply a.
- bx^1 is a linear term proportional to x, because any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself.

We are looking for the values of a and b that will define our function y = a + bx.

Given the data points (-10, -213), (9, 167), (4, 67), (-3, -73), and (20, 387), we can set up a system of equations or use techniques of linear regression to determine the values of a and b.

However, the straightforward approach here would be to look for a pattern in the change of y with respect to the change in x. Let's assume b is the same between all consecutive x-values and try to identify the pattern:

For example, as x changes from -10 to -3 (a change of 7 units), y changes from -213 to -73 (a change of 140 units). The change in y per unit change in x would be 140 / 7 = 20. This suggests that our b could be 20, as this fits the linear part bx^1.

Applying this assumed slope of b = 20 to all other data points should give us consistent results if our assumption is correct:

For x changing from -3 to 4 (a change of 7 units), y should change by 7 * 20 = 140 units. And indeed, y changes from -73 to 67, which is a difference of 140.

Let's now check this apparent slope with the other points:

From x = 4 to x = 9 (a change of 5 units), y changes from 67 to 167 (a change of 100 units). The change in y per unit change in x is 100 / 5 = 20, so the slope remains consistent.

From x = 9 to x = 20 (a change of 11 units), y changes from 167 to 387 (a change of 220 units). The change in y per unit change in x is 220 / 11 = 20, further confirming our slope.

Since the slope remains consistent, we can confirm that b = 20. Now, we just need to find the value of a, the y-intercept.

We can use any data point to find a. Using (4, 67):

67 = a + 20 * 4
67 = a + 80
a = 67 - 80
a = -13

Therefore, the linear function that fits the data provided is:

y = -13 + 20x.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1), we need to determine the values of a and b that best fit the provided input-output pairs.

Given this form:

y = a + bx

Let's solve for a and b using two input-output pairs from the provided data. After finding the values of a and b, we will verify if this linear function fits all the provided input-output pairs.

Let's use the first two pairs for this:

For Input: -18, Output: 339, we can write:

339 = a + b(-18)   (1)

For Input: 0, Output: -3, we can write:

-3 = a + b(0)   (2)

From equation (2), it is clear that:

a = -3

Now, let's substitute a back into equation (1):

339 = -3 - 18b
342 = -18b
b = -19

Therefore, the function is:

y = -3 - 19x

Now let's check the remaining input-output pairs to ensure this function is valid:

For Input: 5, Output should be -98:

y = -3 - 19(5)
y = -3 - 95
y = -98 (which matches the given output)

For Input: -3, Output should be 54:

y = -3 - 19(-3)
y = -3 + 57
y = 54 (which matches the given output)

For Input: -16, Output should be 301:

y = -3 - 19(-16)

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given input-output pairs, we need to determine the constants a and b. The term ax^0 simplifies to a since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. 

Given this form, we can create a system of equations using the provided input-output pairs to solve for a and b. Let's take two distinct pairs to set up the equations:

Using the input-output pair (0, -3):
-3 = a + b*0, which simplifies to -3 = a.

We now know that a = -3.

Using the input-output pair (-18, 339):
339 = a + b*(-18), since we already know a = -3 this becomes 339 = -3 - 18b.

To find b, we solve for b:
18b = -3 - 339,
18b = -342,
b = -342 / 18,
b = -19.

Now we have both constants a and b. Plugging these values into the function y = a + bx gives us:

    To determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) for the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we essentially need a constant term (\( a \)) and a linear term (\( b \)). The \( x^0 \) term is always 1, so the constant \( a \) will be the value of the output when \( x = 0 \), and the linear term \( b \) will be the slope of the line.

From the data given:

- When \( x = 0 \), \( y = -3 \), meaning that \( a = -3 \) (since \( y = a*1^0 + b*0 \) simplifies to \( y = a \)).
- To determine \( b \), we need two points to calculate the slope (\( b \)). Let's use the points \((-18, 339)\) and \((5, -98)\):

The slope \( b \) is calculated by:
\[ b = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]
\[ b = \frac{-98 - 339}{5 - (-18)} \]
\[ b = \frac{-437}{23} \]
\[ b = -19 \]

This fits exactly with the pattern of the data since the change in output for a 1-unit change in input seems to be -19 (e.g., from input -16 to input -18, output changes from 301 to 339, which is a change of 38, and 38 / 2 = 19).

Thus, the function appears to be:

\[ y = -3 + (-19)x \]
\[ y = -3 - 19x \]

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants 'a' and 'b' based on the given input-output pairs. Note that x^0 is always 1 for any non-zero x, so essentially, ax^0 can be thought of as a constant term 'a'.

Given the points:

1. (-18, 339)
2. (0, -3)
3. (5, -98)
4. (-3, 54)
5. (-16, 301)

From the second point (0, -3), we can directly find the value of 'a' because when x is 0, y will equal a*1 + b*0:

-3 = a * 0^0 + b * 0
-3 = a (since 0^0 is 1 and b * 0 is 0)

So we have a = -3. Now we need to find 'b'. We can use any of the remaining points to find the value of 'b'. Let's use the first point (-18, 339):

339 = a * (-18)^0 + b * (-18)
339 = -3 * 1 + b * (-18)

Add 3 to both sides to move the -3 term from the right to the left:

339 + 3 = b * (-18)
342 = b * (-18)

Divide both sides by -18 to solve for b:

342 / (-18) = b
-19 = b

Now we have both 'a' and 'b':

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can recognize that \( ax^0 \) is essentially a because any number (except zero) raised to the power of 0 is 1, and \( bx^1 \) is simply \( bx \) because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself. Therefore, the function will look like:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Given the constraints of the data, we need to determine the constants a and b such that the function best fits the provided input-output pairs. Since we have more than two points, we can't solve it directly for exact values of a and b (as this implies a simple linear equation system with more equations than we have variables), but we can find a function that fits the data points provided to us.

Let's use two data points to determine the constants a and b. We can then check with the other points if the derived function seems to hold true. Taking the points (0, -3) and (-18, 339), we can set up the following equations:

For the point (0, -3):
\[ -3 = a + b(0) \]
\[ -3 = a \]

For the point (-18, 339):
\[ 339 = a + b(-18) \]

Now that we know a is -3 from the first point, we can substitute it into the second equation:

\[ -98 = -98 \]

    To find the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can set up a system of linear equations using the given input-output pairs. Remember that x^0 is equivalent to 1 for all x ≠ 0. So the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given the pairs:

1. x = 5, y = -31
2. x = 9, y = -51
3. x = -11, y = 49
4. x = -4, y = 14
5. x = -12, y = 54

We can substitute these values into the function for each input-output pair, which gives us a system of equations:

1. -31 = a + 5b
2. -51 = a + 9b
3. 49 = a - 11b
4. 14 = a - 4b
5. 54 = a - 12b

We can use two of the equations to solve for a and b. Let's use equations 1 and 4:

-31 = a + 5b  [Equation 1]
14 = a - 4b   [Equation 4]

We can solve these equations by multiplying equation 4 by 5 and adding the two equations together:

5 * (14 = a - 4b) => 70 = 5a - 20b

Now adding the modified equation 4 to equation 1:

-31 + 70 = a + 5b + (5a - 20b)
39 = 6a - 15b
13 = 2a - 5b

Now we've got a new equation which we can call equation 6:

13 = 2a - 5b [Equation 6]

Let’s use equation 6 and equation 1 to solve for a and b:

-31 = a + 5b [Equation 1]
13 = 2a - 5b  [Equation 6]

If we multiply equation 6 by 1 and add it to equation 1, we get:

-31 = a + 5b
13 = 2a - 5b
-----------------
-18 = 3a

Dividing by 3, we get a = -6.

With the value for a, we can substitute it into Equation 1 to solve for b:

-31 = a + 5b
-31 = -6 + 5b
-25 = 5b
b = -5

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -6x^0 - 5x^1
y = -6 - 5x

(5)  a - 12b = 54

We could solve for 'a' from any one equation and then substitute back into another to find 'b'. However, since we have multiple pairs, we can use methods like matrix operations or other algorithms to find an average 'best' solution for a and b considering all the data points simultaneously, rather than solving pairs of equations. This would typically be done using least squares or similar optimization techniques.

Assuming the data reflects a perfect linear model and without using advanced techniques or additional information, let's subtract equations to eliminate 'a' and solve for 'b'.

Take equations (1) and (3) for elimination:

a + 5b = -31    [Equation (1)]
a - 11b = 49    [Equation (3)]

Subtract equation (3) from (1):

16b = -80

Now divide by 16 to solve for b:

b = -80 / 16 = -5

Next, substitute b = -5 into an equation to solve for a, let's use Equation (1):

a + 5(-5) = -31
a - 25 = -31
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

So, the function that best describes the given data points in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 would be:

y = -6x^0 - 5x^1

Which simplifies to:

y = -6 - 5x

    Given the inputs and outputs, we can attempt to find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x is the input value. The term ax^0 is equivalent to a constant a, because any number raised to the power of zero is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx when ax^0 is represented as just a. 

We can do this by setting up a system of equations using the provided input-output pairs and solving for the coefficients a and b.

Let's take two pairs of inputs/outputs to set up the equations:

For input 5:
-31 = a + 5b

For input 9:
-51 = a + 9b

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1) -31 = a + 5b
2) -51 = a + 9b

We can solve this system of equations by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a:

(2) - (1) = (-51) - (-31) = a + 9b - (a + 5b)
-20 = 4b
b = -5

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find a. Let's use equation (1):

-31 = a + 5(-5)
-31 = a - 25
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

    To determine the coefficients `a` and `b` for the function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we can use two pairs of inputs and outputs as a system of linear equations. Let's take the pairs (5, -31) and (9, -51) for this purpose.

Given the pairs (x, y), we can create the following system of equations:

For input 5 and output -31:

-31 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-31 = a + 5b               (1)

For input 9 and output -51:

-51 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
-51 = a + 9b               (2)

Now we can solve the system of equations (1) and (2) for `a` and `b`:

From (1):

a = -31 - 5b              (3)

Substitute the expression for `a` from (3) into (2):

-51 = (-31 - 5b) + 9b
-51 = -31 - 5b + 9b
-51 = -31 + 4b
-51 + 31 = 4b
-20 = 4b

b = -5

Now we can substitute the value of `b` back into equation (3) to find `a`:

a = -31 - 5(-5)
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To describe the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) mathematically, we want to find constants a and b such that the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 best fits the provided data.

The term ax^0 simplifies to a because any number to the power of zero is 1. The term bx^1 simplifies to bx because any number to the power of one is the number itself. So, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's now use two data points to solve for constants a and b. We’ll use the following two data points for our calculation: (5, -31) and (9, -51).

When x = 5, y = -31. Substituting these values into the equation y = a + bx gives us:
-31 = a + 5b

When x = 9, y = -51. Similarly, substituting these into the equation gives us:
-51 = a + 9b

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
1) -31 = a + 5b
2) -51 = a + 9b

We will solve this system for a and b.

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:
-51 - (-31) = (a + 9b) - (a + 5b)
-20 = 4b

Now, let's find b:
b = -20 / 4
b = -5

With the value of b, let's solve for a using the first equation (-31 = a + 5b):
-31 = a + 5(-5)
-31 = a - 25
a = -31 + 25

    To find a function that fits the given input-output pairs, we can notice that the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1. Thus, we are looking for a linear relationship between x and y.

The linear relationship in the form of y = a + bx implies that b is the slope of the line, and a is the y-intercept. To find the values of a and b, we need to solve a system of equations using the input-output pairs provided. 

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to set up our system of equations. We'll use (5, -74) and (3, -50).

From the pair (5, -74), we have:
-74 = a + 5b  ... (1)

From the pair (3, -50), we have:
-50 = a + 3b  ... (2)

Now we need to solve this system for a and b. Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a.

(-74) - (-50) = (a + 5b) - (a + 3b)
-74 + 50 = 5b - 3b
-24 = 2b
b = -12

Now, let's substitute b = -12 into equation (2) to solve for a:

-50 = a + 3(-12)
-50 = a - 36
a = -50 + 36
a = -14

So our linear function, using the values for a and b, is:

    To find a linear function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \). This form is equivalent to \( y = a + bx \), since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x.

Given two pairs of points, \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \), we can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using the following system of equations:

1. \( y_1 = a + bx_1 \)
2. \( y_2 = a + bx_2 \)

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

\( y_2 - y_1 = b(x_2 - x_1) \)

Solving for \( b \):

\( b = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) \)

Once we have \( b \), we can plug it back into either equation to solve for \( a \).

Let's pick two points from the data set, for example the first and last one:

\( x_1 = 7, y_1 = -98 \)
\( x_2 = -6, y_2 = 58 \)

Now let's calculate \( b \):

\( b = (58 - (-98)) / (-6 - 7) \)
\( b = (58 + 98) / (-13) \)
\( b = 156 / (-13) \)
\( b = -12 \)

Now we can use \( b \) to solve for \( a \). Using the first data point:

\( -98 = a + (-12 \times 7) \)
\( -98 = a - 84 \)
\( a = -98 + 84 \)
\( a = -14 \)

Thus, the function that describes the data is:

\( y = -14 + (-12)x \)

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can acknowledge that the function is a linear function in the form of:

From the given input-output pairs, we can set up a system of linear equations to solve for the constants a and b. Using two pairs from the data set:

Using the input-output pair (7, -98):
-98 = a + b(7)

Using the input-output pair (17, -218):
-218 = a + b(17)

We can solve the system of equations to find the values of a and b. Let's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

-218 - (-98) = a + b(17) - (a + b(7))
-218 + 98 = a - a + b(17 - 7)
-120 = 10b
b = -120 / 10
b = -12

Now we can substitute b = -12 into one of the equations to solve for a:

Using the pair (7, -98) again:
-98 = a + (-12)(7)
-98 = a - 84
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

Thus, the function that fits the given data points is:

y = -14 + (-12)x

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) given in the data, we can notice this is a linear equation where ax^0 is a constant and bx^1 is a variable dependent term (y = a + bx).

Given the data points:
(7, -98)
(17, -218)
(5, -74)
(3, -50)
(-6, 58)

We can create a system of equations to solve for a and b, but since our general linear form y = a + bx is such that x, y pairs should satisfy it, we can calculate the slope (b) between each pair of points and see if it's consistent to confirm our linearity assumption.

Take the first two points (7, -98) and (17, -218), and use the slope formula (change in y over change in x):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-218 - (-98)) / (17 - 7)
b = (-218 + 98) / (10)
b = -120 / 10
b = -12

If our relationship is truly linear, then this slope (b = -12) should hold for all pairs of points.

Let's verify the slope with another pair, such as (5, -74) and (3, -50):

b = (-74 - (-50)) / (5 - 3)
b = (-74 + 50) / (2)
b = -24 / 2
b = -12

This confirms our constant slope of -12 across multiple pairs. Now, we need to solve for a using one of the data points. We'll use the point (7, -98):

-98 = a + (-12 * 7)

Let's analyze the given pairs to see if they fit a linear pattern:

1. When Input (x) = 7,   Output (y) = -98
2. When Input (x) = 17, Output (y) = -218

4. When Input (x) = 3,   Output (y) = -50
5. When Input (x) = -6, Output (y) = 58

To determine 'a' and 'b', we can use two of the pairs to form a system of linear equations and solve for the coefficients. However, since we want the function to describe all the provided points, all the points should lie on the line described by the equation if they all conform to the same linear pattern. Let's try to calculate 'b' (the slope) using two points:

Using points (7, -98) and (17, -218):
b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-218 - (-98)) / (17 - 7)
b = (-218 + 98) / (10)
b = -120 / 10
b = -12

Now let's calculate 'a' (the y-intercept). Using the same two points and the value of 'b' just found:

-98 = a + (-12)(7)
-98 = a - 84
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

So our proposed function would be y = -14 + (-12)x or y = -14 - 12x.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can start by noticing the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is essentially y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 for all x ≠ 0.

We need to determine the values of a and b that make this equation valid for all the given pairs of inputs and outputs. The equation y = a + bx has two unknowns, so two pairs of data points would be sufficient to solve for a and b using simultaneous equations or other methods.

However, we have been provided with five data points, which are more than necessary. This could either be an overdetermined system, suggesting the possibility of a precise fit, or the points suggest a function that isn't perfectly linear, in which case we would calculate an approximate fit (for example, by least squares regression).

Let's use two points to calculate a and b:

Using the points (-11, -169) and (20, 265):
For x = -11, y = -169, we get: -169 = a + (-11)b
For x = 20, y = 265, we get: 265 = a + (20)b

Now we have two equations:

1) a - 11b = -169
2) a + 20b = 265

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a:

(20b) - (-11b) = 265 - (-169)
31b = 434
b = 434 / 31
b = 14

With b known, we can solve for a using either equation (1) or (2):

Using equation 1:
a - 11(14) = -169
a - 154 = -169
a = -169 + 154
a = -15

So, the function that fits these two data points exactly is:
y = -15 + 14x

However, this is based on assuming that the data points will fit into a perfect linear equation. Let's quickly verify this assumption using the other data points:

For x = -13, y should be -15 + 14(-13) = -15 - 182 = -197, which matches.
For x = -10, y should be -15 + 14(-10) = -15 - 140 = -155, which matches.

-197 = a - 13b  (1)

For input -11:
-169 = a + b(-11)
-169 = a - 11b  (2)

Now let's solve this system of equations. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) gives us:

(-197) - (-169) = (-13b) - (-11b)
-197 + 169 = -13b + 11b
-28 = -2b
b = 14

For the second pair with input 20: 265 = a + b(20), which simplifies to a + 20b = 265 ... (2)

Now, we have two linear equations with two variables:

a - 13b = -197
a + 20b = 265

We can solve these equations using various methods, such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. For simplicity, let's use the elimination method by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):

(20b + a) - (-13b + a) = 265 - (-197)

When we do the subtraction, we eliminate a:

20b - (-13b) = 265 + 197
33b = 462

Now we can solve for b:

b = 462 / 33
b = 14

Having determined b, we can now substitute b back into either equation (1) or (2) to find a. Substituting b into equation (1):

a - 13(14) = -197
a - 182 = -197
a = -197 + 182
a = -15

So, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -15 + 14x

Or in the exact form you requested:

Output: y = -15x^0 + 14x^1

    ","Given the function y = -15 + 14x, we can apply it to the input 4:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are essentially finding \( y = a + bx \), since \( x^0 \) equals 1 for any x that isn't 0.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs (-13, -197), (-11, -169), (20, 265), (-10, -155), and (7, 83), we can see that the relationship between x and y might be linear given that each step in x seems to correspond to a consistent step in y.

To determine the exact values for a and b, let's take two input-output pairs to form two equations and solve for a and b:

1. Using the input-output pair (-13, -197):
\[ -197 = a + b(-13) \]
\[ -197 = a - 13b \]

2. Using the input-output pair (-11, -169):
\[ -169 = a + b(-11) \]
\[ -169 = a - 11b \]

Now we solve these two equations simultaneously:

Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[ (-197 - (-169)) = (a - a) - 13b + 11b \]
\[ -28 = -2b \]
\[ b = \frac{-28}{-2} \]
\[ b = 14 \]

Using the value of b to solve for a using the second equation:
\[ -169 = a - 11 * 14 \]
\[ --169 = a - 154 \]
\[ a = -169 + 154 \]
\[ a = -15 \]

Therefore, our function that captures the relationship between the input x and the output y is:

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any x not equal to 0, we can use two points from the given data to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's choose the two points (Input, Output): (-13, -197) and (20, 265).

We can set up the following system of linear equations using these points with our function:

For point (-13, -197):
\( -197 = a + b(-13) \)
\( -197 = a - 13b \)

For point (20, 265):
\( 265 = a + b(20) \)
\( 265 = a + 20b \)

Now, let's solve the system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \).

First, we arrange the equations:

\( a - 13b = -197 \)   ... Equation (1)
\( a + 20b = 265 \)    ... Equation (2)

To eliminate \( a \), we can subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):

\( (a + 20b) - (a - 13b) = 265 - (-197) \)
\( a + 20b - a + 13b = 265 + 197 \)
\( 33b = 462 \)

Now, solving for \( b \):

\( b = \frac{462}{33} \)
\( b = 14 \)

Next, substitute \( b \) into Equation (1) to solve for \( a \):

\( a - 13(14) = -197 \)
\( a - 182 = -197 \)
\( a = -197 + 182 \)
\( a = -15 \)

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which can also be simplified as y = a + bx (because any number to the power of 0 is 1), we need to determine the constants a and b that fit the given input-output pairs.

Let's use two of the input-output pairs to set up two equations that will allow us to solve for a and b.

Using the input-output pairs (9, 160) and (13, 228), we get two equations:

1) 160 = a + b(9)
2) 228 = a + b(13)

Now let's solve this system of two equations with two unknowns:

From equation 1) we get:
160 = a + 9b
So,
a = 160 - 9b

Use this expression for a in equation 2):

228 = (160 - 9b) + 13b
228 = 160 + 4b
68 = 4b
b = 17

Now we can find a by using b = 17 in the equation a = 160 - 9b:

a = 160 - 9(17)
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To capture the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) with a linear function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to think of it as \( y = a + bx \), since \( x^0 = 1 \) and \( x^1 = x \). 

We will use two pairs of input/output values to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's pick the input/output pairs (9, 160) and (13, 228).

For the first pair (9, 160):
\(160 = a + 9b\)

For the second pair (13, 228):
\(228 = a + 13b\)

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:
1. \(a + 9b = 160\)
2. \(a + 13b = 228\)

We can solve this system by using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:
\( (a + 13b) - (a + 9b) = 228 - 160 \)

This simplifies to:
\( 4b = 68 \)

Now we can solve for \( b \):
\( b = 68 / 4 \)
\( b = 17 \)

Now we can substitute \( b \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( a \). Let's use equation 1:
\(a + 9(17) = 160\)
\(a + 153 = 160\)
\(a = 160 - 153\)
\(a = 7\)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that the term ax^0 is essentially a constant (since any non-zero number to the power of 0 is 1). Thus, we can rewrite the function as y = a + bx, which is a linear function.

Given the data points:

1. (9, 160)
2. (13, 228)
3. (-4, -61)
4. (15, 262)
5. (-20, -333)

We need to find the values of a and b such that our linear function passes through these points. We are looking for a pattern in how x relates to y that is consistent across these data points.

By substituting the given x and y values from any two points into the linear equation, we can solve for a and b. However, because we were provided with more than two points, it's possible that no single linear equation may pass exactly through all points (unless they are perfectly collinear, which in real data is not always the case). In such cases, we would look for the best-fitting line, potentially using methods like least squares regression. Nevertheless, in this scenario, we are asked for an explicit function, which suggests that there might indeed be a perfect fit.

Let's use two of the data points to solve for a and b:

Using points (9, 160) and (-4, -61):

From the first point (9, 160):
160 = a + 9b (1)

From the second point (-4, -61):
-61 = a - 4b (2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations. We can solve for a and b using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply equation (1) by 4 and equation (2) by 9 to eliminate a:
640 = 4a + 36b (3)
-549 = 9a - 36b (4)

Now add (3) and (4) to eliminate b:
640 - 549 = (4a + 36b) + (9a - 36b)
91 = 13a
a = 91 / 13
a = 7

Substitute the value of a into (1):
160 = 7 + 9b
153 = 9b
b = 153 / 9
b = 17

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:
y = 7x^0 + 17x^1
y = 7 + 17x

Note: It is crucial to check whether this function fits all the provided data points. If it doesn't, it means that there is an error, or the data points do not fit a perfect linear relationship, and a best-fit line would be required using a method such as least squares. However, if we check and it fits all points perfectly, then we have the correct function.

    To determine the coefficients 'a' and 'b' for the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we will need to solve for these coefficients using the given input-output pairs. The term ax^0 simplifies to a*1 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), which leads to the function simplifying to y = a + bx. 

Let's substitute the given input-output pairs into the simplified function:

1) When x = 9, y = 160:
160 = a + 9b

2) When x = 13, y = 228:
228 = a + 13b

Let's now set up a system of linear equations using these two pairs as they will give us enough information to solve for 'a' and 'b':

1) a + 9b = 160  (Equation 1)
2) a + 13b = 228 (Equation 2)

Now, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate 'a':

(a + 13b) - (a + 9b) = 228 - 160

a + 13b - a - 9b = 68

4b = 68

Now, divide by 4:

b = 68 / 4
b = 17

With the value of 'b' discovered, we can now substitute it back into Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find 'a'. We'll use Equation 1:

a + 9b = 160
a + 9(17) = 160
a + 153 = 160

Subtract 153 from both sides to get 'a':

a = 160 - 153
a = 7

We now need to determine the constants a and b based on the given input-output pairs. Since we are given five data points, we can use two of them to solve for a and b and then check if the same a and b work for the other points.

Let's start with the data points (9, 160) and (13, 228). Substituting these into the equation y = a + bx gives us two equations:

1) 160 = a + 9b
2) 228 = a + 13b

Solving these equations simultaneously, we subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

228 - 160 = a + 13b - (a + 9b)
68 = 4b

From here, solving for b gives:

b = 68 / 4
b = 17

Now let's substitute b back into the first equation to solve for a:

160 = a + 9(17)
160 = a + 153

Solving for a gives:

a = 160 - 153
a = 7

At this point, we have:

y = 7 + 17x

We now need to check if this function holds for the other data points:

For input -4, the output is -61:
-61 = 7 - 17 * 4
-61 = 7 - 68
-61 = -61 (This checks out)

Let's use two of the given pairs of points to set up a system of linear equations. Taking (x₁, y₁) = (-2, 17) and (x₂, y₂) = (7, -145), we have:

For (x₁, y₁):
17 = a + b(-2)    (1)

For (x₂, y₂):
-145 = a + b(7)   (2)

Now we can solve for 'a' and 'b'.

Rearranging (1), we get:
a = 17 + 2b       (3)

Substituting (3) into (2), we find:
-145 = (17 + 2b) + 7b
-145 = 17 + 9b
-145 - 17 = 9b
-162 = 9b
b = -162 / 9
b = -18

Let's write out the equations based on the given data pairs (-2, 17), (7, -145), (-10, 161), (9, -181), and (-20, 341):

1. For input -2: 17 = a + b(-2)

4. For input 9: -181 = a + b(9)
5. For input -20: 341 = a + b(-20)

We now have a system of equations. Let's look closely for a pattern in the outputs that might suggest a relationship between the inputs and outputs:

For input -2, output is 17: (-2) * b should be 19 less than a (since -2b + a = 17)
For input 7, output is -145: 7 * b should be 145 less than -a
For input -10, output is 161: (-10) * b should be 171 less than a
For input 9, output is -181: 9 * b should be 181 less than -a
For input -20, output is 341: (-20) * b should be 361 less than a

This pattern suggests that b might be -18, since multiplying it with the inputs seems to yield a consistent difference when subtracted from the outputs:

Let's verify this by substituting b = -18 into one of the equations:

Using the first equation (for input -2):

a = 17 + 36

- `a` is the y-intercept (the value of y when x is 0) 
- `b` is the slope (the rate at which y changes with respect to changes in x)

2. (7, -145)
3. (-10, 161)
4. (9, -181)
5. (-20, 341)

We can observe that every time the input x changes by 1, the output y changes by a constant rate. Let's see this change between the first two provided data points:

For the change from x = -2 to x = 7 (which is an increase of 9 units):
- The output goes from 17 to -145, which is a change of -145 - 17 = -162.

Now, let's figure out the slope (b), which is change in y divided by the change in x:

b = Δy / Δx = -162 / 9 = -18.

The slope is consistent with the change we'd expect based on other data points. For instance:

For the change from x = 7 to x = 9 (which is an increase of 2 units):
- The output goes from -145 to -181, which is a change of -181 - (-145) = -36.

When x increases by 2, y decreases by 36, which is consistent with our slope of -18 (-18 * 2 = -36).

So, we have determined that b = -18.

Next, let’s find a, substituting one of the points into the equation y = a + bx. Using the first data point (-2, 17):

    Given the data points, we can see that the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) appears to be linear because the equation we're trying to fit is in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx (since any number to the power of 0 is 1).

To determine the values of the coefficients a and b in the linear equation, we can use two data points to obtain a system of two equations. Let's choose the points (-2, 17) and (7, -145):

For the input -2 and output 17:
17 = a + b(-2)  -> 1) 17 = a - 2b

For the input 7 and output -145:
-145 = a + b(7) -> 2) -145 = a + 7b

We can now solve this system of equations for a and b:

Multiplying equation 1) by 7 and adding it to 2) to eliminate a:

7(17) + (-145) = 7a - 14b + a + 7b
119 - 145 = 8a - 7b
-26 = 8a - 7b

Now let's multiply equation 1) by 1 and adding it to 2) to eliminate b:

(17) + (-145) = a - 2b + a + 7b
17 - 145 = 2a + 5b
-128 = 2a + 5b

Now we have a new system of equations:

3) 8a - 7b = -26
4) 2a + 5b = -128

Multiplying 4) by 4 to align the a's with 3):

4(2a + 5b) = 4(-128)
8a + 20b = -512

And subtracting 3) from this new equation:

8a + 20b - (8a - 7b) = -512 - (-26)
8a + 20b - 8a + 7b = -512 + 26
27b = -486

b = -486 / 27
b = -18

Finding a by substituting b back into 3):
8a - 7(-18) = -26
8a + 126 = -26
8a = -26 - 126
8a = -152

a = -152 / 8
a = -19

Thus, the function capturing the relationship between x and y is:

y = -19 + (-18)x

    Given the data points and the desired form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, let's find the coefficients a and b. The equation can be simplified to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for any x not equal to zero. We essentially want to find a linear model y = a + bx that best fits the provided data points.

Here are the given points:
(20, -307),
(-1, 8),
(12, -187),
(18, -277).

We can use two of these points to solve for a and b. However, since we are given multiple data points, there could be some noise in the data, so choosing two random points might not provide the best solution for all points. In situations like this, a least squares fit would be better, but since we're to describe the data as well as we can with a linear model, we can still proceed with two points.

Let's take points (20, -307) and (12, -187) and set up a system of equations:

- For (20, -307):
  -307 = a + 20b (1)

- For (12, -187):
  -187 = a + 12b (2)

Let's solve this system for a and b. We'll first subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:

(1) - (2):
-307 - (-187) = (a + 20b) - (a + 12b)
-120 = 8b
b = -120 / 8
b = -15

Now we'll substitute b = -15 back into equation (1):

-307 = a + 20(-15)
-307 = a - 300
a = -307 + 300
a = -7

So, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is

y = -7 + (-15)x

    To find a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we essentially need to find the values for constants \( a \) and \( b \) that will fit the given input-output pairs. This form simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) because any number to the power of 0 is 1.

We have several points to work with, but since the equation is linear, we technically only need two points to determine a unique solution for \( a \) and \( b \). We can use the first two unique points for this calculation:

1. \( (x_1, y_1) = (20, -307) \)
2. \( (x_2, y_2) = (-1, 8) \)

We can create two equations that these two points must satisfy:

1. \(-307 = a + 20b\)
2. \(8 = a - b\)

We can solve this system of equations through various methods such as substitution or elimination. I'll choose the substitution method for simplicity.

From equation 2:

\( a = 8 + b \)

Now, we substitute \( a \) in equation 1:

\(-307 = (8 + b) + 20b\)
\(-307 = 8 + 21b\)
\(-315 = 21b\)
\( b = -15 \)

Now that we have \( b \), go back to solve for \( a \):

\( a = 8 + b \)
\( a = 8 - 15 \)
\( a = -7 \)

So the function that fits the given points is:

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we need to interpret the terms:

- The term ax^0 is a constant because x^0 is 1 for any x that is not zero. So, ax^0 is the same as saying 'a'.
- The term bx^1 is linear because x^1 is x. So, bx^1 is the same as saying 'bx'.

Given that the data points for input (x) and output (y) have the same output for the same input, we can see that there is no random error in the relationship, and the function should consistently map the given inputs to the given outputs.

We are looking to find the values of 'a' and 'b' in the equation y = a + bx. Let's substitute the given data points into the equation to form a system of linear equations.

For the point (20, -307):

-307 = a + b(20)
-307 = a + 20b ---- (1)

And for the point (-1, 8):

8 = a + b(-1)
8 = a - b ---- (2)

We can use these two equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

-307 - 8 = (a + 20b) - (a - b)
-315 = 21b
b = -315 / 21
b = -15

Now, to find 'a', we can substitute the value of 'b' back into either equation (1) or (2). Using equation (2):

8 = a - (-15)
8 = a + 15
a = 8 - 15

Since the output is a linear function of the input, we can use two pairs of the provided data points to calculate the coefficients.

Let's use the data points (20, -307) and (-1, 8):

For the input 20, the output -307 gives us:
-307 = a + b(20)        (1)

For the input -1, the output 8 gives us:
8 = a + b(-1)          (2)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns.

Looking at the provided inputs and outputs, since multiple inputs give the same output (input 20 gives -307 twice), this implies that for this data, there is likely a linear relationship between the input (x) and the output (y), as there are no inconsistencies in the outputs for the same input.

Let's consider two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for a and b.

Using Input: -1 and Output: 8,
y = a + b(-1) = 8

Using Input: 20 and Output: -307,
y = a + b(20) = -307

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. a - b = 8
2. a + 20b = -307

Now, let's solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination in this case:

From equation 1,
a = 8 + b

Substitute a from equation 1 into equation 2:
(8 + b) + 20b = -307
8 + 21b = -307
21b = -307 - 8
21b = -315
b = -315 / 21
b = -15

Now substitute b back into equation 1 to find a:
a - (-15) = 8
a + 15 = 8
a = 8 - 15

Now, we need to determine the values of coefficients a and b that fit the data points provided. We need at least two different data points to solve for the two unknowns. We can use any two pairs to set up a system of equations. Let's use the pairs (-17, -325) and (16, 269).

For the input -17, output -325:

-325 = a - 17b  ...(1)

For the input 16, output 269:

269 = a + 16b  ...(2)

Now we solve this system of linear equations. Let's multiply equation (2) by 17 and add it to equation (1):

(17 * 269) = (17 * a) + (17 * 16b)
= 4573 = 17a + 272b

Adding this to equation (1):

-325 + 4573 = 17a + 272b + a - 17b
4248 = 18a + 255b

Now we solve for a and b using the method of substitution or elimination. However, without doing detailed calculations, we can notice from the given data that for each pair, when x increases by 1, y increases by 19:

(-17, -325), (-16, -306), ..., (16, 269)

So, it's quite clear that b should be 19. Let's confirm it using our equations (1) and (2):

Using equation (2) and substituting b = 19:

269 = a + 16(19)
269 = a + 304
a = 269 - 304
a = -35

Now we've found our coefficients a and b:

a = -35
b = 19

Thus, the function is:

y = -35 + 19x

Therefore, in the form of the equation Output: `y = ax^0 + bx^1` we get:

Output: y = -35x^0 + 19x^1

or simply

Output: y = -35 + 19x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    To deduce the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we should note that ax^0 is a constant term because any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1. Therefore, ax^0 is just a, and bx^1 is simply bx since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself. We're looking for a linear function of the form:

y = a + bx

Given the provided inputs and outputs, we can create a system of linear equations to solve for a and b. Let's use two of the data points to derive the two equations.

Let's use the input-output pair (-17, -325) and (16, 269).
We get the following system:

For x = -17, y = -325:
-325 = a + b(-17) ...(1)

For x = 16, y = 269:
269 = a + b(16) ...(2)

Now let's solve the system of equations. We can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

-Multiply equation (2) by 17 and equation (1) by 16 to eliminate a when we add them:

17(269) = 17a + 17b(16)
16(-325) = 16a - 16b(17)

We get:
4573 = 17a + 272b
-5200 = 16a - 272b

Adding the two equations to eliminate b:
-627 = a

Now that we have a, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for b. Let's substitute into equation (2):

269 = -627 + 16b
269 + 627 = 16b
896 = 16b
b = 56

The linear function that best describes the data is, therefore:

y = 157

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can first simplify the expression to y = a + bx, since x^0 = 1 for any x that is not 0.

Given that the function is linear and we have multiple inputs and outputs, we can solve for a and b by using any pair of input-output points to form a system of equations. Let's use the input-output pairs (-17, -325) and (16, 269):

1) Using the point (-17, -325):
-325 = a + b(-17)
-325 = a - 17b

2) Using the point (16, 269):
269 = a + b(16)
269 = a + 16b

We now have a system of two linear equations:
a - 17b = -325
a + 16b = 269

Let's solve for a and b by using the method of elimination. We will add the two equations together to eliminate a:

(a - 17b) + (a + 16b) = -325 + 269
2a - b = -56

Now we solve for b:

b = 2a + 56

We need one more equation to find a particular solution. Let's use one of the original equations again. Substituting b back into the equation a + 16b = 269:

a + 16(2a + 56) = 269
a + 32a + 896 = 269
33a = 269 - 896
33a = -627
a = -627 / 33
a = -19

Now that we have a, we can find b:

b = 2(-19) + 56
b = -38 + 56
b = 18

Therefore, the function that fits the given points is:

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to determine the coefficients a and b.

The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx, since any number (except zero) to the power of zero is one.

We now need to find the values of a and b that will give us the right output for each input. We can use two pairs of input-output values to set up two equations and solve for a and b.

Let's use the pairs (-17, -325) and (16, 269) to set up the equations:

1. Using input -17 and output -325:
-325 = a + b(-17)
-325 = a - 17b

2. Using input 16 and output 269:
269 = a + b(16)
269 = a + 16b

Now we have a system of equations:

a - 17b = -325
a + 16b = 269

Let's solve this system by adding the two equations together:

( a - 17b ) + ( a + 16b ) = ( -325 ) + ( 269 )
2a - b = -56

We can now express b in terms of a:

b = 2a + 56

We still need the value of a. We can substitute the expression for b back into one of the original equations to solve for a. Let's substitute b into the second equation:

a + 16b = 269
a + 16(2a + 56) = 269
a + 32a + 896 = 269
33a = 269 - 896
33a = -627
a = -627 / 33
a = -19

Now that we have a, we can solve for b:

b = 2(-19) + 56
b = -38 + 56
b = 18

Let's analyze the given input-output pairs to determine the values of a and b:

1. For input 10, output 142:  
   142 = a + 10b

2. For input 15, output 217:

   -68 = a - 4b

5. For input 13, output 187:  
   187 = a + 13b

We have a system of linear equations, and we need to solve for a and b. We can solve this system using various methods, such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. I will demonstrate the use of elimination:

From the first and third equations:

(142) = a + 10b  
(-158) = a - 10b
-----------------
300 = 20b
b = 15

Now we know b, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find a. Using the first equation:

142 = a + 10(15)  
142 = a + 150  
a = 142 - 150  
a = -8

So, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

2) (15, 217)
3) (-10, -158)
4) (-4, -68)

For input 10, output 142:
142 = a + b(10) ... [Equation 1]

For input 15, output 217:
217 = a + b(15) ... [Equation 2]

Now let's do the subtraction (Equation 2 - Equation 1) to eliminate a and solve for b:
217 - 142 = a + 15b - (a + 10b)
75 = 5b
b = 15

Now we can substitute b back into Equation 1 to solve for a:
142 = a + (15)(10)
142 = a + 150
a = 142 - 150
a = -8

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to create a system of linear equations to solve for a and b.

Taking input 10 with output 142:

    142 = a + b(10)    (Equation 1)

Taking input -10 with output -158:

From the first point (10, 142), we have:

We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) by adding these two equations together:

\( 142 + (-158) = a + 10b + a - 10b \)

From this, solving for \( a \) gives us:

For input -1 (x = -1), output is -8 (y = -8)
For input 5 (x = 5), output is 76 (y = 76)

Using the first point in the function: -8 = a + b(-1) => -8 = a - b
Using the second point in the function: 76 = a + b(5) => 76 = a + 5b

We have a system of two equations:

76 = 6b - 8
76 + 8 = 6b

Since we have a linear function, we need to find the values of a and b that allow the function to match the given input-output pairs. We can do this by setting up two equations using two of the input-output pairs and then solving for a and b.

Let's use the inputs and outputs for x = -1 and x = 5:

For x = -1, y = -8:
-8 = a + b(-1)           (1)

So the function we are trying to construct is:

\[ b = 14 \]

Now that we have \( b \), we can use equation (4) to solve for \( a \):
\[ a = -8 + 14 \]
\[ a = 6 \]

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
\[ y = 6 + 14x \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we can note that \(ax^0\) is the same as \(a\) since anything to the power of 0 is 1. Simplifying this, we get:

\(y = a + bx\)

We can use any two pairs of input-output to find \(a\) and \(b\). Let's use the following two points: (-1, -8) and (5, 76).

For the first point (-1, -8), we substitute \(x = -1\) and \(y = -8\):

\(-8 = a + b(-1)\)
\(-8 = a - b\) ... (1)

For the second point (5, 76), we substitute \(x = 5\) and \(y = 76\):

\(76 = a + b(5)\)
\(76 = a + 5b\) ... (2)

Now, we have a system of two linear equations:

\(a - b = -8\) ... (1)
\(a + 5b = 76\) ... (2)

We can solve this system by adding the two equations together:

\(a - b + a + 5b = -8 + 76\)
\(2a + 4b = 68\)
\(\frac{1}{2}(2a + 4b) = \frac{1}{2}(68)\)
\(a + 2b = 34\) ... (3)

Next, we solve equation (1) for \(a\) by adding \(b\) on both sides:

\(a = b - 8\) ... (4)

Now, let's substitute expression (4) into equation (3):

\(b - 8 + 2b = 34\)
\(3b = 42\)
\(b = 14\)

Finally, we use \(b = 14\) in equation (4) to find \(a\):

\(a = 14 - 8\)
\(a = 6\)

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between input \(x\) and output \(y\) is:

\(y = 6x^0 + 14x^1\)

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we first simplify the expression to \(y = a + bx\), since \(x^0 = 1\) for all x except for x = 0.

Given the inputs and outputs, we can form a system of equations from two pairs of input and output to solve for \(a\) and \(b\).

Let's choose two pairs from the given data. Here, we'll use inputs -1 and 5:
1. \(y = a + b*(-1)\) when the input is -1 and the output is -8.
2. \(y = a + b*5\) when the input is 5 and the output is 76.

From the first pair, we have:
-8 = a - b  ...(1)

From the second pair, we have:
76 = a + 5b  ...(2)

We can solve this system of equations for \(a\) and \(b\). Adding equations (1) and (2):

-8 + 76 = a - b + a + 5b
68 = 2a + 4b
34 = a + 2b  ...(3)

Then, subtracting equation (1) from equation (3):

34 + 8 = a + 2b + b
42 = a + 3b

Now, we solve equation (1) for \(a\):

a = b - 8

Substituting \(a\) into equation (3):

34 = (b - 8) + 2b
34 = 3b - 8
42 = 3b
b = 14

Plugging \(b\) back into the equation for \(a\):

a = 14 - 8
a = 6

    To create a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we recognize that ax^0 is always a because x^0 is always 1 for any x except for x=0. The bx^1 term simplifies to bx because x^1 is just x. Thus, we're trying to find a linear function of the form:

y = a + bx

Given the data points:

1. When x = 1, y = 2
2. When x = -19, y = 122
3. When x = 17, y = -94
4. When x = 15, y = -82
5. When x = -6, y = 44

We want to find the constants a and b such that our linear function closely fits these data points. To do so, we can use two of the points to set up a system of linear equations and solve for a and b. Let's use the points (1, 2) and (-19, 122):

From (1, 2):
2 = a + b(1)
2 = a + b

From (-19, 122):
122 = a + b(-19)
122 = a - 19b

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. 2 = a + b
2. 122 = a - 19b

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
120 = -20b
b = -6

Using the value of b in the first equation:
2 = a - 6

Now solving for a:
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

Therefore, the function is:
y = 8 - 6x

Check against the provided data points to ensure the function fits well:
- When x = 1, y = 8 - 6(1) = 2 (matches the given output)
- When x = -19, y = 8 - 6(-19) = 8 + 114 = 122 (matches the given output)

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data points, we have to find the values of 'a' and 'b'. This form is essentially a linear equation y = a + bx, where x^0 is always 1, hence the constant term is a and the coefficient of x^1 is b.

Let's use two data points to solve for a and b:

Choosing the points (1, 2) and (-19, 122):

From the point (1, 2):
2 = a*1^0 + b*1
2 = a + b  ...(1)

From the point (-19, 122):

a = 2 - b

Substitute the value of a from (1) into (2):
122 = (2 - b) - 19b

    Given the function form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we have y = a + bx, since x^0 = 1 for any x value (except for x = 0).

Using the input 1 and its output 2:
2 = a + b(1)
2 = a + b  ... (Equation 1)

Using the input -19 and its output 122:
122 = a + b(-19)

Now we can solve the system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Substitute a into Equation 2:

    The function you are asking for appears to be a linear function, given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx, because x^0 is equal to 1 for any x ≠ 0. In this format, 'a' represents the y-intercept and 'b' reflects the slope of the line.

We can find 'a' and 'b' by setting up a system of equations using the given input-output pairs. However, because we have more than two points, this system would typically be overdetermined. Instead, we'll use two of the points to solve for 'a' and 'b', then check if these values work for the other points to confirm whether the relationship is indeed linear.

Let's use the points (1, 2) and (-19, 122):

From the point (1, 2):
2 = a + b(1)
2 = a + b  ...(1)

From the point (-19, 122):
122 = a + b(-19)
122 = a - 19b  ...(2)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate 'a', we get:

122 - 2 = a - 19b - (a + b)
120 = -20b
b = -6

Then we can use either equation to solve for 'a'. Using equation (1):

2 = a + b
2 = a - 6
a = 8

    To find the coefficients `a` and `b` for the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is equivalent to y = a + bx (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), we need to determine the pattern from the given inputs and outputs.

Because the function is a straight line, we can use two data points to determine the coefficients. We'll use the first two data points for this:

1. When the input `x` is 1, the output `y` is 2.
2. When the input `x` is -19, the output `y` is 122.

Let's set up two equations based on these data points:

For input 1: 
2 = a + b(1) 
2 = a + b

For input -19:
122 = a + b(-19) 
122 = a - 19b

We can solve this system of equations to find `a` and `b`. First, we'll use the elimination method to eliminate `a` and find `b`:

(122 = a - 19b) - (2 = a + b) yields
120 = -20b
b = -6

Now, we'll substitute `b` back into one of the equations to find `a`:

2 = a + b(1)
2 = a - 6

Thus, a = 2 + 6
a = 8

Therefore, substituting the coefficients back into the original function form gives us:

Therefore, ax^0 is equivalent to a (where a is a constant). The term bx^1 is just bx because x^1 is simply x. Therefore, we can simplify the function to y = a + bx.

Now, let's solve for a and b using the given data points. Since we have multiple points, we can use two of them to set up a system of linear equations. Let's use the data points (-17, -292) and (1, 14).

First, plugging in x = -17 and y = -292:

-292 = a + b(-17)     (1)

Next, plugging in x = 1 and y = 14:

14 = a + b(1)         (2)

Now we have the system of equations:

-292 = a - 17b
14 = a + b

To solve for a and b, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

-292 - 14 = a - 17b - (a + b)
-306 = -18b

Now, we can solve for b:

b = -306 / -18

Point 1 (x1, y1): (-17, -292)

The given data suggests that the b coefficient (the rate of change of y with respect to x) is fairly consistent because the y values seem to change by a constant amount for each change in x.

If we analyze two points, such as (1, 14) and (-6, -105), we can solve for b:

Using the point (1, 14):
y = a + b*1 --> 14 = a + b

Using the point (-6, -105):
y = a + b*(-6) --> -105 = a - 6b

We can set up a system of equations:

(1) 14 = a + b
(2) -105 = a - 6b

Now, we can solve these equations for a and b. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) gives us:

(1) 14 = a + b
(-2) 105 = -a + 6b
----------------------------
119 = 7b

Divide both sides by 7 to find b:

b = 119 / 7
b = 17

Now we can use the b value to find a by plugging it into one of the original equations:

Now we substitute this expression for 'a' into Equation 2 to solve for 'b':

(14 - b) - 17b = -292
14 - b - 17b = -292
14 - 18b = -292
-18b = -292 - 14
-18b = -306
b = 17

Now we can substitute 'b' back into Equation 1 to find 'a':

a + 17 = 14
a = 14 - 17
a = -3

With 'a' and 'b' now known, our function in the form y = a + bx is:

y = -3 + 17x

We should check the equation with the other provided data points to ensure that the coefficients are valid:

For input -6:
y = -3 + 17(-6)
y = -3 - 102
y = -105 (matches the provided output)

For input -16:
y = -3 + 17(-16)

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to recognize that ax^0 is equivalent to a, since any number to the zero power is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We will use two data points to solve for a and b.

Let's use the inputs and outputs of x = -7, y = 130 and x = 14, y = -290. We get the following two equations:

1) 130 = a + b(-7)
2) -290 = a + b(14)

Now, let's solve the system of equations for a and b:

From equation 1:
130 = a - 7b
a = 130 + 7b  -- (3)

Substitute equation (3) into equation 2:
-290 = 130 + 7b + 14b
-290 = 130 + 21b
-420 = 21b
b = -420 / 21
b = -20

Now using equation (3) to solve for a:
a = 130 + 7(-20)
a = 130 - 140
a = -10

So the function that describes this relationship is:
y = -10 + (-20)x
y = -10 - 20x

Therefore, in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, the function is:
y = -10x^0 - 20x^1

    To write the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the coefficients a and b such that when we input x into the function, we get the corresponding y output.

In this form, ax^0 is simply a, because any non-zero number to the power of zero is 1. So, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

With two pairs of inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations to solve for a and b.

Let's use the inputs and outputs (-7, 130) and (14, -290) for this purpose.

For the input -7:
130 = a + b(-7)

For the input 14:
-290 = a + b(14)

Now let's set up the system of equations:
1) 130 = a - 7b
2) -290 = a + 14b

Let's multiply equation 1 by 2 to eliminate a:
2 * 130 = 2a - 14b
260 = 2a - 14b

Now add this to equation 2:
260 = 2a - 14b
-290 = a + 14b
------------------
-30 = 3a

Now we can solve for a:
a = -30 / 3
a = -10

Now use the value of a to solve for b in either equation 1 or 2. Using equation 1:
130 = -10 - 7b
140 = -7b
b = 140 / -7
b = -20

Having found a and b, we can write the function:
y = ax^0 + bx
y = (-10)x^0 - 20x
y = -10 - 20x

This function seems to work with the provided input-output pairs, but in practice, to confirm this formula is correct, we would need to test it against all provided data points:

For input -7:
y = -10 - 20(-7)
y = -10 + 140
y = 130 → matches the given output

For input 14:

y = -10 - 280
y = -290 → matches the given output

We now confirm this with the rest of the data points:

For input -12:
y = -10 - 20(-12)
y = -10 + 240
y = 230 → matches the given output

For input 16 (twice, assuming no variation):
y = -10 - 20(16)
y = -10 - 320
y = -330 → matches the given output

Since the function matches all given data points, the function in the desired form is:

y = -10 - 20x

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify it to y = a + bx, as x^0 = 1 for any x ≠ 0. To find the coefficients a and b, we will use two of the given input-output pairs and solve the system of linear equations.

Let's use the input-output pairs (x1, y1) = (-7, 130) and (x2, y2) = (14, -290).

We end up with two equations:
1) 130 = a + b(-7)
2) -290 = a + b(14)

Now we solve this system of equations for a and b:

Solving equation 1):
130 = a - 7b
=> a = 130 + 7b (equation 3)

Now, plug the value of a from equation 3 into equation 2):
-290 = (130 + 7b) + 14b
-290 = 130 + 21b
-420 = 21b
b = -420 / 21
b = -20

Now that we have b, we substitute it back into equation 3 to find a:
a = 130 + 7(-20)
a = 130 - 140
a = -10

So the function that describes the relationship between the input and output is:
y = -10 + (-20)x

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \) given the data points.

Since \( x^0 \) is always 1, our function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We can use two points from the given data to find \( a \) and \( b \). Let's take the points (-7, 130) and (14, -290).

For the point (-7, 130), we plug the values into the function:
\( 130 = a + b(-7)   \),
\( 130 = a - 7b     \) (Equation 1).

For the point (14, -290), we plug the values into the function:
\( -290 = a + b(14) \),
\( -290 = a + 14b   \) (Equation 2).

Now, we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns. Let's solve this system.

By subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2, we get:
\( -290 - 130 = a + 14b - (a - 7b) \),
\( -420 = a + 14b - a + 7b \),
\( -420 = 21b \),
\( b = -420 / 21 \),
\( b = -20 \).

Now that we've found \( b \), we can use it to find \( a \) using either Equation 1 or 2. Let's use Equation 1:

\( 130 = a - 7(-20) \),
\( 130 = a + 140 \),
\( a = 130 - 140 \),
\( a = -10 \).

So, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Let's analyze the given data points:

When input (x) is -7, output (y) is 130:
1. y = a*(-7)^0 + b*(-7)^1
130 = a*1 - 7b
130 = a - 7b ...(1)

When input (x) is 14, output (y) is -290:
2. y = a*(14)^0 + b*(14)^1
-290 = a*1 + 14b
-290 = a + 14b ...(2)

When input (x) is -12, output (y) is 230:
3. y = a*(-12)^0 + b*(-12)^1
230 = a*1 - 12b
230 = a - 12b ...(3)

When input (x) is 16, output (y) is -330 (we will use only one of the (16, -330) points because they are identical):
4. y = a*(16)^0 + b*(16)^1
-330 = a*1 + 16b
-330 = a + 16b ...(4)

Now, let's solve the system of equations to find the values of a and b.

From equations (1) and (2), we have:
130 = a - 7b ...(1)
-290 = a + 14b ...(2)

Adding equation (1) to equation (2), we get:
130 - 290 = (a - 7b) + (a + 14b)
-160 = 2a + 7b
We can simplify this to find the value of a:
2a = -160 - 7b
a = -80 - 3.5b ...(5)

Substituting equation (5) into equation (1), we can find the value of b:
130 = (-80 - 3.5b) - 7b
130 = -80 - 10.5b
10.5b = -80 - 130
10.5b = -210
b = -210 / 10.5
b = -20

Using the value of b to find a from equation (5):
a = -80 - 3.5*(-20)
a = -80 + 70
a = -10

Now we have the values of a and b, so we can write the function:
y = ax^0 + bx^1

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can treat it as a linear equation of the form \( y = a + bx \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants that we need to solve for.

Given the inputs and outputs, we can create the following system of equations:

1. When \( x = -14 \), \( y = -97 \):
\[ -97 = a + b(-14) \]

2. When \( x = 7 \), \( y = 50 \):
\[ 50 = a + b(7) \]

3. When \( x = 2 \), \( y = 15 \):
\[ 15 = a + b(2) \]

We can see that equation 1 and 2 are sufficient to find \( a \) and \( b \) because they give us two separate equations with two unknowns. We can ignore equation 3 for now, as it should be satisfied if determined correctly based on the other two points.

Let's solve the system of equations using equations 1 and 2. We have:

\[ -97 = a - 14b \]
\[ 50 = a + 7b \]

We can solve this system by adding these two equations to eliminate \( a \):

\[ (-97) + 50 = (a - 14b) + (a + 7b) \]
\[ -47 = 2a - 7b \]

Now let's solve for \( a \):

\[ 2a = -47 + 7b \]
\[ a = \frac{-47}{2} + \frac{7b}{2} \]

Plug the value of \( a \) into one of the original equations to find \( b \):

\[ 50 = \frac{-47}{2} + \frac{7b}{2} + 7b \]
\[ 100 = -47 + 7b + 14b \]
\[ 100 = -47 + 21b \]
\[ 147 = 21b \]
\[ b = 7 \]

Plug the value of \( b \) back into the equation for \( a \):

\[ a = \frac{-47}{2} + \frac{7b}{2} \]
\[ a = \frac{-47}{2} + \frac{49}{2} \]
\[ a = \frac{2}{2} \]
\[ a = 1 \]

    To find a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that make the equation true for each given input-output pair. The term \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, the function is effectively of the form \( y = a + bx \).

We have the following pairs of input (x) and output (y):
- \( x = -14, y = -97 \)
- \( x = 7, y = 50 \)
- \( x = 2, y = 15 \)

To find the values of \( a \) and \( b \), we can use two input-output pairs to set up a system of equations. Let's use the pairs \( (-14, -97) \) and \( (2, 15) \).

Using the pair \( x = -14, y = -97 \):
\[ -97 = a + b(-14) \]
\[ -97 = a - 14b \]
\[ a = -97 + 14b \] (Equation 1)

Using the pair \( x = 2, y = 15 \):
\[ 15 = a + b(2) \]
\[ 15 = a + 2b \] (Equation 2)

Now, we need to solve this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \). One way to solve the system is by substitution. We can solve Equation 1 for \( a \) and substitute it into Equation 2:

Substitute \( a \) from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\[ 15 = (-97 + 14b) + 2b \]
\[ 15 = -97 + 14b + 2b \]
\[ 15 = -97 + 16b \]
\[ 97 + 15 = 16b \]
\[ 112 = 16b \]
\[ b = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( a \) by substituting \( b = 7 \) back into Equation 1:
\[ a = -97 + 14b \]
\[ a = -97 + 14(7) \]
\[ a = -97 + 98 \]
\[ a = 1 \]

Using the input-output pairs (7, 50) and (2, 15):

For input 7:

Solve for b:

b = 35 / 5

Solving the system, we add (1) and (2):

\( -26 - (-14) = (a + 5b) - (a + b) \)
\( -12 = 4b \)
\( b = -3 \)

Now use the value of \(b\) in Equation 2 to find \(a\):
\( -14 = a + 1(-3) \)
\( -14 = a - 3 \)
\( a = -11 \)

So the function that fits the data is:
\(y = -11 + (-3)x\)
Or simply:
\(y = -11 - 3x\)

    The given form of the function is a linear equation, y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx, because any number to the power of zero equals one (x^0 = 1) and any number to the power of one is the number itself (x^1 = x).

Given the pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y):

1. When x = 5, y = -26
2. When x = 1, y = -14
3. When x = -14, y = 31
4. When x = -5, y = 4
5. When x = -8, y = 13

We’ll use two of these pairs to form a system of linear equations and solve for a and b.

Let's use the pairs (5, -26) and (1, -14):

1. -26 = a + b(5)
2. -14 = a + b(1)

From the second equation, we can express 'a' as follows:
a = -14 - b

Now we can substitute 'a' into the first equation:

-26 = (-14 - b) + 5b
-26 = -14 + 4b
-12 = 4b
b = -3

Then substitute 'b' into the expression for 'a':

a = -14 - (-3)
a = -14 + 3
a = -11

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -11 + (-3)x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of a and b.

Let's organize the given points (x, y):

1. (5, -26)
2. (1, -14)
3. (-14, 31)
4. (-5, 4)
5. (-8, 13)

The function y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is 1 for all x ≠ 0. Essentially, we are looking for a line with the equation y = a + bx where 'a' is the y-intercept and 'b' is the slope.

To find 'a' and 'b', we would typically solve a system of linear equations based on our inputs and outputs. However, with five points given, the system could be overdetermined and might not have a solution if the points do not all lie on the same line. To find the best-fit line, we should use a method like least squares regression. But for the sake of this task, let's check if a linear equation could fit the data exactly by using two points and solving for 'a' and 'b'.

Using points (5, -26) and (1, -14), we can set up the following two equations:

-26 = a + 5b
-14 = a + 1b

Let's solve for 'a' and 'b' using these two equations.

From the second equation, we can express a as:
a = -14 - b

Substitute this into the first equation:
-26 = (-14 - b) + 5b
-26 = -14 + 4b
-12 = 4b
b = -3

Now we can substitute b into the expression for a:
a = -14 - (-3)
a = -14 + 3
a = -11

So our tentative function is:
y = -11 + (-3)x
y = -11 - 3x

However, this function does need to be verified against all 5 points to ensure it fits:

For x = 5:
y = -11 - 3(5) = -11 - 15 = -26 ✓

For x = 1:
y = -11 - 3(1) = -11 - 3 = -14 ✓

For x = -14,
y = -11 - 3(-14) = -11 + 42 = 31 ✓

For x = -5,
y = -11 - 3(-5) = -11 + 15 = 4 ✓

For x = -8,
y = -11 - 3(-8) = -11 + 24 = 13 ✓

The function fits all given points. Thus, the correct function describing the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we replace y with the output, x with the input, a and b are the constants we want to find. This is essentially the equation of a line, where ax^0 is the y-intercept (since x^0 is always 1) and bx^1 (or simply bx) is the slope of the line.

The equation simplifies to:

y = a + bx

To determine the values for a (the y-intercept) and b (the slope), we can use two data points to formulate two simultaneous equations and then solve for a and b.

Let's choose the inputs and outputs (5, -26) and (1, -14):

1) For the input of 5:
-26 = a + b(5)

2) For the input of 1:
-14 = a + b

Let's solve equation 2 for a:
a = -14 - b

Substitute a in equation 1:
-26 = (-14 - b) + 5b
-26 = -14 + 4b
-12 = 4b
b = -3

Now we substitute b back into the equation for a:
a = -14 - (-3)
a = -14 + 3
a = -11

    To determine the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we'll first use the given pairs of inputs and outputs to create a system of linear equations. The function should be in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\), since \(x^0 = 1\) for any x value that isn't zero.

Given this, we will substitute the inputs and outputs into the equation \(y = a + bx\) and solve for a and b.

Using the input-output pairs (5, -26) and (1, -14):
For the input 5 and output -26:
-26 = a + 5b    --- (1)

For the input 1 and output -14:
-14 = a + 1b    --- (2)

Now, let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to solve for b:
-26 - (-14) = (a + 5b) - (a + 1b)
-12 = 4b

Solving for b gives us:
b = -3

Now that we have the value for b, we can substitute it back into equation (2) to find a:
-14 = a - 3
a = -11

The relationship between inputs and outputs can therefore be described by the function:
y = -11 + -3x

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the given data points, we first recognize that ax^0 is a constant term (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1). The equation we are looking at is therefore a linear equation of the form:

y = a + bx

where y is the output, x is the input, a is the y-intercept, and b is the slope of the line.

Given that we have multiple data points, we can attempt to solve for a and b using two points and then check if the solution fits all the data.

Let's take the first two data points (-9, 64) and (-3, 22) to create a system of linear equations.

For the first point (-9, 64):
64 = a - 9b         (1)

For the second point (-3, 22):
22 = a - 3b         (2)

Now we'll solve for a and b using these two equations. Subtracting Equation (2) from Equation (1) to eliminate a gives:

64 - 22 = a - 9b - (a - 3b)
42 = -6b
b = -7

Now we can substitute b back into Equation (2) to solve for a:

22 = a - 3(-7)
22 = a + 21
a = 1

    To determine the coefficients of the function in the given form `y = ax^0 + bx^1` which is equivalent to `y = a + bx` (since `x^0 = 1` for any `x` that is not zero), we can use two of the given input-output pairs to solve for `a` and `b`.

Let's use the first two input-output pairs to formulate a system of linear equations.

For input -9, output 64:
64 = a + b(-9)

22 = a + b(-3)

We have a system of two equations:
1) 64 = a - 9b
2) 22 = a - 3b

Now we can solve this system for `a` and `b`. Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate `a` and solve for `b`:

64 - 22 = a - 9b - (a - 3b)
42 = -6b
b = -7

Now that we have `b`, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to find `a`. We'll use the second:

1. \( 64 = a + b(-9) \)
2. \( 22 = a + b(-3) \)

This results in a system of equations:

1. \( 64 = a - 9b \)
2. \( 22 = a - 3b \)

Now, we need to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). One way to do this is by solving one equation for \( a \) and then substituting it into the other equation. Let's solve Equation 2 for \( a \):

\[ a = 22 + 3b \]

Substitute this expression for \( a \) into Equation 1:

\[ 64 = 22 - 6b \]

Given the format y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify this to y = a + bx, because x^0 is always 1.

Let's choose two input-output pairs to create the system of equations. I'll use the pairs (-20, 265) and (6, -99). This gives us:

For input -20:
265 = a + b(-20)

For input 6:
-99 = a + b(6)

Now we have two equations:

1) 265 = a - 20b
2) -99 = a + 6b

We can solve this system of equations using elimination or substitution. I'll use elimination:

Multiply equation 2 by 20 and add it to equation 1:

(-99 * 20) = 20a + (6 * 20)b
-1980 = 20a + 120b

Now, add equation 1 to this result:

265 = a - 20b
-1980 = 20a + 120b
---------------------
-1715 = 21a + 100b
-1715 - 265 = 21a + 100b - a + 20b
-1980 = 20a + 120b

From equation 2:

20a + 120b = -1980

We need to isolate either a or b. Let's isolate a:

20a = -1980 - 120b
a = (-1980 - 120b) / 20
a = -99 - 6b

Now plug this expression for a into equation 1:

265 = (-99 - 6b) - 20b
265 = -99 - 26b
265 + 99 = -26b

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to recognize that ax^0 is a constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is a linear term (since x to the power of 1 is just x). We can think of it as y = a + bx, where a is the constant term and b is the coefficient of the linear term.

Given the data points:
(-20, 265), (-15, 195), (-5, 55), (-10, 125), (6, -99)

We can use any two of these points to solve for a and b. However, because we need a function that describes as many of these points as possible, it's better to find a pattern or use a method that considers all points, such as the method of least squares. Without going into the complexity of least squares (which is generally out of the scope of a simple pattern recognition response), let's attempt to discern a pattern.

By doing quick mental calculations, we can see that the output increases as the input goes from -20 to -5, and then the output decreases from -5 to 6. It suggests that there may be a turning point between those inputs, indicating a non-linear relationship that we cannot capture with a function in the form y = a + bx. However, let's ignore this and proceed to visually inspect the linear relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Let's use two points to find a tentative linear pattern:
Using points (-20, 265) and (-5, 55):
Let's calculate the slope (b):
b = (Output2 - Output1) / (Input2 - Input1)
b = (55 - 265) / (-5 - (-20))
b = (-210) / (15)
b = -14

Next, let's plug one of the points into the y = a + bx equation to solve for a:
265 = a + (-14)(-20)
265 = a + 280
a = 265 - 280
a = -15

So, tentatively, our function would be:
y = -15 + (-14)x

However, let's quickly check this equation with the other points provided:
For input -15:
y = -15 - 14(-15) = -15 + 210 = 195. This fits the data point.

For input -10:
y = -15 - 14(-10) = -15 + 140 = 125. This fits the data point, as well.

But let's check the other outlier:
For input 6:
y = -15 - 14(6) = -15 - 84 = -99. Surprisingly, this fits the data point as well.

So, unless this is a coincidence and the real relationship is non-linear which requires higher-order terms, the tentative linear function that describes the data provided would be:
y = -15 - 14x

Our linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 would then be:

    Given the form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can identify this as a linear function where ax^0 represents the y-intercept (since x^0 = 1 for any value of x) and bx^1 represents the slope multiplied by the x-value. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can determine the coefficients a and b by using two of the provided data points to create a system of equations:

Let's use the data points (-20, 265) and (-5, 55).

For the input -20 (x = -20) with the output 265 (y = 265):
265 = a + b(-20) ... [Equation 1]

For the input -5 (x = -5) with the output 55 (y = 55):
55 = a + b(-5) ... [Equation 2]

Next, we solve this system of equations. Let's multiply Equation 2 by 4 so we can eliminate variable a by adding it to Equation 1:

220 = 4a + 4b(-5)
265 = a + b(-20)

Add the two equations:

220 + 265 = 4a + a + 4b(-5) + b(-20)
485 = 5a - 20b - 20b
485 = 5a - 40b

Now divide by 5:

97 = a - 8b

Now, we isolate variable a using Equation 2:

55 = a + b(-5)
55 = a - 5b

We have two new equations:

97 = a - 8b ... [Equation 3]
55 = a - 5b ... [Equation 4]

Subtract Equation 4 from Equation 3:

97 - 55 = (a - 8b) - (a - 5b)
42 = - 3b

So we solve for b:

b = -42 / 3
b = -14

Now we can plug the value of b back into Equation 4 to solve for a:

55 = a - 5(-14)
55 = a + 70
a = 55 - 70
a = -15

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -15 + (-14)x

or simply:

y = -15 - 14x

    ","To find the output for the input -7 using the derived function y = -15 - 14x, we substitute x with -7:

y = 83

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs provided, we notice that x^0 is always 1, so we can simplify the equation to:

y = a + bx

where a and b are constants that we need to find. We can use two data points to solve for a and b.

Let's use the following two points (x1, y1) = (-20, 265) and (x2, y2) = (6, -99):

For the point (-20, 265):
265 = a + b(-20)

For the point (6, -99):
-99 = a + b(6)

We now have a system of linear equations:
1) a - 20b = 265
2) a + 6b = -99

We can solve this system using methods like substitution or elimination. I'll use elimination here:

Multiply equation (2) by 20 to use the elimination method with equation (1):

20a + 120b = -1980

Now add this to equation (1):

a - 20b = 265
(20a + 120b) + (a - 20b) = -1980 + 265

21a + 100b = -1715

Divide through by 21 to solve for a:

a + 100b/21 = -1715 / 21

a = -1715/21 - 100b/21

Now, let's substitute a in equation (2):

-1715/21 - 100b/21 + 6b = -99
-1715 + 6 * 21b - 100b = -99 * 21
-1715 + 126b - 100b = -2079

Combine like terms:

26b = -2079 + 1715
26b = -364

Divide by 26 to solve for b:

b = -364 / 26
b = -14

Now, let's put the value of b back into our first equation to solve for a:

a - 20(-14) = 265
a + 280 = 265
a = 265 - 280
a = -15

Therefore, the function we are looking for is:

y = -15 + (-14)x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's first recognize that ax^0 is just a since anything raised to the zeroth power is 1. Hence the function simplifies to y = a + bx. 

We can use two data points to solve for a and b. Let's use the following two pairs of inputs and outputs:

Input: -20, Output: 265
Input: 6, Output: -99

For the first pair, if we substitute -20 for x and 265 for y we get:
265 = a - 20b (1)

For the second pair, if we substitute 6 for x and -99 for y we get:
-99 = a + 6b (2)

Now we have a system of two equations that we can solve simultaneously to find a and b. Let's perform the subtraction of equation (2) from equation (1):

(265 = a - 20b) - (-99 = a + 6b)
265 - (-99) = (a - a) + (-20b - 6b)
364 = -26b

Now, solve for b:
b = -364 / 26
b = -14

We can then substitute b back into either equation (1) or (2) to find a. Let's use equation (1):

265 = a - 20(-14)
265 = a + 280
a = 265 - 280
a = -15

So the function describing the relationship is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for all x ≠ 0, we need to solve for the constants a and b based on the data provided.

Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to set up a system of equations:

Using Input: -10 and Output: -54, we have:
-54 = a + b(-10)  =>  -54 = a - 10b  =>  Equation 1

Using Input: 4 and Output: 2, we have:
2 = a + b(4)  =>  2 = a + 4b  =>  Equation 2

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

Equation 1: a - 10b = -54
Equation 2: a +  4b =   2

We can solve this system of equations using methods such as substitution or elimination. I'll use the elimination method:

Equation 3 (Multiply Equation 2 by 2.5 to align a's with Equation 1):
2.5( a + 4b = 2 ) => 2.5a + 10b = 5

Now add Equation 1 and Equation 3:
a - 10b = -54
2.5a + 10b = 5
-----------------
3.5a = -49

Now divide both sides of the equation by 3.5 to solve for a:
a = -49 / 3.5
a = -14

With the value of a found, we now substitute it into Equation 2 to find b:

a + 4b = 2
-14 + 4b = 2
4b = 2 + 14
4b = 16
b = 16 / 4
b = 4

So the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -14x^0 + 4x^1
y = -14 + 4x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, which simplifies to `y = a + bx` since `x^0` equals 1 for any x except for x = 0, we would need to solve for `a` and `b` using the given inputs and outputs. We can set up a system of equations using the data points provided:

For Input: -10, Output: -54
-54 = a + b(-10)

For Input: 4, Output: 2
2 = a + b(4)

For Input: -20, Output: -94
-94 = a + b(-20)

For Input: -4, Output: -30
-30 = a + b(-4)

Given that we have four data points (although one is repeated) and only two unknowns, this system is overdetermined. However, since two of the data points are the same, we effectively have three unique data points. We can still try to solve for `a` and `b`.

Taking two of the unique equations:

1. -54 = a - 10b
2. 2 = a + 4b

We can solve these equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply equation 2 by 2.5 to make the coefficients of `a` the same (2.5 * 2 = 5, which is half of -54 when multiplied by the same factor):

2.5(2) = 2.5(a) + 2.5(4b)
5 = 2.5a + 10b

Now add this result to equation 1:

(-54) + (5) = (a) + (2.5a) + (-10b) + (10b)
-49 = 3.5a

Solve for `a`:

a = -49 / 3.5
a = -14

Now substitute `a = -14` back into equation 2:

2 = -14 + 4b
16 = 4b
b = 4

So, we have:

a = -14
b = 4

Thus, the function that fits the given data points is:

y = -14x^0 + 4x^1

Simplifying further:

y = -14 + 4x

Now let's verify this formula with the unique points:

For Input: -10
y = -14 + 4(-10) = -14 - 40 = -54, which matches the given Output.

For Input: 4
y = -14 + 4(4) = -14 + 16 = 2, which matches the given Output.

For Input: -4
y = -14 + 4(-4) = -14 - 16 = -30, which matches the given Output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we must determine the constants 'a' and 'b'. 

This formula is a linear equation, where:

- \( a \) is the y-intercept, the value of y when x is 0.
- \( bx^1 \) indicates that the relationship between x and y is linear, with 'b' being the slope of the line.

Given two unique points, we can solve for 'a' and 'b'. We have multiple points provided, but we can use just two to determine the function since it's linear. Let's use the points (-10, -54) and (4, 2).

Here's the general approach:
- Substitute the first point into the equation to get one equation with 'a' and 'b'.
- Substitute the second point into the equation for a second equation with 'a' and 'b'.
- Solve the system of equations for 'a' and 'b'.

Using the first point (-10, -54):
y = ax^0 + bx^1
-54 = a(1) + b(-10)  -> Equation 1

Using the second point (4, 2):
2 = a(1) + b(4)      -> Equation 2

Let's solve these equations:

Equation 1: -54 = a - 10b
Equation 2: 2 = a + 4b

Now, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. I will use elimination:

Multiply Equation 2 by 2.5 and add to Equation 1 to eliminate 'a':

    To find a function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are essentially looking for a linear relationship where \( ax^0 \) is a constant (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and \( bx^1 \) is just \( bx \) because any number to the power of 1 is itself. Therefore, the equation simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Given the provided inputs and outputs, we can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) by setting up a system of linear equations. However, we only need two distinct points to determine the line. We have multiple instances of inputs with their corresponding outputs, including repetitive ones that should yield the same constants \( a \) and \( b \).

We'll use the following two points to determine our line: (-10, -54) and (4, 2).

For the first point (-10, -54):
\( -54 = a + b(-10) \)
\( -54 = a - 10b \) ... (1)

For the second point (4, 2):
\( 2 = a + 4b \) ... (2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, which we can solve using various methods. One of the simplest is to use the addition method, where we multiply Eq. (2) by a suitable number to make the coefficients of \( b \) in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) opposites. We can multiply Eq. (2) by 2.5 to get:

\( 2 * 2.5 = a * 2.5 + 4b * 2.5 \)
\( 5 = 2.5a + 10b \) ... (3)

Now we can add Eq. (1) and Eq. (3):

\( -54 + 5 = -10b + 10b + (a + 2.5a) \)
\( -49 = 3.5a \)
\( a = \frac{-49}{3.5} \)
\( a = -14 \)

Using the value of \( a \) in Eq. (2):

\( 2 = -14 + 4b \)

- Input: -4, Output: -30 → \(-30 = a + b(-4)\)

Using the two pairs with different input values, we can set up a system of equations to solve for \(a\) and \(b\). Let's use the first and second pair:

1. \(-54 = a - 10b\)
2. \(2 = a + 4b\)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

First, we should multiply the second equation by 2.5 to have a matching coefficient for \(b\), but with opposite signs:
\(2.5(2) = 2.5(a + 4b)\)
\(5 = 2.5a + 10b\)

We can find a and b using two points from the given input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations. Let's use the following two points: (-11, -20) and (-2, -2).

Using the point (-11, -20):
-20 = a + b(-11) -> Equation 1

Using the point (-2, -2):
-2 = a + b(-2) -> Equation 2

Now we have the two equations:
1) a - 11b = -20 
2) a - 2b = -2

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
(1) - (2): (a - 11b) - (a - 2b) = -20 - (-2)
This simplifies to:

a = 2b - 2

Now we substitute a in equation 1 with the expression found in equation 2:

Therefore, the function we are looking for will take the form of a linear equation \( y = a + bx \).

To determine the specific values of 'a' and 'b', we need to find the pattern in the input-output pairs. Let's look at the given data:

\[
\begin{align*}

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

\[

-20 - (-2) &= (a - 11b) - (a - 2b) \\
-18 &= -9b \\
b &= 2

    Let's write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given the data points: (-11, -20), (-8, -14), (-2, -2), (-7, -12), (-17, -32), we can find the coefficients a and b by creating a system of linear equations.

Choose two points to formulate two equations:

Let's use the points (-11, -20) and (-2, -2).

From the point (-11, -20),
-20 = a + b(-11)
-20 = a - 11b ... (1)

From the point (-2, -2),
-2 = a + b(-2)
-2 = a - 2b ... (2)

Now we can solve the system of equations (1) and (2) for a and b.

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
(-20) - (-2) = (a - 11b) - (a - 2b)
-18 = -9b
b = -18 / -9
b = 2

Use the value of b to solve for a:
-2 = a - 2b
-2 = a - 2(2)
-2 = a - 4
a = -2 + 4
a = 2

Now, we can write the function as:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients `a` and `b` for the function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we can use two of the provided input/output pairs.

First, let's clarify the function form:

```
y = ax^0 + bx^1
```
Since `x^0` is 1 for any x (except for x=0), we can simplify the function to:

```
y = a + bx
```

Now, let's take two input/output pairs to form a system of equations. For example, using the pairs (-11, -20) and (-2, -2):

1. `-20 = a + b * -11`
2. `-2 = a + b * -2`

We can solve this system of equations for `a` and `b`. Let's start by solving the second equation for `a`:

`a = -2 - b * -2`
`a = -2 + 2b`

Now, let's substitute this expression for `a` in the first equation:

`-20 = (-2 + 2b) + b * -11`
`-20 = -2 + 2b - 11b`
`-20 = -2 - 9b`

Now, let's solve for `b`:

`9b = -2 + 20`
`9b = 18`
`b = 18 / 9`
`b = 2`

Now that we have `b`, let's find `a`:

`a = -2 + 2b`
`a = -2 + 2 * 2`
`a = -2 + 4`
`a = 2`

So the function that fits the provided data points in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1` is:

```
y = 2x^0 + 2x^1

Simplifying, we get:

```
y = 2 + 2x

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the input-output pairs, we can observe that ax^0 is essentially a constant term (since anything raised to the zero power is 1), and bx^1 is a linear term (since anything raised to the first power is itself). In simpler terms, our function is looking like:

y = a + bx

Let's take two points to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Ideally, we should take points that are not outliers to get a better fit for the data given the simple linear form of the function. We should choose two points that are more spread apart to minimize rounding errors in the calculation. Let's use the inputs -17 and 17 with their corresponding outputs -310 and 302:

For input -17 (output -310):
-310 = a + b(-17)

For input 17 (output 302):
302 = a + 17b

This gives us a system of two linear equations:

1) -310 = a - 17b
2)  302 = a + 17b 

Now we can solve for 'a' and 'b'. Adding both equations cancels out 'b':

-310 + 302 = a - 17b + a + 17b
-8 = 2a
a = -8 / 2
a = -4

Now, plug the value of 'a' into one of the original equations to find 'b'. We'll use equation 2:

302 = -4 + 17b
306 = 17b
b = 306 / 17
b = 18

Thus, our function is:

y = -4 + 18x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to identify the constants a and b that will satisfy the given input-output pairs.

The term ax^0 is simply a, because x^0 is always 1 for any x that is not zero (it's worth noting that in this context we assume x won't be zero because we have no input giving that case). The term bx^1 is bx since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself. Hence, the function should look like this:

y = a + bx

Given the input-output pairs, let's examine the relationship between x and y to determine the constants a and b.

Since this appears to be a linear relationship, we can use any two points to solve for a and b. Let's take the pairs (10, 176) and (12, 212) for simplicity.

For (10, 176):
176 = a + b*10

For (12, 212):
212 = a + b*12

Now we have a system of equations:

1) 176 = a + 10b
2) 212 = a + 12b

Solving the system of equations by subtraction to eliminate a:

(2) - (1) → 212 - 176 = (a + 12b) - (a + 10b)
36 = 2b
b = 18

Now we can substitute b back into either equation to find a. Using equation 1):

176 = a + 10*18
176 = a + 180
a = 176 - 180
a = -4

So the function that relates the inputs to the outputs is:

y = -4 + 18x

    To find a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which is equivalent to y = a + bx because any number to the power of 0 is 1), we need to determine the values of a and b such that the function fits the given input-output pairs as closely as possible.

Since the function is linear, the difference between the outputs for consecutive inputs should be constant if we assume uniform increments. However, since our inputs are not uniformly incremented, we need to find the ratio of change in outputs relative to the change in inputs to determine the slope b.

Let's take two input-output pairs that have equal increments in input (±17 from 0), which could help us determine the slope (b):

For an input of -17, the output is -310.
For an input of 17, the output is 302.

Now, let's calculate the slope (b):

Change in output = output at 17 - output at -17
                = 302 - (-310)
                = 302 + 310
                = 612

Change in input = 17 - (-17)
                = 17 + 17
                = 34

Slope (b) = change in output / change in input
           = 612 / 34
           = 18

We can now use this slope and one of the input-output pairs to find a (the y-intercept). Let's use the input 10 and output 176 to find a:

176 = a + 18 * 10
176 = a + 180

    Given the inputs and outputs, we need to identify the constants `a` and `b` in the function that relates input `x` to output `y` in the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Since x^0 is always 1, this simplifies the function to:

y = a + bx

Now we need to find the values of `a` and `b`. We can do this by setting up a system of equations using the given pairs of inputs and outputs. Let's use the input-output pairs (10, 176) and (17, 302).

For the input 10:
176 = a + b(10)

For the input 17:
302 = a + b(17)

This gives us two equations:
1) 176 = 10b + a
2) 302 = 17b + a

By solving these two equations, we can find `a` and `b`.

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate `a`:
302 - 176 = 17b - 10b
126 = 7b
b = 18

Now that we have `b`, plug it back into either equation to find `a`. Let's use equation 1:
176 = 10(18) + a
176 = 180 + a
a = -4

y = a + bx

We are given pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y). Let's use two pairs to determine 'a' and 'b'. The first pair (-17, -310) and the second pair (17, 302) are good choices for this because they are symmetric with respect to the y-axis, which may simplify the calculations.

Let's set up two equations based on these pairs:

For the first pair, -310 = a + b(-17) (1)
For the second pair, 302 = a + b(17) (2)

If we add these equations together, we can solve for 'a' because the bx terms will cancel each other out:

-310 + 302 = a - 17b + a + 17b
-8 = 2a

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'a':
a = -4

Now we use either Equation (1) or (2) to solve for 'b'. Using Equation (2):

First, let's arrange the provided input/output pairs:

1. For input -16, output is 297: 297 = a - 16b
2. For input 18, output is -315: -315 = a + 18b
3. For input -5, output is 99: 99 = a - 5b
4. For input 5, output is -81: -81 = a + 5b

We have two instances of the same input (-16) with the same output (297), which does not provide additional information, so we will use only one instance of it.

Now, we can use any two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for `a` and `b`. Let's use pairs (1) and (2) to form a system of equations:

297 = a - 16b ... (i)
-315 = a + 18b ... (ii)

By adding these two equations, we can eliminate `a`:

297 + (-315) = (a - 16b) + (a + 18b)
-18 = 2a + 2b
-9 = a + b ... (iii)

Now we can subtract equation (ii) from equation (i) to eliminate `a` again but in a different way:

297 - (-315) = (a - 16b) - (a + 18b)
612 = -34b
b = -18

With the value of `b`, we can now solve for `a` using equation (iii):

We can systematize the process by creating equations for each input-output pair. For the function \(y = a + bx\), the equations are:

1. When \(x = -16\), \(y = 297\):
   \(297 = a + b(-16)\) or \(a - 16b = 297\)

2. When \(x = 18\), \(y = -315\):
   \(-315 = a + b(18)\) or \(a + 18b = -315\)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

\[
\begin{align*}
a - 16b &= 297 \,\,\,\,\, (1) \\
a + 18b &= -315 \,\,\, (2)

To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\), we can solve this system of linear equations. Adding the two equations together will allow us to solve for \(a\):

Adding these two equations together to eliminate `b`, we get:

297 + (-315) = (a - 16b) + (a + 18b)
-18 = 2a + 2b
-9 = a + b ...(3)

Now let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

297 - (-315) = (a - 16b) - (a + 18b)
612 = -34b
b = -18

Now we can use the value of b in equation (3) to solve for a:

-9 = a - 18
a = 9

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 9 - 18x

This is a simplified form, but if you require the exact form you specified (y = ax^0 + bx^1), then it would be:

y = 9x^0 - 18x^1

However, since x^0 is always 1, the function simplifies to y = 9 - 18x, as shown above.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we are essentially looking for a linear relationship since ax^0 is a constant (a) and bx^1 is the input (x) multiplied by a coefficient (b).

Considering that x^0 is always 1 for any x except for x = 0 (by definition, any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1), the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Using two points from the given data, we can find the coefficients a and b. Let's use the following two points: (-18, -265) and (19, 253).

First, set up two equations according to the function y = a + bx, one for each point.

For the point (-18, -265):
-265 = a + b(-18)

For the point (19, 253):
253 = a + b(19)

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (a and b).

-265 = a - 18b
253 = a + 19b

Solve for a and b:

Add the two equations together to eliminate a:
-265 + 253 = a - 18b + a + 19b
-12 = 2a + b
-6 = a + (1/2)b          (Equation 1)

Now subtract the second equation from the first to solve for b:
-265 - 253 = a - 18b - (a + 19b)
-518 = -37b
b = 14

Substitute b into Equation 1 to find a:
-6 = a + (1/2)(14)
-6 = a + 7
a = -13

Thus, the equation that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -13 + 14x

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we will first simplify the equation by acknowledging that x^0 is 1 for any x that isn't zero. Therefore, our function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

To solve for a and b, we can use two of the input-output pairs to set up a system of two linear equations. Use the first two pairs for simplicity:

For input -18, output -265:
-265 = a + b(-18)

For input 19, output 253:
253 = a + b(19)

Now we have the following equations:
1) -265 = a - 18b
2) 253 = a + 19b

We can solve this system for a and b using several methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's use elimination:

Add equation 1) to equation 2). This will eliminate a and allow us to solve for b:
-265 + 253 = (a - 18b) + (a + 19b)
-12 = 2a + b

Now we express b from one of the equations, let's use equation 2):
253 = a + 19b
b = (253 - a) / 19

Substitute the value of b back into the equation we found by adding 1) and 2) together:
-12 = 2a + ((253 - a) / 19)
-12 = 2a + 253/19 - a/19
-12 - 253/19 = a(2 - 1/19)
-12 * 19/19 - 253/19 = a(38/19 - 1/19)
(-228 - 253) / 19 = a * 37/19
-481 / 19 = a * 37/19
-481 / 37 = a
a = -13

Now we'll put the value of a back into the equation for b:
b = (253 - (-13)) / 19
b = (253 + 13) / 19
b = 266 / 19
b = 14

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we recognize that \( ax^0 \) is equivalent to \( a \) because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1, and \( bx^1 \) is just \( bx \) since anything raised to the power of 1 is the number itself.

The function simplifies to:
\[ y = a + bx \]

Given two pairs of inputs and outputs, we can solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Use the two input-output pairs (19, 253) and (-18, -265) to set up a system of equations:
\[ a + 19b = 253 \]
\[ a - 18b = -265 \]

Solving for \( a \) and \( b \) from these equations gives us:
Multiply the second equation by -1 to make the coefficient of \( a \) positive:
\[ -a + 18b = 265 \]

Now add the two equations to eliminate \( a \):
\[ a + 19b = 253 \]
\[ -a + 18b = 265 \]
-------------------------------
\[ 37b = 518 \]

Divide both sides by 37:
\[ b = 518 / 37 \]
\[ b = 14 \]

Now that we have \( b \), substitute it back into one of the equations to solve for \( a \):
\[ a + 19(14) = 253 \]
\[ a + 266 = 253 \]
\[ a = 253 - 266 \]
\[ a = -13 \]

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y), we will first notice that ax^0 is equivalent to a, because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Hence, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Since we have multiple input-output pairs, we can plug in two of them to create a system of equations to solve for the coefficients a and b.

Let's use the input-output pairs (-18, -265) and (19, 253) to form the following equations:

1) For an input of -18:
-265 = a + b(-18)

2) For an input of 19:
253 = a + b(19)

Now we have two equations:
-265 = a - 18b    (Equation 1)
253 = a + 19b     (Equation 2)

Next, we can solve these equations simultaneously. Let's add Equation 1 to Equation 2 to eliminate the variable a:

-265 + 253 = a - 18b + a + 19b
-12 = 2a + b

Now, divide the equation by 2 to solve for a:
-6 = a + 0.5b

Let's keep this result for a reference and subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate 'a' and solve for 'b':

253 + 265 = a + 19b - (a - 18b)
518 = 37b

Divide both sides by 37:
b = 518 / 37
b = 14

Now that we have the value of b, we can use it to find a. Replace b in the equation -6 = a + 0.5b:

-6 = a + 0.5(14)
-6 = a + 7

Subtract 7 from both sides:
a = -6 - 7
a = -13

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we notice that ax^0 is actually a constant (a) since any number to the zeroth power is 1. So, we essentially have a linear function y = a + bx, where a represents the y-intercept and b is the slope of the line.

Let's use two pairs of data points to solve for a and b in the equation. It's convenient to choose pairs that are easy to compute with. In our case, we can use the following points: (-18, -265) and (19, 253).

Let (x1, y1) = (-18, -265) and (x2, y2) = (19, 253).

The slope (b) of the line is computed by the difference in y divided by the difference in x:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (253 - (-265)) / (19 - (-18))
b = (253 + 265) / (19 + 18)
b = 518 / 37
b = 14

Now that we have the slope b, we can plug it back into the equation along with one pair of points to solve for a. Let's use point (19, 253):

253 = a + 14 * 19
253 = a + 266
a = 253 - 266
a = -13

    To write the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the coefficients 'a' and 'b' that will satisfy the given inputs and outputs.

Since ax^0 is always 1 (because any number to the power of 0 is 1), it means that 'a' is a constant term and the function reduces to y = a + bx. Thus, we need to determine the values of 'a' and 'b' that will make the equation true for all given input-output pairs.

One way to determine 'a' and 'b' is by setting up two equations using two different sets of input-output pairs. Let's use the first two pairs (9, 133) and (19, 283):

For input 9 and output 133:
133 = a + b*9    (1)

For input 19 and output 283:
283 = a + b*19   (2)

We can solve this system of equations by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate 'a' and find 'b':

283 - 133 = a + 19b - (a + 9b)
150 = 10b
b = 150 / 10
b = 15

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to consider that ax^0 is equivalent to a since x^0 is 1 for any x.

Hence, the formula can be rewritten as y = a + bx (since ax^0 reduces to just a).

We have several input-output pairs to work with. Let's take two pairs to determine a and b.

Using input 9 and output 133:
133 = a + 9b

Using input -16 and output -242:
-242 = a - 16b

This is a system of linear equations. We can solve for a and b.

To solve for b using this system, we can simplify the equations into the following steps:

From the first equation, express a in terms of b:
a = 133 - 9b

Now substitute this expression for a into the second equation:
-242 = (133 - 9b) - 16b
-242 = 133 - 9b - 16b
-242 = 133 - 25b

Now solve for b:
-25b = -242 - 133
-25b = -375

b = -375 / -25
b = 15

Now insert the value of b back into the equation for a:
a = 133 - 9b
a = 133 - 9(15)
a = 133 - 135
a = -2

So, our function is y = a + bx, where a is -2 and b is 15, which simplifies to:
y = -2 + 15x

Thus, the function in the exact form you requested is:

Output: y = -2x^0 + 15x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the examples provided, it appears that we can determine a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs, which suggests that the output (y) is a linear function of the input (x). A linear function can indeed be expressed in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope.

First, let's observe the provided input-output pairs:

Input (x): 9, Output (y): 133 → (9, 133)
Input (x): 19, Output (y): 283 → (19, 283)
Input (x): 16, Output (y): 238 → (16, 238)
Input (x): -14, Output (y): -212 → (-14, -212)
Input (x): -16, Output (y): -242 → (-16, -242)

By looking at these points, let's first calculate the slope (b). Choose two points to calculate the slope:

Using points (9, 133) and (19, 283), the slope b = (283 - 133) / (19 - 9) = 150 / 10 = 15.

Let's check if the slope of 15 works with another pair to ensure consistency. Using the points (16, 238) and (9, 133):

b = (238 - 133) / (16 - 9) = 105 / 7 = 15.

Since the slope b is consistent, we can confirm that the proposed function is linear.

Next, we need to find the y-intercept (a). Use the slope and one of the points to solve for a:

Let's use point (9, 133) and the slope b = 15.

133 = a * 9^0 + 15 * 9
133 = a + 135
a = 133 - 135
a = -2

Therefore, the function that describes the data provided is:

y = -2 * x^0 + 15 * x^1
or simply
y = -2 + 15x.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the function form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can translate this to y = a + bx, because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1.

We are given a set of inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. When x = 9, y = 133
2. When x = 19, y = 283
3. When x = 16, y = 238
4. When x = -14, y = -212
5. When x = -16, y = -242

Plugging in the first pair of values (x = 9 and y = 133) into the equation y = a + bx gives us:
133 = a + 9b

We can also take another pair to form a second equation. Let's use the pair (x = 19, y = 283):
283 = a + 19b

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:
1. 133 = a + 9b
2. 283 = a + 19b

To solve for a and b, we can use simultaneous equations or a linear algebra approach. Let's use the method of substitution or elimination:

First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate a:

283 - 133 = (a + 19b) - (a + 9b)
150 = 10b

Now we can solve for b:
b = 150 / 10
b = 15

Next, we'll substitute the value of b back into either of the original equations to solve for a. Using the first equation:

133 = a + 9b
133 = a + 9(15)
133 = a + 135
a = 133 - 135
a = -2

Now that we have both a and b, we can write the function as:

y = a + bx
y = -2 + 15x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can observe the linear relationship that is suggested by the term bx^1. The term ax^0 is a constant term (since any value raised to the power of 0 is 1). So, we are essentially looking for a linear function of the form y = a + bx.

We can use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for a and b. Let's take the inputs and outputs (2, 59) and (-5, -81).

For the input 2 (x=2), the output 59 (y=59):
59 = a + 2b ------------ (1)

For the input -5 (x=-5), the output -81 (y=-81):
-81 = a - 5b ----------- (2)

Now we can solve the system of linear equations (1) and (2) to find the values for a and b.

Multiply (2) by 2, we get:
-162 = 2a - 10b ---------- (3)

Now add (1) and (3):
59 + (-162) = (a + 2a) + (2b -10b)
-103 = 3a - 8b
-103 = 3a - 8b ----------- (4)

Now multiply (1) by 5:
295 = 5a + 10b ----------- (5)

Now we add (4) and (5):
295 + (-103) = (5a + 3a) + (10b - 8b)
192 = 8a + 2b

Divide throughout by 2 to get:
96 = 4a + b -------------- (6)

Now we can solve for b using (1) and (6):
59 = a + 2b ------------- (1)
96 = 4a + b ------------- (6)

Multiply (1) by 2:
118 = 2a + 4b ----------- (7)

Subtract (6) from (7):
118 - 96 = (2a - 4a) + (4b - b)
22 = -2a + 3b

Divide throughout by -2 we get:
-11 = a - 1.5b

Now we can solve for b:
b = -11 - a
b = -11 - a / 1.5

From (6), if we solve for a we get:
a = (96 - b) / 4

Inserting the value of b in terms of a:
a = (96 - (-11 - a) / 1.5) / 4

This equation now has only one variable, a. Once we solve for a, we can find b using b = -11 - a.

However, to keep the math simple, let's find a direct method. At this stage, I will directly solve the system of equations (1) and (2) using substitution or elimination.

From equation (2):
a = -81 + 5b

Now substitute a into equation (1):
59 = (-81 + 5b) + 2b
59 = -81 + 7b
140 = 7b
b = 140 / 7
b = 20

Now substitute b back into the equation for a:
a = -81 + 5b
a = -81 + 5(20)
a = -81 + 100
a = 19

So the function is:
y = 19x^0 + 20x^1

y = 19 + 20x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that would generate the given outputs for the specified inputs. The given function is essentially a linear function in the form of \( y = a + bx \), since \( x^0 = 1 \) and \( x^1 = x \).

Given the input-output pairs, we can create the following equations:

1. For input 2: \( 59 = a + 2b \)
2. For input -16: \( -301 = a - 16b \)
3. For input -5: \( -81 = a - 5b \)
4. For input 3: \( 79 = a + 3b \)
5. For input -2: \( -21 = a - 2b \)

We need to solve this system of linear equations for \( a \) and \( b \). We can use any pair of these equations to find \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the first and the fifth equations:

\( 59 = a + 2b \)  [i]
\( -21 = a - 2b \) [ii]

Now, let's add equations [i] and [ii] to eliminate \( b \) and solve for \( a \):

\( 59 + (-21) = a + 2b + a - 2b \)
\( 38 = 2a \)
\( a = 19 \)

Now that we have \( a \), we can solve for \( b \) using either equation. Using equation [i]:

\( 59 = 19 + 2b \)
\( 59 - 19 = 2b \)
\( 40 = 2b \)
\( b = 20 \)

Therefore, the linear function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\( y = 19 + 20x \)

However, if we substitute this function into the other input-output pairs provided, we might find discrepancies, since we only used two input-output pairs to determine the function. To ensure the function is correct, let's check the other points:

\( y = 19 + 20(-16) = 19 - 320 = -301 \) (This matches!)

For input -5:
\( y = 19 + 20(-5) = 19 - 100 = -81 \) (This matches!)

For input 3:
\( y = 19 + 20(3) = 19 + 60 = 79 \) (This matches!)

Since all pairs match, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is indeed:

    To find the coefficients a and b for the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we will first recognize that ax^0 is always a (because x^0 = 1 for any value of x that is not zero), and bx^1 is simply bx. Thus, our function simplifies to y = a + bx. To find a and b, we'll use two of the given input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations and solve for a and b.

Let's take the input-output pairs (2, 59) and (-16, -301). Plugging these into the function we get:

For x = 2, y = 59:
59 = a + b(2)

For x = -16, y = -301:
-301 = a + b(-16)

Now we have the system of two linear equations:
1) 59 = a + 2b
2) -301 = a - 16b

Let's solve this system.

From equation 1), we can express a in terms of b:
a = 59 - 2b

Plugging this expression for a into equation 2), we get:
-301 = (59 - 2b) - 16b
-301 = 59 - 2b - 16b
-301 = 59 - 18b
-301 - 59 = -18b

b = 20

Having found the value for b, we can substitute it back into the expression for a:

We can solve this system using methods such as substitution, elimination, or using matrix operations. For simplicity, let's use the pair of equations that seem easiest to work with:

From equation 1 (input 2) and equation 5 (input -2), we can eliminate ""a"" by adding these two equations:

a + 2b = 59
a - 2b = -21

Next, we can substitute the value of a back into either equation 1 or equation 5 to solve for b. Let's use equation 1:

19 + 2b = 59

Subtract 19 from both sides:

2b = 59 - 19
2b = 40

Now, solve for b:

2. For the input -20: \( -44 = a - 20b \)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1. \( a + 13b = 55 \)
2. \( a - 20b = -44 \)

Let's solve this system of equations using the method of elimination or substitution. First, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( a \):

\( (a + 13b) - (a - 20b) = 55 - (-44) \)

\( a + 13b - a + 20b = 55 + 44 \)

\( 33b = 99 \)

\( b = 99 / 33 \)

\( b = 3 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can solve for \( a \) using one of the original equations. Let's use \( a + 13b = 55 \):

\( a + 13(3) = 55 \)

\( a + 39 = 55 \)

\( a = 55 - 39 \)

\( a = 16 \)

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

\( \boxed{y = 16 + 3x} \)

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can write the expression as:

y = a + bx

This is a linear equation (a straight-line equation), where 'a' is the y-intercept and 'b' is the slope. We can find 'b' (the slope) by considering the change in output with respect to the change in input for any two points:

Let's take two data points to determine the slope (b). We'll use:

Input: 13, Output: 55
Input: -20, Output: -44

The change in y (Δy) is -44 - 55 = -99.
The change in x (Δx) is -20 - 13 = -33.

Slope \( b = \frac{Δy}{Δx} \) = \( \frac{-99}{-33} \) = 3

Now, with the slope known, we can use any point to find 'a'. We'll use the first point (13, 55):

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we need to find the constants \(a\) and \(b\) that fit your data. Let's remember that \(x^0\) is always 1 for any \(x\) (except for \(x = 0\), which is undefined), so the term \(ax^0\) simplifies to \(a\). Therefore, our function simplifies to \(y = a + bx\).

With that in mind, let's use two data points to set up two equations and solve for \(a\) and \(b\):

Using Input: -2 and Output: 0, we get:
0 = a + b(-2) ... (1)

Using Input: -3 and Output: 8, we get:

Let's solve these two equations:

From equation (1) we can express \(a\) as \(a = 2b\).

Substituting this into equation (2) gives us:
8 = 2b + b(-3)
8 = 2b - 3b
8 = -b

Therefore, \(b = -8\). Now we can substitute the value of \(b\) into the expression for \(a\) we derived:
\(a = 2b = 2(-8) = -16\).

    To find a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we need to determine the values of a and b that make the function best approximate the relationship between the input (x) and output (y) values. The term ax^0 is a constant because any number to the power of 0 is 1. So the term ax^0 simplifies to a. Hence, the linear function we are looking for is essentially y = a + bx.

We have the following pairs of inputs and outputs (x, y):

(-11, 72)
(-3, 8)
(-2, 0)
(18, -160)
(-7, 40)

Using two points, we can solve for b by calculating the slope of the line that connects them. Let's take the points (-11, 72) and (-2, 0). The slope b is given by:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Substituting the values:

b = (0 - 72) / (-2 - (-11))
b = (-72) / (9)
b = -8

Now that we have b, we can use one of the points to solve for a. Let's use the point (-2, 0):

a = -16

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify this to y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0. Our job is now to find the coefficients a and b that best fit the data provided.

We have a system of equations based on the inputs and outputs given:

1. a - 11b = 72
2. a - 3b = 8
3. a - 2b = 0
4. a + 18b = -160
5. a - 7b = 40

We can use any two of the equations to solve for a and b. Let's use equations 2 and 3 as they have the smallest coefficients and will be easier to work with. If we subtract equation 3 from equation 2, we get:

(a - 3b) - (a - 2b) = 8 - 0
-3b + 2b = 8
-b = 8
b = -8

Now we can substitute b back into equation 3 to find a:

a = -16

The function that describes the data is therefore:

where \( y \) is the output and \( x \) is the input. This is a simple linear equation where \(a\) is the y-intercept and \(b\) is the slope of the line. We will use two of the given data points to calculate the values of \(a\) and \(b\).

For example, let's use the points (-11, 72) and (-2, 0):

1. For the point (-11, 72):

\[ 72 = a + b(-11) \]
\[ 72 = a - 11b \]
\[ a - 11b = 72 \] ... Equation (1)

2. For the point (-2, 0):

\[ 0 = a + b(-2) \]
\[ 0 = a - 2b \]

Now, we will solve these two equations simultaneously to determine \(a\) and \(b\).

Equation (2) can be rearranged to express \(a\) in terms of \(b\):

\[ a = 2b \] ... Equation (3)

Substitute Equation (3) into Equation (1):

\[ 2b - 11b = 72 \]
\[ -9b = 72 \]
\[ b = -8 \]

So the formula simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We have two variables (a and b) and multiple data points. We can use two data points to set up a system of linear equations to solve for a and b. For simplicity, let's use the points (-2, 0) and (-3, 8).

Using the point (-2, 0):
\( 0 = a - 2b \) (1)

Using the point (-3, 8):
\( 8 = a - 3b \) (2)

We can now solve this system of linear equations. Let's use equation (1) to express a in terms of b:

\( a = 2b \) (3)

Now, substitute \( a \) from equation (3) into equation (2):

\( 8 = 2b - 3b \)
\( 8 = -b \)

Now we solve for b:
\( b = -8 \)

Now we substitute b back into equation (3) to find a:

    To find the coefficients `a` and `b` for the linear function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we will use two of the given input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations. Using the input-output pairs (-4, 66) and (20, -366), we can plug them into the function to create two equations:

For the input -4 and output 66:
66 = a*(-4)^0 + b*(-4)^1
66 = a - 4b ... (1)

For the input 20 and output -366:
-366 = a*(20)^0 + b*(20)^1
-366 = a + 20b ... (2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:
1) 66 = a - 4b
2) -366 = a + 20b

We can solve this system by multiplying equation (1) by 20 to eliminate `a`:

20) 1320 = 20a - 80b
2) -366 = a + 20b

Subtracting equation (2) from the modified equation (1):

1320 - (-366) = (20a - a) + (-80b - 20b)
1686 = 19a - 100b

Now, to find `b`, we can add equation (2) to 4 times equation (1) to eliminate `a`:

4) 264 = 4a - 16b
2) -366 = a + 20b

264 + (-366) = (4a + a) + (-16b + 20b)
-102 = 5a + 4b

Divide by 5:
-20.4 = a + 0.8b

Rearranging for a:
a = -20.4 - 0.8b

Now let's plug this into equation (2) for `a`:
-366 = (-20.4 - 0.8b) + 20b
-366 + 20.4 = 19.2b
-345.6 = 19.2b
b = -345.6 / 19.2
b = -18

Now we can find a using the newly found value of b:
a = -20.4 - 0.8(-18)
a = -20.4 + 14.4

This is a linear function, with ""a"" representing the y-intercept and ""b"" the slope of the line.

3) When x = -17, y = 300
4) When x = -15, y = 264
5) When x = 20, y = -366

For the first point (11, -204):

-204 = a + 11b  ...(1)

198 = 3a - 12b  ...(3)

Now, if we add equations (1) and (3), we see that:

-204 + 198 = a + 11b + 3a - 12b

So the function we are trying to determine simplifies to y = a + bx.

The problem is thus simplified to finding the appropriate values for a and b such that the equation y = a + bx fits the given input-output pairs. To do this, we need a system of equations that we can solve. We will use two input-output pairs to create two equations and then solve for a and b.

For (11, -204): -204 = a + 11b
For (-4, 66):   66 = a - 4b

To solve for 'a' and 'b', we can set up a system of equations:

    The function you're seeking is a linear function of the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

Here, \( ax^0 \) is essentially a constant term because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) (except for \( x = 0 \)), so \( a \) is our y-intercept. The term \( bx^1 \) is just \( bx \), which is our slope.

Given your data points:
- (11, -204)
- (-4, 66)
- (-17, 300)

We need to find \( a \) (the y-intercept) and \( b \) (the slope), assuming all points fit perfectly on a line (which might not be the case with real-world data, but we're assuming it is for the purpose of this exercise).

We can use two points to find the slope \( b \) of the line:
\[ b = \frac{{y_2 - y_1}}{{x_2 - x_1}} \]

Let's use points (11, -204) and (20, -366):
\[ b = \frac{{-366 - (-204)}}{{20 - 11}} = \frac{{-366 + 204}}{9} = \frac{{-162}}{9} = -18 \]

The slope \( b \) is -18. Next, we will use the slope and one point to solve for \( a \), the y-intercept. Using point (11, -204):
\[ -204 = a \cdot 11^0 + (-18) \cdot 11 \]
\[ -204 = a + (-198) \]
\[ a = -204 + 198 \]
\[ a = -6 \]

So, our linear function is:

(20, -55)
(-4, -7)
(-10, 5)
(8, -31)

Since the function is linear, we can use two points to determine the slope \( b \) and the y-intercept \( a \).

Let's choose the points (-12, 9) and (20, -55) to calculate the slope \( b \):

\( b = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) \)
\( b = (-55 - 9) / (20 - (-12)) \)
\( b = (-64) / (32) \)
\( b = -2 \)

Now we have \( b \), we need to find \( a \). We can substitute the slope and one pair of points into the equation to solve for \( a \):

Using the point (-12, 9) with \( b = -2 \):

\( 9 = a + (-2) * (-12) \)
\( 9 = a + 24 \)
\( a = 9 - 24 \)
\( a = -15 \)

So the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) is:

\( y = -15 + (-2)x \)
\( y = -15 - 2x \)

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the data, we need to determine the values of a and b that will best fit the given inputs and outputs. The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for any x except 0.

Let's set up a system of equations using the given input-output pairs:

1. a + b(-12) = 9
2. a + b(20) = -55
3. a + b(-4) = -7
4. a + b(-10) = 5
5. a + b(8) = -31

Let's choose two of these to solve for the values of a and b. Selecting equation #1 and equation #2 should suffice:

1. a - 12b = 9
2. a + 20b = -55

Now we can solve this system by using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's subtract equation #1 from equation #2:

(2) - (1):
a + 20b - (a - 12b) = -55 - 9
a + 20b - a + 12b = -55 - 9
32b = -64
b = -64 / 32
b = -2

Now we can substitute the value of b back into either equation #1 or #2 to solve for a. Let's use equation #1:

a - 12(-2) = 9
a + 24 = 9
a = 9 - 24
a = -15

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the given data points, we need to determine the coefficients 'a' and 'b'. This form is essentially a linear equation y = a + bx, since any number to the power of zero is one (x^0 = 1).

Given the data points:

1. For x = -12, y = 9
2. For x = 20, y = -55
3. For x = -4, y = -7
4. For x = -10, y = 5
5. For x = 8, y = -31

We have the system of equations:

1. a - 12b = 9
2. a + 20b = -55
3. a - 4b = -7
4. a - 10b = 5
5. a + 8b = -31

We can use any two of these equations to solve for a and b. This problem is over-determined (more equations than variables), but we can still find a solution that minimizes the error across all points (for example, using linear regression techniques). However, you asked for an exact solution, so we can use two equations and solve them simultaneously.

Let's pick the first and second equations to solve for 'a' and 'b':

a - 12b = 9    ...(1)
a + 20b = -55  ...(2)

We can solve these equations using elimination or substitution. Let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

(a + 20b) - (a - 12b) = -55 - 9
a + 20b - a + 12b = -64
32b = -64
b = -64 / 32
b = -2

Now we can find 'a' by plugging 'b' into one of the original equations:

This simplifies to:

1) a - 12b = 9
2) a + 20b = -55

We can solve these equations using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

Add equation 1) to equation 2) to eliminate a:

a - 12b + a + 20b = 9 - 55
2a + 8b = -46
a + 4b = -23

Now let's subtract equation 1) from equation 2):

a + 20b - (a - 12b) = -55 - 9
a + 20b - a + 12b = -55 - 9
32b = -64

For the point (-12, 9):
9 = a + b(-12)

-55 = a + b(20)

Now, we have a system of two equations:

1)  9 = a - 12b

To solve for \( a \) and \( b \), we can use any two of these equations to set up a system of linear equations. For ease of computation, we can choose two equations with the most similar \(a\) coefficients to eliminate \(a\). Let's consider equations from Input -16 and -18:

    To derive the function in the specified form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to note that ax^0 is simply a, since any number raised to the zero power is 1. Therefore, our equation simplifies to y = a + bx. We will use two pairs of data points from the given input and output lists to solve for a and b.

Let's pick two pairs of points to create a system of two equations. We can pick the pairs (-16, 82) and (14, -98):

1) For input x = -16 and output y = 82, we get:

82 = a + b(-16)

2) For input x = 14 and output y = -98, we get:

-98 = a + b(14)

Now, we have the following system of equations:

a - 16b = 82
a + 14b = -98

Subtract the second equation from the first one:

a - 16b - (a + 14b) = 82 - (-98)

This simplifies to:

-30b = 180

Divide by -30 to solve for b:

b = 180 / -30
b = -6

Now we substitute the value of b back into one of our original equations to solve for a. If we use the second equation:

a + 14(-6) = -98

a - 84 = -98

Add 84 to both sides to solve for a:

Therefore, we can rewrite the function as:

Given the pairs:

First, align the equations:

a - 16b = 82      ...(1)
a + 14b = -98     ...(2)

Now, we'll subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:

    To find the coefficients a and b that fit the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 to the given data, we can set up a system of equations using a pair of input-output values. However, since the term ax^0 is simply a, because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1, we can rewrite the function in a simplified form:

y = a + bx

Now, let's pick two pairs of inputs and outputs to create two equations to solve for a and b. We'll use the input-output pairs (3, 9) and (-1, -7).

For the input 3 and output 9:
9 = a + b(3)

For the input -1 and output -7:
-7 = a + b(-1)

We have now two equations:

1) 9 = a + 3b
2) -7 = a - b

We can solve this system of equations using different methods such as substitution or elimination. We will use elimination in this example:

First, sum the two equations to eliminate a:

(1) + (2) => (9) + (-7) = (a + 3b) + (a - b)
2a + 2b = 2
a + b = 1  (Equation 3)

Now, let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate a and solve for b:

(1) - (2) => (9) - (-7) = (a + 3b) - (a - b)
16 = 4b
b = 4

Now that we've got the value for b, we can substitute it back into equation 3 to find a:

a + 4 = 1
a = 1 - 4
a = -3

So, we've determined the coefficients a and b for our original equation:

y = a + bx
y = -3 + 4x

We can now rewrite it in the exact requested form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -3x^0 + 4x^1
y = -3 + 4x

That is the function describing the relationship between the inputs and outputs given in the problem statement.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To create a function of the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we need to determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the given inputs when substituted into \(x\) will provide the corresponding outputs. The given pairs of inputs and outputs are:

\[
\begin{align*}
-18 & \to -75 \\
-1 & \to -7 \\
3 & \to 9 \\
-18 & \to -75 \\
2 & \to 5 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Since the term \(ax^0\) is equal to \(a\) (because \(x^0 = 1\) for any nonzero \(x\)), this term represents the constant or y-intercept of the function. The term \(bx^1\) simplifies to \(bx\), representing the slope of the function times the input variable.

Looking at the input-output pairs, we can attempt to find a consistent difference that would suggest a slope. We notice that when the input increases from -1 to 2 (a change of 3 units), the output increases from -7 to 5 (a change of 12 units). This gives the slope \(b = \frac{12}{3} = 4\).

To determine \(a\), we should find the constant that will adjust the slope to give us the correct output for a given input. For example, taking the input-output pair (2, 5), and knowing that \(b = 4\), we can setup this equation:

\(y = 4x + a\), and substituting \(x = 2\) and \(y = 5\),

\(5 = 4(2) + a\)

\(5 = 8 + a\)

\(a = 5 - 8\)

\(a = -3\).

Now, let's check this function with another pair to make sure it holds true:

\(y = -3 + 4x\)

For the pair (-1, -7):

\(y = -3 + 4(-1)\)

\(y = -3 - 4\)

\(y = -7\)

This is correct based on the provided data. Therefore, the function that seems to capture the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

\(y = -3 + 4x\)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we must determine the values of the coefficients a and b.

The provided function form simplifies to y = a + bx, because x^0 is 1 for any x except for x = 0.

First, we can see that the outputs seem to be related linearly to the inputs, so we can use two sets of input-output pairs to determine the coefficients.

Let's take the pairs (-1, -7) and (2, 5). Plugging these into y = a + bx, we get two equations:

1) When x = -1, y = -7:
-7 = a + b(-1)
-7 = a - b
a - b = -7 ...(1)

2) When x = 2, y = 5:
5 = a + b(2)
5 = a + 2b
a + 2b = 5 ...(2)

Now, let's solve these two equations simultaneously for a and b. We can use the method of elimination or substitution.

Adding equations (1) and (2) together, we get:
(a - b) + (a + 2b) = -7 + 5
2a + b = -2

Now, let's isolate b using equation (1):
b = a + 7

Substituting this expression for b into 2a + b = -2:
2a + (a + 7) = -2
3a + 7 = -2
3a = -9
a = -3

Now we can find b:
b = a + 7
b = -3 + 7
b = 4

Thus, the coefficients a and b for our function are -3 and 4, respectively. So the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be expressed as:

y = -3x^0 + 4x^1

Given that x^0 is 1, this simplifies to:
y = -3 + 4x

    Given the data points provided, we can try to deduce a relationship between the input (x) and output (y). We are looking for a function of the form:
\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]
which simplifies to:
\[ y = a + bx \]
since \( x^0 = 1 \) for all x not equal to zero.

Now we need to determine the values of a and b such that the function fits the given input-output pairs. To fit the function perfectly, the same values of a and b must work for all given pairs.

Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to calculate a and b:
Using Input: 6; Output: 74 and Input: -5; Output: -25, we can set up the following equations:

1. When x = 6; y = 74:
\[ 74 = a + 6b \] 

2. When x = -5; y = -25:
\[ -25 = a - 5b \] 

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns which we can solve:

From equation (2):
\[ a = -25 + 5b \]

Substitute the value of a from equation (2) into equation (1):
\[ 74 = (-25 + 5b) + 6b \]
\[ 74 = -25 + 11b \]
\[ 99 = 11b \]
\[ b = 9 \]

Now we substitute b back into the equation for a:
\[ a = -25 + 5b \]
\[ a = -25 + 5(9) \]
\[ a = -25 + 45 \]
\[ a = 20 \]

So the function that fits the given points is:

Let's use the points (6, 74) and (19, 191):

For the input 6:
\( 74 = a(6)^0 + b(6) \)
Since anything raised to the power of 0 equals 1, this simplifies to:
\( 74 = a + 6b \) ... [1]

For the input 19:
\( 191 = a(19)^0 + b(19) \)
Again simplifying as anything to the power of 0 equals 1, we get:
\( 191 = a + 19b \) ... [2]

Now, we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns. We can solve this system by subtracting equation [1] from equation [2] to eliminate \( a \):

\( (191 - a) - (74 - a) = (19b - 6b) \)
\( 191 - 74 = 19b - 6b \)

    To determine the coefficients `a` and `b` in the function of the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to use the given input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations. However, it's important to note that `x^0` is always 1, so we can simplify the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1` to `y = a + bx`, because anything raised to the power of zero is 1.

Given the pairs:

1. For x=6, y=74: `74 = a + 6b`
2. For x=19, y=191: `191 = a + 19b`
3. For x=-11, y=-79: `-79 = a - 11b`
4. For x=-5, y=-25: `-25 = a - 5b`
5. For x=-10, y=-70: `-70 = a - 10b`

We can use any two pairs of these equations to solve for `a` and `b`. Let's use the first and the third pairs:

1. `74 = a + 6b`
2. `-79 = a - 11b`

By adding these two equations together, we can solve for `a`:

`74 + (-79) = a + 6b + a - 11b`
`-5 = 2a - 5b`
`-5 + (6/2) * 5 = 2a - 5b + (6/2) * 5` (Adding `(6/2) * 5` to both sides so that we can cancel out `- 5b`)
`-5 + 15 = 2a`
`10 = 2a`
`a = 5`

Now we have `a`. Let's plug it back into one of the original equations to find `b`:

From `74 = a + 6b`:
`74 = 5 + 6b`
`69 = 6b`
`b = 69 / 6`

The term \( b{x^1} \) is simply \( bx \) since any number to the power of 1 is itself. Thus, we have to solve for \( a \) and \( b \) in the equation:

Using the given inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations. However, since they all seem to be linear, we can just take two input-output pairs to determine \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's take the input-output pairs (6, 8) and (-5, -25):

Using the first pair (6, 8):
\( 8 = a + 6b \)

y = a + bx

To determine the constants a and b, let's examine the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y).

Let's look at a pair of input-output values to find b:

For the input x = 6, the output y = 8.
For the input x = -5, the output y = -25.

We can create two equations:

8 = a + 6b
-25 = a -5b

Now we can solve these two simultaneous equations to find a and b. Let's multiply the second equation by 6 and the first equation by 5 to eliminate a when we add them together:

(6) * (-25) = (6) * a - (30) * b
(5) * 8 = (5) * a + (30) * b

This simplifies to:

40 = 5a + 30b

Now we add these two equations:

-150 + 40 = (6a + 5a) + (-30b + 30b)
-110 = 11a

From this, we find that:

a = -110 / 11
a = -10

y = a + bx

We can use two input-output pairs to form a system of equations, which we can then solve for a and b. Let's use the input-output pairs (6, 8) and (-5, -25).

For the input 6:
8 = a + b(6)

For the input -5:
-25 = a + b(-5)

We now have a system of two linear equations:

1)  8 = a + 6b
2) -25 = a - 5b

Let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate a:
8 - (-25) = (a + 6b) - (a - 5b)
33 = 11b

Therefore:
b = 33 / 11
b = 3

    To find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) in the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that fits the given data, we notice that \( ax^0 \) is equivalent to \( a \) since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) (except when \( x = 0 \), which is not in our dataset). So the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Given the data, we can set up a system of equations based on the inputs and outputs. We need to find values for \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy all the given points. Let's use two points to set up two equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Using the points (-5, -25) and (6, 8):
1. From input -5 and output -25: -25 = a + (-5)b
2. From input 6 and output 8: 8 = a + 6b

Now let's solve this system of equations:

From equation 1: \( a = -25 + 5b \)

Substitute \( a \) in equation 2:
\( 8 = (-25 + 5b) + 6b \)
\( 8 = -25 + 11b \)
\( 11b = 8 + 25 \)
\( 11b = 33 \)
\( b = 3 \)

Now substitute \( b \) back in the expression for \( a \):
\( a = -25 + 5(3) \)
\( a = -25 + 15 \)
\( a = -10 \)

Our function is therefore:
\( y = -10 + 3x \)

Rewriting it in the exact given form:
\( y = -10x^0 + 3x^1 \)

However, simplifying \( -10x^0 \) to \( -10 \) would give us the correct function description:

    To determine the values of a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use the given input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations. The term ax^0 is just a, since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to create two equations.

For Input: 9, Output: 29, we have:
29 = a + 9b, which simplifies to  Equation (1)

For Input: 2, Output: 8, we have:
8 = a + 2b, which simplifies to Equation (2)

Now, let's solve this system of equations to find a and b.

From Equation (2):
a = 8 - 2b

Substitute the expression for a from Equation (2) into Equation (1):
29 = (8 - 2b) + 9b
29 = 8 + 7b
21 = 7b
b = 3

Now find a using the value of b:
a = 8 - 2 * 3
a = 8 - 6

2. \( (2, 8) \)
3. \( (-1, -1) \)
4. \( (-6, -16) \)

Now we will use two of the points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). The function can be simplified to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \neq 0 \), and \( x^1 = x \).

Using points (9, 29) and (-1, -1), we will setup two equations:

1. \( 29 = a + 9b \)
2. \( -1 = a - 1b \)

Now, let's solve this system of equations:

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( a \):

\( 29 - (-1) = (a + 9b) - (a - b) \)
\( 30 = 10b \)
\( b = 3 \)

    The function you are looking for is linear (since it's written in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\)), which suggests that the relationship between the input (x) and the output (y) can be described by an equation of a straight line. The term \(ax^0\) is just a constant (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), so \(ax^0 = a\). The term \(bx^1\) is simply \(bx\), as any number to the power of 1 is itself.

Let’s use the given input-output pairs to determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\). Considering the first pair:

Input: 9
Output: 29

This gives us the equation \(29 = a + 9b\).

Next, let's use another pair such as:

Input: 2
Output: 8

This gives us the equation \(8 = a + 2b\).

With two equations, we can solve for our coefficients \(a\) and \(b\):

From the second equation (2):
\(a = 8 - 2b\)   (1)

Substitute that into the first equation (9):
\(29 = (8 - 2b) + 9b\)
\(29 = 8 + 7b\)
\(21 = 7b\)
\(b = 3\)

Now that we have \(b\), use the equation (1) to find \(a\):
\(a = 8 - 2 \cdot 3\)
\(a = 8 - 6\)
\(a = 2\)

    To define the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we treat it as a simple linear equation, commonly known as y = a + bx, where a and b are constants, and x is the variable input.

Since ax^0 is always 1 (because any number to the power of 0 is 1), the term ax^0 represents the constant term a. The term bx^1 is simply bx, since any number to the power of 1 is itself.

Given four pairs of inputs and outputs, we can determine the constants a and b:

1) For x = 9, y = 29:
   29 = a(9)^0 + b(9)
   29 = a + 9b

2) For x = 2, y = 8:
   8 = a(2)^0 + b(2)
   8 = a + 2b

3) For x = -1, y = -1:
   -1 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)
   -1 = a - b

4) For x = -6, y = -16:
   -16 = a(-6)^0 + b(-6)
   -16 = a - 6b

Notice that the last input-output pair is the same as the fourth one, so it doesn't provide any new information.

Let's solve for a and b using equations from inputs 2) and 3):

From 2): 8 = a + 2b (Equation 1)
From 3): -1 = a - b (Equation 2)

Now, let's solve these equations simultaneously. We can add Equation (2) to Equation (1) to eliminate a:

8 + (-1) = (a + 2b) + (a - b)
7 = 2a + b

Now let's solve for a by isolating it on one side:

7 = 2a + b
7 - b = 2a
(7 - b) / 2 = a

Substitute the expression for a from above back into Equation (2):

-1 = (7 - b) / 2 - b
-2 = 7 - b - 2b
-2 = 7 - 3b
-9 = -3b
b = 3

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using b = 3 in (for example) Equation (1):

8 = a + 2(3)
8 = a + 6
a = 8 - 6
a = 2

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to interpret the given function form as a linear function:

y = ax^0 + bx^1 is another way to write y = a + bx, where a corresponds to the y-intercept and b corresponds to the slope of the function.

With the given pairs of inputs and outputs, we can form a system of equations to determine the values of a and b.

Let's use two pairs of input and output to determine a and b:

For input 9 and output 29:
29 = a + 9b

For input 2 and output 8:
8 = a + 2b

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1) 29 = a + 9b
2) 8 = a + 2b

To solve for a and b, we can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate a:

29 - 8 = (a + 9b) - (a + 2b)
21 = 7b

Divide both sides by 7 to solve for b:

b = 3

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for a. Let's use the second equation:

8 = a + 2b
8 = a + 2(3)
8 = a + 6

Subtract 6 from both sides to solve for a:

a = 8 - 6
a = 2

1. Using the input-output pair (2, -17):
-17 = a + b(2)

2. Using the input-output pair (-3, 18):
18 = a + b(-3)

Now we have a system of two equations:
(1) -17 = a + 2b
(2)  18 = a - 3b

To solve for a and b, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

Multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (2) by 2 to eliminate a when we add them together:
(1) becomes: -51 = 3a + 6b
(2) becomes:  36 = 2a - 6b

Add the two new equations together:
-51 + 36 = 3a + 6b + 2a - 6b
-15 = 5a

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for a:
a = -15 / 5
a = -3

-17 = -3 + 2b

We will use two of the given points to calculate the coefficients a and b. Once we find a and b, we can plug them into our equation y = a + bx to describe the relationship.

Let's use the points (-16, 109) and (2, -17). With these two points, we get two equations:

For the input -16:
109 = a + b(-16) [1]

For input 2:
-17 = a + b(2) [2]

Let's solve this system of equations for a and b.

From equation [2]:
a = -17 - 2b

Substitute the expression for a from equation [2] into equation [1]:
109 = (-17 - 2b) - 16b
109 = -17 - 18b

126 = -18b

a = -3

Let's select two points to formulate a system of linear equations. The points (x, y) will be (2, -17) and (-3, 18). For these points, the function becomes:

For x = 2:
\[ -17 = a + b(2) \]
\[ -17 = a + 2b \]

For x = -3:
\[ 18 = a + b(-3) \]
\[ 18 = a - 3b \]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
1. \( a + 2b = -17 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( a - 3b = 18 \) (Equation 2)

Next, we can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination in this case to find the values of a and b.

To eliminate a, we will multiply Equation 1 by 1 and Equation 2 by 1 and then subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1.

Equation 1 (multiplied by 1):
\( a + 2b = -17 \)

Equation 2 (multiplied by 1):
\( a - 3b = 18 \)

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:
\[ (a + 2b) - (a - 3b) = -17 - 18 \]
\[ a + 2b - a + 3b = -35 \]
\[ 5b = -35 \]
\[ b = -7 \]

Now we will substitute b = -7 into Equation 1 to find a.

\( a + 2(-7) = -17 \)
\( a - 14 = -17 \)

5. \((-14, 242)\)

We can observe that the output (y) increases when the input (x) decreases, suggesting that the slope of the line (b_1) is negative. This implies a negative coefficient for x.

Now, let's consider the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Looking at the data, we notice the following pattern: the output is always 18 times the negative of the input minus 18. That is:

\( y = -18x - 18 \)

Rewriting it in the requested format:

\( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \)

We get:

\( y = -18 + -18x \)

Therefore, our function is:

\( y = -18x^0 - 18x^1 \)

However, this equation may not be traditionally accepted because \( x^0 \) is equal to 1 for all x not equal to zero, and thus it is not a variable term but a constant term. The standard way to represent this would be simply to denote the constant term without the \( x^0 \), leading to:

\( y = -18 - 18x \)

This simplification is mathematically equivalent and aligns with conventional notation.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we first recognize that ax^0 is equivalent to a since x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx, where 'a' is the y-intercept and 'b' is the slope of the line.

Looking at the inputs and outputs:

1. When x = -9, y = 162
2. When x = 17, y = -254
3. When x = -4, y = 82
4. When x = -18, y = 306
5. When x = -14, y = 242

We can observe that as the value of x decreases by 1, the value of y increases by -28. This consistency can be recognized to figure out the slope 'b'.

For example:

- From Input -9 to -18, the output goes from 162 to 306, which is a change of 144 over a change in input of 9 (since -18 - (-9) = -9). 144/9 is indeed 16.
- From Input -4 to -9, the output increases from 82 to 162 which is a change of 80 over a change in input of 5 (since -9 - (-4) = -5). 80/5 again gives us 16.

This consistent increase of 16 in the output for each decrease of 1 in the input suggests that our slope 'b' is -16 (since the input decreases, the change in output is in the opposite direction to the slope).

With the slope (-16), we can use any of the given points to find 'a'. Let's use the first point (-9, 162):

y = a + bx
162 = a + (-16)(-9)
162 = a + 144
a = 162 - 144
a = 18

Thus, the function is:

y = 18 - 16x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To create a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are essentially finding a linear relationship between the input x and the output y, since x^0 is always 1 (anything raised to the power of zero is one). So our function simplifies to y = a + bx, where a and b are constants that we need to solve for.

However, since we see that our output changes sign when the input changes sign, and the relationship between input and output is proportional (the output is scaled by a constant for every input), it indicates that there isn't any constant term in the equation. This simplifies our potential function to just y = bx.

Using two points from the given data set, we can solve for b by dividing the output y by the input x. Let's choose (x1, y1) = (-9, 162) and (x2, y2) = (17, -254).

Using point (x1, y1):
b = y1 / x1 = 162 / -9 = -18

To ensure that the same b works for the second point (x2, y2), we'll check it:
b = y2 / x2 = -254 / 17 = -18 / 1 = -18

Since both points give us the same b value, and based on the nature of the other data points that also follow this pattern, we can hypothesize that the function is y = -18x (where b is -18).

Hence the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -18x

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is equivalent to y = a + bx (since x^0 is 1 for any x except for x=0), we need to solve for a and b using the provided inputs and outputs.

We are given that:

For x = -9, y = 162;
for x = 17, y = -254;
for x = -4, y = 82;
for x = -18, y = 306;
for x = -14, y = 242.

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for a and b. We'll use the first two pairs:

1. For x = -9, y = 162, we get:
162 = a + b(-9)

2. For x = 17, y = -254, we get:
-254 = a + b(17)

Now we have a system of two equations:

a - 9b = 162
a + 17b = -254

We can solve this system by using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

By adding the two equations together, we eliminate a:

a - 9b + a + 17b = 162 - 254
2a + 8b = -92
a + 4b = -46

Now let's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a again:

a + 17b - (a - 9b) = -254 - 162
a + 17b - a + 9b = -416
26b = -416
b = -416 / 26
b = -16

Now we can substitute b back into one of the original equations to solve for a:

a - 9(-16) = 162
a + 144 = 162
a = 162 - 144
a = 18

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we should find the constants a and b such that the function describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) as closely as possible.

Notice that ax^0 is just a, as anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, we are looking for a function of the form y = a + bx.

Given this form, with multiple input-output pairs, one could use various methods to find the optimal a and b, like least squares regression. However, since this method might not be easily carried out in a text-based interaction without computational tools, we can attempt to find a and b by inspecting the given pairs.

With enough pairs, we might observe patterns that suggest what a and b should be. In this very constrained form (linear), we can pick two points, then solve for a and b. Let's take two pairs to construct two equations and solve for a and b:

Let's use these two input-output pairs:
Input: 18, Output: 350
Input: 16, Output: 310

(1) For x = 18, y = 350: 350 = a + 18b
(2) For x = 16, y = 310: 310 = a + 16b

Now, subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
(350 - 310) = (a + 18b) - (a + 16b)
40 = 2b
b = 20

With b found, we can substitute it into either equation to find a. Let's use equation (2) for that:
310 = a + 16*20
310 = a + 320
a = 310 - 320
a = -10

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we first need to understand that ax^0 is always equal to a since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the term ax^0 is actually a constant term.

What we need to find out is a method for determining a (the constant) and b (the coefficient of x). Let's use two of the input-output pairs to calculate a and b.

For the sake of simplicity, let's use the following two input-output pairs:
1. Input: 12, Output: 230
2. Input: 16, Output: 310

This gives us two equations:
230 = a + b(12)
310 = a + b(16)

Let's solve this system of equations for a and b.

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

310 - 230 = a + 16b - (a + 12b)
80 = 4b
b = 80 / 4
b = 20

Now, we'll substitute the value of b back into the first equation:

230 = a + 20(12)
230 = a + 240
a = 230 - 240
a = -10

Thus, our function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = -10x^0 + 20x^1

Simplified, this becomes:

y = -10 + 20x

We can verify this for the given points:

For x = 18, y = -10 + 20(18) = -10 + 360 = 350 (matches the given output)
For x = 12, y = -10 + 20(12) = -10 + 240 = 230 (matches the given output)

230 = a + 12b

2. Using Input: 18, Output: 350:

Subtract the first equation from the second one to get:

120 = 6b
b = 120 / 6
b = 20

Then, substitute the value of b back into one of the equations to solve for a. Using the first equation:

230 = a + 240
a = 230 - 240

Plugging the first data point into the simplified equation \( y = a + bx \) gives us:

Let’s solve this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \):

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate \( a \):

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to recognize it as a linear equation of the form \( y = a + bx \), where:

- \( a \) corresponds to the y-intercept, which is the value of \( y \) when \( x = 0 \).
- \( b \) is the slope of the line, which is the change in \( y \) for a one-unit change in \( x \).

From the given inputs and outputs, we can determine \( b \) by examining the change in output divided by the change in input. Let's consider the inputs 13 and 14, and their respective outputs 177 and 191:

For \( x_2 = 14 \) and \( y_2 = 191 \):
For \( x_1 = 13 \) and \( y_1 = 177 \):

\[ b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{191 - 177}{14 - 13} = \frac{14}{1} = 14 \]

Now that we have \( b \), we need to find \( a \). We'll use one of the input-output pairs to solve for \( a \). Let's use the input 3 and output 37:

\[ y = a + bx \]
\[ 37 = a + 14(3) \]
\[ 37 = a + 42 \]
\[ a = 37 - 42 \]
\[ a = -5 \]

Hence, the function that describes the data is:

\[ y = -5 + 14x \]

In the form you requested, which is \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), it would be:

\[ y = -5x^0 + 14x^1 \]

However, since \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any \( x \) (except for \( x = 0 \)), it is equivalent to:

\[ y = -5(1) + 14x \]
\[ y = -5 + 14x \]

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: 13
Output: 177

Input: 14
Output: 191

Input: -8
Output: -117

Input: 3
Output: 37

Input: 7
Output: 93


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: -13
    ","To find the output for the input -13 using the function \( y = -5 + 14x \), we substitute \( x \) with -13:

\[ y = -5 + 14(-13) \]
\[ y = -5 - 182 \]
\[ y = -187 \]

Therefore, the output is:

Output: -187",-187,True,"[14, -5]"
