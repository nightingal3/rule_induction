"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which is equivalent to \( y = a + bx \), we need to deduce the coefficients 'a' and 'b' based on the given input-output pairs.

Looking at the provided data:
- For an input of -10, the output is -213,
- For an input of 9, the output is 167,
- For an input of 4, the output is 67,
- For an input of -3, the output is -73,
- For an input of 20, the output is 387.

We need to find a pattern that applies to all these input-output pairs. Notice that with input of -10 and output of -213:

\( -213 = a - 10b \)  (Equation 1)

With input of 9 and output of 167:

\( 167 = a + 9b \)  (Equation 2)

Now, let's calculate \( b \) by subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:

\( 167 - (-213) = (a + 9b) - (a - 10b) \)

\( 380 = 19b \)

\( b = \frac{380}{19} \)

\( b = 20 \)

Knowing \( b = 20 \), we can substitute it back into either equation to find \( a \). Using Equation 2:

\( 167 = a + 9(20) \)

\( 167 = a + 180 \)

\( a = 167 - 180 \)

\( a = -13 \)

So the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

\( y = -13 + 20x \)

Or written in the exact form requested:

Output: \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \)

\( y = -13x^0 + 20x^1 \)

Note that \( x^0 \) is 1 for all x (except x cannot be 0 because \( 0^0 \) is indeterminate), so \( -13x^0 \) is simply -13.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Input: 15
    ","Given the function \( y = -13 + 20x \), we can apply it to the input of 15:

\( y = -13 + 20 \cdot 15 \)
\( y = -13 + 300 \)
\( y = 287 \)

Therefore, the output is:

Output: 287",287,True,"[20, -13]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we need to solve for the constants a and b.

First, note that x^0 is always 1 regardless of the value of x (except when x = 0 which is not in our case). Therefore, we can simplify the function to:

y = a + bx

Given the input-output pairs, we have the following equations:

-213 = a + b(-10)
167 = a + b(9)
67 = a + b(4)
-73 = a + b(-3)
387 = a + b(20)

This is a set of linear equations with two variables (a and b). We would usually solve this system using methods like substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. However, with five equations and only two variables, we have an overdetermined system and may not find a single solution that exactly satisfies all five equations. Instead, we can use linear regression to find the ""best fit"" line.

However, since I've been requested to provide an explicit function, I will handle this task as a least squares problem. Unfortunately, without computational tools, I cannot solve this system exactly here. Instead, I will estimate a solution based on the average change per unit x to illustrate a possible approach.

For simplicity, let's take two equations that are far apart to estimate:

From the first and last input-output pairs:

Output when x = -10: y = -213
Output when x = 20: y = 387

Change in y = 387 - (-213) = 600
Change in x = 20 - (-10) = 30

Estimated slope (b) = Change in y / Change in x = 600 / 30 = 20

Now we pick one of the points to estimate the intercept (a), let's use the point (20, 387):

387 = a + 20(20)
a = 387 - 400
a = -13

Based on this rough estimation, we can say the function is approximately:

y = -13 + 20x

Please keep in mind that this function is a rough approximation based on an estimation method and would not precisely fit all of the given points. For a perfect fit (if possible with the given points), more sophisticated methods such as least squares regression would need to be applied.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Input: -6
    ","To predict the output for the input x = -6 using the estimated function y = -13 + 20x, we would calculate:

y = -13 + 20(-6)
y = -13 - 120
y = -133

Thus, the output is:

Output: -133",-133,True,"[20, -13]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to understand that \( ax^0 \) is a constant term (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), and \( bx^1 \) is a linear term (since \( x^1 \) is just x). The function can then be simplified to \( y = a + bx \).

We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) by using two points from the given data to form a system of linear equations. Let's choose the points (-10, -213) and (20, 387).

Using the point (-10, -213):
\( -213 = a + b(-10) \)  
\( -213 = a - 10b \) ...(1)

Using the point (20, 387):
\( 387 = a + b(20) \)  
\( 387 = a + 20b \) ...(2)

We have a system of two equations:
1) \( -213 = a - 10b \)  
2) \( 387 = a + 20b \) 

We can solve this system using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's use elimination.

Add (1) and (2) to eliminate \( a \):
\( -213 + 387 = a - 10b + a + 20b \)  
\( 174 = 2a + 10b \) 

Divide by 2:
\( 87 = a + 5b \) ...(3)

Now let's subtract equation (1) from (3) to eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( b \):
\( 87 + 213 = a + 5b - a + 10b \)  
\( 300 = 15b \) 

Divide by 15:
\( b = 20 \)

Now we can substitute \( b \) back into either (1) or (3) to find \( a \). Let's substitute it into (3):

\( 87 = a + 5(20) \)  
\( 87 = a + 100 \)  
\( a = 87 - 100 \)  
\( a = -13 \)

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and the outputs is:

\[ y = -13 + 20x \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which can be simplified to y = a + bx (since x^0 = 1 for any x except for x = 0), we need to solve for the constants a and b. We can use two data points to form two equations and solve for a and b.

Let's choose the input-output pairs (9, 167) and (20, 387) to set up the equations:

For the input 9:
167 = a + b(9)

For the input 20:
387 = a + b(20)

Now let's solve these two equations simultaneously:

Equation (1): 167 = a + 9b
Equation (2): 387 = a + 20b

Subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2) to solve for b:

387 - 167 = (a + 20b) - (a + 9b)
220 = 11b
b = 20

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using either of the original equations. Let's use Equation (1):

167 = a + 9(20)
167 = a + 180
a = 167 - 180
a = -13

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = -13x^0 + 20x^1

Simplified, this is:

y = -13 + 20x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Thus, the output is:

Output: -353",-353,True,"[20, -13]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we should recognize that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) not equal to zero. Therefore, our function effectively reduces to \( y = a + bx \), since \( ax^0 \) will always be \( a \).

Given this form, we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that will make the function describe the provided input-output pairs.

Looking at the given data:

1. When \( x = -10 \), \( y = -213 \)
2. When \( x = 9 \), \( y = 167 \)
3. When \( x = 4 \), \( y = 67 \)
4. When \( x = -3 \), \( y = -73 \)
5. When \( x = 20 \), \( y = 387 \)

We need to find the values for \( a \) and \( b \) such that the above conditions are satisfied.

To determine \( a \) and \( b \), we generally need to solve a system of equations. However, with multiple data points and potentially no perfect fit, we may need to use a method like least squares to approximate the best values. In this simplistic form, we're not provided with enough information to apply a method like least squares regression without a computer or calculator; we can only ballpark the values by observation.

By inspecting the data, we can intuit that the value of the output increases generally with the input, suggesting that \( b \) is positive. Additionally, due to the asymmetry of the outputs for negative and positive inputs, it seems that there will also be a constant \( a \) contributing to the output.

While we could attempt to approximate \( a \) and \( b \) by evaluating the changes in outputs relative to changes in inputs, we would still likely only arrive at an approximation given this method. That said, without additional computational tools or a systematic approach, we will make an attempt to estimate \( a \) and \( b \).

Considering the data point (4, 67) and (9, 167), the increase in output for an increase of 5 in input is 100, we might guess that \( b \approx 100/5 = 20 \).

Taking the data point (4, 67) and assuming \( b = 20 \), we can back-calculate \( a \) roughly as:
\( 67 = a + 20 \times 4 \)
\( 67 = a + 80 \)
\( a = 67 - 80 \)
\( a = -13 \)

Thus, a very rough estimate for the function given the pattern could be:
\( y = -13 + 20x \)

However, without properly calculating the best-fit line via a method such as least squares, this estimate could be significantly off. This function will not perfectly describe the given data, but it may serve as a starting point for a more refined analysis with appropriate computational tools.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the given inputs and outputs, first note that ax^0 is the same as a, because any number to the power of zero is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We already know that when x is 0, y is -3 (from the second data point). This tells us immediately that a = -3, because b times 0 will still be 0.

Now we only need to determine the value of b. We can use any of the other given points for this. Let's use the point where the input is -18 and the output is 339:

y = a + bx
339 = -3 + b(-18)

We'll solve for b:

339 + 3 = -18b
342 = -18b
b = 342 / -18
b = -19

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), let's first understand what the given terms mean:

- \( ax^0 \) will always be a constant because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So, \( ax^0 = a*1 = a \).
- \( bx^1 \) is simply \( bx \) because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself.

Therefore, the function we are looking for will be in the form of \( y = a + bx \).

Given the data points:

1. For Input -18, Output is 339, we have \( 339 = a + b(-18) \).
2. For Input 0, Output is -3, we have \( -3 = a + b(0) \).
3. For Input 5, Output is -98, we have \( -98 = a + b(5) \).
4. For Input -3, Output is 54, we have \( 54 = a + b(-3) \).
5. For Input -16, Output is 301, we have \( 301 = a + b(-16) \).

From the second data point, where Input is 0, we can immediately determine that \( a = -3 \) because \( b(0) \) will be 0.

Now we just need to find \( b \) using this \( a \) value and any of the other data points. Let's use the first data point where Input is -18 and Output is 339:

\( 339 = a + b(-18) \)
\( 339 = -3 - 18b \)

Now we solve for \( b \):

\( 339 + 3 = -18b \)
\( 342 = -18b \)
\( b = -\frac{342}{18} \)
\( b = -19 \)

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the data points given, we recognize that ax^0 is a constant term (since anything to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is a linear term in x. So we are looking for a function of the form:

y = a + bx

Where 'a' represents the y-intercept and 'b' represents the slope of the line.

Given the data points, we can create a system of equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'. However, considering that we only need two points to determine the line, let's use these two:

Input: 0 (x1)

Now we plug these values into the equation y = a + bx twice, once for each pair of points, and solve for 'a' and 'b':

For (x1, y1):

a = -3

    To determine the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which can also be written as \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x, we need to find the values of constants \( a \) and \( b \) that make the function fit the given input-output pairs as closely as possible.

A function of this form is a linear function and given multiple input-output pairs, the best we can hope for is to use a method such as least squares to minimize the error between the actual outputs and the ones predicted by our function. However, in this case, you've asked for an explicit function that captures the relationship exactly. To find the exact coefficients \( a \) and \( b \), we need two input-output pairs, preferably those that give a unique solution.

We already have an input-output pair at \( x = 0 \), which gives us \( y = -3 \), so we know that \( a = -3 \) because when \( x = 0 \), \( bx^1 \) term will become 0, and all that is left is \( a \).

Now we need just one other pair to find \( b \). Let's use the pair (x = -18, y = 339). Plugging this into the equation \( y = a + bx \), we get:

\[ 339 = -3 + b(-18) \]

Now, solve for \( b \):

\[ 339 = -3 - 18b \]
\[ 18b = -3 - 339 \]
\[ 18b = -342 \]
\[ b = -342 / 18 \]

    To find the constants `a` and `b` in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1, we need to use two of the given points to set up a system of linear equations.

Let's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

From the first equation:
a + 5b = -31     ...(1)

From the second equation:

    ","To find the output for the input 15 using the derived function y = -6 - 5x, we substitute x with 15:

y = -6 - 5(15)
y = -6 - 75
y = -81

Therefore, the output is:

    The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx, since any number to the power of 0 is 1.

To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use any two of the provided input-output pairs to solve for a and b.

Let's use the first and the third points (5, -31) and (-11, 49).

For the first point:

-31 = a + b(5)

For the third point:

49 = a + b(-11)

We now have a system of two linear equations:

1. -31 = a + 5b
2. 49 = a - 11b

Let's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

49 - (-31) = (a - a) - 11b - 5b
80 = -16b
b = -5

Now let's substitute b back into the first equation to solve for a:

-31 = a + 5(-5)
-31 = a - 25
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To capture the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we will need to identify the values of 'a' and 'b' that fit the data provided.

The term ax^0 is essentially 'a', as x^0 is always 1 for any value of x (except x=0). Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. 

We will now solve for 'a' and 'b' using the given input-output pairs.

We will set up two equations using two pairs of the given input-output points to solve for 'a' and 'b'.

Let's use the input-output pairs (5, -31) and (-11, 49):

For the input 5:
-31 = a + b(5)
-31 = a + 5b  (Equation 1)

For the input -11:
49 = a + b(-11)
49 = a - 11b  (Equation 2)

Now, we'll solve this system of two linear equations for 'a' and 'b'. We can use elimination or substitution methods; here, we'll use the elimination method:

Multiply Equation 1 by 11 and Equation 2 by 5 to eliminate 'a' when we sum the equations:

11(-31) = 11a + 55b   =>   -341 = 11a + 55b  (Equation 3)
5(49) = 5a - 55b      =>    245 = 5a - 55b   (Equation 4)

Now, we'll add Equation 3 and Equation 4:
-341 + 245 = (11a + 55b) + (5a - 55b)
-96 = 16a

Divide both sides by 16 to solve for 'a':
a = -96 / 16
a = -6

Now we'll substitute 'a' back into Equation 1 to find 'b':
-31 = (-6) + 5b
-31 + 6 = 5b
-25 = 5b

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for 'b':
b = -25 / 5
b = -5

Now we have our values for 'a' and 'b':
a = -6, b = -5

So the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship is:
y = -6x^0 + (-5)x^1
Or simplifying further:
y = -6 + (-5)x
y = -6 - 5x

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the data, we are essentially looking for a linear function of the form y = b0 + b1x, where:

- b0 is the constant term (or the y-intercept), equivalent to ax^0, since x^0 is always 1.
- b1 is the linear coefficient, equivalent to bx^1.

We have five points: (5, -31), (9, -51), (-11, 49), (-4, 14), and (-12, 54). With two parameters, b0 and b1, to find, we can use two points to come up with a system of two equations and solve for b0 and b1. However, to ensure that we capture the relationship that applies to all given points, we need to check consistency with all the data. It might be necessary to use more than two points if the first two do not provide a consistent solution that works for all five points.

Let's set up two equations using the first two data points:

For the input 5 and output -31:
-31 = b0 + 5b1  (1)

For the input 9 and output -51:
-51 = b0 + 9b1  (2)

Let's solve the system of equations:

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

-51 - (-31) = (b0 + 9b1) - (b0 + 5b1)
-20 = 4b1
b1 = -20 / 4
b1 = -5

Using b1 = -5 in equation (1):
-31 = b0 + 5(-5)
-31 = b0 - 25
b0 = -31 + 25
b0 = -6

So our function is y = -6 + (-5)x, or, in the requested format:

y = -6x^0 - 5x^1

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the data points given, we first need to recognize that ax^0 is a constant term, because anything raised to the power of zero is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We are looking for values of \( a \) and \( b \) such that when we plug in the input value for \( x \), we get the corresponding output value.

Let's translate the inputs and outputs into coordinate pairs: (7, -98), (17, -218), (5, -74), (3, -50), (-6, 58).

Because there are more than two points, this is an overdetermined system, and usually, we would turn to methods like least squares regression to find the best fitting line. But in this task, we're asked to find the exact function that matches the given points, which suggests that there is a perfect linear fit.

So, we will form two equations with two of the coordinate pairs and then solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Using points (7, -98) and (17, -218):

For point (7, -98): -98 = a + b(7)
For point (17, -218): -218 = a + b(17)

Let's solve these equations simultaneously. We can start by writing two simplified equations:

1) a + 7b = -98      (Equation 1)
2) a + 17b = -218   (Equation 2)

Next, we will solve these equations using the method of elimination or substitution. Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2 gives:

(17b - 7b) = -218 - (-98)

10b = -218 + 98

10b = -120

b = -12

Now that we have \( b \), we can substitute it back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for \( a \). Using Equation 1:

a + 7(-12) = -98

a - 84 = -98

a = -98 + 84

a = -14

    To determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) for the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, we can look at the given input-output pairs and solve the system of linear equations. However, with multiple input-output pairs, we can use a least squares approach or similar method to find the best fitting coefficients for all pairs. Here, I will demonstrate a simpler approach by selecting two points to derive the coefficients directly:

Let's choose two input-output pairs to construct two equations. For instance, we can pick the pairs (7, -98) and (-6, 58). We then have:

1. For input 7:    -98 = a + 7b
2. For input -6:    58 = a - 6b

Now we can solve this system of equations to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \). We'll solve the first equation for \( a \):

a = -98 - 7b

Substitute this expression for \( a \) in the second equation:

58 = (-98 - 7b) - 6b

Combine like terms:

58 = -98 - 13b

Add 98 to both sides:

156 = -13b

Now divide by -13:

b = -12

Now that we have \( b \), we can solve for \( a \) using the first equation:

a = -98 - 7(-12)
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

Thus, the function that best describes the relationship between these two input-output pairs is:

y = -14 + (-12)x

or written explicitly as requested:

Output: y = -14x^0 - 12x^1

Please note that this function is based on only two points, and it may not perfectly predict other points that you provided, but it is the best fit using the given method.

\[ y = -158 \]

So the output for the input of 12 is -158.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are essentially looking for a linear relationship between the input (x) and the output (y) where ax^0 is a constant term (since anything raised to the 0 power is 1) and bx^1 is a term that involves x linearly.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs:

(7, -98) 
(17, -218) 
(5, -74) 
(3, -50) 
(-6, 58)

We notice that the output decreases as the input increases, suggesting a negative slope (b). To find the specific values of 'a' (y-intercept) and 'b' (slope), we can use two points to first calculate the slope 'b'.

Let's use the points (7, -98) and (17, -218):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (-218 - (-98)) / (17 - 7) = (-218 + 98) / (10) = -120 / 10 = -12

So, our slope 'b' is -12.

Now we need to solve for 'a'. We can choose any of the given points for this purpose. Let's use the point (7, -98):

y = a * 7^0 - 12 * 7
-98 = a * 1 - 84

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\). The equation simplifies to \(y = a + bx\), because \(x^0\) is 1 for all x except 0.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of linear equations to solve for \(a\) and \(b\). However, looking at the outputs, we notice that they are negative and decrease as the inputs increase. This suggests that \(b\) is negative.

Looking at the difference between consecutive inputs and their corresponding outputs, we observe the following pattern:

For inputs 5 and 7 (a difference of 2), the difference in outputs is -98 - (-74) = -24.
For inputs 3 and 5 (a difference of 2), the difference in outputs is -74 - (-50) = -24.

This consistent difference of -24 when the input increases by 2 suggests that \(b\) might be -12 (because -12 times the input increase of 2 equals the output difference of -24).

Let's test this hypothesis with an input-output pair:

For input 7, using \(b = -12\):
Output: -98
Let's try to find \(a\) using this input-output pair:
-98 = a + (-12 × 7)
-98 = a - 84
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

Now we have \(a\) and \(b\). Let's write the function as:
\( y = -14 + (-12x) \)
Or, simplifying:
\( y = -14 - 12x \)

To verify this is correct, we can plug in another pair to see if it holds true:

\( y = -14 - 12(17) \)
\( y = -14 - 204 \)
\( y = -218 \)

Now we need to find the constants a and b that fit the given set of input-output pairs. To do this, we can use two of the given points to create a system of equations and solve for a and b.

Let's take the input-output pairs (7, -98) and (-6, 58) as examples to form our equations:

1. For input 7, output -98:
-98 = a + 7b

2. For input -6, output 58:
58 = a - 6b

Now we have the system of two equations:
(1) a + 7b = -98
(2) a - 6b = 58

We can solve this system using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

(1) - (2): (a + 7b) - (a - 6b) = -98 - 58
            a + 7b - a + 6b = -156

For x = -13: y = -197
For x = -11: y = -169
For x = 20: y = 265
For x = -10: y = -155
For x = 7: y = 83

The term ax^0 is simply a, as any number (x) to the power of 0 is 1. 

So the formula simplified is y = a + bx.

Let's find a and b by looking at the patterns. 

Examining the changes between inputs and corresponding changes in outputs:

From x = -13 to x = -11 (an increase of 2), y increases from -197 to -169 (an increase of 28).

From x = -11 to x = -10 (an increase of 1), y increases from -169 to -155 (an increase of 14).

This suggests a pattern where each increment of 1 in x corresponds to an increase of 14 in y. Therefore, we can hypothesize b = 14.

Now let's test this with one of the given points. Using x = 7:

If y = a + 14x, and if y = 83 when x = 7,

83 = a + 14(7),
83 = a + 98.

Solving for a gives us:

a = 83 - 98,
a = -15.

So our hypothesized function is y = -15 + 14x.

- For x = -13: y = -15 + 14(-13) = -15 - 182 = -197 (matches given output).

Using the data point (-13, -197):

    To capture the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that ax^0 is simply a constant term since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, ax^0 = a. The term bx^1 is a linear term since anything raised to the power of 1 is itself, so bx^1 = bx.

With this understanding, we are effectively looking for a function in the form of y = a + bx.

Given the inputs and outputs, we can create a system of equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'. However, we only need two points to determine a straight line, so let's use two of the given pairs of inputs and outputs. Usually, choosing two points that seem simpler to work with or which have nice properties (like small numbers or easy to handle negatives) can make the math easier. Here, let's use the points (-10, -155) and (7, 83).

Using point (-10, -155):
-155 = a + b(-10) ... [Equation 1]

Using point (7, 83):
83 = a + b(7) ... [Equation 2]

Now we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to get 'a' and 'b'.

Let's multiply Equation 1 by 7 and Equation 2 by 10 to eliminate 'a' when we subtract one equation from the other:

7(-155) = 7a + 7b(-10)

This simplifies to:

830 = 10a + 70b ... [Equation 4]

-1085 + 830 = 7a - 70b + 10a + 70b
-255 = 17a
a = -255 / 17
a = -15

Now we can substitute 'a' back into either of our original equations to find 'b'. Let's use Equation 1:

-155 = -15 + b(-10)

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can recognize that ax^0 is a constant term (since x^0 = 1 for all x except x = 0). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We can use two pairs of input-output values to set up a system of equations and solve for a and b. Let's use the inputs -13 and -11 with their corresponding outputs -197 and -169:

For input -13:
-197 = a + b(-13)

For input -11:
-169 = a + b(-11)

Now we have two equations:
1) -197 = a - 13b
2) -169 = a - 11b

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation to eliminate a, we get:
-197 - (-169) = a - 13b - (a - 11b)
-28 = -2b
b = 14

Now let's find a by substituting b back into either equation 1 or 2. Using equation 2 for example:
-169 = a - 11(14)
-169 = a - 154
a = -169 + 154
a = -15

So our function is:
y = -15 + 14x

    Let's refer to the inputs as `x` and the outputs as `y`. Given the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to solve for `a` and `b`.

Since `x^0` is always 1 for any `x` that isn't zero, the equation simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

Let's use two of the given input-output pairs to create a system of two equations in order to solve for `a` and `b`.

Using Input: -13, Output: -197:
-a + 13b = 197 … (1)

And using Input: -10, Output: -155:
-a + 10b = 155 … (2)

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate `a`, we get:
13b - 10b = 197 - 155
3b = 42
b = 42 / 3
b = 14

Next, let's substitute `b = 14` back into equation (2):
-a + 10(14) = 155
-a + 140 = 155
-a = 155 - 140
-a = 15

    To find a function that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can notice that ax^0 is essentially a constant term (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is a linear term in x.

Let's call the constant term ""a"" and the linear coefficient ""b"". So we can restate the function in a clearer form as:

y = a + bx

We have five pairs of inputs and outputs, which give us five equations to solve for a and b:

1. For input x = 9, output y = 160:
160 = a + 9b

2. For input x = 13, output y = 228:
228 = a + 13b

3. For input x = -4, output y = -61:
-61 = a - 4b

4. For input x = 15, output y = 262:
262 = a + 15b

5. For input x = -20, output y = -333:
-333 = a - 20b

We can use any two equations to solve for a and b. Let's use equations 1 and 3 to set up a system of equations:

160 = a + 9b
-61 = a - 4b

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

160 - (-61) = (a + 9b) - (a - 4b)
221 = 13b
b = 221 / 13
b = 17

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into one of the equations to solve for a:

160 = a + 9b
160 = a + 9(17)
160 = a + 153
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

With a and b determined, the function describing the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can set up a system of linear equations using the given input-output pairs. The term ax^0 simplifies to a because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function becomes y = a + bx. We can use two of the provided input-output pairs to set up our equations and solve for a and b.

Let’s use the input-output pairs (9, 160) and (13, 228):

1. From the pair (9, 160), we get the equation:
160 = a + 9b

2. From the pair (13, 228), we get the equation:
228 = a + 13b

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
1) a + 9b = 160
2) a + 13b = 228

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

(228 - 160) = (a + 13b) - (a + 9b)
68 = 4b

Now solve for b:
b = 68 / 4
b = 17

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for a. Let's use the first equation:

a + 9(17) = 160
a + 153 = 160
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

Therefore, the coefficients a and b are:
a = 7

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we have to determine the values of 'a' and 'b'. The term ax^0 is effectively a constant, since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, ax^0 is simply 'a'. The term bx^1 is just bx, as anything raised to the power of 1 is itself. Thus, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Given the data points, we can use two of them to calculate 'a' and 'b'. Let's choose the inputs and outputs (x, y) pairs (9, 160) and (-4, -61) to form a system of linear equations:

1. Using (9, 160): 160 = a + b(9)
2. Using (-4, -61): -61 = a + b(-4)

Now we can solve this system for 'a' and 'b'. From the first equation, we have:

a = 160 - 9b ...(1)

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

-61 = (160 - 9b) + b(-4)
-61 = 160 - 9b - 4b
-61 = 160 - 13b
13b = 160 + 61
13b = 221
b = 221 / 13
b = 17

Now that we have 'b', we can solve for 'a' using either equation, but we'll use equation (1):

a = 160 - 9b
a = 160 - 9(17)
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

Thus, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's take two of the given input-output pairs to solve for a and b. We will use the simplest pairs to make calculations easier:

Input: 9, Output: 160 implies
\( 160 = a + 9b \) ... (1)

Input: -4, Output: -61 implies
\( -61 = a + (-4)b \) ... (2)

Now we can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using these two equations:

From equation (2), let's make \( a \) the subject:

\( a = -61 + 4b \) ... (3)

Replace \( a \) in equation (1):

\( 160 = (-61 + 4b) + 9b \) 

\( 160 = -61 + 13b \) 

Therefore:

\( 13b = 160 + 61 \) 

\( 13b = 221 \) 

\( b = \frac{221}{13} \) 

\( b = 17 \)

    To find a linear function that fits the given points (x, y), we need to find the coefficients a and b in the linear equation y = ax^0 + bx^1 = a + bx that correspond to the y-intercept and the slope of the line, respectively.

Given the pairs (9, 160), (13, 228), (-4, -61), (15, 262), and (-20, -333), we can use the first two points to calculate the slope (b).

Using points (9, 160) and (13, 228):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (228 - 160) / (13 - 9)
b = 68 / 4
b = 17

Now we have the slope b = 17. We will use one of the points to find the y-intercept (a). I'll use the point (9, 160).

    Given that the function should be in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can recognize that by its nature, \( ax^0 \) is equivalent to \( a \), because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Additionally, \( bx^1 \) is the same as \( bx \), because any number to the power of 1 is itself. Therefore, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Given the inputs and outputs, we have a set of equations where the output \( y \) corresponds to each input \( x \):

2. For \( x = 7 \), \( y = -145 \), so \( -145 = a + b(7) \) or \( -145 = a + 7b \).
3. For \( x = -10 \), \( y = 161 \), so \( 161 = a + b(-10) \) or \( 161 = a - 10b \).
4. For \( x = 9 \), \( y = -181 \), so \( -181 = a + b(9) \) or \( -181 = a + 9b \).
5. For \( x = -20 \), \( y = 341 \), so \( 341 = a + b(-20) \) or \( 341 = a - 20b \).

Now, we are looking for values of \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy all these equations. To find \( a \) and \( b \), we need to solve this system of equations. Since we have two unknowns and five equations, this is an overdetermined system. However, we notice a pattern in the input-output pairs:

When \( x = -2 \), \( y \) is a positive number, specifically 17.
When \( x = 7 \), \( y \) is negative and an odd multiple of 7 (7 times 5, but negative).
When \( x = -10 \), \( y \) is positive and 1 more than a multiple of 10 (10 times 16, plus 1).
When \( x = 9 \), \( y \) is negative and 1 less than a multiple of 9 (9 times 20, but negative).
When \( x = -20 \), \( y \) is positive and 1 more than a double multiple of 10 (20 times 17, plus 1).

These rules suggest that \( b = -16 \), because the output decreases by 16 for each increase in input by 1, respectively, since \( x \) and \( y \) are alternating signs with the input, the difference seems to center around multiples of the absolute input value. Also, \( a \) appears to be 1 more than the multiples of the absolute values (as seen with 161 and 341), when \( x \) is negative.

Using these clues, let's check if \( b = -16 \) is consistent with the given inputs and outputs.

If \( b = -16 \):
For \( x = -2 \), \( y \) should be \( a - 2(-16) = a + 32 \). Since \( y = 17 \), \( a + 32 = 17 \), so \( a = -15 \).

Now, let's verify if \( a = -15 \) and \( b = -16 \) work for all given data points:
\( 17 = (-15) -16(-2) = -15 + 32 = 17 \) [Correct]
\( -145 = (-15) -16(7) = -15 - 112 = -127 \) [Incorrect]

Since the second calculation does not produce the expected output, our initial guess for \( b \) was incorrect. Let's correct ourselves by actually solving the system of equations. Using the equations 1 and 2, we can solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

From equation 1 (\( 17 = a - 2b \)), we can express \( a \) in terms of \( b \): \( a = 17 + 2b \).
Substitute \( a \) from equation 1 into equation 2 (\( -145 = a + 7b \)):
\( -145 = (17 + 2b) + 7b \)
\( -145 = 17 + 9b \)
\( -162 = 9b \)
\( b = -18 \)

Now that \( b \) is found, substitute \( b \) into the expression for \( a \):
\( a = 17 + 2(-18) \)
\( a = 17 - 36 \)
\( a = -19 \)

So the function that describes the data is:

\( y = a + bx \)
\( y = -19 - 18x \)

Let's verify with one of the inputs:

For \( x = 7 \),
\( y = -19 - 18(7) \)
\( y = -19 - 126 \)
\( y = -145 \), which matches our provided data point.

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\( y = -19 - 18x \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the given input-output pairs, we should first understand that ax^0 is just a because any number (except 0) raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, we are looking for a function in the form y = a + bx.

We have several pairs of input (x) and output (y) values:

1. x = 20, y = -307
2. x = -1, y = 8
3. x = 20, y = -307 (repeated, so we will use it for verification)
4. x = 12, y = -187
5. x = 18, y = -277

Let's use two of these pairs to calculate the values of a and b.

Using the first pair (20, -307) and the second pair (-1, 8):
We have:
-307 = a + 20b
8 = a - b

Now let's solve these equations simultaneously.

From the second equation we can express a:
a = 8 + b

Substituting a into the first equation, we get:
-307 = (8 + b) + 20b
-307 = 8 + 21b
-315 = 21b
b = -315 / 21
b = -15

Now we put the value of b back into the equation for a:
a = 8 + b
a = 8 - 15
a = -7

So the function that describes the data is:
y = -7 + (-15)x
Or simply:
y = -7 - 15x

To verify this, we can check this equation with all the given input-output pairs:

1. For x = 20:
y = -7 - 15(20) = -7 - 300 = -307

2. For x = -1:
y = -7 - 15(-1) = -7 + 15 = 8

3. Again for x = 20 (same as point 1).

4. For x = 12:
y = -7 - 15(12) = -7 - 180 = -187

5. For x = 18:
y = -7 - 15(18) = -7 - 270 = -277

The function y = -7 - 15x is consistent with all given pairs of input and output, thus we can say confidently that this is the function describing the relationship between inputs and outputs.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to interpret \( ax^0 + bx^1 \) correctly:

- \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \neq 0 \). Since there's no indication of zero input, we can simplify \( x^0 \) to 1.
- \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \) because \( x^1 = x \).

Therefore, the function should be written as: \( y = a + bx \).

Since we have multiple inputs and outputs, let's solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using the given pair of input-output values. We can use the inputs and outputs to set up a system of equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \). However, since the inputs 20 lead to the same output -307 consistently, we can use this pair to find \( b \) directly:

Using the input \( x = 20 \) and the output \( y = -307 \):

\( -307 = a + 20b \) (Equation 1)

Now, we need another pair to get a second equation and solve the system. We can use the input \( x = -1 \) and output \( y = 8 \):

\( 8 = a - 1b \) (Equation 2)

Now, let's solve the system consisting of Equation 1 and Equation 2:

From Equation 2, we can express \( a \) as \( a = 8 + b \). Substituting this into Equation 1, we get:

\( -307 = (8 + b) + 20b \)
\( -307 = 8 + 21b \)
\( -315 = 21b \)
\( b = -15 \)

Now, let's find \( a \) by substituting \( b \) back into Equation 2:

\( a = 8 + b \)
\( a = 8 - 15 \)
\( a = -7 \)

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

\( y = -7 + (-15)x \)

    To find a function of the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

We can simplify this because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1:

We will use two points from the given data to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the points (20, -307) and (-1, 8):

For the first point:

\[ -307 = a + b(20) \]
\[ -307 = a + 20b \]
\[ (1) \]

For the second point:

\[ 8 = a + b(-1) \]
\[ 8 = a - b \]
\[ (2) \]

Now we have a system of two equations that we can solve. By subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

\[ -307 - 8 = (a + 20b) - (a - b) \]
\[ -315 = a + 20b - a + b \]
\[ -315 = 21b \]
\[ b = -315 / 21 \]
\[ b = -15 \]

Now let's put the value of \( b \) back into equation (2) to find \( a \):

\[ 8 = a - (-15) \]
\[ 8 = a + 15 \]
\[ a = 8 - 15 \]
\[ a = -7 \]

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

where \( y \) is the output, \( x \) is the input, \( a \) is the y-intercept when \( x = 0 \), and \( b \) is the slope of the line.

We need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that best fit the provided data. Since we have multiple input-output pairs, we can set up a system of equations using two of the pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). However, since we have got two identical input-output pairs (Input: 20, Output: -307), we will use another pair instead to ensure we have distinct points to solve our linear system.

Let's use the input-output pairs (20, -307) and (-1, 8).

For the first pair (20, -307):

\[ -307 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1 \]
\[ -307 = a + 20b \]

For the second pair (-1, 8):

\[ 8 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1 \]
\[ 8 = a - b \]

Now let's solve this system of equations.

From the second equation:

\[ a = 8 + b \]

Substitute \( a \) into the first equation:

\[ -307 = (8 + b) + 20b \]
\[ -307 = 8 + 21b \]
\[ -315 = 21b \]
\[ b = -315 / 21 \]
\[ b = -15 \]

Now substitute \( b \) back into the second equation to find \( a \):

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can use two data points to solve for the coefficients a and b.

Let's use the following two points: (20, -307) and (-1, 8).

For the first point (20, -307):
-307 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
-307 = a + 20b ... (1)

For the second point (-1, 8):
8 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)^1
8 = a - b ... (2)

Now we solve this system of equations for a and b:

Add equation (2) to equation (1):
-307 + 8 = (a + 20b) + (a - b)
-299 = 2a + 19b

Divide the whole equation by 2:
-299/2 = a + 19b/2

Express a in terms of b using equation (2):
a = 8 + b

Substitute the expression for a into the divided equation:
-299/2 = (8 + b) + 19b/2
Multiply everything by 2 to clear the fraction:
-299 = (16 + 2b) + 19b
-299 = 16 + 21b
Subtract 16 from both sides:
-315 = 21b
Divide by 21:
b = -15

Now, find a using equation (2) and b = -15:
8 = a - (-15)
8 = a + 15
Subtract 15 from both sides:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to calculate the coefficients `a` and `b` that best fit the given input-output pairs. Here, `x` represents the input and `y` represents the output.

Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can see that it simplifies to y = a + bx, because x^0 is always 1 for any x that is not zero.

We can use two sample points to find `a` and `b`.

Let's select (Input: 13, Output: -66) and (Input: 0, Output: 12) to set our system of equations. Using the inputs and outputs:

For Input 0 (x = 0):

This form is a linear function where \( x^0 \) is always 1 (since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1), so the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Our goal is to find 'a' and 'b' such that:

2. For x = -20, y = 132:
\( 132 = a - 20b \)

3. For x = 18, y = -96:
\( -96 = a + 18b \)

4. For x = 0, y = 12:
\( 12 = a + 0b \)
\( 12 = a \)

So we have our 'a' value, which is 12. Inserting that into one of the previous equations to find 'b':

\( -66 = 12 + 13b \)
\( -66 - 12 = 13b \)
\( -78 = 13b \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can treat this as a linear equation \( y = a + bx \), since \( x^0 = 1 \) by definition.

Given two points, we can determine the slope \( b \) of the line using the formula for slope:

\[ b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

However, since we have more than two points, we should check that these points form a line with the same slope. Let's calculate the slope between each pair of points to verify if they have the same slope:

Using points (-17, -325) and (-5, -109):
\[ b = \frac{-109 - (-325)}{-5 - (-17)} \]
\[ b = \frac{216}{12} \]
\[ b = 18 \]

Now let's check if the same slope applies to the pair (16, 269) and (-15, -289) as a sanity check:
\[ b = \frac{269 - (-289)}{16 - (-15)} \]
\[ b = \frac{558}{31} \]
\[ b = 18 \]

The fact that the slope is the same for each pair indicates that the data points lie on the same line.

Now that we have the slope \( b = 18 \), we need to find \( a \), which is the y-intercept of the line. We can substitute one of the points into the equation to solve for \( a \):

Let's take the point (-17, -325) and plug it into \( y = a + 18x \):

\[ -325 = a + 18(-17) \]
\[ -325 = a - 306 \]
\[ a = -325 + 306 \]
\[ a = -19 \]

So, our function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\[ y = -19 + 18x \]

Which in the requested form as \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) would be:

\[ y = -19x^0 + 18x^1 \]

However, it should be noted that the term \( -19x^0 \) simplifies to just \( -19 \), because \( x^0 \) is always 1. So, we can simply write:

\[ y = -19 + 18x \]

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are essentially looking for a linear function y = b * x + a, where a is the y-intercept (constant term) and b is the slope of the line. Given the five sets of inputs and outputs, we can use any two points to calculate the slope b, and then use one of the points to solve for a.

Let's take two points (x1, y1) = (-17, -325) and (x2, y2) = (-5, -109) to calculate the slope b.

The formula for the slope b is:
b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

By plugging in the values:
b = (-109 - (-325)) / (-5 - (-17))
b = (216) / (12)
b = 18

Now we have the slope b, we can use the point (x1, y1) = (-17, -325) to find the y-intercept a.

y1 = b * x1 + a
-325 = 18 * (-17) + a
-325 = -306 + a
a = -325 + 306

    To find the function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to determine the constants `a` and `b` such that the function fits the given input-output pairs.

Notice that `x^0` is always 1 for any non-zero `x`, so `ax^0` is essentially a constant term, `a`. Therefore, the form of the function simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

Now we have two unknowns and need to use at least two input-output pairs to find a system of equations to solve for `a` and `b`. We can use the following two pairs as an example:

Input: -17, Output: -325
Input: -5, Output: -109

From the first pair, we have:
-325 = a + b(-17)  ... (1)

From the second pair, we have:
-109 = a + b(-5)   ... (2)

We can solve this system of linear equations. Let's calculate equation (1) minus (2):

(-325 - (-109)) = a + b(-17) - (a + b(-5))
-216 = -12b

b = 18

With b determined, we can substitute it into either equation (1) or (2) to find a. We will use equation (2):

-109 = a + 18(-5)
-109 = a - 90
a = -109 + 90
a = -19

Now we have the function:

y = -19 + 18x

    To find the function that describes the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can notice that the outputs seem to be a linear function of the inputs, given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. In this form, 'a' is the y-intercept and 'b' is the slope of the function. 

Since we suspect that the relationship is linear, we can use two points to determine 'a' and 'b'. Let's choose the first two points for simplicity:

For (x1, y1) = (10, 142) and (x2, y2) = (15, 217), we can set up the following system of equations:

1. 142 = a*10^0 + b*10
2. 217 = a*15^0 + b*15

These simplify to:

1. 142 = a + 10b
2. 217 = a + 15b

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate 'a':

217 - 142 = a + 15b - (a + 10b)
75 = 5b

Now, solve for 'b':

b = 75 / 5
b = 15

Using the value of 'b' in the first equation:

142 = a + 10*15
142 = a + 150

Solve for 'a':

a = 142 - 150
a = -8

    To solve this, we need to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) in the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \). Since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) that is not 0, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We can use two points from the provided inputs and outputs to solve for these coefficients. I'll take the first two points from your data for the calculation:

For Input 10, Output 142:
\( 142 = a + 10b \)  (Equation 1)

For Input 15, Output 217:
\( 217 = a + 15b \)  (Equation 2)

Now, we need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate \( a \):

\( 217 - 142 = (a + 15b) - (a + 10b) \)
\( 75 = 5b \)
\( b = 15 \)

Now we'll substitute \( b \) back into Equation 1 to solve for \( a \):

    The function requested is in the form of a linear equation, which can generally be defined as:

y = ax + b

- \( y \) is the output.
- \( x \) is the input.
- \( a \) is the coefficient of \( x \) (slope of the line).
- \( b \) is the constant term (y-intercept of the line).

We will use two of the given input-output pairs to calculate the values of \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's use the following two pairs: (10, 142) and (-10, -158).

For the first pair where \( x_1 = 10 \) and \( y_1 = 142 \), the equation becomes:

142 = 10a + b ...(1)

For the second pair where \( x_2 = -10 \) and \( y_2 = -158 \), the equation becomes:

-158 = -10a + b ...(2)

Now, let's solve these two equations simultaneously.

Adding the equations (1) and (2):

\( 142 - 158 = 10a - 10a + b + b \)
\( -16 = 2b \)
\( b = \frac{-16}{2} \)
\( b = -8 \)

Now, let's substitute the value of \( b \) back into equation (1):

\( 142 = 10a - 8 \)
\( 150 = 10a \)
\( a = \frac{150}{10} \)
\( a = 15 \)

So the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Note: This simplifies the original form requested (y = ax^0 + bx^1) since ax^0 is a term for the constant b (as x^0 equals 1), and bx^1 is for the term with the variable x, which matches the linear form of the function perfectly:

First, let's look at the data provided to see if there is a pattern that fits the \( y = a + bx \) format (since \( ax^0 = a \) and \( bx^1 = bx \)):

For input -1: 
\( y = a + b(-1) = -8 \) 
which becomes 
\( a - b = -8 \) (Equation 1)

For input 5: 
\( y = a + b(5) = 76 \) 
which becomes 
\( a + 5b = 76 \) (Equation 2)

For input 3: 
\( y = a + b(3) = 48 \)
which becomes 
\( a + 3b = 48 \) (Equation 3)

Similarly, for inputs 8 and 13, we would have:
\( a + 8b = 118 \) (Equation 4)
\( a + 13b = 188 \) (Equation 5)

By looking at how the output increases as the input increases, we can see there is a pattern that suggests a linear relationship since the increases are constant. 

Let's use two data points to find the values of a and b.

Using Equation 2 and Equation 1, which are:

\( a + 5b = 76 \) (Equation 2)
\( a - b = -8 \) (Equation 1)

If we add these two equations together, we eliminate a and can solve for b:
\[ a + 5b + a - b = 76 - 8 \]
\[ 2a + 4b = 68 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ a + 2b = 34 \]
We are left with two simplified equations:

\( a + 2b = 34 \)
\( a - b = -8 \)

Now subtract the second equation from the first one to solve for b:
\[ (a + 2b) - (a - b) = 34 - (-8) \]
\[ a + 2b - a + b = 34 + 8 \]
\[ 3b = 42 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ b = 14 \]

Now, we can use b to solve for a using \( a - b = -8 \):

1. When input x = -1, output y = -8, we get:
-8 = a - b

2. When input x = 5, output y = 76, we get:
76 = a + 5b

We now have a system of equations:
a - b = -8

We can solve this system using algebra. First, we can add both equations to eliminate a:

(a - b) + (a + 5b) = -8 + 76
2a + 4b = 68
a + 2b = 34

Now, let's express a in terms of b:

-3b = -8 - 34
-3b = -42
b = -42 / -3

1. \( -8 = a + b(-1) \) 
2. \( 76 = a + b(5) \) 
3. \( 48 = a + b(3) \) 
4. \( 118 = a + b(8) \) 
5. \( 188 = a + b(13) \) 

Now, we need to find the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy all these equations. To do this, we need to either solve the system of equations or determine the pattern through observation.

Let's check if there's a consistent increment as the input increases. We will look at the change in output as the input increases by 1:

- Input difference from -1 to 3 (difference of 4): \( 48 - (-8) = 56 \)
- Input difference from 3 to 5 (difference of 2): \( 76 - 48 = 28 \)

- Input difference from 8 to 13 (difference of 5): \( 188 - 118 = 70 \)

It looks like every time the input increases by 1, the output increases by 14 (since 56/4 = 28/2 = 42/3 = 70/5 = 14).

Therefore, our slope \( b \) is 14. Now that we have \( b \), we can use one of the equations to solve for \( a \). Using the first equation:

We have several inputs and corresponding outputs which we can use to find a and b. We can start by setting up a system of equations using two of the given data points. Usually, two points would suffice, but given that we have more data, we can use more points to find the best fit line (a regression).

Using the points (-1, -8) and (5, 76):
1. Plugging into the equation y = a*1 + bx: 
   For x = -1, y = -8: -8 = a - b
   For x = 5, y = 76: 76 = a + 5b

Now let us solve this system of equations for a and b.

The two equations we have are:
1. -8 = a - b     (equation 1)
2. 76 = a + 5b    (equation 2)

We can solve for a or b using several methods, such as substitution, elimination, or matrix methods.

I'll use the elimination method:
Add equation 1 to equation 2 to eliminate a:
(-8 = a - b) + (76 = a + 5b)
68 = 6b
b = 68 / 6
b = 11.333...

Now we can substitute b back into either equation 1 or 2 to find a. Using equation 1:

-8 = a - 11.333...
a = -8 + 11.333...
a = 3.333...

However, because the original request did not specify the need for rounded values, and due to the inconsistency with the other data points, it's clear that we cannot accurately determine the relationship with these two points alone. Considering all the data points, we can see that the increase in output does not perfectly fit a linear relationship - the rise is not consistent.

To determine a possible common difference between the x and y values, we could compute the differences in the y values and divide by the differences in the x values for each pair of adjacent points:

(76 - (-8)) / (5 - (-1)) = 84 / 6 = 14
(48 - 76) / (3 - 5) = (-28) / (-2) = 14
(118 - 48) / (8 - 3) = 70 / 5 = 14
(188 - 118) / (13 - 8) = 70 / 5 = 14

The difference is consistent (14), which means a possible equation of the line could be y = 14x + C, where C is the y-intercept. To find the y-intercept (C), we can substitute any given x-y pair into the equation. Let's use the first point (-1, -8):

-8 = 14*(-1) + C
-8 = -14 + C
C = -8 + 14
C = 6

Considering the regular increase in output relative to the input and applying these calculations, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs could be written as:

y = 14x + 6

This equation is consistent with the data points provided, with the relationship simulating a linear function where each increment of x increases y by 14 units and the y-intercept is at 6 when x is 0.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify this to y = a + bx, because x^0 = 1 for any x (except for x=0).

Now, let's use two data points to solve for a and b. I'll use the points (-1, -8) and (5, 76).

For the first point (-1, -8):
-8 = a + b(-1)
-8 = a - b ...(1)

For the second point (5, 76):
76 = a + b(5)
76 = a + 5b ...(2)

Now, let's solve the system of linear equations.

From equation (1):
a = b - 8

Substitute a from equation (1) into equation (2):
76 = (b - 8) + 5b
76 = 6b - 8
84 = 6b
b = 84 / 6
b = 14

Now that we have the value of b, let's solve for a:
a = b - 8
a = 14 - 8
a = 6

Now we have the values for a and b, so the function is:
y = a + bx
y = 6 + 14x

So the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs given in the problem statement is:

Output: y = 6 + 14x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we need to determine the constants a and b.

Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we recognize that this is a linear relationship, where ax^0 is a constant term (since any number to the 0 power equals 1) and bx^1 is simply bx. Therefore, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Now, we will use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for the constants a and b. Let's use the inputs 1 and -19, with their respective outputs 2 and 122.

For the input 1:
2 = a + b(1)
2 = a + b

For the input -19:
122 = a + b(-19)
122 = a - 19b

We have two equations:
1) 2 = a + b
2) 122 = a - 19b

Let's solve these equations simultaneously. We can start by subtracting equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a:

122 - 2 = a - 19b - (a + b)
120 = -19b - b
120 = -20b
b = -6

Now that we have the value for b, we can substitute it back into equation 1 to find a:

2 = a + b
2 = a - 6
a = 8

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 8 - 6x

Or, in the explicit form requested:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1
Output: y = 8x^0 - 6x^1

This linear function should now correctly map the given pairs of input and output within the potential measurement or observational error inherent in the provided data points.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we interpret it as \( y = a + bx \), because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) except for \( x = 0 \), which is not relevant in this set of inputs.

We have a set of input-output pairs here:

1. \( (1, 2) \)
2. \( (-19, 122) \)
3. \( (17, -94) \)
4. \( (15, -82) \)
5. \( (-6, 44) \)

We need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \). This can be typically done using a least squares method or other numerical methods to find the best fit for the given data. Here, however, since we're asked to find a single function that fits all data points exactly and we have only two unknowns, we can use two of the points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's pick the first two points to set up the system of equations.

From the first point (1, 2),
\( 2 = a + b(1) \)
\( 2 = a + b \) -- (1)

From the second point (-19, 122),
\( 122 = a + b(-19) \)
\( 122 = a - 19b \) -- (2)

Now, we can solve these two equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).

Subtracting (1) from (2) to eliminate \( a \), we get
\( 122 - 2 = -19b - b \)
\( 120 = -20b \)
\( b = -6 \)

Now, we put \( b = -6 \) into equation (1),
\( 2 = a + (-6) \)
\( a = 8 \)

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is essentially y = a + bx, we need to determine the constants a and b.

This function represents a straight line, where `a` is the y-intercept and `b` is the slope. Given the datapoints:

(1, 2)
(-19, 122)
(17, -94)
(15, -82)
(-6, 44)

we need to solve for `a` and `b` such that the line fits the data as best as possible. However, since this system can only detect patterns and not perform actual regression analysis, we can only estimate `a` and `b` using the given data points or we can solve it analytically by setting up a system of linear equations using two points and solving for 'a' and 'b'.

Let's use the two pairs of points to set up two equations:

For (1, 2): 2 = a + b(1)
For (-6, 44): 44 = a + b(-6)

Now, let's solve for `a` and `b` using these two equations:

From the first equation:
2 = a + b(1)
2 = a + b
b = 2 - a

Now plug the value of `b` into the second equation:
44 = a + b(-6)
44 = a + (2 - a)(-6)
44 = a - 12 + 6a
44 = 7a - 12
7a = 56
a = 8

Now that we have `a`, we can solve for `b`:
b = 2 - a
b = 2 - 8
b = -6

Hence, the function that seems to best fit the given data points, according to our calculations, is:

y = 8 - 6x

However, please note that with more than two points, this could be an over-simplified model, as real data often does not fit perfectly in a straight line. The most accurate way to find 'a' and 'b' would be to use a method like least squares regression which requires calculation beyond pattern detection.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we will solve for 'a' and 'b' in the equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. This is effectively a linear equation y = a + bx, where ax^0 is simply a constant (a) and bx^1 is the product of b and the input x.

Given the input/output pairs:
1. (1, 2)
2. (-19, 122)
3. (17, -94)
4. (15, -82)
5. (-6, 44)

We will consider two pairs of points to determine the linear function.

For the pair (1, 2) and (-19, 122), the linear equation would be derived as following:

1. For (1,2):
2 = a * 1^0 + b * 1^1
2 = a + b

2. For (-19, 122):
122 = a * (-19)^0 + b * (-19)^1
122 = a - 19b

Now we have a system of equations:
a + b = 2
a - 19b = 122

We can solve for 'a' and 'b' using substitution or elimination. Let's subtract the second equation from the first:

(a + b) - (a - 19b) = 2 - 122
20b = -120
b = -120 / 20
b = -6

Now we substitute b back into the first equation to find a:
a + (-6) = 2
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

Therefore, the function that fits the given input-output pairs is:

y = 8x^0 - 6x^1

We can use the given input-output pairs to determine the coefficients a and b. Let's denote the inputs as x_i and outputs as y_i. We have:

1. y_1 = a + b * 1 = a + b = 2
2. y_2 = a + b * (-19) = a - 19b = 122
3. y_3 = a + b * 17 = a + 17b = -94
4. y_4 = a + b * 15 = a + 15b = -82
5. y_5 = a + b * (-6) = a - 6b = 44

Now we have a system of equations with two variables a and b and five equations. Generally, we only need two equations to solve for two variables, but since we have five and the real-world data can be noisy, this is likely a case for a least squares approximation.

However, since we are to define a single function that exactly fits all given data points, we will use two of the equations to solve for a and b. We can pick any two pairs, but it might be simplest to use the pairs (1, 2) and (-6, 44) for calculation.

From (1, 2):
a + b = 2   (Equation 1)

a - 6b = 44  (Equation 2)

Solving for a and b using these two equations:

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

a + b - a + 6b = -42

b = -42 / 7

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the given data, we need to solve for the constants a and b.

First, note that ax^0 is just a because any nonzero number to the power of zero is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Looking at the input-output pairs, it would seem that for each unit decrease in x, the change in y is consistent. A simple way to find the function is to determine the difference in y for a single unit change in x.

Let's find the difference between two pairs of data:

Using the pair (-17, -292) and (-16, -275),
y2 - y1 = (-275) - (-292) = 17
x2 - x1 = (-16) - (-17) = 1

Now, we get the value of b by dividing the change in y by the change in x.
b = 17 / 1 = 17

This suggests a constant increase of 17 in output for every 1 unit increase in input. Therefore, b = 17.

Now, we need to solve for a using one of the input-output pairs. Let's use the pair (1, 14):

2) a - 17b = -292

We can solve this system of equations for a and b.

a = 14 - b

\( 2 \times 130 = 2 \times (a - 7b) \)
\( 260 = 2a - 14b \)

Now, add this result to equation 1 to eliminate \( a \):

\( -290 + 260 = (a + 14b) + (2a - 14b) \)
\( -30 = 3a \)

Divide by 3 to find \( a \):

\( a = \frac{-30}{3} \)
\( a = -10 \)

Now that we have \( a \), we can substitute it back into either equation to find \( b \). We'll use equation 2:

\( 130 = -10 - 7b \)
\( 140 = -7b \)
\( b = \frac{140}{-7} \)
\( b = -20 \)

So, the function that describes the data is:

\( y = -10 + (-20)x \)
\( y = -10 - 20x \)

This function fits the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) with \( a = -10 \) and \( b = -20 \), hence:

Function: \( y = -10x^0 - 20x^1 \)

    ","To generate the output for the input 10 using the function \( y = -10 - 20x \), we substitute \( x \) with 10:

\( y = -10 - 20(10) \)
\( y = -10 - 200 \)
\( y = -210 \)

Therefore, the output is:
Output: -210",-210,True,"[-20, -10]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we'll first recognize that \( ax^0 = a \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x that is not zero. Thus, our function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We have the following pairs of inputs and outputs:

1. Input: -7, Output: 130
2. Input: 14, Output: -290
3. Input: -12, Output: 230
4. Input: 16, Output: -330

We need to find constants a and b such that the above pairs satisfy the equation \( y = a + bx \). Using two pairs of these data points, we can set up two equations and solve for a and b.

Let's take pairs (1) and (2):
For Input -7: \( 130 = a + b(-7) \)  ... (i)
For Input 14: \( -290 = a + b(14) \) ... (ii)

Now, we will solve these two equations to find a and b.

First, rearrange both (i) and (ii) to express a in terms of b:
\( a = 130 + 7b \)  ... (i')
\( a = -290 - 14b \) ... (ii')

Equating (i') and (ii'), we get:
\( 130 + 7b = -290 - 14b \)

Solve for b:
\( 21b = -420 \)
\( b = -20 \)

Substitute b back into (i') to solve for a:
\( a = 130 + 7(-20) \)
\( a = 130 - 140 \)
\( a = -10 \)

Our function is then \( y = -10 + (-20)x \) or simplified to \( y = -10 - 20x \).

Now let's verify with inputs and outputs if the function \( y = -10 - 20x \) works for the given points:
1. For \( x = -7 \), \( y = -10 - 20(-7) = -10 + 140 = 130 \) ✓
2. For \( x = 14 \), \( y = -10 - 20(14) = -10 - 280 = -290 \)  ✓
3. For \( x = -12 \), \( y = -10 - 20(-12) = -10 + 240 = 230 \)  ✓
4. For \( x = 16 \), \( y = -10 - 20(16) = -10 - 320 = -330 \)  ✓

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the data, let's first simplify the equation to acknowledge that x^0 is always 1. Thus, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx, where a and b are constants that we need to find.

Let's use the given inputs and outputs to create a system of linear equations. Since you gave me a set of inputs and corresponding outputs, I can set up the equations as follows:

For input -7 and output 130: 
130 = a + b(-7)    -> Equation 1

For input 14 and output -290:
-290 = a + b(14)   -> Equation 2

For input -12 and output 230:
230 = a + b(-12)   -> Equation 3

For input 16 and output -330 (given twice, but only needed once):
-330 = a + b(16)   -> Equation 4

Now, let's solve the system of equations. We'll use Equation 1 and Equation 2 to eliminate a and find b:

Equation 1: 130 = a - 7b
Equation 2: -290 = a + 14b

Multiplying Equation 1 by 2 to help eliminate 'a', we get:
260 = 2a - 14b

Adding this to Equation 2:
-290 = a + 14b
260 = 2a - 14b
-----------------
-30 = 3a

Now solve for a:
a = -30 / 3
a = -10

Now that we have 'a', we can substitute it into Equation 1 to find 'b':

130 = -10 - 7b
140 = -7b
b = -20

So the function that describes the data is y = -10 + (-20)x or simplified:
y = -10 - 20x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the given data points, let's start by understanding the structure:

The term ax^0 is the same as a*1, since anything to the power of zero equals one. This means ax^0 is a constant term, effectively a.

The term bx^1 is the same as bx, as anything to the power of one is itself.

Given the form y = a + bx, we need to find the appropriate values for a and b that will describe the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y).

Using two data points, we can set up two equations and then solve for a and b:

Using the first data point (-7, 130):
130 = a + b(-7) ... (1)

Using any other data point, for example, (14, -290):
-290 = a + b(14) ... (2)

Now let's solve this system of linear equations.

Multiplying equation (1) by 2, to align with the factor of the b from equation (2):
260 = 2a - 14b ... (3)

Adding equation (3) to equation (2) to cancel out b:
-30 = 3a
a = -30 / 3
a = -10

Now plug the value of a into equation (1) to solve for b:
130 = -10 - 7b
140 = -7b
b = 140 / -7
b = -20

Therefore, the function in the form y = a + bx that fits the data given is:
y = -10 - 20x

This can be rearranged in the requested format to:
y = -10x^0 - 20x^1 

So the resulting function description is:

    To find the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the given inputs and outputs. The form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 \) is always \( 1 \).

Let's use two data points to determine \( a \) and \( b \).

Using the points (-7, 130) and (14, -290):
1. \( y = a + bx \) with \( x = -7 \) gives us \( 130 = a - 7b \) (Equation 1)
2. \( y = a + bx \) with \( x = 14 \) gives us \( -290 = a + 14b \) (Equation 2)

Let's solve these two equations simultaneously.

From Equation 1:
\[ 130 = a - 7b \]
\[ a = 130 + 7b \] (Equation 3)

Plugging Equation 3 into Equation 2 gives us:
\[ -290 = (130 + 7b) + 14b \]
\[ -290 = 130 + 21b \]
\[ -420 = 21b \]
\[ b = -20 \]

And using \( b = -20 \) in Equation 3:
\[ a = 130 + 7(-20) \]
\[ a = 130 - 140 \]
\[ a = -10 \]

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and the outputs is:

    To determine the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can use the given pairs of values to generate a system of equations. Given that we need to find the function in the form of:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any x that is not 0. We will use the provided input-output pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Since the same input-output pairs are repeated, we only need to consider two unique pairs for our calculation:

1. For the input \( x = -14 \), the output \( y = -97 \):
\[ -97 = a + b(-14) \]

2. For the input \( x = 7 \), the output \( y = 50 \):
\[ 50 = a + b(7) \]

Let's solve this system of linear equations:

From the first equation:
\[ a = -97 - b(-14) \]
\[ a = -97 + 14b \]

Substitute \( a \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 50 = (-97 + 14b) + 7b \]
\[ 50 = -97 + 21b \]
\[ 147 = 21b \]
\[ b = 7 \]

Now that we have \( b \), we can substitute it back into the equation for \( a \):
\[ a = -97 + 14(7) \]
\[ a = -97 + 98 \]
\[ a = 1 \]

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the input and output, we can consider ax^0 + bx^1 to be a linear function, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope. This is equivalent to y = a + bx, because x^0 = 1 for any x that is not equal to zero.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs:

1. When x = -14, y = -97
2. When x = 7, y = 50
3. When x = 2, y = 15

We will use two of these points to solve for a and b.

Let's use the first and the third points (-14, -97) and (2, 15).

We can set up two equations:

For x = -14, y = -97:
-97 = a + b(-14)

For x = 2, y = 15:
15 = a + b(2)

We have two equations now:
1. -97 = a - 14b
2. 15 = a + 2b

Let's solve this system of equations by using the method of substitution or elimination. We'll use the elimination method here.

If we multiply the second equation by 7, we get:
3. 105 = 7a + 14b

Now we add equation 1 and equation 3 to eliminate b:
-97 + 105 = a - 14b + 7a + 14b
8 = 8a
a = 1

Now we substitute a into one of our initial equations to find b:

b = 7

1. For input -14, output -97:

Now we have two equations:

\[ b = 7 \]

Given the input-output pairs, we can create a system of equations to solve for a and b. We can use any two distinct points for this. Let's take the points (7, 50) and (-14, -97).

For the input 7 (x = 7) and the output 50 (y = 50), the equation is:

Multiply equation (1) by 2 to prepare for elimination with equation (2):

We can use these points to create a system of equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'. However, in order to derive a specific function from the given points, we should ideally have only two points, since this appears to be a linear function and you need exactly two points to define a line. Let's use the first two points for this purpose:

For the point (5, -26):
-26 = a + 5b  --(1)

For the point (1, -14):
-14 = a + 1b  --(2)

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate 'a' and solve for 'b':

(-26) - (-14) = (a + 5b) - (a + b)
-26 + 14 = a + 5b - a - b
-12 = 4b
b = -3

Using this value of 'b' in equation (2):

1) a + 5b = -26
2) a +  b = -14

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to solve for b:
(5b - b) = -26 - (-14)
4b = -12
b = -12 / 4
b = -3

Now we can solve for a using equation (2):
a - 3(1) = -14
a - 3 = -14
a = -14 + 3
a = -11

Therefore, the function is:
y = -11 + (-3)x

y = -11 - 3x

    To find the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) for the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we can use two points to set up a system of linear equations.

The function simplifies to \(y = a + bx\), since \(x^0 = 1\) for any \(x\) that is not zero.

Let's pick two points from the given data to construct our system.
Using the points \( (5, -26) \) and \( (1, -14) \), we can set up the following system of equations:

1. For the input \(x = 5\), the output \(y = -26\):
\[
-26 = a + 5b
\]

2. For the input \(x = 1\), the output \(y = -14\):
\[
-14 = a + 1b
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
-14 = a + b
\]

Now we can solve this system of linear equations:

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \(a\):
\[
(-26) - (-14) = (a + 5b) - (a + b)
\]
\[
-12 = 4b
\]
\[
b = -3

Now we can plug \(b\) back into the second equation to solve for \(a\):
\[
-14 = a + (-3)(1)

\[
-14 = a - 3

\[

    To find a linear function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we must find values for 'a' and 'b' that fit the given input-output pairs. The expression \( ax^0 + bx^1 \) simplifies to \( a + bx \) since any nonzero number raised to the 0th power is 1.

Given this simplification, our task is to solve for 'a' and 'b' such that the equation:

\[ y = a + bx \]

matches the provided data points.

Let's consider two of the data points to form a system of linear equations:

Using the data point (1, -14):

\[ -14 = a + b(1) \]
\[ -14 = a + b \]

Using the data point (5, -26):

\[ -26 = a + b(5) \]
\[ -26 = a + 5b \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:

1. \( -14 = a + b \)
2. \( -26 = a + 5b \)

Our goal is to solve for 'a' and 'b'. We can do this by subtracting the first equation from the second one to eliminate 'a':

\[ -26 - (-14) = (a + 5b) - (a + b) \]
\[ -12 = 4b \]
\[ b = -3 \]

Now that we have the value for 'b', we can solve for 'a' using either of the original equations. Let's use the first one:

\[ -14 = a + b \]
\[ -14 = a - 3 \]
\[ a = -14 + 3 \]
\[ a = -11 \]

So, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we notice that ax^0 is just a (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is simply bx (since any number to the power of 1 is itself). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We need to determine the values of a and b that best fit the given data points. We can do this by using two points to create two equations and then solve for a and b. This is similar to solving a system of linear equations.

For the first point (-9, 64):
64 = a + b(-9)
64 = a - 9b ... (1)

For the second point (-3, 22):
22 = a + b(-3)
22 = a - 3b ... (2)

Now we have a system of equations (1) and (2). We can solve for a and b by using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

Multiply (2) by 3, we get:
66 = 3a - 9b ... (3)

Now we subtract equation (1) from equation (3):
66 - 64 = (3a - a) - (9b - 9b)

where \( a \) is the y-intercept and \( b \) is the slope of the line. To find \( a \) and \( b \), we can use two of the provided data points to set up a system of linear equations.

From the first input-output pair \((-9, 64)\):

\[ 64 = a - 9b \]
\[ 64 + 9b = a \]

From the second input-output pair \((-3, 22)\):

Now we can solve this system using any appropriate method, such as substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method by multiplying equation (2) by 20 and adding it to equation (1) to eliminate a:

20*(-99) = 20*a + 20*6b

Adding equation (1) to this result:

-1715 = 21(265 + 20b) + 100b
-1715 = 5565 + 420b + 100b
-1715 = 5565 + 520b

Now, let's solve for b:

b = -7280 / 520
b = -14

Now, let's use the data points given to calculate the coefficients a and b.

1. For the input -20 and output 265, the equation becomes:

    We have the data points:

(-20, 265), (-15, 195), (-5, 55), (-10, 125), and (6, -99).

The requested function form is a linear equation:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

y = a + bx

Which is the standard form of a linear equation, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope.

To find a and b, we need to use two points to set up a system of two equations. Picking points (-20, 265) and (-5, 55):

For (-20, 265):
265 = a - 20b

For (-5, 55):
55 = a - 5b

Now we have two equations:

1) 265 = a - 20b
2) 55 = a - 5b

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate a and solve for b:

(265 - 55) = (-20b) - (-5b)
210 = -15b
b = -14

Using b to solve for a using equation 2:

55 = a - 5(-14)
55 = a + 70
a = -15

Therefore, the function is:

y = -15 + (-14)x

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to first understand that x^0 is always 1 for any x that is not zero, thus the term ax^0 becomes just a since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1 (except for the case where x=0). So the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can solve for a and b using two of the given input-output pairs:

Let's take the pairs (-10, -54) and (4, 2) to form two equations.

Using (-10, -54):
-54 = a - 10b

Using (4, 2):
2 = a + 4b

We can solve this system of linear equations to find the values of a and b.

From the first equation:
a = -54 + 10b

Substitute that a into the second equation:
2 = (-54 + 10b) + 4b
2 = -54 + 14b
56 = 14b
b = 4

Now that we have b, we can find a:
a = -54 + 10b
a = -54 + 10(4)
a = -54 + 40
a = -14

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), let's first understand that \( ax^0 \) is another way of writing \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any x that is not 0. Thus, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We need to solve for a and b using the provided input-output pairs. Let's use two pairs of data to form a system of linear equations:

Let's choose the input-output pairs (4, 2) and (-20, -94).

For the input 4 and output 2:
\( 2 = a + 4b \) ---(1)

For the input -20 and output -94:
\( -94 = a - 20b \) ---(2)

Now, let's solve this system of equations for a and b.

We can multiply equation (1) by 5 to aim to eliminate a when we add it to equation (2):
\( 5 \times 2 = 5a + 20b \)
\( 10 = 5a + 20b \) ---(3)

Adding equation (2) to equation (3), we get:
\( -94 + 10 = a - 20b + 5a + 20b \)
\( -84 = 6a \)
\( a = -84 / 6 \)
\( a = -14 \)

\( 4b = 16 \)

    To find the function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to figure out the constants a and b that will satisfy the given inputs and outputs. Since ax^0 is just a because any number raised to the zero power is 1, the equation simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

Let's use two sets of input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations and solve for a and b. We can take the first two pairs for simplicity:

1) For the input x = -10, output y = -54:
-54 = a + b(-10)

2) For the input x = 4, output y = 2:
2 = a + b(4)

Now we have two equations:
-54 = a - 10b (Equation 1)
2 = a + 4b (Equation 2)

We can solve this system of equations by using the method of substitution or elimination. I'll use the elimination method:

Add the two equations together to eliminate a:

-54 + 2 = a - 10b + a + 4b
-52 = 2a - 6b

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for a:

-26 = a - 3b (Equation 3)

Now, let's subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate a again and solve for b:

-54 - 2 = a - 10b - (a + 4b)
-56 = -14b
b = 4

Now that we have b, we can plug it into Equation 2 or Equation 3 to solve for a. Using Equation 2:

2 = a + 4(4)
2 = a + 16
a = 2 - 16
a = -14

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we need to determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1. This is essentially a linear function y = a + bx, where ax^0 is just a constant term (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1).

Let's use two data points to determine the coefficients, a and b. We can use the points (-10, -54) and (4, 2).

For the first point (-10, -54), we get:
-54 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)

Since (-10)^0 is 1, this simplifies to:
-54 = a - 10b      [Equation 1]

For the second point (4, 2), we get:
2 = a(4)^0 + b(4)

Since (4)^0 is 1, this simplifies to:
2 = a + 4b         [Equation 2]

Now we have two equations with two unknowns. Let's solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Multiply Equation 2 by 10 to align the a term with Equation 1:
20 = 10a + 40b      [Equation 3]

Now subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:
20 - (-54) = (10a - a) + (40b - (-10b))
74 = 9a + 50b

Divide the entire equation by 9 to solve for a:
a + (50/9)b = 74/9

We need to solve for b first before we can determine a. Let's use the original two equations again.

Multiply Equation 2 by 10 and then add it to Equation 1:
(-54) + 10(2) = a - 10b + 10a + 40b
-54 + 20 = a - 10b + 10a + 40b
-34 = 11a + 30b

Divide the entire equation by 11:
-34/11 = a + (30/11)b
-34/11 = a + (30/11)b

Now we find the common multiplier for b's coefficients between the equations a + (50/9)b = 74/9 and -34/11 = a + (30/11)b, which is 90. 

Now, multiply the first equation by 10 and the second by 9 to make the coefficients of b the same:

10a + 100b = 740/9
9a + 90b = -306/11

Now, by multiplying the first equation by 9 and the second by 10, we will achieve a common coefficient of 90 for b:

9(10a + 100b) = 9(740/9)
10(9a + 90b) = 10(-306/11)

90a + 900b = 740
90a + 900b = -3060/11

From here, it is clear that there is a mistake as the system of equations does not align. We need to rethink our method of solving for a and b.

Let's go back to the equations we developed initially:

-54 = a - 10b [Equation 1]
2 = a + 4b    [Equation 2]

Now subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:
-54 - 2 = a - a - 10b - 4b
-56 = -14b
b = 4

Now substitute b = 4 into Equation 2 to find the value of a:
2 = a + 4(4)
2 = a + 16
a = 2 - 16
a = -14

Now we have found our coefficients:
a = -14
b = 4

y = -14x^0 + 4x^1

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can use two points to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Given that x^0 is always 1, the function simplifies to a constant plus a multiple of x.

The function y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx. Let's use the first two data points provided to form a system of linear equations:

1) Using the point (-10, -54):
-54 = a + b(-10)

We can solve this system of equations for 'a' and 'b'. I will subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate 'a' and solve for 'b':

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we can recognize that ax^0 is just a, because any number to the power of 0 is 1. So, we are looking for a function y = a + bx, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope.

Given the points (-11, -20), (-8, -14), (-2, -2), (-7, -12), and (-17, -32), we can calculate the slope (b) by finding the change in y divided by the change in x between any two points (assuming a linear relationship).

For example, using the first two points (-11, -20) and (-8, -14):

Change in y = y2 - y1 = -14 - (-20) = 6
Change in x = x2 - x1 = -8 - (-11) = 3

Hence, the slope (b) is:
b = Change in y / Change in x = 6 / 3 = 2

We can check whether this slope fits all other data points as well:

For the points (-8, -14) and (-2, -2):
Change in y = -2 - (-14) = 12
Change in x = -2 - (-8) = 6
b = 12 / 6 = 2

For the points (-7, -12) and (-17, -32):
Change in y = -32 - (-12) = -20
Change in x = -17 - (-7) = -10
b = -20 / -10 = 2

Since the slope is consistent between all these points, we can confidently say b = 2.

Now, we can calculate the y-intercept (a) by substituting the slope and one point into the equation.

Using the point (-11, -20):
-20 = a + 2(-11)
-20 = a - 22
a = -20 + 22
a = 2

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs (x, y), we can use two of them to calculate the values of a and b.

For instance, using the points (-11, -20) and (-2, -2):

1. Slope (b):
b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (-2 - (-20)) / (-2 - (-11)) = (18) / (9) = 2

We can multiply the first equation by 1 and the second equation by 1 to keep them the same:

1(-20) = a + (-11)b -> -20 = a - 11b (Equation 1)
1(-14) = a + (-8)b -> -14 = a - 8b (Equation 2)

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

-20 + 14 = -11b + 8b
-6 = -3b

To solve for b, divide both sides by -3:

b = -6 / -3
b = 2

To determine the constants a and b, we can use two of the given input-output pairs to form a system of equations. Let's use the pairs (10, 176) and (17, 302):

1. For the input 10:

176 = a (10)^0 + b (10)^1
176 = a + 10b

2. For the input 17:

302 = a (17)^0 + b (17)^1
302 = a + 17b

Now, we have two equations:
1. a + 10b = 176
2. a + 17b = 302

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2 gives us:
(17b - 10b) = (302 - 176)
7b = 126
b = 126 / 7
b = 18

We can now plug the value of b back into either equation to solve for a. Using equation 1:
a + 10(18) = 176
a + 180 = 176
a = 176 - 180
a = -4

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) is:

y = -4 + 18x

Or more simply in the exact form requested:

Output: y = -4x^0 + 18x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0, we need to find the relationship between the given input (x) and output (y) values that follows a linear pattern.

Since the equation is linear, we can choose any two points to derive the slope (b), and then calculate the y-intercept (a). Let's use the two points (10, 176) and (12, 212):

First, we'll find the slope (b):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (212 - 176) / (12 - 10)
b = (36) / (2)
b = 18

Now that we have the slope, we can find the y-intercept (a) using one of the points. Let's use the point (10, 176):

y = a + bx
176 = a + (18 * 10)
176 = a + 180
a = 176 - 180
a = -4

Plug the values of a and b into the general form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -4 + 18x

So the function that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs is:

y = -4 + 18x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to recognize that ax^0 is simply the value of 'a' since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, this part of the function represents the y-intercept of the linear equation y = a + bx.

From the given data points, we can create a system of equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'. However, given that the data seems to exhibit linearity and by observing that both positive and negative inputs of the same magnitude (-17 and 17) give outputs that are near opposites of each other (considering a constant offset), we can infer that 'b' will be the slope of our line and 'a' will be the constant y-intercept, again confirming the observed symmetry.

We can use two of the data points to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Let's use (17, 302) and (10, 176):

1. From the first data point (17, 302):
   302 = a + 17b

2. From the second data point (10, 176):
   176 = a + 10b

Now we can solve this system of equations. To do so, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination to illustrate:

Multiply the second equation by -1.7 to align the 'b' terms:
1.7 * (176 = a + 10b) -> -299.2 = -1.7a - 17b

Now add this result to the first equation to eliminate 'b':
302 = a + 17b
-299.2 = -1.7a - 17b
-----------------------
2.8 = -0.7a

Solving for 'a' gives us:
a = -4

Now we can use this 'a' value in either of the original equations to solve for 'b'. Using the second equation (10, 176):
176 = -4 + 10b
180 = 10b
b = 18

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we should identify values for a and b that fit the given points. Since \( ax^0 \) is just a because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Let's take two of the given points to solve for a and b. The points taken should ideally be symmetric about the y-axis to simplify calculations when dealing with a linear function as suggested by the form \( y = a + bx \), where \( x = -17 \) and \( x = 17 \) seem like natural choices because they are opposites of each other.

Given the inputs/outputs:
1. Input: -17, Output: -310
2. Input: 17, Output: 302

Let's make two equations:
1. \(-310 = a + b(-17)\) or \(-310 = a - 17b\)
2. \(302 = a + b(17)\) or \(302 = a + 17b\)

Now, add the two equations together to eliminate b and solve for a:
\(-310 + 302 = (a - 17b) + (a + 17b)\)
\(-8 = 2a\)

Dividing both sides by 2:
\(-4 = a\)

Now that we have a, let's solve for b using the equation with positive x (it's simpler):
\(302 = -4 + 17b\)
\(302 + 4 = 17b\)
\(306 = 17b\)

Dividing by 17:
\(b = \frac{306}{17}\)
\(b = 18\)

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to recognize that ax^0 is simply a because any number to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, the function takes the form:

y = a + bx

We are given a series of inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's denote the input as x and the output as y.

For the input x = -16, y = 297, giving us:
297 = a - 16b

For the input x = 18, y = -315, giving us:
-315 = a + 18b

For the input x = -5, y = 99, giving us:
99 = a - 5b

For the input x = 5, y = -81, giving us:
-81 = a + 5b

We have four equations and two unknowns. Generally, two points are enough to determine the parameters a and b for a line, but we should be careful because more data points have been provided, and they may not all lie exactly on a line. In this case, these additional points can be used for a consistency check.

First, we can set up a system of equations using any two points, and then solve for a and b. Let's use the points (-16, 297) and (18, -315) for convenience.

From the first point:
297 = a - 16b  [Equation 1]

From the second point:
-315 = a + 18b  [Equation 2]

We can now solve these two equations together to find the values of a and b. First, let's add the two equations to eliminate a:

297 + (-315) = a - 16b + a + 18b
-18 = 2a + 2b
-9 = a + b

Now, let's subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate a:

297 - (-315) = (a - 16b) - (a + 18b)
612 = -34b
b = -612 / 34
b = -18

Now we can solve for a using the equation -9 = a + b by substituting b:

-9 = a - 18
a = -9 + 18
a = 9

So the function is:
y = a + bx
y = 9 - 18x

To check if this is consistent with all given points, we can substitute the other points into this equation:

For x = -5, y should be 99:
y = 9 - 18(-5)
y = 9 + 90
y = 99 (which is consistent)

For x = 5, y should be -81:
y = 9 - 18(5)
y = 9 - 90
y = -81 (which is consistent)

Since the calculated values are consistent with all given points, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = 9 - 18x

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we need to first determine the coefficients a and b for the equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Since ax^0 is essentially a (because anything raised to the power 0 is 1), we are looking for the function:
y = a + bx

We have the given paired inputs and outputs:

1) x = -16, y = 297
2) x = 18, y = -315
3) x = -16, y = 297 (Duplicate of the first pair, so we don't need to use it again)
4) x = -5, y = 99
5) x = 5, y = -81

We can use any two distinct pairs to solve for a and b. Let's use pairs (1) and (2): 

Pair (1):
297 = a - 16b
Pair (2):
-315 = a + 18b

Now let's solve this system of equations. First, let's rearrange the first equation to solve for a:

a = 297 + 16b

Now, substitute this into the second equation:

-315 = (297 + 16b) + 18b
-315 = 297 + 34b
-612 = 34b
b = -612 / 34
b = -18

Now that we have b, let's substitute it back into the equation for a:

a = 297 + 16(-18)
a = 297 - 288
a = 9

Our estimated function is thus:

y = 9 - 18x
This can be also written as:
y = 9x^0 - 18x^1

To validate this function, we can check it with the other given pairs of inputs and outputs. For pair (4):

y = 9 - 18(-5) = 9 + 90 = 99 (which matches the given output for x = -5)

And for pair (5):

y = 9 - 18(5) = 9 - 90 = -81 (which matches the given output for x = 5)

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to understand it as a linear equation \( y = a + bx \), where \( ax^0 = a \) (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1) and \( bx^1 = bx \).

Given two distinct points, we can determine the specific linear function. Let's use the given pairs (18, -315) and (-16, 297) to find a and b.

For the first point (18, -315), the equation would be:
\[ -315 = a + 18b \]

For the second point (-16, 297), the equation would be:
\[ 297 = a - 16b \]

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

\[ a + 18b = -315 \]
\[ a - 16b = 297 \]

We can solve for a and b using linear algebra techniques, such as substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a and solve for b:

\[ (a + 18b) - (a - 16b) = -315 - 297 \]
\[ 18b + 16b = -612 \]
\[ 34b = -612 \]
\[ b = -612 / 34 \]
\[ b = -18 \]

Now substitute b back into one of the equations to solve for a:

\[ a + 18(-18) = -315 \]

\[ a = -315 + 324 \]

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use the given pairs of inputs and outputs to determine the constants a and b. The term ax^0 is mathematically equivalent to a since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx. We can use two pairs of inputs and outputs to derive a system of equations and solve for a and b.

Let's use the input-output pairs (-16, 297) and (18, -315):

For input -16:
297 = a + b(-16) -> Equation 1

For input 18:
-315 = a + b(18) -> Equation 2

Now we have two equations:

1) 297 = a - 16b
2) -315 = a + 18b

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiply the Equation 1 by 18 and Equation 2 by 16:

1) 18 * 297 = 18a - 18 * 16b
2) 16 * -315 = 16a + 16 * 18b

Simplifying the multiplication:

1) 5346 = 18a - 288b
2) -5040 = 16a + 288b

Now add the two equations to eliminate b:

5346 - 5040 = (18a + 16a) + (-288b + 288b)

306 = 34a
a = 306 / 34
a = 9

Now that we have the value of a, we can plug it into one of the earlier equations to find b. Using the Equation 1:

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \).

From the given pairs of inputs and outputs, we can create the following set of equations:

1. \( a + b(-16) = 297 \)
2. \( a + b(18) = -315 \)
3. \( a + b(-16) = 297 \) (This is the same as equation 1)
4. \( a + b(-5) = 99 \)
5. \( a + b(5) = -81 \)

Using the information from equation 1:

\( a - 16b = 297 \)   (Equation 1)

And from equation 2:

\( a + 18b = -315 \)  (Equation 2)

If we add Equation 1 and Equation 2, we will be able to solve for \( a \) because the \( b \) terms will cancel out:

\( (a - 16b) + (a + 18b) = 297 - 315 \)

\( 2a + 2b - 16b + 18b = -18 \)

\( 2a + 2b = -18 \)

Now we divide everything by 2:

\( a + b = -9 \)   (Equation 3)

If we now subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3, we can find \( b \):

\( (a + b) - (a - 16b) = -9 - 297 \)

\( a + b - a + 16b = -306 \)

\( 17b = -306 \)

\( b = -306 / 17 \)

\( b = -18 \)

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we have to determine the values of a and b that fit the given input and output pairs. Here, x represents the input and y represents the output.

Notice that the term ax^0 will always be a constant since x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0. Therefore, ax^0 represents the y-intercept of the function. The term bx^1 is simply bx, which represents the slope of the line times the x value.

We have the following pairs of inputs and outputs:

2. (19, 253)
3. (-15, -223)
4. (6, 71)
5. (17, 225)

- From input -18 to -17, the output increases from -265 to -265 + 14 = -251.
- From input 17 to 18, the output increases from 225 to 225 + 14 = 239.

    Based on the given input and output pairs, one approach to find the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) is to inspect the changes in outputs relative to changes in inputs and try to find a consistent pattern that can be modeled by a linear equation of the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

This is equivalent to:

y = a + bx

With only the given data points, the relationship between the inputs and outputs suggests a linear relationship since the changes in output appear to be consistent with the changes in input, after considering the effects of negative and positive values of x.

We need to solve for the coefficients a (y-intercept) and b (slope) to describe the relationship.

Let's start with assuming a linear relationship and estimate b by looking at the change in y over the change in x (also known as the rise over run in the slope of a line):

Using the two given points (19, 253) and (-18, -265):

b = (difference in y) / (difference in x)
b = (253 - (-265)) / (19 - (-18))
b = (253 + 265) / (19 + 18)
b = 518 / 37
b ≈ 14

Since b is approximately 14, this suggests the linear relationship can be roughly estimated by y = a + 14x.

To find the y-intercept (a), we can substitute one of the input/output pairs into the equation. I'll use the pair (6, 71):

71 = a + 14*6
71 = a + 84
a = 71 - 84
a = -13

Combining our estimates for a and b, the function that approximates the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the given input-output pairs, we first note that ax^0 is equivalent to a since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, ax^0 reduces to a constant term a, and the function has the form y = a + bx, which is the equation of a line.

We have two parameters a and b to determine. The parameter b represents the slope of the line, and a represents the y-intercept. Using two points, we can solve for a and b.

Let's use the following two points from the dataset to find the slope b first: (x1, y1) = (-18, -265) and (x2, y2) = (19, 253).

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we need to recognize this as a linear equation in the form of \(y = a + bx\), where \(a\) is the y-intercept (when \(x = 0\)) and \(b\) is the slope of the line.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can solve for \(a\) and \(b\) using two of the pairs as a system of linear equations. We can use the following two points for convenience: \((-18, -265)\) and \((19, 253)\).

Let's set up two equations using the general form \(y = a + bx\):

For the input -18 (x = -18), output -265 (y = -265):

\(-265 = a - 18b\) ... (1)

For the input 19 (x = 19), output 253 (y = 253):

\(253 = a + 19b\) ... (2)

Now, we have a system of two equations. We can solve for \(a\) and \(b\) by using either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Add the two equations to eliminate \(a\):

\(-265 + 253 = a - 18b + a + 19b\)

\(-12 = 2a + b\)

Now, let's isolate \(b\):

\(b = -12 - 2a\) ... (3)

We can substitute the value of \(b\) from equation (3) into either equation (1) or (2) to find \(a\). We will use equation (1):

\(-265 = a - 18(-12 - 2a)\)

\(-265 = a + 216 + 36a\)

\(-265 = 37a + 216\)

\(a = \frac{-265 - 216}{37}\)

\(a = \frac{-481}{37}\)

\(a \approx -13\)

Now substitute \(a\) back into equation (3) to find \(b\):

\(b = -12 - 2(-13)\)

\(b = -12 + 26\)

\(b = 14\)

After rounding \(a\) to the nearest whole number and calculating \(b\), we can write the function as:

\(y = -13 + 14x\)

Please note that the value of \(a\) has been rounded to -13, which seems to be a reasonable approximation given the inputs and outputs. If a more precise value is desired, you would use the exact fraction or a decimal form for \(a\).

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) can be described by a linear function of the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Here, ax^0 is essentially a constant (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is a term linear with x.

To determine a and b, we can set up a system of linear equations using the given input-output pairs.

Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to set up a system of equations:

For input -18 and output -265:
-265 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
-265 = a - 18b       (1)

For input 19 and output 253:
253 = a(19)^0 + b(19)^1
253 = a + 19b        (2)

We now have a system of two linear equations:

a - 18b = -265
a + 19b = 253

We can solve this system using various methods. Let's use substitution or elimination. In this particular case, one can easily solve for a by adding both equations:

(1) a - 18b = -265
(2) a + 19b = 253
-------------------
2a + b = -12 (after combining the equations, the b term is eliminated)

From this new equation, we can solve for a:
2a = -12 - b
a = (-12 - b)/2

Now, to find b, we can substitute a into either equation (1) or (2). Let's use (2):

a + 19b = 253
(-12 - b)/2 + 19b = 253

Multiply everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
-12 - b + 38b = 506

Now combine like terms:
37b = 506 + 12
37b = 518
b = 518 / 37
b = 14

Now we find a by plugging the value of b back into the equation for a:
a = (-12 - b)/2
a = (-12 - 14)/2
a = (-26) / 2
a = -13

So the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the constants a and b for the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use two points from the given data to form a system of equations:

Let's use the points (0, -15) and (5, 5).

For the point (0, -15):
y = ax^0 + bx^1
-15 = a * 1 + b * 0
-15 = a

Now we know that a = -15.

Then, we can use the point (5, 5):
y = ax^0 + bx^1
5 = (-15) * 1 + b * 5
5 = -15 + 5b

Adding 15 to both sides, we have:
5 + 15 = 5b
20 = 5b

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
b = 20 / 5
b = 4

So, the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 with our determined coefficients is:
y = -15x^0 + 4x^1

Given that we have a linear relationship (as suggested by \( ax^0 + bx^1 \)), we can find \( a \) and \( b \) using the input-output pairs provided, by solving a system of linear equations, or by finding the slope and intercept using at least two points.

To find \( b \) (the slope), we can use any two points. Let's use the first two:

\( b = \frac{283 - 133}{19 - 9} = \frac{150}{10} = 15. \)

Given the data points, we can form a system of linear equations and solve for $a$ and $b$. However, since we're looking for a pattern, we can attempt to deduce $b$ by observing the change in $y$ with respect to the change in $x$. Let's take two data points to find $b$:

    To find a linear function that describes the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y), we are looking for a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1. This simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is equal to 1 for any x except 0.

Given the data points:
(2, 59)
(-16, -301)
(-5, -81)
(3, 79)
(-2, -21)

We can find the slope (b) by taking any two points and using the slope formula:
b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Let's use the first and the last data points:
b = (59 - (-21)) / (2 - (-2))
b = (59 + 21) / (2 + 2)
b = 80 / 4
b = 20

Now that we have the slope, we can plug it back into one of the original points to solve for a. Let's use the point (2, 59):
59 = a + 20*2
59 = a + 40
a = 59 - 40
a = 19

Thus, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs should be:
y = 19 + 20x

Let's verify this with another point from our dataset, (-16, -301):
-301 = 19 + 20*(-16)
-301 = 19 - 320
-301 = -301

As the function is consistent with at least one other point provided in the data set, we can tentatively suggest that the function is indeed:
y = 19 + 20x

However, note that this function will not exactly match all given points because the provided points do not all lie on the same line, indicating the true relationship may not be linear or that there is some error in the data points.

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to identify the constants a and b. Notice that in this form, ax^0 is equal to a, because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1, and bx^1 is equal to bx, because anything raised to the power of 1 is itself.

The given inputs and outputs can be written as a system of equations:

1. For the input 2, output 59: 59 = a + 2b
2. For the input -16, output -301: -301 = a - 16b
3. For the input -5, output -81: -81 = a - 5b
4. For the input 3, output 79: 79 = a + 3b
5. For the input -2, output -21: -21 = a - 2b

To solve for a and b, we need to pick any two equations and solve for both variables. Let's pick equations 1 and 5 for simplicity:

From equation 1:
59 = a + 2b  ==> (a)

From equation 5:
-21 = a - 2b ==> (b)

Adding equation (a) and equation (b) together to eliminate b:
(59) + (-21) = (a + 2b) + (a - 2b)
38 = 2a
a = 19

Substituting the value of a back into equation (a):
59 = 19 + 2b
40 = 2b
b = 20

Thus, the function that describes this data is:
y = 19 + 20x

However, we need to confirm that these values of a and b work for all the given points, not just the two we used:

For the input -16:

-301 = 19 - 320
-301 = -301 (matches)

For the input -5:

-81 = 19 - 100
-81 = -81 (matches)

79 = 19 + 60
79 = 79 (matches)

For the input -2:
-21 = 19 - 2(20)

    To determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) for the function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we can set up a system of linear equations using the given input-output pairs. Let's take two pairs to form the equations:

From Input: 2, Output: 59, we get:
\(59 = a \cdot 2^0 + b \cdot 2^1\)
\(59 = a + 2b\) ...(1)

From Input: -2, Output: -21, we get:
\(-21 = a \cdot (-2)^0 + b \cdot (-2)^1\)

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\). By adding (1) and (2) together we get:
\(59 - 21 = (a + 2b) + (a - 2b)\)
\(38 = 2a\)
\(a = 19\)

Now, using the value of \(a\), we can substitute it into either (1) or (2) to find \(b\). Let's use equation (1):

    Based on the inputs and outputs provided, to find a function of the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, which simplifies to `y = a + bx` (since `x^0 = 1` for any x except x ≠ 0), we can set up a system of equations using the provided input-output pairs and solve for the constants a and b.

Let's use two of the given input-output pairs to create our equations:

1. Using input 2 and output 59:

\( 59 = a + 2b \)

2. Using input -16 and output -301:

\( -301 = a - 16b \)

Now we have the system of equations:
\( 59 = a + 2b \)
\( -301 = a - 16b \)

Let's solve this system of equations. First, we'll subtract the second equation from the first:

\( 59 - (-301) = (a + 2b) - (a - 16b) \)
\( 360 = 18b \)
\( b = 20 \)

We need to find the best values for \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the given inputs and outputs. We'll use two of the given points to determine the values for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the points (13, 55) and (-20, -44). 

We can set up two equations based on these points:

1. For input 13 and output 55: 
\( 55 = a + b(13) \)

2. For input -20 and output -44: 
\( -44 = a + b(-20) \)

Now we solve this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \):

Equation 2: \( a = -44 - b(-20) = -44 + 20b \)

Substitute \( a \) from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

\( 55 = (-44 + 20b) + b(13) \)

Combine like terms:

\( 55 = -44 + 20b + 13b \)

\( 55 = -44 + 33b \)

Add 44 to both sides:

\( 99 = 33b \)

Divide by 33:

\( b = \frac{99}{33} \)

\( b = 3 \)

Now find \( a \) using Equation 2:

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 = 1 for any x ≠ 0), we can use two of the given input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations.

Let's choose the input-output pairs (13, 55) and (-20, -44):

For the input 13:
55 = a + b(13)  (1)

For the input -20:
-44 = a + b(-20)  (2)

We now have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

55 = a + 13b
-44 = a - 20b

Let's solve this system using substitution or elimination. I will demonstrate the elimination method:

First, we want the coefficients of a to be the same in both equations (but with opposite signs), so we can directly subtract one equation from the other. As the coefficients are already the same (both 1), we can simply subtract the second equation from the first:

(55 = a + 13b) - (-44 = a - 20b)
55 + 44 = (a - a) + (13b + 20b)
99 = 33b
b = 99 / 33
b = 3

Now, let's substitute the value of b back into one of the original equations. We will use equation (1):

55 = a + 13(3)
55 = a + 39
a = 55 - 39
a = 16

Finally, plugging the values of a and b back into the function y = a + bx, we get:

y = 16 + 3x

This function describes the given input-output pairs:

For x = 13, y = 16 + 3(13) = 16 + 39 = 55  (matches the given output)

1. For the input 13:

\( 11 = 2a - 7b \)
\( 2a = 11 + 7b \)
\( a = \frac{11 + 7b}{2} \) ...(1)

\( 110 = 11 + 7b + 26b \)
\( 110 = 11 + 33b \)

Given the form y = c + bx, we need at least two distinct points to find b and c. Let's use the points (-11, 72) and (18, -160) to create a system of equations:

-160 - 72 = 29b

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b. Since ax^0 is equal to a for all x (because x^0 is 1), we can rewrite the equation as y = a + bx.

Let's use two data points to solve for a and b:

Using Input: -2 and Output: 0, we get:
0 = a + b(-2)
0 = a - 2b ... (1)

Using Input: -3 and Output: 8, we get:
8 = a + b(-3)
8 = a - 3b ... (2)

Now we will solve these two equations simultaneously for a and b.

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a:
8 - 0 = (a - 3b) - (a - 2b)
8 = -3b + 2b
8 = -b

Therefore, b = -8.

Now plug the value of b back into equation (1) to find a:
0 = a - 2(-8)
0 = a + 16
a = -16

The function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = -16x^0 - 8x^1

    To find the linear function that describes the relationship between the inputs \(x\) and the outputs \(y\) in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which is equivalent to the form \(y = a + bx\) since \(x^0 = 1\), we need to determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\).

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we are looking to solve the system:

1. \(a - 11b = 72\)
2. \(a - 3b = 8\)
3. \(a - 2b = 0\)
4. \(a + 18b = -160\)
5. \(a - 7b = 40\)

From the third equation, we can immediately isolate \(a\):

\(a - 2b = 0\)
\(a = 2b\)  (Equation 6)

Now, we can substitute \(a\) from Equation 6 into any of the other equations to find \(b\). Let's use Equation 2 for substitution:

\(2b - 3b = 8\)
\(-b = 8\)
\(b = -8\)

Now that we have \(b\), we can substitute that back into Equation 6 to find \(a\):

\(a = 2(-8)\)
\(a = -16\)

So, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

\(y = -16x^0 - 8x^1\)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we can look at this as a linear relationship of the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Where:
- a and b are constants to be determined,
- x^0 is always 1 (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and
- x^1 is just x.

In this representation, 'a' is the y-intercept of the function, and 'b' is the slope. To find 'a' and 'b', we can use two points from the provided inputs and outputs. Let's take the pairs (11, -204) and (-4, 66) to form two equations:

1. For input 11:
-204 = a*11^0 + b*11
-204 = a + 11b

2. For input -4:
66 = a*(-4)^0 + b*(-4)
66 = a - 4b

Now, we have a system of two linear equations:
a + 11b = -204
a - 4b = 66

Let's solve for 'a' and 'b':

By subtracting the second equation from the first, we can eliminate 'a':
a + 11b - (a - 4b) = -204 - 66
a - a + 11b - (- 4b) = -270
15b = -270
b = -270/15
b = -18

Once we have 'b', we can plug it back into either of the original equations to find 'a'. Using the second equation:

a - 4(-18) = 66
a + 72 = 66
a = 66 - 72
a = -6

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between x and y is:

y = -6x^0 - 18x^1
y = -6 - 18x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we first note that the term ax^0 is simply a, since any number raised to the zeroth power is 1.

So we are essentially looking for a linear relationship of the form:
\[ y = a + bx \]

Let's use two data points to derive a system of linear equations that will help us solve for a and b. Choosing the first two data points:

1. When x = 11, y = -204:
\[ -204 = a + 11b \]

2. When x = -4, y = 66:
\[ 66 = a - 4b \]

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

\[ \begin{cases} 
a + 11b = -204 \\
a - 4b = 66 
\end{cases} \]

Let's solve this system for a and b. We can use either substitution or elimination; let's use elimination in this case.

Add the two equations together to eliminate a:

\[ (a + 11b) + (a - 4b) = -204 + 66 \]
\[ 2a + 7b = -138 \]
\[ a + (7/2)b = -69 \]

Now, we'll multiply the second equation from the original system by 2 so that when we subtract it from the twice of the first equation, a will be eliminated:

\[ 2a - 8b = 132 \]

Now subtract this result from the first equation multiplied by 2:

\[ 2(a + 11b) - (2a - 8b) = 2(-204) - 132 \]
\[ 22b + 8b = -408 - 132 \]
\[ 30b = -540 \]
\[ b = -540 / 30 \]
\[ b = -18 \]

Now substitute b back into one of the original equations to find a. We'll use the first equation:

\[ a + 11(-18) = -204 \]
\[ a - 198 = -204 \]
\[ a = -204 + 198 \]
\[ a = -6 \]

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\[ y = -6 -18x \]

    To find a function that fits the input-output pairs provided in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the values of a and b that will satisfy the equation for all given pairs. Since x^0 is always 1, the term ax^0 is just a. Hence, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We have a linear relationship with a being the y-intercept and b being the slope of the line.

Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to form a system of equations to solve for a and b. We can use the pairs (-4, 66) and (20, -366) for this purpose as they will likely give us a good spread and a more accurate representation of the slope.

The equations would be:
1. a - 4b = 66
2. a + 20b = -366

Now let's solve this system of equations:

From equation 1, we can express a in terms of b:
a = 66 + 4b

Now substitute the expression for a into equation 2:
(66 + 4b) + 20b = -366
66 + 24b = -366
24b = -366 - 66
24b = -432
b = -432 / 24
b = -18

Now let's find a by substituting b = -18 into equation 1:
a - 4(-18) = 66
a + 72 = 66
a = 66 - 72
a = -6

We have found the values a = -6 and b = -18. Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = -6 + (-18)x
y = -6 - 18x

Thus, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 would be:

    To find a linear function that represents the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we will use the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since ax^0 is always a, as x^0 = 1 for any x that isn't 0, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx. This is the standard equation of a straight line with a as the y-intercept and b as the slope.

To determine the values of a and b, we can use any two of the provided data points to set up a system of linear equations.

Let's use the first and last data points provided:

1) Using the data point (11, -204), we have:
-204 = a + b(11)

2) Using the data point (20, -366), we have:
-366 = a + b(20)

Now, we will solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Taking equation 1 and multiplying it by -2, we get:
2) 408 = -2a - 2b(11)

Adding this to equation 2, we get:
-366 + 408 = -2a + a - 22b + 20b

42 = -a - 2b

So, -a = 42 + 2b. We can call this equation 3.

Now, let's solve for b by subtracting equation 1 from 2:

-366 - (-204) = a + 20b - (a + 11b)
-162 = 9b

b = -162 / 9
b = -18

Now plug b into equation 3:

-a = 42 + 2(-18)
-a = 42 - 36
-a = 6
a = -6

Now we have the values of a and b:

y = -6 + (-18)x

To find the coefficients, I will use two of the given input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \). I'll choose the following pairs (11, -204) and (-4, 66):

For the input 11 and output -204:
-204 = a + b(11)  [Equation 1]

For the input -4 and output 66:
66 = a + b(-4)  [Equation 2]

Now, we can solve this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \). First, let's solve Equation 2 for \( a \):

a = 66 + 4b  [Equation 3]

Now, we can substitute Equation 3 into Equation 1:

-204 = (66 + 4b) + b(11)

Now, solve for b:

-204 = 66 + 15b

First, let's align the equations:

a - 12b = 9
a + 20b = -55

Now, let's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate `a`:

(a + 20b) - (a - 12b) = -55 - 9
a + 20b - a + 12b = -55 - 9

-55 = a + 20b       ...(2)

We can solve for a and b by using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

By multiplying equation (1) by 20 and (2) by 12 to eliminate a:

20 * 9 = 20a - 240b  ->  180 = 20a - 240b     ...(3)
12 * -55 = 12a + 240b ->  -660 = 12a + 240b   ...(4)

Adding equations (3) and (4) together we get:

180 - 660 = 20a - 240b + 12a + 240b
-480 = 32a
a = -480 / 32
a = -15

Now substitute the value of a into either equation (1) or (2) to solve for b:

9 = -15 - 12b 
24 = -12b
b = -2

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -15 + (-2)x
Or simply put:
y = -15 - 2x

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we must first understand this form. ax^0 is a constant term, because any number to the power of zero is one, so ax^0 becomes a*1 or just a. bx^1 is just bx because anything to the power of one is itself. Thus, the function we are looking for simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We can solve for a and b using the given inputs and outputs as points (x, y) in the function. We need two points to solve for the two unknowns, a and b. Let's use the first two points given:

1. For the input x = -16:
y = a + b(-16) = 82

2. For the input x = -11:
y = a + b(-11) = 52

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. a - 16b = 82
2. a - 11b = 52

We can solve this system using the elimination method to find the values of a and b:

Subtract the second equation from the first, to eliminate a:

a - 16b - (a - 11b) = 82 - 52
a - 16b - a + 11b = 30
-16b + 11b = 30
-5b = 30
b = 30 / -5
b = -6

Now we can substitute the value of b into either of the original equations to find a. We'll use the second one:

a - 11(-6) = 52
a + 66 = 52
a = 52 - 66
a = -14

So the function that relates the inputs and outputs is:

y = -14 - 6x

To match the requested form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Given a = -14 and b = -6, we can write it as:

y = (-14)x^0 + (-6)x^1

Or simplifying the exponents:

Output: y = -14 + (-6)x

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given input-output pairs, we need to determine the values of a and b. 

The term ax^0 simplifies to a, because any non-zero number to the power of 0 equals 1. So the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have a system of equations based on the input-output pairs given:

1. a + b(-16) = 82
2. a + b(-11) = 52
3. a + b(14) = -98
4. a + b(-18) = 94
5. a + b(3) = -32

Now, we can solve for a and b using any two of these equations. Let's pick equations 1 and 3 for simplicity:

a - 16b = 82          (1)
a + 14b = -98         (3)

We can use addition to eliminate the a term:

(1) + (3):
a - 16b + a + 14b = 82 - 98
2a - 2b = -16
a - b = -8           (4)

We still need another equation involving a and b alone to solve this system. We can choose another pair of input-output equations and repeat the process. Let's use equations 2 and 5:

a - 11b = 52         (2)
a + 3b = -32         (5)

Subtract equation (5) from equation (2):

(2) - (5):
a - 11b - a - 3b = 52 + 32
-14b = 84
b = -6

Now we can substitute b back into equation (4) to find a:

a - (-6) = -8
a + 6 = -8
a = -14

We have a set of input-output pairs, and we need to determine the constants a and b. Let's set up two equations using two of the given points to solve for a and b:

Using the input-output pair (-16, 82):
\( 82 = a + b(-16) \)
\( 82 = a - 16b \) .... (1)

Using the input-output pair (-11, 52):
\( 52 = a + b(-11) \)
\( 52 = a - 11b \) .... (2)

Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
\( 82 - 52 = (a - 16b) - (a - 11b) \)
\( 30 = -16b + 11b \)
\( 30 = -5b \)

Now we can substitute b back into any of the two initial equations to find a. We'll use equation (2):

To solve for a and b, we could use two pairs of inputs and outputs to create a system of equations. Since we have more than two pairs, we can use any two pairs or a more complex fitting method such as the least squares regression for higher accuracy. However, for simplification, let's use the first and the last pairs to create our system of equations:

System of equations:
1) 82 = a - 16b
2) -32 = a + 3b

Now we solve for a and b:

From equation 1):
a = 82 + 16b

Substitute a into equation 2):

-32 = (82 + 16b) + 3b
-32 = 82 + 19b
19b = -32 - 82
19b = -114
b = -114 / 19
b = -6

Now substitute b back into the equation for a:

(3, -32)

Let's consider two of these pairs to formulate a system of linear equations:

Using inputs (-16, 82) and (14, -98), we get two equations:

1) 82 = a + b(-16)
2) -98 = a + b(14)

Let's solve this system of equations.

Equation 1: 82 = a - 16b
Equation 2: -98 = a + 14b

Now, let's add both equations to eliminate a:

82 + (-98) = (a - 16b) + (a + 14b)
-16 = 2a - 2b
-8 = a - b

Now, let's solve one of the equations for a and substitute this expression into the equation we just derived to find b:

From Equation 1:
a = 82 + 16b

Substituting into -8 = a - b:

-8 = 82 + 16b - b

Let's take the points (x1, y1) = (-1, -7) and (x2, y2) = (3, 9) to set up the system of equations:

1. \( -7 = a + b(-1) \)  --> This simplifies to \( a - b = -7 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( 9 = a + b(3) \)    --> This simplifies to \( a + 3b = 9 \)  (Equation 2)

Now we can solve these equations simultaneously to find a and b.

Adding Equation 1 to Equation 2 to eliminate a, we get:

\( (a - b) + (a + 3b) = -7 + 9 \)
\( 2a + 2b = 2 \)
Divide both sides by 2:
\( a + b = 1 \) (Equation 3)

Now subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 3, we get:

\( 2b = 8 \)
Divide both sides by 2:
\( b = 4 \)

    Given the form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can identify that ax^0 is a constant term and bx^1 is a linear term.

    To find the coefficients a and b in the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can translate ax^0 + bx^1 to a + bx since x^0 equals 1 for any x that is not zero.

Given the data points:

1. When x = -18, y = -75, we get the equation a - 18b = -75
2. When x = -1, y = -7, we get the equation a - 1b = -7
3. When x = 3, y = 9, we get the equation a + 3b = 9
4. When x = 2, y = 5, we get the equation a + 2b = 5

We can use any two pairs of these to solve for a and b. Let's use (2) and (4):

From equation (2): a - b = -7 
From equation (4): a + 2b = 5

Adding both equations to eliminate a, we get:

(a - b) + (a + 2b) = -7 + 5
2a + b = -2

Now subtracting (2) from (4) to eliminate a:

(a + 2b) - (a - b) = 5 - (-7)
3b = 12

We get b = 12 / 3, which is b = 4.

Now, we can solve for a using either equation, using b = 4. Let's use equation (2):

First, let's simplify \( ax^0 + bx^1 \) to \( a + bx \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x that is not zero, and \( x^1 = x \).

Now, we have the simplified function: \( y = a + bx \).

We can use the given input-output pairs to find \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's start with the input-output pair (-1, -7):

\( -7 = a + b(-1) \)
\( -7 = a - b \) ... (1)

Next, we use the input-output pair (3, 9):

\( 9 = a + b(3) \)
\( 9 = a + 3b \) ... (2)

We now have a system of linear equations:

\( a - b = -7 \) (from equation 1)
\( a + 3b = 9 \) (from equation 2)

Adding these two equations, we get:

\( 2a + 2b = 2 \)

Divide by 2 to simplify:

\( a + b = 1 \)

Now subtract equation 1 from this result:

\( (a + b) - (a - b) = 1 - (-7) \)
\( 2b = 8 \)

Divide by 2:

\( b = 4 \)

Now we can replace \( b \) with 4 in equation 1 to solve for \( a \):

First, let's simplify the equation by understanding that x^0 is always 1, since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. This means our equation reduces to:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = a(1) + bx
y = a + bx

Now let's work with the given data to find 'a' and 'b'. The equation with an input of x and an output of y will look like this for each pair:

For input -1, output -7:
-7 = a - 1b
-7 = a - b

For input 3, output 9:
9 = a + 3b

5 = a + 2b

We have four equations and two unknowns, which means this system is over-determined. However, we can see that we have repeated inputs with consistent outputs (-18 input gives -75 output each time), indicating those are reliable equations. We will use the first and any other of the remaining three equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'.

Let's use the equation from the inputs -1 and 3 (since they are farthest apart, this might give us a more accurate solution):

Equation (1): -7 = a - b
Equation (2): 9 = a + 3b

Now, let's solve these two equations simultaneously.

Adding the two equations:

(-7) + 9 = (a - b) + (a + 3b)
2 = 2a + 2b
1 = a + b

Now, we need to find the value of b. We can substitute a from Equation (1) into this new equation:

a = 1 - b

Substitute a into Equation (1):

-7 = (1 - b) - b
-7 = 1 - 2b
-8 = -2b
b = 4

Now we put the value of b back into the equation for a:

a = 1 - b
a = 1 - 4
a = -3

For the first data point (6, 74):
74 = a + b(6) ... (1)

191 = a + b(19) ... (2)

Now we have a system of linear equations:

74 = a + 6b ... (1)
191 = a + 19b ... (2)

We can solve this system for a and b. One way to do that is to subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a:

2) 191 = a + 19b

Let us now solve for a and b using these two equations. First, we will solve one of the equations for a and then substitute into the other equation.

From equation 1) we get: a = 74 - 6b

Now we substitute a into equation 2):

191 = (74 - 6b) + 19b
191 = 74 + 13b
191 - 74 = 13b
117 = 13b
b = 9

Now plug the value of b back into the equation for a:

a = 74 - 6b
a = 74 - 6(9)
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

Now we have our a and b values. The function that captures the relationship between the inputs and the outputs is:

y = 20 + 9x

This function should be checked against all the data points to make sure it fits the data provided. Here's the verification:

For x = 6: y = 20 + 9(6) = 20 + 54 = 74 (matches given output)
For x = 19: y = 20 + 9(19) = 20 + 171 = 191 (matches given output)
For x = -11: y = 20 + 9(-11) = 20 - 99 = -79 (matches given output)
For x = -5: y = 20 + 9(-5) = 20 - 45 = -25 (matches given output)
For x = -10: y = 20 + 9(-10) = 20 - 90 = -70 (matches given output)

All data points fit the function, confirming that:

y = 20 + 9x

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the provided data, we need to determine the values of 'a' and 'b'. Since ax^0 is always a because x^0 is equal to 1, we can simplify the equation to y = a + bx.

Let's try to find the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) using the given data points:

1. For input 6:
y = a + b(6)
74 = a + 6b

2. For input 19:
y = a + b(19)
191 = a + 19b

3. For input -11:
y = a + b(-11)
-79 = a - 11b

4. For input -5:
y = a + b(-5)
-25 = a - 5b

5. For input -10:
y = a + b(-10)
-70 = a - 10b

Now we need to identify the pattern. Let's look at the difference in the output when the input is increased by 1. 

From input -11 to -10 (an increase of 1):
-70 - (-79) = 9

From input -10 to -5 (an increase of 5):
-25 - (-70) = 45
Since 45 / 5 = 9, this also increases by 9 per increase of 1 in input.

From input -5 to 6 (an increase of 11):
74 - (-25) = 99
Since 99 / 11 = 9, this also indicates an increase of 9 per increase of 1 in input.

From input 6 to 19 (an increase of 13):
191 - 74 = 117
Since 117 / 13 = 9, this increase is consistent with 9 per increase of 1 in input.

This consistent difference of 9 with each increment of 1 in the input indicates that 'b = 9'. Now let's use one of the points to solve for 'a'.

If we take the point (6, 74):
74 = a + 6(9)
74 = a + 54
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

    To find a linear function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1), we can use two points to solve for a and b.

Let's use the following two points from the given data:

1) Input: 6, Output: 74, which gives us the equation 74 = a + 6b.
2) Input: -10, Output: -70, which gives us the equation -70 = a - 10b.

Now, we can solve these two linear equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

From Equation 1:
74 = a + 6b ... (1)

From Equation 2:
-70 = a - 10b ... (2)

We can add Equation 1 and Equation 2 to eliminate a:

74 + (-70) = a + 6b + a - 10b
4 = 2a - 4b
2 = a - 2b ... (3)

Now let's subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate a:

74 - (-70) = (a + 6b) - (a - 10b)
144 = 16b
b = 144 / 16
b = 9

Plugging the value of b into Equation 3:
2 = a - 2(9)
2 = a - 18
a = 20

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the constants a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that ax^0 is the same as a, since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Now, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can create a system of equations based on the given points to solve for a and b. Let's use two points to set up the system:

1. Taking the point (6, 74):
74 = a + b(6)

2. Taking another point (19, 191):
191 = a + b(19)

If we solve this system of equations, we get:

6b + a = 74         (1)
19b + a = 191       (2)

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to solve for b:

(19b + a) - (6b + a) = 191 - 74
13b = 117
b = 117 / 13
b = 9

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into one of our original equations to find a. We'll use equation (1) for this purpose:

6b + a = 74
6(9) + a = 74
54 + a = 74
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

Now we have our values for a and b. The function that describes the data is:

    Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. When x = 6, y = 8, we have 8 = a*6^0 + b*6
2. When x = -5, y = -25, we have -25 = a*(-5)^0 + b*(-5)
3. When x = -3, y = -19, we have -19 = a*(-3)^0 + b*(-3)
4. When x = -10, y = -40, we have -40 = a*(-10)^0 + b*(-10)
5. When x = -14, y = -52, we have -52 = a*(-14)^0 + b*(-14)

Let's simplify the equations using the fact that x^0 = 1 for all x ≠ 0.

1. 8 = a + 6b
2. -25 = a - 5b
3. -19 = a - 3b
4. -40 = a - 10b
5. -52 = a - 14b

Looking at the equations, it seems that for each unit decrease in x, y decreases by an additional 4 units (which would correspond to the coefficient b). Let's test this by choosing two consecutive values for x and comparing their outputs.

From (2) to (3) (-5 to -3), output increases from -25 to -19, which is a difference of 6.
From (3) to (1) (-3 to 6), output increases from -19 to 8, which is a difference of 27 for a difference of 9 in input.

This pattern doesn't fit perfectly with the linear function we are trying to construct (y = ax^0 + bx^1). Perhaps we can try to find the values for a and b using pairs of equations.

Let's use the equations (1) and (4):

8 = a + 6b => a = 8 - 6b (6)
-40 = a - 10b => -40 = (8 - 6b) - 10b
-40 = 8 - 16b
-48 = -16b
b = 3

Now, we can replace b back into equation (6) to find a:
a = 8 - 6b
a = 8 - 6*3
a = 8 - 18
a = -10

So, the function that best describes the data given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = -10 + 3x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first acknowledge that ax^0 is a constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is simply bx, as any number to the power of 1 is the number itself. Therefore, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We need to determine the constants a and b that fit the data given. We can substitute the input-output pairs into the function to create a system of equations.

Using the input-output pair (6, 8):

8 = a + b(6)

Using the input-output pair (-5, -25), we get:

-25 = a + b(-5)

We now have a system of two equations:

1) 8 = a + 6b
2) -25 = a - 5b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. Let's multiply the second equation by 1 so we can eliminate a by adding both equations:

1) 8 = a + 6b
2* -25 = a - 5b

If we multiply the second equation by 1, it remains the same:

-25 = a - 5b

Now, let's add both equations to eliminate ""a"":

(8) + (-25) = (a + 6b) + (a - 5b)
-17 = 2a + b

We now have a new equation (let's call it equation 3):

3) -17 = 2a + b

To solve for a and b, we can use equations 1 and 3:

From equation 1:
a = 8 - 6b

Substitute a into equation 3:
-17 = 2(8 - 6b) + b
-17 = 16 - 12b + b
-17 = 16 - 11b
-33 = -11b
b = 3

Now that we have b, we can find a by substituting back into equation 1:
a = 8 - 6(3)
a = 8 - 18

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the given input-output relationship, we need to understand that ax^0 is a constant term since any number to the power of 0 is 1, and bx^1 is a linear term since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself. Thus, our function y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given the input and output pairs, we can construct a system of equations to find the values for 'a' and 'b'. However, looking at the input-output pairs, a pattern emerges that suggests a possible linearity between inputs and outputs.

Consider the input-output pair (-5, -25) and (-10, -40). A change in input from -5 to -10 (a difference of -5) causes a change in output from -25 to -40 (a difference of -15). Similarly, from the input-output pair (-3, -19) to (-5, -25), a change in input of -2 results in a change in output of -6. This hints that the relationship might be linear and directly proportional. For input 0, the output should ideally be the constant 'a'.

However, a direct calculation reveals that for all the negative inputs, if you multiply the input by 3 and subtract 10, you arrive at the output:

For x = -5:  -5 * 3 - 10 = -25
For x = -3:  -3 * 3 - 10 = -19
For x = -10: -10 * 3 - 10 = -40
For x = -14: -14 * 3 - 10 = -52

This pattern suggests that 'a' = -10 and 'b' = 3 for the negative inputs. It seems that when the input is positive, the function deviates from this behavior. For instance, when the input is 6, the output is 8, which can't be obtained using the a = -10, b = 3 function.

Nevertheless, since we need one function to describe all the data, we need to make an assumption or average these deviant values. If our pattern holds true generally, we should obtain for x = 6: 6 * 3 - 10 = 8 as we see in the dataset. But 18 - 10 is actually 8, which coincidentally matches our desired output. 

This pattern matches all the provided input-output pairs, including the positive input.

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can observe that \( ax^0 \) is the constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and \( bx^1 \) is simply \( bx \) since any number to the power of 1 is itself.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations:

For input 6, output 8:
\( 8 = a*6^0 + b*6 \)
\( 8 = a + 6b \)

For input -5, output -25:
\( -25 = a*(-5)^0 + b*(-5) \)
\( -25 = a - 5b \)

For input -3, output -19:
\( -19 = a*(-3)^0 + b*(-3) \)
\( -19 = a - 3b \)

For input -10, output -40:
\( -40 = a*(-10)^0 + b*(-10) \)
\( -40 = a - 10b \)

For input -14, output -52:
\( -52 = a*(-14)^0 + b*(-14) \)
\( -52 = a - 14b \)

Looking at these equations, we can attempt to solve for the values of \( a \) and \( b \). One approach to find a pattern in the change of the output relative to the change in the input.

Comparing the input-output pairs, there is a consistent pattern where the output changes by -4 times the change in input:

- Increasing input from -14 to -10 (increase of 4), output increases from -52 to -40 (increase of 12).
- Increasing input from -10 to -5 (increase of 5), output increases from -40 to -25 (increase of 15).
- And so on.

This suggests that our coefficient \( b \) might be 3 since -4 (change in output) / 4 (change in input) = -1 and then this -1 must be further multiplied by -3 to match the change in outputs observed above.

Let's test our hypothesis for \( b = 3 \):

For input -5, output -25:
\( -25 = a + 3*(-5) \)
\( -25 = a - 15 \)
\( a = -10 \)

Let's check if \( a = -10 \) and \( b = 3 \) make sense for other pairs:

For input 6, output 8:
\( 8 = -10 + 3*6 \)
\( 8 = -10 + 18 \)
\( 8 = 8 \) (which is consistent)

For other inputs:
For input -3, output -19:
\( -19 = -10 + 3*(-3) \)
\( -19 = -10 - 9 \)
\( -19 = -19 \) (which is consistent)

For input -10, output -40:
\( -40 = -10 + 3*(-10) \)
\( -40 = -10 - 30 \)
\( -40 = -40 \) (which is consistent)

For input -14, output -52:
\( -52 = -10 + 3*(-14) \)
\( -52 = -10 - 42 \)

- For x = 6, y = 8 can be written as 8 = a * 1 + b * 6
- For x = -5, y = -25 can be written as -25 = a * 1 + b * (-5)

- For x = -14, y = -52 can be written as -52 = a * 1 + b * (-14)

Now, let's consider two of these equations and solve for a and b:

From the first point (x = 6, y = 8):
8 = a + 6b ... (1)

From the second point (x = -5, y = -25):
-25 = a - 5b ... (2)

We can solve for a and b using simultaneous equations:

(1) a + 6b = 8
(2) a - 5b = -25

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) gives:
11b = 33

Solving for b we get:
b = 33 / 11
b = 3

Using b to solve for a from equation (1):

    From the given pairs of inputs and outputs, we can deduce that the relationship of input \( x \) to output \( y \) seems to be linear, and we want to find coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) to describe the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \). Note that \( x^0 \) is always 1, so \( ax^0 \) is just \( a \). Hence, our function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \). Let's use the given points to find \( a \) and \( b \).

Take the first and second points: (9, 29) and (2, 8), and write down the relationships:

For input 9, output 29:

For input 2, output 8:

Now, we can solve these two equations as a system to find \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's multiply the second equation by -4.5 to help eliminate \( a \) when we add it to the first equation (we multiply by -4.5 because 9 divided by 2 is 4.5 and we want the coefficients of \( b \) to cancel each other out):

\[ -36 = -4.5a - 9b \]

Add this to the first equation:

\[ 29 = a + 9b \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can use the provided input-output pairs to determine the constants a and b in the function of the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Since x^0 is always 1, the equation simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We can now use two of the input-output pairs to set up a system of equations to solve for a and b.

Let's use the input-output pairs (x=9, y=29) and (x=2, y=8):

For x=9, y=29:
29 = a + b(9)

For x=2, y=8:
8 = a + b(2)

Let's solve this system of equations. First we will subtract the second equation from the first:

29 - 8 = a + 9b - (a + 2b)
21 = 7b
b = 3

Now we'll substitute b back into one of the original equations to solve for a. Let's use the second equation:

8 = a + 3(2)
8 = a + 6
a = 8 - 6
a = 2

So, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = 2x^0 + 3x^1

or simply

y = 2 + 3x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function that describes the given set of inputs and outputs as `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, where `x` is the input and `y` is the output, we essentially need to find the values for coefficients `a` and `b`.

Since `ax^0` is equivalent to `a` (because any number to the zero power is 1), and `bx^1` is equivalent to `bx` (because any number to the first power is itself), the function simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

We can solve for `a` and `b` by using the provided input-output pairs. Let's set up a system of equations using two of the provided pairs:

Using input 9 and output 29:
29 = a + b(9)

Using input 2 and output 8:
8 = a + b(2)

Now, we have two equations:
1) 29 = a + 9b
2) 8 = a + 2b

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate `a` and solve for `b`:
29 - 8 = (a + 9b) - (a + 2b)
21 = 7b
b = 21 / 7
b = 3

Now that we have `b`, substitute `b = 3` into one of the equations to solve for `a`:
8 = a + 2(3)
8 = a + 6
a = 8 - 6
a = 2

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship of the given inputs and outputs is:
y = 2 + 3x

y = 2x^0 + 3x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we notice that each output is three more than three times the input.

Hence, based on the given points, we can deduce that the function is likely of the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

where a and b are constants we need to find. Given that the term \( ax^0 \) is equivalent to \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any x, and \( bx^1 \) is just \( bx \), the function simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Let's consider the given points:

1. When x = 9, y = 29
2. When x = 2, y = 8
3. When x = -1, y = -1
4. When x = -6, y = -16

Let's take two points to solve for a and b:

Using points (1) and (3):

\[ 29 = a + 9b \]
\[ -1 = a -1b \]

Now, we subtract the second equation from the first:

\[ (29 - (-1)) = (a + 9b) - (a - b) \]
\[ 30 = 10b \]
\[ b = 3 \]

Then, use b to solve for a:

\[ -1 = a - 1(3) \]
\[ -1 = a - 3 \]
\[ a = 2 \]

So the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) is:

\[ y = 2 + 3x \]

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we recognize that ax^0 is a constant term (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 simplifies to bx. So we're essentially looking for a function of the form:

y = a + bx

Where ""a"" represents the y-intercept and ""b"" represents the slope of the line. To find these, we need two points to solve the system of linear equations. Let's take any two points from the given data, say:

Point 1 (x1, y1): (-3, 18)
Point 2 (x2, y2): (2, -17)

Plugging these into our linear equation format we get two equations:

18 = a + b(-3)
-17 = a + b(2)

Now we'll solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 (to eliminate a when we sum the two equations), we get:

36 = 2a - 6b
-51 = 3a + 6b

Now we add the two equations:

36 + (-51) = 2a - 6b + 3a + 6b
-15 = 5a

Now solve for a:

a = -15 / 5
a = -3

Now we can plug the value of a into one of our initial equations to solve for b. Using the first equation:

18 = -3 - 3b
3b = -3 - 18
3b = -21

b = -21 / 3
b = -7

The function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is therefore:

y = -3 + (-7)x

Or, simplifying:

y = -3 - 7x

    To find a linear function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, which simplifies to `y = a + bx` because `x^0` is 1 for any x that is not zero, we need to find the values of `a` and `b` that best fit the given data points.

Given the data points (-16, 109), (-3, 18), (2, -17), (12, -87), and (5, -38), we calculate `b` as the slope of the line that best fits these points and then calculate `a` as the y-intercept.

To find the slope `b`, we can use two data points and the formula for slope:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Let's use the first two points (-16, 109) and (-3, 18):

b = (18 - 109) / (-3 - (-16))
b = (-91) / (13)
b = -7

Now that we have our `b` value, we need to find `a`. We could do so by substituting one of our (x, y) pairs into the equation y = a + bx and solving for `a`:

Given the input/output pairs provided, we can use two of them to solve for a and b because we have two unknowns and thus need two equations to solve for them.

Let's use the input/output pairs (-16, 109) and (2, -17) to set up a system of equations:

For the input -16:
109 = a + b(-16) ... (Equation 1)

For the input 2:
-17 = a + b(2) ... (Equation 2)

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate a:

    To write a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can simplify it to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x that is not zero, and \( x^1 = x \). We need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that will make the function fit the given input-output pairs as closely as possible.

Given the form \( y = a + bx \), let's find \( a \) and \( b \) by using two of the input-output pairs. We can then check if the resulting function fits the other given points.

Using the points (-16, 109) and (2, -17):
1. From the point (-16, 109), we get the equation \( 109 = a + b(-16) \) or \( 109 = a - 16b \).
2. From the point (2, -17), we get the equation \( -17 = a + 2b \).

Solving the system of equations:
1. \( 109 = a - 16b \)
2. \( -17 = a + 2b \)

From equation (2), we can express \( a \) as:
\( a = -17 - 2b \)

Substituting \( a \) into equation (1), we get:
\( 109 = (-17 - 2b) - 16b \)
\( 109 = -17 - 18b \)
\( 126 = -18b \)
\( b = -7 \)

Now, we substitute \( b \) back into \( a = -17 - 2b \):
\( a = -17 - 2(-7) \)
\( a = -17 + 14 \)
\( a = -3 \)

So the function that best fits the two chosen points (-16, 109) and (2, -17) is:

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the data points given, we are essentially finding a linear function of the form y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1 for any number x except when x is 0.

This function is the equation of a straight line where 'a' is the y-intercept and 'b' is the slope of the line. To determine the constants 'a' and 'b', we can use two of the given points to get two equations and solve them to find 'a' and 'b'.

1. For (-3, 18): 18 = a + b(-3)
2. For (2, -17): -17 = a + b(2)

Now, let's solve these two equations simultaneously.

From the first equation:

a = 18 + 3b  ... (i)

The function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is essentially a linear equation y = b * x + a, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope. We can rewrite our goal function as y = a + bx, with \( x^0 \) being 1 for all x (except x=0, where it is defined as 1 by convention).

Now, we need to find the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a). To determine the slope, we will need to pick two points and use the slope formula:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Let's choose the points (-9, 162) and (17, -254) for calculation:

b = (-254 - 162) / (17 - (-9))
b = (-416) / (26)
b = -16

    The given function form is y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) because any non-zero number raised to the power of zero is one (x^0 = 1).

To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use two of the given input-output pairs to solve for a and b.

Let's use the input-output pairs (-9, 162) and (17, -254):

1. \( 162 = a - 9b \)
2. \( -254 = a + 17b \)

Now we have a system of two linear equations that we can solve for a and b. We can multiply the first equation by 17 and the second equation by 9 to eliminate a when we subtract one equation from the other:

\( 17 * 162 = 17a - 153b \)
\( 9 * -254 = 9a + 153b \)

Now, add the two equations:

\( 17 * 162 + 9 * -254 = (17a - 153b) + (9a + 153b) \)

Solve for a:

\( 2754 - 2286 = 26a \)
\( 468 = 26a \)
\( a = 18 \)

With the value of a, use one of the original equations to find b. Using the first equation:

\( 162 = 18 - 9b \)

Now solve for b:

\( 144 = -9b \)
\( b = -16 \)

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

\( y = 18 - 16x \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a linear function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first need to understand that \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) (since anything raised to the power of zero is 1) and \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \) (since anything raised to the power of one is itself). So the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \). Now we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that best fit the given input-output pairs.

We can start this by considering two input-output pairs to form a system of equations, which we can then solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's choose the pairs (18, 350) and (12, 230), as both have positive inputs and outputs, which can make calculations a bit simpler.

Using these two pairs:

For input 18, output 350:
\( 350 = a + 18b \)

For input 12, output 230:
\( 230 = a + 12b \)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously:

Subtract the second equation from the first:

\( 350 - 230 = a + 18b - (a + 12b) \)
\( 120 = 6b \)
\( b = 120 / 6 \)
\( b = 20 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can substitute it back into either equation to find \( a \). We'll use the second equation for convenience:

\( 230 = a + 12*20 \)
\( 230 = a + 240 \)
\( a = 230 - 240 \)
\( a = -10 \)

So the function that fits the data is:

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any x value other than 0, we need to calculate the constants \( a \) and \( b \) such that the function best fits the given input-output pairs.

The given points are:
- (18, 350)
- (12, 230)
- (−13, −270)
- (4, 70)

From these points, one strategy to find \( a \) and \( b \) is to set up a system of linear equations using two input-output pairs and solve for \( a \) and \( b \). We will use two points to create two equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's use the points (12, 230) and (16, 310).

For the first point (12, 230): \( 230 = a + 12b \) (1)

For the second point (16, 310): \( 310 = a + 16b \) (2)

Now, subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate \( a \):

\( 310 - 230 = a + 16b - (a + 12b) \)
\( 80 = 4b \)
\( b = 20 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can plug it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find \( a \):

Using equation (1):

    The function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) can be written in the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Here, x^0 is equal to 1 for any value of x, so ax^0 is just a constant a. This function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

To find the values of a and b that describe the given input-output pairs, we need to set up a system of equations. However, since we only need two points to determine the linear relationship, we can use two of the given input-output pairs to find a and b.

Let's take the input-output pairs (12, 230) and (16, 310). When x = 12, y = 230; when x = 16, y = 310. This leads to two equations:

230 = a + 12b
310 = a + 16b

Now we subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

310 - 230 = a + 16b - (a + 12b)
80 = 4b
b = 20

Now we can substitute the value of b back into either of the equations to find the value of a. Using the equation for when x = 12:

230 = a + 12(20)
230 = a + 240
a = 230 - 240

We have the system of equations:
1. \(350 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1\)
2. \(230 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1\)

This simplifies to:
1. \(350 = a + 18b\)
2. \(230 = a + 12b\)

From equation 2 we can express \(a\) in terms of \(b\):
\(a = 230 - 12b\)

Now plug this expression for \(a\) into the first equation:
\(350 = (230 - 12b) + 18b\)
\(350 = 230 + 6b\)
\(120 = 6b\)
\(b = 20\)

Now we can solve for \(a\) using \(b = 20\):

Given the data points (13, 177), (14, 191), (-8, -117), (3, 37), and (7, 93), we want to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) that would best fit these points. Normally, we might use methods like least squares regression to find the best fit, but since we have a limited data set, we could attempt to determine a pattern directly from the data.

Firstly, let's look at the differences in 'y' for consecutive 'x' values:
- Between \(x=13\) and \(x=14\), the increase in 'y' is \(191 - 177 = 14\).
- For \(x=-8\), there's no immediate consecutive value to compare with.
- Between \(x=3\) and \(x=7\), the increase in 'y' is \(93 - 37 = 56\), or an average of \(56 / (7-3) = 14\) per unit 'x'.

From this, we can see that 'b' is likely to be 14, since the increase in 'y' per unit increase in 'x' is consistently 14 (even for just the sample we computed).

Now we need to find 'a'. We can take any of the given points to do this. Let's use the point (3, 37).

We are looking for constants a and b such that the outputs for the respective inputs match the data provided.

Let's start by looking at the change in the output when the input changes. We can find the difference between consecutive inputs and outputs to get a hint of what b might be:

- From input 13 to 14: The output changes from 177 to 191, so the change in output is 191 - 177 = 14.
- From input 3 to 7: The output changes from 37 to 93, so the change in output is 93 - 37 = 56 over an input change of 4. Dividing this change by 4 gives us 56 / 4 = 14.

It seems that b could be 14 since increasing the input by 1 results in an increase of 14 in the output.
