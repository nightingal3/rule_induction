"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to recognize that ax^0 is a constant because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So the function can be rewritten as y = a + bx. We are looking for the values of a and b that will fit the given input-output pairs.

To solve for 'a' and 'b', we can use two of the given points to set up a system of linear equations. Let's use the points (-10, -213) and (9, 167):

For the input -10:
a - 10b = -213    ... (1)

For the input 9:
a + 9b = 167    ... (2)

To solve this system of equations, we can use the addition method to eliminate 'a'. To do that, add both equations:

a - 10b + a + 9b = -213 + 167
2a - b = -46

Now, we will solve for 'a'. Let's multiply equation (2) by 2 and subtract equation (1) to isolate 'a':

2a + 18b = 334    ... (3) (equation (2) multiplied by 2)
a - 10b = -213    ... (1)

Subtract equation (1) from equation (3):
2a + 18b - (a - 10b) = 334 - (-213)
2a + 18b - a + 10b = 334 + 213
a + 28b = 547

Now, solve for 'a':
a = 547 - 28b

We'll now find 'b' by inserting the expression for 'a' into one of our other equations. Let's use equation (2) for this purpose:

(547 - 28b) + 9b = 167
547 - 28b + 9b = 167
547 - 19b = 167

Now solve for 'b':
-19b = 167 - 547
-19b = -380
b = -380 / -19
b = 20

Having found 'b', we can now find 'a':
a + 9 * 20 = 167
a + 180 = 167
a = 167 - 180
a = -13

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = -13 + 20x

(Or in the exact form requested: y = -13x^0 + 20x^1)

y = -13 + 300
y = 287

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To derive the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use two points to determine the coefficients a and b. This is because the function is linear and two points are sufficient to determine a line.

We have the function form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where ax^0 is equivalent to a (since x^0 = 1 for any x not equal to 0) and bx^1 is just bx. Thus, the function form simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's use the points (-10, -213) and (20, 387) to solve for a and b. We have two equations based on these points:

1. For point (-10, -213): -213 = a - 10b
2. For point (20, 387): 387 = a + 20b

Now, let's solve this system of linear equations.

From equation 1:
a = -213 + 10b    ...(eq. 3)

Substituting eq. 3 into equation 2 gives:
387 = (-213 + 10b) + 20b
387 = -213 + 30b
600 = 30b
b = 20

Now substitute b back into eq. 3 to solve for a:
a = -213 + 10(20)
a = -213 + 200
a = -13

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:
y = -13 + 20x

Which can be rewritten in the exact form requested:

    ","Given the function we derived, y = -13 + 20x, we can find the output for the input x = -6.

y = -13 + 20(-6)

y = -133

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the coefficients `a` and `b` such that the function `y = ax^0 + bx^1` fits the given data points, we should understand that:

- `ax^0` simplifies to `a` because any number to the power of 0 is 1
- `bx^1` simplifies to `bx` because any number to the power of 1 is the number itself

So our function simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

We can then substitute the known input-output pairs into this equation to solve for a and b.

Let's use two data points to solve for `a` and `b`. It is often useful to choose points that will simplify the arithmetic. However, in this case, we'll illustrate the method with just the first two points provided:

1) For input -10, output -213
-213 = a - 10b

2) For input 9, output 167
167 = a + 9b

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

1) a - 10b = -213
2) a + 9b = 167

We can solve this system by adding the two equations to eliminate `a`:

(a - 10b) + (a + 9b) = -213 + 167
2a - b = -46

Now, we will isolate `b`:

b = 2a + 46

Substituting this into one of the original equations, let's choose equation 2):

a + 9b = 167

a + 9(2a + 46) = 167
a + 18a + 414 = 167
19a = 167 - 414
19a = -247

Now, solve for `a`:

a = -247 / 19
a = -13

Now we can find `b`:

b = 2(-13) + 46
b = -26 + 46
b = 20

So the values for `a` and `b` that fit our function are:

a = -13
b = 20

Therefore, our function is:

y = -13 + 20x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to first understand that ax^0 is a constant term because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, ax^0 = a. The bx^1 term is simply bx because any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself. Thus, we are looking for an equation of the form y = a + bx.

Using the inputs and outputs provided, we have a set of linear equations:

For input -10 (x = -10), output -213 (y = -213):
-213 = a - 10b

For input 9 (x = 9), output 167 (y = 167):
167 = a + 9b

For input 4 (x = 4), output 67 (y = 67):
67 = a + 4b

For input -3 (x = -3), output -73 (y = -73):
-73 = a - 3b

For input 20 (x = 20), output 387 (y = 387):
387 = a + 20b

We can now use any two of these equations to solve for a and b. Let's use the first two for simplicity.

From the first equation with input -10:
-213 = a - 10b ...(1)

From the second equation with input 9:
167 = a + 9b ...(2)

Now, add equation (1) to equation (2) to eliminate a and solve for b:

-213 + 167 = (a - 10b) + (a + 9b)
-46 = 2a - b
2a = b - 46
a = (b - 46) / 2

Now b can be isolated by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):

167 - (-213) = (a + 9b) - (a - 10b)
380 = 19b
b = 380 / 19
b = 20

Now plug the value of b back into the expression for a:

a = (b - 46) / 2
a = (20 - 46) / 2
a = -26 / 2
a = -13

Now we have the values for a and b:

a = -13
b = 20

So the function describing the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are essentially looking for a first-degree polynomial (linear equation) with the general form of \( y = b_0 + b_1x \), where \( b_0 \) and \( b_1 \) are constants (with \( b_0 = a \) since \( x^0 \) is always 1, and \( b_1 = b \)).

Given the data points:

1. \((-10, -213)\)
2. \((9, 167)\)
3. \((4, 67)\)
4. \((-3, -73)\)
5. \((20, 387)\)

We can determine \( b_0 \) and \( b_1 \) by fitting a linear line to these points using the method of least squares or by solving a system of linear equations that comes from these points. However, you provided a finite number of data points, so a perfect solution might not exist. Instead, we can estimate the line that fits best to these points.

While we could do this analytically, for a series of points like these, which don't seem to fit an obvious linear pattern, we could use numerical methods or computational tools to find the best fitting line. However, assuming there's an exact answer for these particular points without using computational tools, we would do the following:

Pick two data points to calculate \( b_1 \) (slope):
Taking the points \((-10, -213)\) and \((20, 387)\):

\( b_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{387 - (-213)}{20 - (-10)} = \frac{600}{30} = 20 \)

Once we have \( b_1 \), we can solve for \( b_0 \) (y-intercept) by plugging \( b_1 \) and any data point into the formula \( y = b_0 + b_1x \).
Using the point \((-10, -213)\), we get:

\( -213 = b_0 + 20(-10) \)
\( -213 = b_0 - 200 \)
\( b_0 = -213 + 200 \)
\( b_0 = -13 \)

Therefore, the function that most closely describes the data provided would be:

\( y = -13x^0 + 20x^1 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( y = -13 + 20x \)

This formula is derived strictly from mathematical calculations, and actual best fit could vary significantly depending on the overall trend if more data points were considered. This formula may not perfectly describe the other given points, but it is the linear function that exactly fits the two data points we chose to use in our calculations.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find out the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for any x except 0, we must determine the values of a and b that give us the respective outputs for the given inputs. 

From the inputs and outputs provided, we have the following system of equations:

1) a + b(-18) = 339
2) a + b(0) = -3
3) a + b(5) = -98
4) a + b(-3) = 54
5) a + b(-16) = 301

From equation 2, we immediately see that a = -3.

Now we substitute a into the remaining equations to find b:

1) -3 - 18b = 339
3) -3 + 5b = -98
4) -3 - 3b = 54
5) -3 - 16b = 301

Let's solve for b using the first equation:

-3 - 18b = 339
-18b = 339 + 3
-18b = 342
b = 342 / -18
b = -19

Now, let's plug the values of a and b into the function:

    To find a function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we treat the term ax^0 as a constant term (a) since any number to the power of 0 is 1, and bx^1 as the linear term (bx) since any number to the power of 1 is itself. 

We are given:

1. y = a(-18)^0 + b(-18) when x = -18, y = 339
2. y = a(0)^0 + b(0) when x = 0, y = -3
3. y = a(5)^0 + b(5) when x = 5, y = -98
4. y = a(-3)^0 + b(-3) when x = -3, y = 54
5. y = a(-16)^0 + b(-16) when x = -16, y = 301

Let's replace x^0 with 1 and x^1 with x to simplify:

1. 339 = a(1) + b(-18)
2. -3 = a(1) + b(0)
3. -98 = a(1) + b(5)
4. 54 = a(1) + b(-3)
5. 301 = a(1) + b(-16)

From the second equation, when x = 0, y = -3, thus determining that a = -3 since b(0) is 0. Now that we have a, we can use any of the other equations to solve for b. Let's use equation 4 for simplicity:

54 = -3 + b(-3)

Adding 3 to both sides gives:

57 = b(-3)

Dividing both sides by -3 gives the value for b:

Given the pairs (x, y):

(5, -31), (9, -51), (-11, 49), (-4, 14), and (-12, 54),

We can set up a system of equations to solve for `a` and `b`. Let's use two of the points to solve for `a` and `b`.

Let's use the points (5, -31) and (-11, 49):

From (5, -31):
-31 = a + 5b ...(1)

From (-11, 49):
49 = a - 11b ...(2)

Now we have a system of two equations, and we can solve for `a` and `b`. Let's multiply equation (1) by 11 and equation (2) by 5 to eliminate the variable `a` when we add them:

-341 = 11a + 55b ...(3)

245 = 5a - 55b  ...(4)

Now, adding equations (3) and (4):

-96 = 16a  ...(5)

Divide both sides by 16:

-6 = a

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we can recognize this as a linear equation of the form y = b0 + b1*x, where b0 is the y-intercept (a constant term) and b1 is the slope of the line.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs:

(5, -31)
(9, -51)
(-11, 49)
(-4, 14)
(-12, 54)

We can observe that the change in output when the input increases by 1 is consistent, which suggests a linear relationship. Let's calculate the slope first.

Taking the change between two points, for example between x = 5 (y = -31) and x = 9 (y = -51):

slope (b1) = (change in y) / (change in x) 
           = (-51 - (-31)) / (9 - 5) 
           = (-51 + 31) / (9 - 5) 
           = -20 / 4 
           = -5

Now, knowing the slope is consistent, we can use any point to find the y-intercept (b0). We can take the point (-4, 14) to solve for b0:

14 = b0 - 5*(-4)
14 = b0 + 20
b0 = 14 - 20

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can analyze the given data points. In the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, ax^0 simplifies to a since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, and bx^1 simplifies to bx because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself. So effectively, we are looking for a function of the form y = a + bx.

We can use two data points to solve for the coefficients a and b. Let's use the first two:

For the input 5, output -31:
-31 = a + 5b  ... (1)

For the input 9, output -51:
-51 = a + 9b  ... (2)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b. Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) gives:

-51 - (-31) = a + 9b - (a + 5b)
-20 = 4b

b = -20 / 4
b = -5

Now we can substitute b back into either equation (1) or (2) to solve for a. Using equation (1):

-31 = a + 5(-5)
-31 = a - 25
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

Thus, the function that describes the data provided is:

y = -6 + (-5)x

y = -6 - 5x

    To find a linear function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which is equivalent to \(y = a + bx\), we need to solve for \(a\) and \(b\). We can use two points from the given data to set up a system of linear equations:

Let's use the inputs and outputs of \((5, -31)\) and \((9, -51)\):

For \(x = 5\), \(y = -31\):
\[-31 = a + 5b\]  (Equation 1)

For \(x = 9\), \(y = -51\):
\[-51 = a + 9b\]  (Equation 2)

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to solve for \(b\):

\((-51) - (-31) = (a + 9b) - (a + 5b)\)
\[-20 = 4b\]
\[b = -5\]

Now substitute \(b\) back into Equation 1 to solve for \(a\):

\(-31 = a + 5(-5)\)
\(-31 = a - 25\)

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants ""a"" and ""b"" such that the function correctly maps the given inputs to the outputs.

The general form given is equivalent to y = a + bx, since any number (except zero) raised to the power of 0 is 1.

For each input-output pair, we can form an equation:

1. For input 5 and output -31: -31 = a + 5b
2. For input 9 and output -51: -51 = a + 9b
3. For input -11 and output 49: 49 = a - 11b
4. For input -4 and output 14: 14 = a - 4b
5. For input -12 and output 54: 54 = a - 12b

Now let's take two equations and solve them as a system to find the values of a and b. To simplify the calculation, let's take equations (3) and (4), since they are likely to give us simpler numbers:

49 = a - 11b ...(3)
14 = a - 4b ...(4)

Subtract equation (4) from equation (3):

49 - 14 = (a - 11b) - (a - 4b)
35 = -7b

b = -35 / 7
b = -5

Now that we have the value for b, we can substitute it back into any of the original equations to find the value for a. Let's use equation (4):

14 = a - 4(-5)
14 = a + 20
a = 14 - 20
a = -6

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, first, recognize that ax^0 is essentially a constant term (since x^0 = 1 for all x). The term bx^1 is a linear term (since x^1 = x). Given this form, the function is a linear equation y = b*x + a, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the line.

We can determine the slope (b) by taking two input-output pairs and using the equation for slope (rise over run):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Taking the input-output pairs (7, -98) and (17, -218):

b = (-218 - (-98)) / (17 - 7)
b = (-218 + 98) / (10)
b = (-120) / (10)
b = -12

So the linear relationship has a slope of -12. Now we need to find the constant term (a). We can plug in one of the input-output pairs into the equation y = -12x + a to solve for a. Using the pair (7, -98):

-98 = -12*7 + a
-98 = -84 + a
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

Therefore, a (the y-intercept) is -14.

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we can consider that ax^0 is effectively a constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is a linear term (since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself). This gives us a function of the form y = a + bx, which is a linear equation.

We can use two input-output pairs to find the values of a and b. Let's choose the pairs (7, -98) and (-6, 58).

We'll have two equations in the following form:
1. -98 = a + 7b (using the input 7)
2. 58 = a - 6b (using the input -6)

Now let's solve these equations for a and b.

Multiply the second equation by 7 to eliminate a when we add the equations together:

(1)  -98 =  a  +  7b
(7×2)  406 = 7a - 42b

Add the two equations:

-98 + 406 = (a + 7a) + (7b - 42b)
308 = 8a - 35b

Now, let's multiply the first equation by 6 and the second by 7, so that when we subtract them, we can eliminate a:

(6×1)  -588 =  6a + 42b
(7×2)   406 = 7a - 42b

Now subtract the two equations:

-588 - 406 = (6a - 7a) + (42b + 42b)
-994 = -1a + 84b
994 = a - 84b

Now we have two new equations:
308 = 8a - 35b
994 = a - 84b

Multiply the first equation by 1 and the second by 8 to eliminate b:

(1×1)  308 = 8a  -  35b
(8×2)  7952 = 8a - 672b

Now subtract the two equations:

7952 - 308 = (8a - 8a) + (-672b + 35b)
7644 = -637b

Now divide both sides by -637 to solve for b:

b = 7644 / -637
b = -12

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either one of the original equations to find a. We'll use the first equation:

-98 = a + 7(-12)
-98 = a - 84
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

    To find the linear function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that best describes the given input-output pairs, we first recognize that \( ax^0 \) is simply \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any \( x \neq 0 \). Therefore, our function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), where \( a \) is the y-intercept and \( b \) is the slope of the linear function.

Given the points (x, y):

(7, -98)
(17, -218)
(5, -74)
(3, -50)
(-6, 58)

We can find \( a \) and \( b \) by solving a system of linear equations using any two distinct points from the set above. Usually, we could use a matrix or the method of substitution or elimination to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). However, here we'll pick the two points and generate a direct formula:

Let's choose the points (7, -98) and (17, -218) to find the slope:

\[ b = \frac{-218 - (-98)}{17 - 7} = \frac{-218 + 98}{10} = \frac{-120}{10} = -12 \]

Now, we know our function has the form \( y = a - 12x \).

Next, we need to solve for \( a \). We can use either of the two points for this. Let's use the point (7, -98):

\[ -98 = a - 12 \cdot 7\]
\[ -98 = a - 84 \]
\[ a = -98 + 84 \]
\[ a = -14 \]

Thus, the linear function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the coefficients a and b for the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to solve the following system of equations based on the given set of input-output pairs (x, y):

1. y = ax^0 + bx^1 (for x = 7, y = -98)
2. y = ax^0 + bx^1 (for x = 17, y = -218)
3. y = ax^0 + bx^1 (for x = 5, y = -74)
4. y = ax^0 + bx^1 (for x = 3, y = -50)
5. y = ax^0 + bx^1 (for x = -6, y = 58)

Substituting the input-output pairs into the function, we get the following equations:

1. -98 = a*(7^0) + b*7
2. -218 = a*(17^0) + b*17
3. -74 = a*(5^0) + b*5
4. -50 = a*(3^0) + b*3
5. 58 = a*(-6^0) + b*(-6)

Since x^0 is always 1 for any non-zero x, we can simplify these equations to:

1. -98 = a + 7b
2. -218 = a + 17b
3. -74 = a + 5b
4. -50 = a + 3b
5. 58 = a - 6b

We can now use the method of linear equations to solve for a and b. Let's use the first and last equations to form a system:

From Equation 1:
a = -98 - 7b

Substitute a into Equation 5:
58 = (-98 - 7b) - 6b
58 = -98 - 7b - 6b
58 = -98 - 13b
58 + 98 = -13b
156 = -13b
b = -156/13
b = -12

We can solve this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \). Let me do the calculation.

From the first equation:

\(a = -197 + 13b\)

Insert that into the second equation:

\(265 = (-197 + 13b) + 20b\)

Combining the \( b \) terms:

\(265 = -197 + 33b\)

Adding 197 to both sides:

\(462 = 33b\)

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

a - 10b = -155 ...(1)

2a - 3b = -72

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

We can then solve for a or b using either equation (1) or (2). Let's use equation (2) and substitute a from the addition result:

a + 7b = 83
(-36 + (3/2)b) + 7b = 83

Let's begin with the assumption that the relationship is linear and that y = a + bx fits the data. We need at least two points to determine the coefficients 'a' and 'b'. We can use the pairs (-13, -197) and (-11, -169) to set up the following system of linear equations:

-36 = a - (1.5)b  [Equation 3]

Next, we'll solve Equation 3 for a:

a = -36 + (1.5)b  [Equation 4]

Now we need to plug Equation 4 back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for b. Let's use Equation 2:

83 = (-36 + 1.5b) + 7b
83 = -36 + 1.5b + 7b
83 = -36 + 8.5b
119 = 8.5b
b = 119 / 8.5
b = 14

Having found b, we can now solve for a using Equation 4:

a = -36 + (1.5)(14)
a = -36 + 21
a = -15

y = -15 + 14x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that relates the input and output, we first need to understand the structure of the function:

- \( ax^0 \) is just \( a \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) (except for \( x = 0 \)).
- \( bx^1 \) is simply \( bx \) since \( x^1 = x \).

Therefore, the function we are looking for can be simplified to y = a + bx. We have to find the values of a and b that fit the given input-output pairs.

Let's analyze two pairs to solve for a and b:

1) Input: -13, Output: -197
2) Input: 20, Output: 265

Using the form y = a + bx, we have:
- For input -13: \( -197 = a - 13b \) (equation 1)
- For input 20: \( 265 = a + 20b \) (equation 2)

Now, we solve this system of equations to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \):

Add equation 1 and equation 2 to eliminate \( a \):
\( -197 + 265 = a - 13b + a + 20b \)
\( 68 = 2a + 7b \)
\( 34 = a + 3.5b \) (equation 3)

Now, let's multiply equation 1 by 2 and then add it to equation 2:
\( 2(-197) + 265 = 2a - 26b + a + 20b \)
\( -394 + 265 = 3a - 6b \)
\( -129 = 3a - 6b \) (equation 4)

Now we can solve equations 3 and 4 together:
\( 34 = a + 3.5b \) (equation 3)
\( -129 = 3a - 6b \) (equation 4)

Let's multiply equation 3 by 3 to eliminate \( a \):
\( 102 = 3a + 10.5b \) (equation 5)

Subtract equation 4 from equation 5:
\( 102 - (-129) = 3a + 10.5b - (3a - 6b) \)
\( 231 = 16.5b \)
\( b = \frac{231}{16.5} \)
\( b = 14 \)

We can now substitute \( b = 14 \) back into equation 3 to find \( a \):
\( 34 = a + 3.5(14) \)
\( 34 = a + 49 \)
\( a = 34 - 49 \)
\( a = -15 \)

Thus, the coefficients are \( a = -15 \) and \( b = 14 \). The function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To derive the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to understand that ax^0 is just a because any number raised to the power of zero is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can substitute the values of x to find the corresponding values of a and b.

Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to set up a system of equations:

1) 9,160
2) -4,-61

Substituting these into the equation y = a + bx, we get two equations:

160 = a + b(9)
-61 = a + b(-4)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

1) 160 = a + 9b
2) -61 = a - 4b

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply equation 2 by 2 to make the coefficients of a equal and add the equations to eliminate a:

-122 = 2a - 8b
+
160 = a + 9b
________________
38 = 3a + b

Now we solve for a using equation 1):

160 = a + 9b

Since now we know that 3a + b = 38, let's solve it for a:

3a = 38 - b
a = (38 - b)/3

Plug this value of a back into equation 1) to solve for b:

160 = (38 - b)/3 + 9b
480 = 38 - b + 27b
480 = 38 + 26b
442 = 26b
b = 442 / 26
b = 17

Now that we have b, we can solve for a:

a = (38 - b)/3
a = (38 - 17)/3
a = 21/3
a = 7

Thus, the function can be described by the following parameters:

a = 7
b = 17

    The data points provided suggest that there is a linear relationship between the input x and the output y. The general form for a linear equation is y = ax + b, which can also be represented as y = bx^1 + ax^0 by substituting a for the constant term and b for the coefficient of x.

Based on the data points provided, we can set up two equations using two of the points to solve for a and b. Let's use the points (9, 160) and (-4, -61).

For the point (9, 160):
160 = 9b + a ...(1)

For the point (-4, -61):
-61 = -4b + a ...(2)

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Multiply equation (2) by 2.25 to make the coefficient of b the same as in equation (1):
2.25 * (-61) = 2.25 * (-4b) + 2.25 * a
-137.25 = -9b + 2.25a ...(3)

Adding equation (1) and equation (3) to eliminate b:
160 - 137.25 = 9b - 9b + a + 2.25a
22.75 = 3.25a
a = 22.75 / 3.25
a ≈ 7

Substituting the value of a back into equation (1):

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for all x except x = 0), we need to find the values of a and b that make this equation true for all given data points.

This equation is a linear equation with a being the y-intercept and b being the slope. So, let's determine the slope (b) first. The slope can be calculated by picking two points and using the formula:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Let's choose the points (x1, y1) = (9, 160) and (x2, y2) = (13, 228).

b = (228 - 160) / (13 - 9) = 68 / 4 = 17

Now that we have the slope (b = 17), we can use one of the points to solve for a. Let's use the point (9, 160).

160 = a + 17 * 9
160 = a + 153
a = 160 - 153

Let's use two pairs to set up our equations:

(1)
For input 9, output 160:
160 = a + 9b

(2)
For input -4, output -61:
-61 = a - 4b

Now, we can solve these two linear equations to find the values of a and b.

From equation (1):
160 = a + 9b          (3)

From equation (2):
-61 = a - 4b          (4)

Let's multiply equation (4) by 9 and equation (3) by 4 to eliminate a when we subtract the equations:
4 * (160) = 4a + 36b  =>  640 = 4a + 36b    (5)
9 * (-61) = 9a - 36b  => -549 = 9a - 36b   (6)

Add equations (5) and (6):
640 - 549 = (4a + 36b) + (9a - 36b)
91 = 13a

We can solve for a and b using a pair of input-output points to create a system of linear equations. Let's use the following two points:

(9, 160) and (13, 228).

The corresponding equations would be:

1) 160 = a + 9b
2) 228 = a + 13b

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate 'a', we get:

228 - 160 = a + 13b - (a + 9b)

Now we can substitute b back into either equation 1 or 2 to find 'a'. Let's use equation 1:

We need to find the correct values of a and b that fit all the given data points. Since we have a linear equation and more than two points, there's the possibility that the data might not perfectly align on a straight line, but let's try to find the best values for a and b. The equation can be rewritten as:

y = a + bx

To find a and b, we can use two data points to form two equations and then solve for a and b. Let's use the first two:

For the first data point (-2, 17):
17 = a - 2b

For the second data point (7, -145):
-145 = a + 7b

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1) 17 = a - 2b
2) -145 = a + 7b

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

-145 - 17 = (a + 7b) - (a - 2b)

b = -18

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into equation 1 to find a:

So we are looking for a function of the form y = a + bx.

Given this function form, we have to find the values of 'a' and 'b' that fit the data. We can do this by setting up a system of equations using two pairs of input/output values.

So, we are looking for a function of the form:

Using the points (-2, 17) and (7, -145):
1. For the first point (-2, 17):
17 = a + b(-2)

2. For the second point (7, -145):

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the given input-output pairs, we can use the basic equation of a straight line, which is usually written as y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept. However, to match the requested format, we'll use a for the y-intercept (since x^0 is equal to 1 and therefore it's the constant term) and b for the slope.

From the given pairs, we can see that all the outputs are linearly dependent on the inputs, meaning as the input increases or decreases, the output changes in a linearly consistent way. Thus, the task is to find the values of a and b that satisfy the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1 for all given input-output pairs.

Let's first set up our system of equations using two of the input-output pairs:

For input -2 and output 17:
17 = a*(-2)^0 + b*(-2)
17 = a - 2b

For input 7 and output -145:
-145 = a*7^0 + b*7
-145 = a + 7b

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1. 17 = a - 2b
2. -145 = a + 7b

We can solve this system for a and b using the following steps:

Multiply equation 1 by 7 and equation 2 by 2 to make the coefficients of a match, and then subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a.
7*(17) = 7a - 14b
2*(-145) = 2a + 14b

That gives us:
119 = 7a - 14b
-290 = 2a + 14b

Now add them together to eliminate b:
119 - 290 = 7a - 14b + 2a + 14b
-171 = 9a
a = -171 / 9
a = -19

Now we can substitute the value of a in any of the original equations to find b. Let's use equation 1:
17 = (-19) - 2b
2b = -19 - 17
2b = -36
b = -36 / 2
b = -18

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to identify the coefficients `a` and `b` that satisfy the given input-output pairs. 

Here, `ax^0` simplifies to `a` because any nonzero number to the power of 0 is 1. So our function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We have several points that we can use to determine `a` and `b`. Let's take two pairs of input and output to create a system of linear equations to solve for `a` and `b`. 

Using the input-output pairs (-2, 17) and (7, -145), we get:

1) 17 = a - 2b
2) -145 = a + 7b

Now let's solve for `a` and `b` using these two linear equations. We can use the method of elimination or substitution. We will use elimination in this case.

Multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 2 to eliminate `a` when we add them:

1) 119 = 7a - 14b
2) -290 = 2a + 14b

Now, add the two equations:

119 - 290 = (7a + 2a) + (-14b + 14b)
-171 = 9a

Divide both sides by 9 to solve for `a`:

a = -171 / 9
a = -19

Now that we have `a`, we can solve for `b` using one of the previous equations. Let's use equation 1):

17 = -19 - 2b
2b = -19 - 17
2b = -36
b = -36 / 2
b = -18

So the function that describes the data is:

y = -19 + (-18)x

or

y = -19 - 18x

    Given the form of the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we see that it represents a linear relationship between input \( x \) and output \( y \). Here \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because any non-zero number to the power of 0 is 1. So our function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Now, let us use two of the given input-output pairs to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). 

Let's take the input-output pairs (20, -307) and (-1, 8).

For the input 20 and output -307:
\( -307 = a + 20b \) --- (1)

For the input -1 and output 8:
\( 8 = a - b \) --- (2)

Let's solve these two equations simultaneously.

From equation (2):
\( a = 8 + b \) --- (3)

Now, substitute equation (3) into equation (1):
\( -307 = (8 + b) + 20b \)
\( -307 = 8 + 21b \)
\( -307 - 8 = 21b \)
\( -315 = 21b \)
\( b = -315 / 21 \)
\( b = -15 \)

Now substitute \( b \) into equation (3):
\( a = 8 + (-15) \)
\( a = -7 \)

    From the given inputs and outputs, we infer that the relationship between the input (x) and the output (y) can be described by a linear function in the form prescribed: y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Given that the form of the function is y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can rewrite this as y = a + bx, since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Let's use two data points to calculate the coefficients a and b:

Data point 1 (using Input: 20, Output: -307):
-307 = a + 20b   ... (1)

Data point 2 (using Input: -1, Output: 8):
8 = a - b        ... (2)

Now we can solve the system of equations (1) and (2) to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying equation (2) by 20, we get:

Adding equation (1) and equation (3), we get:
-307 + 160 = a + 20b + 20a - 20b

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to establish the values of 'a' and 'b' that will fit the provided input-output pairs. Recognize that ax^0 is just 'a' because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Since we have a linear form here with y = a + bx, we can solve for 'a' and 'b' using two of the provided pairs. Let's take the following two points to set up our equations:

1. For input 20, output -307:
-307 = a + 20b

2. For input -1, output 8:

Now, we can solve these two linear equations to find the values of 'a' and 'b'.

Equation 2 can be rearranged to express 'a' in terms of 'b':
a = 8 + b

Substituting this expression for 'a' into Equation 1 gives us:
-307 = (8 + b) + 20b
-307 = 8 + 21b
-315 = 21b
b = -315 / 21
b = -15

For input 20 and output -307 (pair 1):
-307 = a + 20b  (1)

For input 12 and output -187 (pair 4):
-187 = a + 12b  (2)

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:

\( (x_2, y_2) = (-5, -109) \)

Using the point-slope form:

\( y - y_1 = ((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)) * (x - x_1) \)

we get:

\( -325 - y = ((-109 + 325) / (-5 + 17)) * (-17 - x) \)

which simplifies to:

\( -325 - y = (216 / 12) * (-17 - x) \)

\( -325 - y = 18 * (-17 - x) \)

\( -325 - y = -306 - 18x \)

Adding 325 to both sides gives us:

\( -y = -306 - 18x + 325 \)

\( -y = 19 - 18x \)

Multiply both sides by -1:

\( y = -19 + 18x \)

Now we have the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \):

\( y = -19 * x^0 + 18 * x^1 \)

\( y = -19 + 18x \)

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 for the given inputs and outputs, we notice that ax^0 is equivalent to a because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

Since we have pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can create a system of equations to solve for a and b. Let's take two pairs of the inputs and outputs to set up the equations:

For the input -17 and output -325:
-325 = a + b(-17)  ...(1)

For the input 16 and output 269:
269 = a + b(16)  ...(2)

We can now solve this system of linear equations to find a and b. Let's use equation (2) to express a in terms of b:

a = 269 - 16b  ...(3)

Next, we substitute the expression for a from equation (3) into equation (1) and solve for b:

-325 = (269 - 16b) + b(-17)
-325 = 269 - 16b - 17b
-325 = 269 - 33b
-325 - 269 = -33b
-594 = -33b
b = 18

Now, we have the value for b. We can find a using equation (3):

a = 269 - 16b
a = 269 - 16(18)
a = 269 - 288
a = -19

    To find the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of a and b that will satisfy the equation for each given input-output pair.

The term ax^0 is simply a, because any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1.

Let's take two of the given input-output pairs to create a system of equations to solve for a and b.

Using the pairs (-17, -325) and (16, 269):

For the input -17:
-325 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)
-325 = a - 17b

For the input 16:
269 = a(16)^0 + b(16)
269 = a + 16b

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1) -325 = a - 17b
2) 269 = a + 16b

Let's solve for a and b using these two equations. We can add the two equations together to solve for a:

-325 + 269 = (a - 17b) + (a + 16b)
-56 = 2a - b

We can rearrange to solve for a:
2a = -56 + b
a = (-56 + b) / 2 

Now let's substitute a into one of the two initial equations. We'll use equation 2):
269 = ((-56 + b) / 2) + 16b
538 = -56 + b + 32b
538 = -56 + 33b
538 + 56 = 33b
594 = 33b
b = 594 / 33
b = 18

Now that we have the value of b, we can solve for a using the expression for a that we derived earlier:
a = (-56 + b) / 2
a = (-56 + 18) / 2
a = -38 / 2
a = -19

With a = -19 and b = 18, the function that describes the data is:

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we must first understand that x^0 is always equal to 1 for any x that is not zero. Therefore, ax^0 simplifies to a since a * 1 = a. This means the function we are trying to find is essentially y = a + bx, which is a linear equation.

Now we need to find the values of a and b that will fit the given input and output data. We can do this by setting up two simultaneous equations using two of the input-output pairs and then solving those equations for a and b.

Let's use the following two pairs:
1) Input: 10, Output: 142
2) Input: -10, Output: -158

From these pairs:
For Input 10: 142 = a + 10b
For Input -10: -158 = a - 10b

We can now solve these two equations simultaneously.

Adding both equations:
(142) + (-158) = (a + 10b) + (a - 10b)

Which simplifies to:
-16 = 2a

Thus, a = -16 / 2 = -8.

Now we can use either of the two equations to solve for b by substituting the value of a back in:

142 = -8 + 10b

b = 150 / 10

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that ax^0 is simply a constant (because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is just bx (because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself).

So, y = ax^0 + bx^1 translates to y = a + bx.

Given the input-output pairs:

1. When x = 10, y = 142
2. When x = 15, y = 217
3. When x = -10, y = -158
4. When x = -4, y = -68
5. When x = 13, y = 187

We need to find constants a and b such that they work for all of these pairs. Let's take two pairs to establish two equations to solve for a and b:

From pair 1 (x = 10, y = 142):
142 = a + b(10)

From pair 3 (x = -10, y = -158):
-158 = a + b(-10)

Now we have two equations:
1. 142 = a + 10b
2. -158 = a - 10b

Add the two equations to eliminate b:
(142 - 158) = (a + 10b) + (a - 10b)
-16 = 2a

Divide both sides by 2:
a = -16 / 2
a = -8

Now we know that a is -8, we can solve for b using either of the original two equations. Let's use the first one:
142 = -8 + 10b
142 + 8 = 10b
150 = 10b

Divide both sides by 10:
b = 150 / 10

142 = a + b(10) ... [Equation 1]

Now we have two equations:

1. 142 = a + 10b
2. -158 = a - 10b

Thus, our function simplifies to y = a + bx. To determine the constants a and b, observe the following:

1. When x = 10, y = 142, which gives us 142 = a + 10b
2. When x = 15, y = 217, which gives us 217 = a + 15b

4. When x = -4, y = -68, which gives us -68 = a - 4b
5. When x = 13, y = 187, which gives us 187 = a + 13b

We can solve this system of equations for a and b. Let's use the first and third equations:

For x = 10, we have:
142 = a + 10b --- (1)

For x = -10, we have:

Adding equations (1) and (2) to eliminate b, we get:

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to recognize that ax^0 is essentially a constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is a linear term (as x to the power of 1 is x itself).

We thus have:

y = a + bx

To find the parameters a and b, we consider two points and solve the system of equations they provide.

Let's use these two input-output pairs to form our equations:

1. For input 1, output is 2:
   2 = a + b * 1  => (1) 2 = a + b

2. For input -19, output is 122:
   122 = a + b * (-19) => (2) 122 = a - 19b

Now, let's solve this system of equations:

From (1):
a = 2 - b

Substitute the expression of a into (2):
122 = (2 - b) - 19b
122 = 2 - 20b
20b = 2 - 122
20b = -120
b = -120 / 20
b = -6

Now, substitute the value of b back into the expression of a:
a = 2 - (-6)
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

The function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is then:
y = 8 - 6x

Please note that with only two points to determine the line, we’re assuming that the relationship between the input and output for all data points is linear and follows the pattern seen in the two points used for calculation. If the relationship is not linear, or if the other points do not exactly fall on this line, this function will not accurately predict other outputs.

    To find the function in the desired form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which actually simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1, we need to determine the constants a and b. 

Given that we have pairs of inputs and outputs, we can form a system of linear equations and solve for a and b. Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to form the equations:

For Input 1 and Output 2:
2 = a + 1*b  ...(1)

We should choose another pair of input/output that (hopefully) will give us a solvable system. For instance, let's take Input: 15 and Output: -82:
-82 = a + 15*b  ...(2)

Now we will solve these two equations in two unknowns.

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
-82 - 2 = (a + 15b) - (a + b)
-84 = 14b
b = -84 / 14
b = -6

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using equation (1):
2 = a + 1*(-6)
2 = a - 6

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we are given data points and the desired function format, which is a linear equation of the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ y = a + bx \]

Here, \(a\) and \(b\) are constants that we need to determine. \(x\) is the input and \(y\) is the output.

Let's take two data points to calculate \(a\) and \(b\):

Using points (1, 2) and (-19, 122), we can set up two equations:

1. For the input 1 and output 2:
\[ 2 = a + b(1) \]
\[ 2 = a + b \]

2. For the input -19 and output 122:
\[ 122 = a + b(-19) \]
\[ 122 = a - 19b \]

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:
1. \( a + b = 2 \)
2. \( a - 19b = 122 \)

Let's solve this system of equations:

From equation (1):
\[ a = 2 - b \]

Now substitute \( a \) into equation (2):
\[ 2 - b - 19b = 122 \]
\[ 2 - 20b = 122 \]
\[ -20b = 122 - 2 \]
\[ -20b = 120 \]
\[ b = -6 \]

Now substitute \( b \) back into the equation for \( a \):
\[ a + (-6) = 2 \]
\[ a - 6 = 2 \]
\[ a = 2 + 6 \]
\[ a = 8 \]

Thus, the function in the desired form is:

Let's take two of the given input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations:

    To find function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given input and output pairs, we need to determine the constants ""a"" and ""b"". Recall that x^0 is always 1, so the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have the pairs (1, 2), (-19, 122), (17, -94), (15, -82), and (-6, 44). Let's take any two pairs of inputs and outputs to set up two equations and solve for ""a"" and ""b"".

1) For (1, 2):      a + b(1) = 2
2) For (-19, 122):  a - 19b = 122

We can solve this system of equations for ""a"" and ""b"". Let's solve the first equation for ""a"":

a = 2 - b

Now we'll substitute this into the second equation:

(2 - b) - 19b = 122

Simplifying this, we get:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the given data, we observe that ax^0 is simply a, because x^0 equals 1 for any x except for 0.

Given the data points, we can try to find b by looking at how the output changes as input changes. Since the inputs are all negative or positive integers and we have a pair of inputs, -17 and -16, where their outputs are -292 and -275 respectively, we can determine the change in output with respect to a change of 1 in input.

From -17 to -16, the input increases by 1, and the output increases from -292 to -275, a difference of 17. This suggests that for each step increase in x, the output increases by 17. Thus, b is likely to be 17.

Now, comparing input 1 and its output 14, we get:
14 = a * 1^0 + 17 * 1
14 = a + 17

To find a, we just subtract 17 from both sides:
a = 14 - 17

    To determine the coefficients a and b for the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use two data points ((x1, y1) and (x2, y2)) to set up a system of linear equations and solve for a and b. 

However, let's first recognize that a term with x^0 is essentially a constant (since any number to the power of zero is 1). This means our function can be simplified to: 

y = a + bx

Now let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to form equations:

Using the input-output pair (-17, -292) and (1, 14), we can create the following equations:

1) For the input x = -17 (which leads to the output y = -292):
-292 = a + b(-17)

2) For the input x = 1 (which leads to the output y = 14):
14 = a + b(1)

This gives us a system of two linear equations:
-292 = a - 17b
14 = a + b

We can solve this system using several methods, such as substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution for simplicity.

From the second equation, we can solve for a:
a = 14 - b

Now substitute this expression for a into the first equation:
-292 = (14 - b) - 17b
-292 = 14 - 18b
-292 - 14 = -18b

b = 17

    Given the data provided—where the input is labeled as \( x \) and the output as \( y \)—we are asked to write a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \).

Generally, this is the form of a linear equation:
- \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because any number to the power of 0 is 1.
- \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \) because any number to the power of 1 is the number itself.

So our function should look like \( y = a + bx \). 

Now we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \). Given that we have a set of points, we can calculate \( a \) and \( b \) by substituting the \( x \) and \( y \) values from a couple of the points and solving the resulting system of equations.

Let's start by using the inputs and outputs for \( x = -17 \) and \( x = 1 \).

For \( x = -17 \), \( y = -292 \):
\[ -292 = a + b(-17) \]
\[ -292 = a - 17b \]  -- (1)

For \( x = 1 \), \( y = 14 \):
\[ 14 = a + b(1) \]
\[ 14 = a + b \]  -- (2)

Now we solve this system of equations. We can start by isolating \( a \) in equation (2):
a = 14 - b  -- (3)

Substituting equation (3) into equation (1) gives us:
\[ -292 = (14 - b) - 17b \]
\[ -292 = 14 - 18b \]
\[ -306 = -18b \]
\[ b = \frac{-306}{-18} \]
\[ b = 17 \]

Now that we have \( b \), we can substitute it back into equation (3) to find \( a \):

Equation A: 14 = a + b --> a = 14 - b  (1)

2a - 16b = -278

We have two unknowns, a and b, and at least two pairs of inputs and outputs to generate two equations and solve for the unknowns.

Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to create two equations.

Using input-output pairs (14, -290) and (-7, 130), we get two equations:

1. -290 = a + 14b
2. 130 = a - 7b

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Let's multiply the second equation by 2 to eliminate a when adding it to the first equation:

2(130) = 2a - 2(7b)
260 = 2a - 14b

Now add this result to the first equation:

260 = 2a - 14b

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to recognize that \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is always equal to 1 for any x that is not 0.

Our function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We have to find the constants \( a \) and \( b \) such that the function accurately maps the provided inputs to their corresponding outputs.

From the given pairs, we have:

For input -7, output 130:
\( 130 = a + b(-7) \)  ... (1)

For input 14, output -290:
\( -290 = a + b(14) \) ... (2)

For input -12, output 230:
\( 230 = a + b(-12) \) ... (3)

For input 16, output -330:
\( -330 = a + b(16) \) ... (4)

To solve for \( a \) and \( b \), we can use any two of the given pairs:

Taking equations (2) and (4), we have two equations with two unknowns:

\( -290 = a + 14b \) ... (2)
\( -330 = a + 16b \) ... (4)

Subtract equation (2) from equation (4) to eliminate \( a \):

\( -330 - (-290) = (a + 16b) - (a + 14b) \)
\( -40 = 2b \)
\( b = -20 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can substitute it back into any of the equations to find \( a \). Using equation (2):

\( -290 = a + 14(-20) \)
\( -290 = a - 280 \)
\( a = -290 + 280 \)
\( a = -10 \)

Therefore, the function we are looking for is:

\( y = -10 + (-20)x \)

\( y = -10 - 20x \)

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can also express the equation as y = a + bx because x^0 is always 1 for any x ≠ 0. We need to determine the constants 'a' and 'b' that would define this linear relationship between the input (x) and output (y).

The function provided has two terms; the first term is 'a', which is the y-intercept (the value of y when x=0), and the second term is 'bx', where 'b' is the slope of the line. Given at least two points, we can calculate the slope, 'b', and subsequently find 'a'.

Let's use the two provided data points to calculate 'b':
(1) For x1 = -7, y1 = 130
(2) For x2 = 14, y2 = -290

The slope (b) is calculated as follows:
b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-290 - 130) / (14 - (-7))
b = (-420) / (21)
b = -20

Now that we have the slope, we can use it and one of the points to solve for 'a':
130 = a + (-20)(-7)

a = 130 - 140
a = -10

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we need to solve for a and b. We know that x^0 is always 1 for any x not equal to 0, so ax^0 is simply a.

From the given data points, we can create two equations using two different inputs and their corresponding outputs to solve for a and b.

Let's use the points (2, 15) and (7, 50).

For the input 2 and output 15, the equation will be:
15 = a*2^0 + b*2
15 = a + 2b ...(1)

For the input 7 and output 50, the equation will be:
50 = a*7^0 + b*7
50 = a + 7b ...(2)

Now, we have two equations:

1) 15 = a + 2b
2) 50 = a + 7b

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) to solve for b, we get:

50 - 15 = (a + 7b) - (a + 2b)
35 = 7b - 2b
35 = 5b
b = 35 / 5
b = 7

Using the value of b to solve for a using equation (1):

15 = a + 2*7
15 = a + 14
a = 15 - 14
a = 1

So, the function is:

Given the data points:

1. (-14, -97)

We can use any two points to find the slope \( b \) of the line. Let's use points (2, 15) and (7, 50):

\[ b = \frac{35}{5} \]

\[ b = 7 \]

    To determine the values of `a` and `b` in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, let's first substitute the provided input-output pairs into the equation and solve for `a` and `b`.

Given the equation:
y = ax^0 + bx^1
This simplifies to:
y = a + bx

Now, let's use the input-output pairs to form a system of equations:

For the first point (-14, -97):
-97 = a - 14b

For the third point (7, 50):
50 = a + 7b

We now have two equations with two unknowns:
1) -97 = a - 14b
2) 50 = a + 7b

We can solve this system of equations for `a` and `b`.

Multiply equation 2) by 2 to align the coefficients for `b`:
100 = 2a + 14b

Now add the new equation to equation 1):
-97 + 100 = 3a

a = 1

With the value of `a`, now we can find `b` from 2):

Let's choose the inputs and outputs (x, y):

Point 1 (x1, y1): (2, 15)
Point 2 (x2, y2): (7, 50)

Applying the pairs of inputs and outputs to the function, we get two equations:

For Point 1: 15 = a + 2b
For Point 2: 50 = a + 7b

Now, let's solve this system of equations:

From the first equation: a = 15 - 2b

Substitute this expression for a in the second equation:

50 = 15 + 5b

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, you can start by substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation to create a system of linear equations. The term ax^0 is just a, because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. So you are finding a function y = a + bx.

Let's use the provided input-output pairs to create two equations (using two pairs is enough since it's a linear equation with two unknowns):

For Input: 2, Output 15:
15 = a + 2b

For Input: 7, Output 50:
50 = a + 7b

Solving this system of equations, you want to find the values of a and b. One way to solve the system is to use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's opt for elimination:

Multiply the first equation by -3.5 to align the b terms:
-52.5 = -3.5a - 7b

Now add this to the second equation:
50 = a + 7b
-52.5 = -3.5a - 7b
------------------
-2.5 = -2.5a

Divide both sides of the equation by -2.5 to find a:
a = 1

Now that we have a, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find b. Let's use the first one:

15 = 1 + 2b
14 = 2b
b = 7

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which translates to \(y = a + bx\) since \(x^0 = 1\) for any number \(x\) (except for \(x = 0\)), we need to find the constants \(a\) and \(b\) that provide the best fit to the data points provided.

To do this, let's look at the inputs (x) and outputs (y):

1. \(x = 5\), \(y = -26\)
2. \(x = 1\), \(y = -14\)
3. \(x = -14\), \(y = 31\)
4. \(x = -5\), \(y = 4\)
5. \(x = -8\), \(y = 13\)

To determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\), we typically need a system of equations, but since we only have two unknowns, we only need two points to solve for them. As a pattern recognition system, I can either guess the relation based on two points and see if it fits all others or calculate \(a\) and \(b\) using more complex techniques such as least squares regression.

Let's try the first method and use points 1 and 2 to solve the system:

From \(x = 5\), \(y = -26\):  
\( -26 = a + 5b \)  (Equation 1)

From \(x = 1\), \(y = -14\):  
\( -14 = a + 1b \) or \( -14 = a + b \)  (Equation 2)

We can subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to solve for \(b\):

\( -26 - (-14) = a + 5b - (a + b) \)  
\( -12 = 4b \)  
\( b = -3 \)

Now we use the value of \(b\) to find \(a\) using Equation 2:

\( -14 = a + (-3) \)  
\( -14 = a - 3 \)  
\( a = -11 \)

So the function would be:

\( y = -11 + (-3)x \)  
\( y = -11 - 3x \)

But let's check this function with the other given points to ensure it provides a consistent description of the data:

For \(x = -14\), according to our function:  
\( y = -11 - 3(-14) \)  
\( y = -11 + 42 \)  
\( y = 31 \)

\( y = -11 - 3(-5) \)  
\( y = -11 + 15 \)  
\( y = 4 \)  
This matches too!

For \(x = -8\), according to our function:  
\( y = -11 - 3(-8) \)  
\( y = -11 + 24 \)  
\( y = 13 \)  
And this matches as well!

Let's rewrite the function:

To determine the values of a and b, we can use any two input-output pairs to create a system of equations and solve for a and b. Let's use the first two pairs:

For input 5 and output -26:
-26 = a + 5b ---- (1)

For input 1 and output -14:

Now we can solve this system of equations.

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:

The generic form of the equation given breaks down into y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1 and x^1 is simply x.

Looking at the data:

Let's label the equations for convenience:
1. -26 = a + 5b  (I)
2. -14 = a + b   (II)
3. 31 = a - 14b  (III)
4. 4 = a - 5b    (IV)

b = -7.

Now we will plug the value of b into Equation 2 to find a:
a - 3(-7) = 22
a + 21 = 22
a = 22 - 21
a = 1.

Thus, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the data approximately is:

y = 1 - 7x.

However, keep in mind that this function is a best guess based on just two of the given points. Depending on the intended use of the function and the nature of the underlying data, more sophisticated methods, such as least squares regression, may be required to provide a better fit using all points.

    To determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) in the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can set up a system of linear equations using the given input-output pairs. The general form of the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 \) is 1 for any x except 0, which simplifies further to \( y = a + bx \).

Let's use two of the provided input-output pairs to create our equations. For example, let's use the pairs \((-3, 22)\) and \((9, -62)\):

1. When \(x = -3\), \(y = 22\):
\[ 22 = a - 3b \]

2. When \(x = 9\), \(y = -62\):
\[ -62 = a + 9b \]

We now have a system of two equations that can be solved simultaneously to find \(a\) and \(b\). Let's solve it:

From the first equation: 
\[ a = 22 + 3b \]

Substitute \(a\) from the first equation into the second one:
\[ -62 = (22 + 3b) + 9b \]
\[ -62 = 22 + 12b \]
\[ -62 - 22 = 12b \]
\[ -84 = 12b \]
\[ b = -7 \]

Substituting \(b = -7\) into the equation \(a = 22 + 3b\):
\[ a = 22 + 3(-7) \]
\[ a = 22 - 21 \]
\[ a = 1 \]

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
\[ y = 1 - 7x \]

    To find a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first recognize that ax^0 is a constant because x^0 = 1 for any x. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We need to determine the values of ""a"" and ""b"" that fit the given input-output pairs.

Let's set up two equations using two of the input-output pairs to solve for ""a"" and ""b"":

Using input -9 and output 64:
64 = a + b(-9)

Using input -3 and output 22:
22 = a + b(-3)

We have two equations:

1) 64 = a - 9b
2) 22 = a - 3b

We can solve this system of equations by using various methods such as substitution or elimination. Here, the elimination method may be more straightforward.

First, we'll align the equations:

a - 9b = 64
a - 3b = 22

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate ""a"":

(-9b + 3b) = 64 - 22
-6b = 42

Now, solve for ""b"":

b = 42 / -6
b = -7

Now that we have b, substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for ""a"". We'll use the second equation:

22 = a - 3(-7)
22 = a + 21
a = 22 - 21

We can calculate the slope b by taking two points and using the formula for the slope:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Select two points from the given data, for example, (-9, 64) and (-3, 22):

Let's use two data points to find the values of a and b by forming a system of equations. I'll select the inputs -9 and -3 with their respective outputs:

1) For input -9, output 64:
64 = a + b(-9)

2) For input -3, output 22:
22 = a + b(-3)

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Rearranging them gives:

1) a - 9b = 64
2) a - 3b = 22

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1 gives:

1. For input -20 and output 265: 265 = a + b(-20)
2. For input 6 and output -99: -99 = a + b(6)

We now solve this system of linear equations.

First, let's rewrite these equations:
1. a - 20b = 265
2. a + 6b = -99

Now let's subtract the second equation from the first:
( a - 20b ) - ( a + 6b ) = 265 - (-99)
a - 20b - a - 6b = 265 + 99

Since the function is linear, we can establish a relationship between two points to find the slope (b):

Let's use points (x1, y1) = (-5, 55) and (x2, y2) = (6, -99) to find the slope:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (-99 - 55) / (6 - (-5)) = (-154) / (11) = -14

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we will first simplify the expression. Since \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any x except 0, the equation simplifies to \( y = a + bx \). Here, \( a \) is the constant term, and \( b \) is the coefficient of the linear term \( x \).

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can form the following equations:

1. For input -10, output -54: \( -54 = a - 10b \)
2. For input 4, output 2: \( 2 = a + 4b \)
3. For input -20, output -94: \( -94 = a - 20b \)
4. For input 4 (again), output 2 (again): \( 2 = a + 4b \) (This is the same as equation 2, so it does not provide new information.)
5. For input -4, output -30: \( -30 = a - 4b \)

Now we need to solve these equations to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use equations 1 and 2 to set up a system of linear equations:

\( a - 10b = -54 \) (1)
\( a + 4b = 2 \) (2)

If we add equations (1) and (2), we eliminate \( a \) and can solve for \( b \):

\( (a - 10b) + (a + 4b) = -54 + 2 \)
\( 2a - 6b = -52 \)
\( a - 3b = -26 \) ... divide by 2

Now, let's multiply equation (2) by 3 to prepare to eliminate \( b \):

\( 3a + 12b = 6 \) (2 multiplied by 3)

Subtract the above equation from \( a - 3b = -26 \):

\( (a - 3b) - (3a + 12b) = -26 - 6 \)
\( -2a - 15b = -32 \)
\( 2a + 15b = 32 \)

Now we have two new equations:

\( a - 3b = -26 \) (3)
\( 2a + 15b = 32 \) (4)

Multiplying equation (3) by 2 gives us:

\( 2a - 6b = -52 \)

Now we subtract this from equation (4):

\( (2a + 15b) - (2a - 6b) = 32 - (-52) \)
\( 21b = 84 \)
\( b = 84 / 21 \)
\( b = 4 \)

Now that we know \( b = 4 \), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for \( a \). We'll use equation (2):

\( a + 4b = 2 \)
\( a + 4(4) = 2 \)
\( a + 16 = 2 \)
\( a = 2 - 16 \)
\( a = -14 \)

Thus, the function that describes the data is:

\( y = -14x^0 + 4x^1 \)

Simplified, the function is:

\( y = -14 + 4x \)

\( y = 30 \)

So the correct output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can recognize that ax^0 simplifies to a since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the term ax^0 is essentially a constant term. The term bx^1 simplifies to bx, as any number raised to the power of 1 is itself. So, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Now, to find the exact values of a and b, we can use two data points to solve for the constants. Let's choose two inputs and outputs. For example, using the inputs -11 and -8:

For Input: -11, Output: -20,
-20 = a - 11b

For Input: -8, Output: -14,
-14 = a - 8b

Now we can solve the system of equations for a and b.

Multiply the second equation by -1 to make it easier to eliminate one of the variables:

1. -20 = a - 11b
2. 14 = -a + 8b

Adding the two equations to eliminate a:

-20 + 14 = a - 11b - a + 8b
-6 = -3b

Therefore, b = -6 / -3 = 2.

Now we can substitute b back into one of the original equations to solve for a. We'll use the first equation:

-20 = a - 11b
-20 = a - 11(2)
-20 = a - 22

So, a = -20 + 22 = 2.

Hence, the function that fits the given points is:

y = 2 + 2x

Please note that without additional information or constraints, and by only having a simple linear form for the function, this is a possible function that fits the given points. Additional points and more complex relationships may require a different function.

    To find a linear function that describes a relationship between the input, \( x \), and output, \( y \), in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \). The term \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Given the pairs of inputs and their corresponding outputs, we will determine \( a \) and \( b \) that best fit the data.

This can be done using methods such as least squares linear regression, but since we are looking for an exact fit and the function is linear, we only need two data points to determine \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the first two pairs:

For input -11, output -20:
-20 = a + b(-11)   (1)

For input -8, output -14:
-14 = a + b(-8)    (2)

Now let's solve these equations together to get \( a \) and \( b \). 

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
(-20) - (-14) = (a - a) + b(-11 - (-8))
-6 = 0 + b(-3)
-6 = -3b

Dividing both sides by -3, we get b = 2.

Now we have the value for \( b \), we can substitute \( b \) into equation (2) to find \( a \):

-14 = a + 2(-8)
-14 = a - 16
a = -14 + 16
a = 2

Thus, our function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) is:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to understand that ax^0 is equal to a*1 (since any number to the power of 0 equals 1), and bx^1 is equal to bx (since any number to the power of 1 equals the number itself). Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Now, we need to determine the values of a and b that fit the given input-output pairs. This can be done by setting up a system of linear equations based on the inputs and outputs provided, and then solving that system.

However, with the data given, there seems to be a linear relationship between x and y. If we look at the first pair (-11, -20) and the last pair (-17, -32), we can determine the slope by using the formula for the slope of a line between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):

slope (b) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

b = (-32 - (-20)) / (-17 - (-11))
b = (-32 + 20) / (-17 + 11)
b = -12 / -6
b = 2

Now we know our function will look like:
y = a + 2x

To find the value of a, we can substitute one of the input-output pairs into the equation and solve for a. Let's take the pair (-2, -2):

-2 = a + 2(-2)
-2 = a - 4
a = -2 + 4
a = 2

So the function that fits the data provided is:

    To find the relationship between the input x and the output y in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can notice that ax^0 is always equal to a (since any number to the power of zero is 1), and bx^1 is simply bx (since any number to the power of 1 is itself). So, we are looking for a function of the form:

y = a + bx

Where a and b are constants. To determine the constants a and b, we can use two of the given input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations.

Let's take the input-output pairs (-2, -2) and (-11, -20):

For the pair (-2, -2):
-2 = a + b(-2) --------> Equation 1

For the pair (-11, -20):
-20 = a + b(-11) -----> Equation 2

Now let's solve this system for a and b. Multiply equation 1 by 2 to eliminate a when we add it to equation 2:

-4 = 2a + b(-4) --------> 2 * Equation 1

Now, add this new equation to equation 2:

(-4) + (-20) = (2a + a) + (-4b - 11b)
-24 = 3a - 15b

Still, we need to solve for a and b. Let's go back to equation 1:

-2 = a - 2b
a = -2 + 2b -------------> Equation 3

Now let's plug equation 3 into our adjusted equation 2:

-24 = 3(-2 + 2b) - 15b
-24 = -6 + 6b - 15b
-24 = -6 - 9b
-18 = -9b
b = -18 / -9
b = 2

Now we'll plug the value of b back into equation 3:

a = -2 + 2(2)
a = -2 + 4
a = 2

So the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

Given this form, it simplifies to:

Using the points (10, 176) and (17, 302), we can create the following two equations:

1) For the input 10, output 176:
176 = a + 10b

2) For the input 17, output 302:
302 = a + 17b

To solve the system of equations, we can use various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. In this case, let's use the subtraction method to eliminate a:

Subtract equation 1) from 2):
(302 - 176) = (a + 17b) - (a + 10b)
126 = 7b

Now solve for b:
b = 126 / 7
b = 18

Now that we have b, we can find a by substituting b back into either equation 1) or 2). We'll use equation 1):

176 = a + 10b
176 = a + 10(18)
176 = a + 180

First, let's notice that when the input is 10, the output is 176, and when the input is 12, the output is 212. The difference in the input (x) is 2 and the difference in the output (y) is 36. Thus, for each increase of 1 in x, y increases by 36/2 = 18. So we have:

a = 9

The values are a = 9 and b = -18.

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between input x and output y is:

y = 9x^0 - 18x^1
y = 9 - 18x

    The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx, since any number to the power of zero is 1.

We have the pairs:

2. (18, -315)
3. (-16, 297)
4. (-5, 99)
5. (5, -81)

These can be translated into the following system of equations, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope:

1. 297 = a - 16b
2. -315 = a + 18b
3. 297 = a - 16b
4. 99 = a - 5b
5. -81 = a + 5b

Looking at equations 1 and 3, since they are the same, they give us no additional information.

We can solve this system by subtracting equation 5 from equation 4:

99 = a - 5b
-81 = a + 5b
-----------------
180 = -10b

This simplifies to b = -18.

Now, using b = -18 in equation 4:

99 = a - 5(-18)
99 = a + 90

Now we solve for a:

a = 99 - 90
a = 9

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are essentially looking for a function of the form y = a + bx, since x^0 = 1 for any x ≠ 0.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs:

1. When x = -16, y = 297
2. When x = 18, y = -315
3. When x = -5, y = 99
4. When x = 5, y = -81

Let's use the first two points to determine the coefficients a and b.

For the first point (x = -16, y = 297):
297 = a + b(-16)

For the second point (x = 18, y = -315):
-315 = a + b(18)

Now we have a system of linear equations:

297 = a - 16b
-315 = a + 18b

We can solve this system by using addition to eliminate one of the variables. By adding the two equations together, we get:

297 - 315 = a - 16b + a + 18b
-18 = 2a + 2b
-9 = a + b

Next, let's subtract the second equation from the first one:

297 + 315 = a - 16b - (a + 18b)
612 = -34b
b = -612 / 34
b = -18

Now, use the value of b to find a from the equation -9 = a + b:
-9 = a - 18
a = 9

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 9 - 18x 

But we need to confirm this with the other points given:

For the third point (x = -5, y = 99):
99 = 9 - 18(-5)
99 = 9 + 90
99 = 99 (which is true)

For the fourth point (x = 5, y = -81):
-81 = 9 - 18(5)
-81 = 9 - 90

    To find the coefficients a and b for the linear equation y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given input-output pairs, we can set up the equation using two different pairs of points to solve a system of linear equations. The term ax^0 is the same as a since any number to the zero power is 1.

Choose two pairs of points to set up the equations:

Using the points (-16, 297) and (18, -315):
1) 297 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)
2) -315 = a(18)^0 + b(18)

Simplify the terms with x^0:
1) 297 = a + b(-16)
2) -315 = a + b(18)

Now we have two equations, which we will call equation (1) and equation (2):
1) a - 16b = 297
2) a + 18b = -315

We can solve for a and b by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2). This will eliminate a:
(2) - (1) => a + 18b - (a - 16b) = -315 - 297
a + 18b - a + 16b = -315 - 297
34b = -612
b = -612 / 34
b = -18

Now, we can plug b into either equation (1) or (2) to solve for a:
Using equation (1):
a - 16(-18) = 297
a + 288 = 297
a = 297 - 288
a = 9

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first recognize that the term \( ax^0 \) is a constant because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x that is not equal to zero. Therefore, \( ax^0 = a \). The term \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \) because \( x^1 = x \). Therefore, the function we are looking for takes the form \( y = a + bx \).

We have two pairs of input and output that we can use to solve for a and b:

1) When \( x = -16 \), \( y = 297 \).
2) When \( x = 18 \), \( y = -315 \).

Let's set up two equations using the given points and solve for a and b:

For \( x = -16, y = 297 \):
\[ 297 = a + b(-16) \]
\[ 297 = a - 16b \] —— (1)

For \( x = 18, y = -315 \):
\[ -315 = a + b(18) \]
\[ -315 = a + 18b \] —— (2)

Now we can solve these equations simultaneously. Adding equation (1) and equation (2), we get:

\[ 297 + (-315) = a - 16b + a + 18b \]
\[ -18 = 2a + 2b \]
\[ -9 = a + b \] —— (3)

We can now solve for a by subtracting equation (3) from equation (1):

\[ 297 = a - 16b \]
\[ -9 = a + b \]
\[ 306 = -17b \]
\[ b = \frac{-306}{17} \]
\[ b = -18 \]

Plugging this value of b into equation (3), we get:

    To find the function of the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, which can be simplified as `y = a + bx`, we can use two points to solve for `a` and `b`. 

Given the points (-18, -265) and (19, 253), we can set up two equations based on the general form `y = a + bx`.

From the first point (-18, -265):
-265 = a + b(-18)     (1)

From the second point (19, 253):
253 = a + b(19)       (2)

Now, we solve this system of linear equations for `a` and `b`.

Multiplying equation (1) by 19 and equation (2) by 18 to eliminate `a` when we add them we get:

-19 * 265 = 19a - 19 * 18b
18 * 253 = 18a + 18 * 19b

Adding these two equations will cancel out `a`:

(-19 * 265) + (18 * 253) = (19a + 18a) + (-19 * 18b + 18 * 19b)
-5035 + 4554 = 37a
-481 = 37a
a = -481 / 37
a = -13

Now we will substitute `a` back into one of the original equations to find `b`. Using equation (1):

-265 = -13 -18b
-265 + 13 = -18b
-252 = -18b
b = 252 / 18

3. \( (-15, -223) \)

We need two such data points to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's take the first two data points to establish a system of linear equations.

From the point \( (-18, -265) \):
\[ -265 = a + (-18)b \]
\[ a = -265 + 18b \] ... (equation 1)

From the point \( (19, 253) \):
\[ 253 = a + 19b \] ... (equation 2)

Now, let’s solve this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \).

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

\[ 253 - (-265) = (a - a) + 19b - (-18b) \]
\[ 518 = 37b \]
\[ b = \frac{518}{37} \]
\[ b = 14 \]

Now use the value of \( b \) to solve for \( a \) using equation 1:

\[ a = -265 + 18b \]
\[ a = -265 + 18(14) \]
\[ a = -265 + 252 \]
\[ a = -13 \]

Combining these values, the function is:

Therefore, the function in the required format is:

    Given the form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we see that ax^0 is a constant term since any number raised to the power of zero is 1. Hence, ax^0 becomes a. The term bx^1 simplifies to bx as anything raised to the power of one is itself. The function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

The coefficients a and b represent the y-intercept and slope of the line, respectively. To determine these coefficients, we can use any two given points to set up a system of linear equations and solve for a and b.

Let's use the points (-18, -265) and (19, 253) to derive the linear equation.

For the first point (-18, -265):
-265 = a + b(-18)

For the second point (19, 253):
253 = a + b(19)

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) -265 = a - 18b
2) 253  = a + 19b

To solve for a and b, we can use the method of simultaneous equations. Let's add the two equations together to eliminate a:

(-265) + (253) = (a - 18b) + (a + 19b)
-12 = 2a + b

Now we can isolate b:

b = -12 - 2a

To find the value of a, we can now substitute b back into any of the original equations. Let's use equation 2):

253 = a + 19b
253 = a + 19(-12 - 2a)
253 = a - 228 - 38a
253 = -37a - 228

Now isolate a:

a = (253 + 228) / -37
a = 481 / -37
a = -13

Let's take the input-output pairs (-18, -265) and (19, 253):

1. For input -18: -265 = a + b(-18)
2. For input 19: 253 = a + b(19)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1. -265 = a - 18b
2. 253 = a + 19b

To solve for a and b, we can first add these two equations together to eliminate a:

-265 + 253 = a - 18b + a + 19b
-12 = 2a + b
-12 - 2a = b

Now that we have b in terms of a, we can substitute this expression for b into one of the original equations to solve for a:

-265 = a - 18(-12 - 2a)
-265 = a + 216 + 36a
-265 = 37a + 216
-481 = 37a
a = -481 / 37

To find the values of a and b, we need to solve for them using two of the provided input-output pairs. Let's choose two pairs to set up our system of equations. For simplicity, let's use Input: 6, Output: 71 and Input: 19, Output: 253.

From Input: 6, Output: 71:
71 = a + b(6) ... [Equation 1]

From Input: 19, Output: 253:
253 = a + b(19) ... [Equation 2]

Let's solve these two equations simultaneously to find a and b.

Multiplying Equation 1 by 19 and Equation 2 by 6 we get:
19 * 71 = 19a + 19b(6) ... [Equation 3]
6 * 253 = 6a + 6b(19) ... [Equation 4]

Which simplifies to:
1349 = 19a + 114b ... [Equation 3]
1518 = 6a + 114b ... [Equation 4]

Now, subtract Equation 3 from Equation 4:
1518 - 1349 = (6a + 114b) - (19a + 114b)
169 = -13a

Divide both sides by -13 to solve for a:
a = -169 / -13
a = 13

Now that we have a, we can plug it back into Equation 1 to find b:
71 = 13 + b(6)
71 - 13 = 6b
58 = 6b

Dividing both sides by 6 to solve for b:
b = 58 / 6
b = 9.6667

Observing the given pairs, we can also see that each y value seems to be 14 times the x value, plus a constant number. Let's apply this hypothesis to the numbers given:

For x = -18, y should be 14(-18) + c = -252 + c, and the actual output is -265. Therefore, c = -265 + 252 = -13.
For x = 19, y should be 14(19) + c = 266 + c, and the actual output is 253. Therefore, c = 253 - 266 = -13.

This further confirms our hypothesis, so a = -13 and b = 14.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, in the exact form y = ax^0 + bx^1, would be:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 which describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can use the given data points to solve for a and b.

The term ax^0 is equivalent to a, since any number except zero raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given any two unique data points, we can set up a system of equations to solve for a and b. Let's take the two data points (0, -15) and (5, 5).

From the first data point (0, -15):
-15 = a + b*0
-15 = a  (since b*0 is 0)

Now we know that a = -15. 

Using the second data point (5, 5):
5 = a + b*5
5 = -15 + 5b  (substituting a with -15)
5 + 15 = 5b
20 = 5b
b = 4

Therefore, the function is:
y = -15 + 4x

    From the given pairs of inputs and outputs, we are asked to find the function of the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

Here, \(ax^0\) is a constant term since \(x^0\) is 1 for any \(x\) that is not 0, and \(bx^1\) is simply \(bx\) since \(x^1\) is \(x\). So we are essentially trying to fit a linear equation:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Let's start by determining the constant term \(a\) and the coefficient \(b\) using the given data points.

Let's plug the given data points into the equation:

For Input: 0 (x = 0)
\[ -15 = a + b \cdot 0  \]
\[ -15 = a \]

Here we can deduce that \(a = -15\).

With \(a\) determined, we now need to find \(b\). We can use one of the other points to solve for \(b\). Using the point with Input: 5 (x = 5) and Output: 5:

\[ 5 = -15 + b \cdot 5 \]
\[ 5 + 15 = 5b \]
\[ 20 = 5b \]
\[ b = \frac{20}{5} \]

Therefore, for an input of -20, the output is as follows:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we recognize that ax^0 is always 1 times a because any number to the power of 0 is 1. So the term ax^0 is simply a constant term, and the term bx^1 is just b times x because any number to the power of 1 is itself.

Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have two unknowns (a and b) and will need at least two points to solve for those unknowns. Let's use two of the provided input-output pairs to form a system of equations to solve for a and b:

For Input: 9, Output: 133:
133 = a + 9b (1)

For Input: -16, Output: -242:
-242 = a - 16b (2)

Now, let's solve for a and b by using the system of linear equations.

We can multiply equation (1) by 16 and equation (2) by 9 to eliminate a when we subtract one equation from the other:

16 * (133 = a + 9b) => 2128 = 16a + 144b (3)
9 * (-242 = a - 16b) => -2178 = 9a - 144b (4)

Adding (3) and (4) together to eliminate b:
2128 + (-2178) = (16a + 9a) + (144b - 144b)
-50 = 25a
a = -50 / 25
a = -2

Now substitute a back into either equation (1) or (2) to solve for b:

133 = -2 + 9b
135 = 9b
b = 135 / 9
b = 15

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given set of inputs and outputs, we must first recognize that x^0 is always 1 for any x except for x = 0, in which case it is typically defined as also being 1. This means that the function is actually linear:

y = a + bx

Now, let's use two points from the provided data to find the coefficients a and b. We will use the input-output pairs (9, 133) and (-14, -212).

If we substitute the first pair into the equation we get:
133 = a + 9b

And for the second pair we have:
-212 = a - 14b

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1) a + 9b = 133
2) a - 14b = -212

We can solve this system for a and b by using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's use the elimination method:

By subtracting the second equation from the first, we eliminate a:

(1) - (2): (a - a) + (9b - (-14b)) = 133 - (-212)
0a + 23b = 133 + 212
23b = 345
b = 345 / 23
b = 15

Now that we know b, we substitute it back into the first equation to find a:

a + 9(15) = 133
a + 135 = 133
a = 133 - 135

For Input: 9, Output: 133, we have:

133 = a + 9b  (1)

For Input: 19, Output: 283, we have:

283 = a + 19b  (2)

Now, let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a and solve for b:

(283 - 133) = (a + 19b) - (a + 9b)
150 = 10b
b = 15

Now we have the value of b. Let's substitute the value of b back into equation (1) to solve for a:

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data, we can recognize that x^0 is always 1, so the term involving 'a' is just a constant. The second term is linear, with x^1 just being x, so 'b' represents the slope of the line. We are essentially looking for a linear equation of the form y = a + bx.

Given the data, we can set up a system of equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'. However, since we have 5 data points and only need to determine 2 parameters, we should realize this system may be overdetermined, meaning we may need to use methods such as least squares to find the best fit.

Nonetheless, if we examine the changes between the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can try and discern a pattern to help us identify 'a' and 'b':

Going from:
- Input: 9 to Input: 19, the output increases from 133 to 283, a difference of 150.
- Input: 19 to Input: 16, the output decreases from 283 to 238, a difference of -45.
- Input: -14 to Input: -16, the output decreases from -212 to -242, a difference of -30.

If the relationship is linear, the changes in output should be proportional to the changes in input:

(283 - 133) / (19 - 9) = 150 / 10 = 15
(238 - 283) / (16 - 19) = -45 / -3 = 15
(-242 + 212) / (-16 + 14) = -30 / -2 = 15

In all cases, the change in output over the change in input is 15, so our slope 'b' looks to be 15.

Now we can use one of our data points to solve for 'a'. Let's use the first data point (9, 133):

133 = a + 15*9
133 = a + 135

    Based on the given input-output pairs, we can deduce that there is a linear relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y). A linear equation can be typically written in the form:

\[ y = ax^1 + bx^0 \]

where:
- \( a \) is the slope of the line,
- \( b \) is the y-intercept,
- \( x^1 \) represents the input raised to the power of 1 (which is simply x),
- \( x^0 \) is always 1, as anything raised to the power of 0 is 1.

The function is presented with the exponentiation notation, which simplifies to:

\[ y = ax + b \]

Given the pairs of input (x) and output (y), we can find the values of a and b that fits these points by solving the linear equations:

1. For \( x = 9 \), \( y = 133 \):
\[ 133 = 9a + b \]

2. For \( x = 19 \), \( y = 283 \):
\[ 283 = 19a + b \]

Using these two equations, let's solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

\[ 133 = 9a + b \,(1) \]
\[ 283 = 19a + b \,(2) \]

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

\[ (283 - 133) = (19a - 9a) \]
\[ 150 = 10a \]
\[ a = 15 \]

Now, substitute \( a \) into one of the original equations to find \( b \):

\[ 133 = 9(15) + b \]
\[ 133 = 135 + b \]
\[ b = 133 - 135 \]

1. Using input 2 and output 59:
59 = a + b(2)

2. Using input -16 and output -301:
-301 = a + b(-16)

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables, a and b:

59 = a + 2b
-301 = a - 16b

To solve for a and b, we can use several methods, such as substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method by multiplying the first equation by 16 and adding it to the second one to cancel out a:

16(59) = 16a + 32b
-301 = a - 16b
------------------------------------
944 - 301 = 16a + 32b + a - 16b
643 = 17a + 16b

Now let's solve for a from the first equation:

59 = a + 2b
a = 59 - 2b

Substituting this value of a into the modified second equation above:

643 = 17(59 - 2b) + 16b
643 = 1003 - 34b + 16b
643 = 1003 - 18b
643 - 1003 = -18b

Adding this result to equation 2:

17a + 16b = 643

Now, solve for a:

17a = 643 - 16b

Let's use the two points (2, 59) and (-2, -21):

The slope 'b' is given by the change in y over the change in x:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (59 - (-21)) / (2 - (-2))
b = (59 + 21) / (2 + 2)
b = 80 / 4
b = 20

Now we can use the value of 'b' and one of the points to solve for 'a':

Using the point (2, 59):
59 = a + 20(2)
59 = a + 40
a = 59 - 40
a = 19

Now, I will check this with another point to see if it is consistent:

Using the point (-2, -21):
-21 = 19 + 20(-2)
-21 = 19 - 40
-21 = -21

The function, using the derived 'a' and 'b', is consistent for this point as well. We will assume it is the best fit for all given points (however, in mathematical precision, one would actually apply a more sophisticated fitting method to verify this).

Therefore, the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the data is:

y = 19 + 20x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data, we need to recognize that ax^0 is a constant (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is simply bx (since any number to the power of 1 is itself). So the function will look like:

y = a + bx

We must determine the appropriate values of a and b. To do this, we can use two of the given input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations. Once we have two equations, we can solve for a and b.

Let's take the input-output pairs (13, 55) and (-20, -44).

Using the first pair (13, 55), we get:
55 = a + 13b --- (1)

Using the second pair (-20, -44), we get:
-44 = a - 20b --- (2)

Now we solve this system of equations. Multiplying equation (2) by -1 to help with elimination, we get:
44 = -a + 20b --- (3)

Adding equation (1) and equation (3):
55 + 44 = a + 13b - a + 20b
99 = 33b
b = 99 / 33
b = 3

With the value of b found, we substitute it back into equation (1) to find a:
55 = a + 13(3)
55 = a + 39
a = 55 - 39
a = 16

Therefore, the function is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to calculate the coefficients a and b. Since x^0 is always 1, ax^0 is just a. Therefore, the function becomes y = a + bx.

We can plug in the given input-output pairs to form a system of equations, and then solve this system for a and b.

Let's use the first two input-output pairs to form our equations:

Using the input-output pair (13, 55):

55 = a + b(13)    [1]

Using the input-output pair (-20, -44):

-44 = a + b(-20)  [2]

Now we have a system of two equations:

55 = a + 13b      [1]
-44 = a - 20b     [2]

Let us solve this system of equations. First, we can subtract equation [2] from equation [1] to eliminate a and solve for b:

(55 - (-44)) = (a + 13b) - (a - 20b)
99 = 33b
b = 99 / 33
b = 3

Now we can substitute b back into either [1] or [2] to find a. We'll use [1]:

55 = a + 13(3)
55 = a + 39
a = 55 - 39
a = 16

Hence, we have a = 16 and b = 3. The function that describes this relationship is:

y = 16x^0 + 3x^1

y = 16 + 3x

Our function therefore has the form y = a + bx.

We can find a and b by using two data points to solve a system of linear equations. Let's take two pairs from the given data:

Using the point (13, 55):
55 = a + 13b ...(1)

Using the point (-20, -44):
-44 = a + (-20)b ...(2)

Solving the two linear equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

From equation (2):
a = -44 + 20b ...(3)

Substitute the expression for a from equation (3) into equation (1):
55 = (-44 + 20b) + 13b
55 = -44 + 20b + 13b
55 = -44 + 33b

    To find a linear function that fits the data points provided (Input -> Output), it is necessary to determine the coefficients `a` and `b` in the function of the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`. The given form simplifies to `y = a + bx`, because `x^0` is 1 for any x (except for x=0, where it is undefined).

Let's use two data points to calculate the coefficients `a` and `b`. We will use the points (13, 55) and (-20, -44).

For the first point (13, 55):
55 = a + b(13)

For the second point (-20, -44):
-44 = a + b(-20)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1) \( a + 13b = 55 \)
2) \( a - 20b = -44 \)

We can solve this system by various methods, such as substitution, elimination, or matrix methods. Here we'll use the elimination method:

Multiplying the first equation by 20 and the second equation by 13, we get:
1) \( 20a + 260b = 1100 \)
2) \( 13a - 260b = -572 \)

Adding the two equations to eliminate `b`:
\( 33a = 528 \)

Now we solve for `a`:
\( a = 528 / 33 \)
\( a = 16 \)

Using the value of `a` in either of the original equations to solve for `b`. Let's use the first equation:
\( 16 + 13b = 55 \)
\( 13b = 39 \)
\( b = 39 / 13 \)
\( b = 3 \)

Thus, the function that best fits the given points is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes this relationship, we can interpret ax^0 as a (since x^0 is always 1) and bx^1 as bx (since x^1 is just x). Thus, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We know that this is a linear function and we need to find the constants a and b that provide the best fit to the given input-output pairs.

Let's use two of the provided data points to set up two equations and solve for a and b. We should choose two points that will likely give us a straightforward solution. In this case, let's use the following two points: (13, 55) and (-20, -44). Substituting these into the equation gives us two simultaneous equations:

For the input 13: 
55 = a + 13b

For the input -20:
-44 = a - 20b

Now we can solve these two equations for a and b.

Equation 1: 55 = a + 13b
Equation 2: -44 = a - 20b

To solve for b, we can multiply Equation 1 by 20 and Equation 2 by 13 and then subtract one from the other to eliminate a:

20 * (55) = 20a + 20 * 13b (Equation 1 multiplied by 20)
13 * (-44) = 13a - 13 * 20b (Equation 2 multiplied by 13)

1100 = 20a + 260b
-572 = 13a - 260b

Adding these two:

1100 - 572 = (20a + 13a) + (260b - 260b)
528 = 33a

Divide both sides by 33:

a = 528 / 33
a = 16

Now that we have a, we can substitute it into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for b. We'll use Equation 1:

55 = 16 + 13b
39 = 13b
b = 39 / 13

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to understand that ax^0 is essentially a constant (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is a simple linear term. So, the function can be rewritten as:

y = a + bx

We can solve for a and b using two points from the given data set. Let's choose two inputs and their corresponding outputs to set up a system of equations.

Let's use these two points:
Input: -2 (x = -2)
Output: 0 (y = 0)

Input: -3 (x = -3)
Output: 8 (y = 8)

From the first point (-2, 0):
0 = a + b(-2)
0 = a - 2b...(1)

From the second point (-3, 8):
8 = a + b(-3)
8 = a - 3b...(2)

Now, let's solve the system of equations formed by (1) and (2). We can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a and solve for b.

(2) - (1) gives us:
8 - 0 = (a - 3b) - (a - 2b)
8 = -3b + 2b
8 = -b
b = -8

Now that we have the value for b, we can substitute it into equation (1) to find a:

0 = a - 2(-8)
0 = a + 16
a = -16

    To determine the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to figure out the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that will satisfy the given input-output pairs. The function simplified is essentially \( y = a + bx \), because \( x^0 \) is \( 1 \) for any \( x \) except for \( x = 0 \), but that case doesn't impact our calculation since \( a \cdot 1 = a \).

From the input-output pairs given:

1. For input -11: 
   \( 72 = a + b(-11) \)
2. For input -3:

We have a system of equations, and we need to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the equation where the output is 0 to find \( a \):

For input -2:
\( 0 = a + b(-2) \)
\( a = 2b \)  (Equation 1)

This gives us a relation between \( a \) and \( b \). We can now plug \( a = 2b \) into one of the other equations to solve for \( b \). Let's use the equation for input -11:

\( 72 = a - 11b \)
Substituting for \( a \):
\( 72 = 2b - 11b \)

The form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for all x except for \( x = 0 \) (where it's undefined but usually taken as 1).

Let's use two of the input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

For instance, taking the input-output pairs (-3, 8) and (-2, 0), we have:
1. When input \( x = -3 \), output \( y = 8 \):
\[ a - 3b = 8 \]

2. When input \( x = -2 \), output \( y = 0 \):
\[ a - 2b = 0 \]

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

\[ -b = 8 \]

\[ b = -8 \]

We have two unknowns (a and b), which means we need at least two points to solve for those unknowns. Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to set up a system of equations. It is often easier to work with smaller numbers, so we will use the points (-2, 0) and (-3, 8).

From the point (-2, 0):
0 = a - 2b

From the point (18, -160):

Nevertheless, we can still find an approximate solution that minimizes the error between the real outputs and the outputs predicted by our function.

Using equation (1) and (2) to eliminate \( a \):

\[ 66 - (-204) = a - 4b - (a + 11b) \]
\[ 270 = -15b \]
\[ b = -18 \]

Now plug the value of \( b \) back into one of the equations, for instance, equation (1):

\[ -204 = a - 198 \]
\[ a = -6 \]

This gives us the function:

2. -366 = a + 20b

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second to eliminate a and find b:

(-366) - (-204) = (a + 20b) - (a + 11b)
-366 + 204 = 9b
-162 = 9b
b = -162 / 9
b = -18

Now that we have b, we can solve for a by plugging the value of b back into either equation 1 or 2. Let's use equation 1:

-204 = a + 11(-18)
-204 = a - 198
a = -204 + 198
a = -6

Thus, the function can be described as:
y = -6x^0 - 18x^1
or simply
y = -6 - 18x

    To find the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we need to determine the values of `a` and `b`. Since `x^0` is always 1, the equation simplifies to `y = a + bx`. We can use the given input-output pairs to generate a system of equations and solve for `a` and `b`.

Let's take two of the given points to set up our system of equations. We can use the points (11, -204) and (20, -366).

Using the point (11, -204):
-204 = a + b(11) => Eq1

Using the point (20, -366):
-366 = a + b(20) => Eq2

Now we have two equations and two unknowns, and we can solve for `a` and `b`:

Eq1: -204 = a + 11b
Eq2: -366 = a + 20b

Let's subtract Eq1 from Eq2 to eliminate `a`:

(-366) - (-204) = (a + 20b) - (a + 11b)
-366 + 204 = 20b - 11b
-162 = 9b
b = -162 / 9
b = -18

Now we can solve for `a` using the value of `b` in Eq1:

-204 = a + 11(-18)
-204 = a - 198
a = -204 + 198
a = -6

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use two of the provided input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations. The term ax^0 is equivalent to a since x^0 is 1 for all x except for x = 0. Therefore, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's use the input-output pairs (11, -204) and (20, -366) to form two equations:

For input 11:
-204 = a + b(11)  => Equation 1

For input 20:
-366 = a + b(20)  => Equation 2

Now let's solve this system of equations:

From Equation 1:
a = -204 - 11b   => (3)

Substituting equation (3) into Equation 2:

-366 = (-204 - 11b) + 20b
-366 = -204 - 11b + 20b
-366 + 204 = 9b
-162 = 9b
b = -162 / 9
b = -18

Now substitute the value of b back into Equation (3):

a = -204 - 11(-18)
a = -204 + 198
a = -6

So, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b using the input-output pairs provided. The function simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 = 1.

We can set up a system of linear equations using two of the given points. Let's use the first two for convenience:

1. For Input 11, Output -204:
-204 = a + 11b

2. For Input -4, Output 66:
66 = a - 4b

Now we'll solve this system for a and b.

Multiplying the second equation by 11 to eliminate a:
66 * 11 = a * 11 - 4b * 11
726 = 11a - 44b

Adding this result to the first equation:
-204 + 726 = 11a - 44b + a + 11b
522 = 12a - 33b

Now we solve for a:
a = (522 + 33b) / 12

Substituting this expression for a into one of the original equations to find b:
66 = (522 + 33b) / 12 - 4b
66 * 12 = 522 + 33b - 48b
792 = 522 - 15b
270 = -15b
b = -270 / 15
b = -18

Substituting b back into the equation for a:
a = (522 + 33(-18)) / 12
a = (522 - 594) / 12
a = -72 / 12
a = -6

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 \) is always 1, we will need to solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using the provided input-output pairs.

We have the following system of linear equations based on the input-output pairs given:

1. \( a + b(-12) = 9 \)
2. \( a + b(20) = -55 \)
3. \( a + b(-4) = -7 \)
4. \( a + b(-10) = 5 \)
5. \( a + b(8) = -31 \)

We need to find consistent values for \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy all these equations. However, with more than two equations, it's possible that no single solution will fit perfectly due to potential inconsistencies or errors in the data.

Let's try to solve the system using two equations and see if the solution is consistent with the other ones. Selecting equations 1 and 2:

1. \( a - 12b = 9 \)   ... (i)
2. \( a + 20b = -55 \) ... (ii)

Adding equations (i) and (ii) to eliminate \( a \):

\( a - 12b + a + 20b = 9 - 55 \)

\( 2a + 8b = -46 \)

Solving for \( a \):

\( a + 4b = -23 \)   ... (iii)

Now, let's subtract equation (i) from equation (ii) to eliminate \( a \):

\( a + 20b - (a - 12b) = -55 - 9 \)

\( 20b + 12b = -64 \)

\( 32b = -64 \)

\( b = -64 / 32 \)

\( b = -2 \)

Using the value of \( b \) in equation (iii):

\( a + 4(-2) = -23 \)

\( a - 8 = -23 \)

\( a = -23 + 8 \)

\( a = -15 \)

So the function that best fits the data is:

\( y = -15 + -2x \)

However, given the nature of the data, this may not fit perfectly all provided points.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first need to understand that \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Then \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \) as any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself. So, the function simplifies to:

\( y = a + bx \)

Given the inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations to solve for coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). However, since we have more than two pairs of inputs and outputs, we can't find a single unique solution for \( a \) and \( b \) because a linear function can't perfectly fit all these points unless they all lie on the same line, which they likely don't.

Nevertheless, we can use two of the given points to determine a possible function that fits a pair of points. Let's use the first two points to set up a system of equations:

For Input: -12, Output: 9
\( 9 = a + b(-12) \)
\( 9 = a - 12b \) ...(1)

For Input: 20, Output: -55
\( -55 = a + b(20) \)
\( -55 = a + 20b \) ...(2)

Now we can solve this linear system to find \( a \) and \( b \).

If we add equations (1) and (2), we get:
\( 9 + (-55) = (a - 12b) + (a + 20b) \)
\( -46 = 2a + 8b \)
\( -23 = a + 4b \) ...(3)

We can subtract equation (1) from equation (3) to find \( b \):
\( -23 - 9 = (a + 4b) - (a - 12b) \)
\( -32 = 16b \)
\( \frac{-32}{16} = b \)
\( b = -2 \)

Then we substitute \( b \) into equation (1) to find \( a \):
\( 9 = a - 12(-2) \)
\( 9 = a + 24 \)
\( a = 9 - 24 \)
\( a = -15 \)

So, the function that fits the first two points is:
\( y = -15 + (-2)x \)

\( y = -2x - 15 \)

    To find a function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\) that best fits the given data points, we need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy the equation as closely as possible for each of the given input-output pairs. Since \(x^0 = 1\) for any x (except \(x = 0\)), our equation simplifies to \(y = a + bx\).

Given the pairs:
1. \((-12, 9)\)
2. \( (20, -55)\)
3. \((-4, -7)\)
4. \((-10, 5)\)
5. \( (8, -31)\)

We can construct the system of equations:
1. \(a - 12b = 9\)
2. \(a + 20b = -55\)
3. \(a - 4b = -7\)
4. \(a - 10b = 5\)
5. \(a + 8b = -31\)

To find the best fit line, typically, a method such as least squares regression would be used. However, since we seem to be looking for an exact solution with the form given and we have an overdetermined system (more equations than unknowns), there won't be an exact solution that satisfies all these points unless they happen to lie perfectly on a straight line (which they don't).

Normally, such a system can have no solution, or we may seek an approximate solution, for example, by using least squares regression. However, for the sake of simplicity, if we take any two pairs and solve the corresponding system of equations, we can find \(a\) and \(b\) that might fit those two points exactly but won't necessarily fit the others.

For instance, let's take the first and last points to set up our system:

\(a - 12b = 9\) (from point 1)
\(a + 8b = -31\) (from point 5)

Now add these two equations to eliminate \(a\):

\(a - 12b + a + 8b = 9 - 31\)
\(2a - 4b = -22\)

Divide by 2:
\(a - 2b = -11\) (equation 3)

Now, let's solve equation 3 and one of our original equations to get \(a\) and \(b\). We'll use equation 1:

\(a - 12b = 9\) (equation 1)
\(a - 2b = -11\) (equation 3)

Subtract equation 3 from equation 1 to eliminate \(a\):

\(-12b - (-2b) = 9 - (-11)\)
\(-10b = 20\)

Divide by -10:
\(b = -2\)

Now we can substitute \(b = -2\) into equation 3:

\(a - 2(-2) = -11\)
\(a + 4 = -11\)
\(a = -15\)

So our function that fits the two points (-12, 9) and (8, -31) exactly would be:

\(y = -15 + (-2)x\)
\(y = -15 - 2x\)

Please note that this function will not fit the other points provided and is not the least squares regression solution. For an accurate model, advanced techniques like least squares that minimize the errors across all points would need to be used.

We can use the input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations and solve for a and b. For example, using the input-output pairs (-12, 9) and (20, -55), we can create the following two equations:

1) 9 = a - 12b
2) -55 = a + 20b

We can solve this system of linear equations by using methods such as substitution or elimination. For simplicity, let's use the elimination method :

Multiply equation 1) by 20 and equation 2) by 12 to make the coefficients of a the same:

20*9 = 20a - 240b
12*(-55) = 12a + 240b

This gives us:

180 = 20a - 240b
-660 = 12a + 240b

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate b:

180 + (-660) = (20a + 12a) + (-240b + 240b)
-480 = 32a
a = -480 / 32
a = -15

\( -98 = a + 14b \) -> Equation (2)

Next, we can solve this system of equations using either substitution or elimination methods. Let's use the elimination method by adding the two equations to eliminate \( a \):

\( 82 + (-98) = (a - 16b) + (a + 14b) \)
\( -16 = 2a - 2b \)
Divide each side by 2:
\( -8 = a - b \) -> Equation (3)

Now we will express \( a \) in terms of \( b \) using Equation (3):
\( a = b - 8 \)

Insert expression for \( a \) into Equation (1):
\( 82 = (b - 8) - 16b \)
\( 82 = -15b - 8 \)
Add 8 to both sides:
\( 90 = -15b \)
Divide by -15:
\( b = -6 \)

Now insert \( b \) back into Equation (3) to find \( a \):
\( a = -6 - 8 \)
\( a = -14 \)

Therefore, the function is \( y = -14x^0 - 6x^1 \), which can be simplified to \( y = -14 - 6x \).

    To determine the coefficients a and b for a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is 1 for all x except for x=0), we need to solve a system of linear equations using the provided input-output pairs.

From Input (-16, Output 82) and Input (14, Output -98), we can form the following two equations:

82 = a - 16b   (1)
-98 = a + 14b   (2)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Let's add equation (1) and equation (2) to eliminate b:

82 - 98 = a - 16b + a + 14b
-16 = 2a - 2b
-8 = a - b       (3)

Now, let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to also eliminate a:

82 + 98 = a - 16b - (a + 14b)
180 = -30b
b = -6        (4)

Now that we have the value for b, we can substitute it back into equation (3) to solve for a:

-8 = a - (-6)
-8 = a + 6
a = -14       (5)

Hence, the coefficients are a = -14 and b = -6, and the function capturing the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a linear function that matches the inputs and outputs, we can use two points to determine the coefficients a and b in the linear equation y = ax^0 + bx^1. Notice that x^0 is always 1, so the term ax^0 is just a constant term, a. Therefore, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx. Let's choose two points to solve for a and b.

Let's take the first two points (-16, 82) and (-11, 52). Plugging these into the equation:

For the first point (-16, 82):
82 = a + b(-16)

For the second point (-11, 52):
52 = a + b(-11)

To solve for a and b, we have a system of two equations:

1) 82 = a - 16b
2) 52 = a - 11b

Subtract the second equation from the first:

(82 - 52) = a - 16b - (a - 11b)
30 = a - 16b - a + 11b
30 = -5b

Now, divide by -5 to solve for b:
b = -6

Now, plug in the value of b into one of the original equations to solve for a. We'll use the second equation:

52 = a - 11(-6)
52 = a + 66
a = 52 - 66
a = -14

Now we have both a and b, and we can write the function:

y = -14 + (-6)x

y = -14 - 6x

So the function matching the relationship of the given inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can treat it as a simple linear equation where ax^0 is the constant term (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is the linear term (since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself).

Given the points:

1. (-18, -75)
2. (-1, -7)
3. (3, 9)
4. (-18, -75) [repeat of the first, so doesn't provide new information]
5. (2, 5)

We can use two points to determine the equation of the line. Points (2) and (3) would be the simplest to use, as they are closest to each other:

With the points (-1, -7) and (3, 9), we can find the slope (b) of the line:

b = (output2 - output1) / (input2 - input1)
b = (9 - (-7)) / (3 - (-1))
b = (9 + 7) / (3 + 1)
b = 16 / 4
b = 4

Next, we use the value of b to find the constant term (a). We'll use point (3, 9) for this:

9 = a(-1)^0 + 4(3)
9 = a*1 + 12
9 = a + 12
a = 9 - 12
a = -3

So the function is:

Let's use a pair of inputs and outputs to determine the values of a and b. We can pick any two pairs of inputs and outputs, so I will choose (x1, y1) = (-1, -7) and (x2, y2) = (3, 9) since they're more convenient values.

For the first pair (x1, y1) = (-1, -7):
-7 = a + b(-1)

For the second pair (x2, y2) = (3, 9):
9 = a + b(3)

We have two equations:
1) -7 = a - b
2) 9 = a + 3b

Now, let's solve this system of equations for a and b.

For the input-output pair (-1, -7):

-7 = a*(-1)^0 + b*(-1)^1
-7 = a - b

For the input-output pair (3, 9):

9 = a*3^0 + b*3^1
9 = a + 3b

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

1. -7 = a - b
2. 9 = a + 3b

Add equation 1 to equation 2 to eliminate a:

(1) + (2): 2 = 2a + 2b
Divide the entire equation by 2 to solve for a:

a + b = 1

Using this result, let's solve for b by substituting a = 1 - b back into equation 1:

-7 = (1 - b) - b
-7 = 1 - 2b

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of a and b such that the function fits the given data points. 

However, we notice that the data points provided are not consistent with a linear function, because a linear function has the form y = bx + a, where b is the slope and a is the y-intercept. The given function form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1 for any x ≠ 0.

To fit this data to the form y = a + bx, we need to find the appropriate values of a and b. Let's use two data points to calculate the values of a and b:

Let's take the input-output pairs (-1, -7) and (3, 9) for calculation, to avoid using the same input-output pair (-18, -75) twice. Hence, we have two equations:

For input -1:
-7 = a + b(-1)   -> Equation (1)

For input 3:
9 = a + b(3)   -> Equation (2)

Let’s solve these two equations simultaneously:

From Equation (1):
-7 = a - b   -> a = b - 7  -> Equation (3)

Now, substitute Equation (3) into Equation (2):
9 = (b - 7) + 3b
9 = 4b - 7
9 + 7 = 4b

b = 16 / 4
b = 4

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which is essentially \( y = a + bx \), we can use the given input-output pairs to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to set up a system of equations. For example, let's use the pairs (-1, -7) and (3, 9):

1. For the input -1 and output -7:
\( -7 = a + b(-1) \)
\( -7 = a - b \)    ---- (1)

2. For the input 3 and output 9:
\( 9 = a + b(3) \)
\( 9 = a + 3b \)   ---- (2)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) by first adding equations (1) and (2) together to eliminate \( b \):

\( -7 + 9 = a - b + a + 3b \)
\( 2 = 2a + 2b \)
\( 1 = a + b \)    ---- (3)

Next, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (3) to solve for \( a \):

\( 1 - (-7) = (a + b) - (a - b) \)
\( 8 = 2b \)
\( b = 4 \)        ---- (4)

Now that we know \( b \), we can substitute \( b = 4 \) back into equation (1) or (2) to find \( a \). Let's use equation (1):

Input: 19   | Output: 191
Input: -11 | Output: -79
Input: -5   | Output: -25
Input: -10 | Output: -70

Let's first simplify the function. Since ax^0 is equal to a (because anything raised to the zero power is 1), the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given this form, we will attempt to determine the values of a and b that would satisfy the equations based on the provided input-output pairs:

1. For input 6:    74 = a + b(6)
2. For input 19: 191 = a + b(19)
3. For input -11: -79 = a + b(-11)
4. For input -5:   -25 = a + b(-5)
5. For input -10: -70 = a + b(-10)

To deduce a pattern, let's investigate the changes in output relative to changes in the input:

From input 6 to input 19 (an increase of 13), the output increases from 74 to 191 (an increase of 117). This suggests that b, the coefficient for the linear term, may be 117/13 = 9.

Testing this with b = 9 in our input-output pairs:

For input 6:    74 = a + 9(6)   =>  a = 74 - 54  => a = 20
For input 19: 191 = a + 9(19)  => a = 191 - 171 => a = 20

Now with a = 20 and b = 9, let's check if this works for all input-output pairs:

Input -11: -79 = 20 + 9(-11) => -79 = 20 - 99   => -79 = -79 (Correct)

2) For x = -5, y = -25:
-25 = a + b(-5)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1) a + 6b = 74
2) a - 5b = -25

Let's solve this system for a and b.

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:

(6b - (-5b)) = (74 - (-25))
11b = 99
b = 99 / 11
b = 9

Now plug the value of b into one of our equations to solve for a. We'll use equation 2):

a = -25 + 45

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we can recognize that ax^0 is a constant term (since any number to the power of zero is 1), and bx^1 is a linear term (since x to the power of one is just x). So the function will have the form:

y = a + bx

To find the values of a and b, we can use two pairs of input-output values and set up a system of linear equations. Let's take two pairs of input and output values (6, 74) and (-10, -70) to set up the equations:

For input 6, output 74:
74 = a + 6b

For input -10, output -70:
-70 = a - 10b

Now, we have the system of linear equations:
1) a + 6b = 74
2) a - 10b = -70

To solve these equations, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use the elimination method:

Add equation 1) and equation 2) to eliminate a:
(a + 6b) + (a - 10b) = 74 - 70
2a - 4b = 4
a - 2b = 2  (divide every term by 2)

Now let's multiply equation 2 by -1 before adding to equation 1) to eliminate a again:
-(a - 10b) = 70
-a + 10b = 70

Now add this equation to equation 1):
(a + 6b) + (-a + 10b) = 74 + 70
16b = 144
b = 144 / 16
b = 9

Now substitute the value of b back into equation 1):
a + 6*9 = 74
a + 54 = 74
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship seems to be:
y = 20 + 9x

So, in the exact form as requested:
Output: y = 20x^0 + 9x^1

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that x^0 is always 1, so we basically have a constant term a and a linear term bx.

Looking at the input-output pairs, let's try to discern a pattern:

For Input: 6, Output: 8, we have:
8 = a(1) + b(6)

For Input: -5, Output: -25, we have:
-25 = a(1) + b(-5)

For Input: -3, Output: -19, we have:

For Input: -10, Output: -40, we have:
-40 = a(1) + b(-10)

For Input: -14, Output: -52, we have:
-52 = a(1) + b(-14)

Let's form two equations based on the provided pairs to solve for a and b. We can use the input-output pairs for -5 and -10, since their relationship seems to be easier to deduce at a glance:

-25 = a - 5b
-40 = a - 10b

By subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

-40 - (-25) = a - 10b - (a - 5b)
-15 = -5b
b = 3

Now let's plug the value of b back into one of the initial equations to find a. We'll use the first one:

-25 = a - 5(3)
-25 = a - 15
a = -10

So, the function that captures the relationship between the provided inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) that will satisfy the given input-output pairs. The equation can be simplified to \( y = a + bx \), since \( x^0 \) is 1 for any \( x \) that is not 0.

We will use the given data points to solve for the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \):

1. When \( x = 6 \), \( y = 8 \):
\[ 8 = a + 6b \]

2. When \( x = -5 \), \( y = -25 \):
\[ -25 = a - 5b \]

From the 2nd equation we can solve for \( a \):
\[ a = -25 + 5b \]

Now substitute this expression for \( a \) in the 1st equation:
\[ 8 = (-25 + 5b) + 6b \]
\[ 8 = -25 + 11b \]
\[ 11b = 33 \]
\[ b = 3 \]

Now that we have \( b \), we can solve for \( a \):
\[ a = -25 + 5b \]
\[ a = -25 + 5(3) \]

    To determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) of the function in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we can use any two points from the provided input-output pairs. Let's use the first two points for simplicity:

Input: 6
Output: 8

Input: -5
Output: -25

Now, translating these inputs and outputs into coordinates, we get the points (6, 8) and (-5, -25). We then substitute these values into the function:

For the point (6, 8):
\(8 = a(6)^0 + b(6)^1\)
\(8 = a + 6b\)

For the point (-5, -25):
\(-25 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1\)
\(-25 = a - 5b\)

Now we have a system of linear equations:

\(a + 6b = 8\)
\(a - 5b = -25\)

Solving for \(a\) and \(b\), we can subtract the second equation from the first:

\((a + 6b) - (a - 5b) = 8 - (-25)\)
\(6b + 5b = 33\)
\(11b = 33\)
\(b = 3\)

We can then plug the value of \(b\) into either equation to find \(a\). Using the second equation:

\(a - 5 * 3 = -25\)
\(a - 15 = -25\)
\(a = -25 + 15\)
\(a = -10\)

    To find the function that fits the given input-output pairs, we can observe the pattern that seems to relate the inputs to the outputs. The reflections in the data suggest a linear relationship, which is the reason why we're considering a function of the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 = a + bx \]

We need to find the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that will make this equation hold true for all the given input-output pairs.

From the second input-output pair (-5, -25), we can establish a starting point:

\[ -25 = a + b(-5) \]
\[ -25 = a - 5b \]

And from another input-output pair, let us use the first pair (6, 8):

\[ 8 = a + b(6) \]
\[ 8 = a + 6b \]

We now have a system of two equations:

1. \( -25 = a - 5b \)
2. \( 8 = a + 6b \)

Solving this system of equations simultaneously will give us the values of \( a \) and \( b \). By adding both equations, we eliminate \( a \):

\[ -25 + 8 = (a - 5b) + (a + 6b) \]
\[ -17 = 2a + b \]

Now we have a single-variable equation, which is easier to solve. But let's go back and subtract the second equation from the first to also get a single-variable equation for \( b \):

\[ -25 - 8 = (a - 5b) - (a + 6b) \]
\[ -33 = -11b \]

Dividing both sides by -11:

\[ b = 3 \]

Now we know the value of \( b \), we can plug it back into one of the equations to find \( a \):

\[ 8 = a + 6b \]
\[ 8 = a + 6(3) \]
\[ 8 = a + 18 \]

Subtracting 18 from both sides:

\[ a = 8 - 18 \]
\[ a = -10 \]

5*(8) = 5 * a + 30 * b ... (iv)

    To capture the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the constants ""a"" and ""b"" that fit the given data points.

Let's consider the given input-output pairs:

1. When x = 9, y = 29
2. When x = 2, y = 8
3. When x = -1, y = -1
4. When x = -6, y = -16
5. (This data point is the same as number 4 and so does not provide new information.)

To find ""a"" and ""b"", we can set up two equations using two distinct input-output pairs and solve the system of equations:

Using the form y = ax^0 + bx^1:
For y = 29 when x = 9,
29 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
29 = a + 9b         ...(1)

For y = -16 when x = -6,
-16 = a(-6)^0 + b(-6)^1
-16 = a - 6b        ...(2)

We can now solve these two equations (1) and (2) simultaneously for ""a"" and ""b"".

Adding (1) and (2):
29 - 16 = a + 9b + a - 6b
13 = 2a + 3b
2a + 3b = 13         ...(3)

Now, we can subtract (2) from (1):
29 - (-16) = a + 9b - (a - 6b)
45 = 15b
b = 45 / 15
b = 3

Now that we have the value for ""b"", we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find ""a"". Let's use equation (1):

29 = a + 9(3)
29 = a + 27
a = 29 - 27
a = 2

    To determine the function that describes the given input-output relationship in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the values of coefficients a and b that best fit the data provided.

From the form of the function, we can see that:
- \( ax^0 \) simplifies to a because anything raised to the zeroth power is 1.
- \( bx^1 \) simplifies to bx because anything raised to the first power is itself.

So, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We need to find the values of a and b such that:
y = a + bx

We have several pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y) to work with:

1. x = 9, y = 29
2. x = 2, y = 8
3. x = -1, y = -1
4. x = -6, y = -16
5. x = -6, y = -16 (repeated and hence does not provide additional information)

To find a and b, we will consider two distinct pair of points to set up a system of linear equations:

Let's use points 1 (x=9, y=29) and 3 (x=-1, y=-1) for more diversity in x values:

From point 1 (x=9, y=29):
29 = a + 9b

From point 3 (x=-1, y=-1):
-1 = a - b

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. 29 = a + 9b
2. -1 = a - b

To solve these equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

By adding the two equations, we eliminate a:

29 + (-1) = a + 9b + a - b
28 = 2a + 8b

Divide by 2:

14 = a + 4b

Now let's use equation 2 to express a in terms of b:

a = -1 + b

Substitute a from this equation into the 14 = a + 4b:

14 = (-1 + b) + 4b
14 = -1 + 5b
14 + 1 = 5b
15 = 5b
b = 3

Now that we have the value of b, substitute it back into the expression for a:

a = -1 + b
a = -1 + 3
a = 2

Using the second point (2, -17):
-17 = a + b(2)

We now have two equations:

1) 109 = a - 16b
2) -17 = a + 2b

You can solve these equations simultaneously for a and b. Let's do this step by step:

Multiply the second equation by 8 to align the b terms:

8(-17) = 8a + 16b
-136 = 8a + 16b

Now we have the system:

1) 109 = a - 16b
2) -136 = 8a + 16b

Add the two equations together to eliminate b:

109 + (-136) = a - 16b + 8a + 16b
-27 = 9a

Solve for a:

a = -27 / 9
a = -3

Using the value of a, plug it into one of the original equations to solve for b. We'll use the first equation:

109 = a - 16b
109 = -3 - 16b
109 + 3 = -16b
112 = -16b

b = 112 / -16
b = -7

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can note that \( ax^0 \) would be a constant term since \( x^0 \) is always 1, and \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \) since \( x^1 \) is just \( x \). Hence, we are looking to find a linear equation of the form:

\[ y = a + bx \]

We need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \). We can do this by creating a system of linear equations using two of the given input-output pairs. Let's take the inputs 2 and 5 with their corresponding outputs -17 and -38:

1. For input 2 and output -17:
\[-17 = a + 2b\]

2. For input 5 and output -38:
\[-38 = a + 5b\]

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

Step 1: Align the equations:
\[ \begin{align*}
-17 & = a + 2b \\
-38 & = a + 5b \\
\end{align*} \]

Step 2: Make the coefficients of \( a \) the same for both equations by multiplying the first equation by -1:
\[ \begin{align*}
17 & = -a - 2b \\
-38 & = a + 5b \\
\end{align*} \]

Step 3: Add the two equations to eliminate \( a \):
\[ \begin{align*}
17 + (-38) & = (-a - 2b) + (a + 5b) \\
-21 & = 3b \\
\end{align*} \]

Step 4: Solve for \( b \):
\[ \begin{align*}
b & = \frac{-21}{3} \\
b & = -7 \\
\end{align*} \]

Step 5: Substitute \( b \) back into one of the original equations to find \( a \). Let's substitute it into the first equation:
\[ \begin{align*}
-17 & = a + 2(-7) \\
-17 & = a - 14 \\
a & = -17 + 14 \\
a & = -3 \\

Let's use the points (-16, 109) and (2, -17) to create our equations.

From the point (-16, 109), we can write:
1) 109 = a + b(-16)...(i)

From the point (2, -17), we can write:
2) -17 = a + b(2)...(ii)

Now we can solve for a and b.

From equation (ii):
-17 = a + 2b
a = -17 - 2b....(iii)

Now substituting a from equation (iii) into equation (i):

109 = (-17 - 2b) - 16b
109 = -17 - 18b
18b = -17 - 109
18b = -126
b = -126 / 18

y = a + bx

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can solve for a and b using two points from the data set:

(Input1, Output1) = (-16, 109)
(Input2, Output2) = (-3, 18)

Let's set up two equations:

1) 109 = a + b(-16)
2) 18 = a + b(-3)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b. Let's do so:

From equation (2):
18 = a - 3b
a = 18 + 3b (Equation 3)

Substitute a from equation (3) into equation (1):
109 = (18 + 3b) + b(-16)
109 = 18 + 3b - 16b
109 = 18 - 13b
13b = 18 - 109
13b = -91
b = -91 / 13
b = -7

Now we substitute b back into equation (3) to find a:
a = 18 + 3(-7)
a = 18 - 21

To find the appropriate values of a and b, we can use two of the provided points to solve the system of linear equations. Let's use the points (-9, 162) and (17, -254).

For the point (-9, 162):
162 = a + b(-9) => 162 = a - 9b ... (1)

For the point (17, -254):
-254 = a + b(17) => -254 = a + 17b ... (2)

Now we can solve this system of equations for a and b. First, let's add equation (1) to equation (2) to eliminate a:

162 + (-254) = a - 9b + a + 17b
-92 = 2a + 8b
-46 = a + 4b ... (3)

Now lets isolate a in equation (1):

a = 162 + 9b ... (4)

Substitute (4) into (3):

-46 = (162 + 9b) + 4b
-46 = 162 + 13b
-46 - 162 = 13b
-208 = 13b
b = -208 / 13
b = -16

Now substitute b back into equation (4) to find a:

a = 162 + 9(-16)
a = 162 - 144
a = 18

Now we have the values of a and b. The function is:

    The function described in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 resembles a simple linear equation y = a + bx, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the line. To find the values of a and b, we can use two points from the given data set to set up a system of linear equations. However, because the equation requires ax^0, which is always equal to a (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), it simplifies the equation to y = a + bx.

Let's choose two points to create the system. We will use the points (-9, 162) and (17, -254):

For the first point:
162 = a + b(-9)  -->(1)

For the second point:
-254 = a + b(17) -->(2)

Now we have a system of equations with two unknowns. Let's solve this system:

- If x = 17, then y = -254
- If x = -4, then y = 82
- If x = -18, then y = 306
- If x = -14, then y = 242

The term ax^0 simplifies to a (since any number to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, the function can also be written as y = a + bx.

Let's look at the changes in x and changes in y to find b, the rate at which y changes with respect to x.

Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the slope b can be calculated as:
b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Let's use the first two points (-9, 162) and (17, -254) to determine the slope:

b = (-254 - 162) / (17 - (-9))
b = (-416) / (26)
b = -16

So the relationship between x and y is a linear relationship with a slope of -16. Now we need to find the value of a.

Let's plug the slope and one of the points into the equation y = a + bx to find a. We can use the point (-9, 162):

1. Using input -9 and output 162:
162 = a + b*(-9)

2. And using input 17 and output -254:
-254 = a + b*17

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1) 162 = a - 9b
2) -254 = a + 17b

To solve for a and b, we can use a method such as substitution or elimination. I will use the elimination method:

By multiplying the first equation by 17 and the second equation by 9, we get:

1) 2754 = 17a - 153b
2) -2286 = 9a + 153b

Adding these two equations will eliminate b:

2754 + (-2286) = 17a - 153b + 9a + 153b
468 = 26a

Divide both sides by 26:

a = 468 / 26
a = 18

Now we can solve for b using the original first equation:

162 = 18 - 9b

Subtract 18 from both sides:

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the input x and the output y based on the given data points, we first recognize that ax^0 is simply a, since any number raised to the 0th power is 1. Therefore, the function we are looking for simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have to determine the values of a and b that will satisfy the equations for each pair of inputs and outputs. Let's first express the given data points in this form:

For input 18 (x = 18):
y = a + b(18) = 350

For input 12 (x = 12):
y = a + b(12) = 230

For input -13 (x = -13):
y = a + b(-13) = -270

For input 4 (x = 4):
y = a + b(4) = 70

For input 16 (x = 16):
y = a + b(16) = 310

We can use any two of these equations to solve for a and b. Let's use the equations from inputs 18 and -13 for convenience:

1) a + 18b = 350
2) a - 13b = -270

Now, we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:

(1) - (2): (a + 18b) - (a - 13b) = 350 - (-270)
a + 18b - a + 13b = 350 + 270
31b = 620
b = 620 / 31
b = 20

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either equation to find a. We'll use equation (1):

a + 18(20) = 350
a + 360 = 350
a = 350 - 360
a = -10

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the input x and the output y is:

y = -10 + 20x

Or in the exact form requested:

Output: y = -10x^0 + 20x^1

    ","Given the function y = -10 + 20x, we can apply it to the input value 7:

y = -10 + 20(7)

y = 130

Thus, for the input 7, the output is 130.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 which best describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can recognize that ax^0 is simply a since any number to the power of zero is 1, and bx^1 is just bx since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself.

Thus, we are looking for a function of the form y = a + bx.

To determine the coefficient b, which is the slope of the line, we can use two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) and apply the slope formula b = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁).

Taking the provided data:

(18, 350) and (16, 310)

b = (350 - 310) / (18 - 16) = 40 / 2 = 20

Now that we have the slope, we can find the y-intercept a using one of the points. Let's use the point (18, 350):

350 = a + 20 * 18
a = 350 - (20 * 18)
a = 350 - 360
a = -10

Our function that describes the data is:

y = -10 + 20x

This function seems to match all given points reasonably well. Let's verify this hypothesis quickly with some of the other provided points:

y = -10 + 240
y = 230

For x = -13:
y = -10 + 20*(-13)
y = -10 - 260
y = -270

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the input (x) and output (y), we need to determine the values of constants 'a' and 'b'. 

Since ax^0 is always a (because anything raised to the power of 0 equals 1), this simplifies the function form to:
y = a + bx

Now let's use two data points to solve for 'a' and 'b':

Using the point (13, 177):
177 = a + 13b ...(1)

Using the point (14, 191):
191 = a + 14b ...(2)

Now, let's solve this system of linear equations.

Subtract (1) from (2):
191 - 177 = a + 14b - (a + 13b)
14 = b

Now that we know 'b', we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find 'a'. Using equation (1):

177 = a + 13(14)
177 = a + 182
a = 177 - 182
a = -5

So, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = -5x^0 + 14x^1

    To write the function in the desired form, Output: \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can recognize that this is essentially a linear equation, since \( x^0 \) is always 1 and \( x^1 \) is just \( x \). Thus, the equation simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

What we need to do is determine the values of a and b that define the line which best fits the given data points. To figure out a and b, we can use two of the given input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations.

Let's take the input-output pairs (13, 177) and (14, 191):

For the first pair (13, 177):
177 = a + 13b      (1)

For the second pair (14, 191):
191 = a + 14b      (2)

Let's solve this system of equations:

Subtracting equation (1) from (2) gives:
\( 191 - 177 = a + 14b - (a + 13b) \)
\( 14 = b \)

Now that we have b, we can easily find a by substituting b back into either equation (1) or (2). Using equation (1):

177 = a + 13b
177 = a + 13(14)
177 = a + 182
a = 177 - 182
a = -5

So the function that describes the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) is:

We need to find coefficients a and b such that the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 fits the data, where ax^0 is a constant term (since any number to the zero power is 1) and bx^1 is simply a linear term. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's use two data points to set up two equations and solve for a and b:

Using the input-output pair (13, 177):
177 = a + 13b (Equation 1)

Using the input-output pair (14, 191):

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we first note that `x^0` is always 1 for any non-zero value of `x`, so the first term `ax^0` simply becomes `a`. The second term `bx^1` is just `bx` because `x^1` is `x`. Therefore, we can rewrite the function as:

`y = a + bx`

Now we need to determine the constants `a` and `b`. We can do this by setting up a system of equations using the given input-output pairs:

For the input 13 and output 177:
`177 = a + 13b`

For the input 14 and output 191:
`191 = a + 14b`

Let's solve this system of equations.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:
`(191 - 177) = (a + 14b) - (a + 13b)`
`14 = b`

Using the value of `b` to solve for `a`, we substitute `b` into the first equation:
`177 = a + 13(14)`
`177 = a + 182`
`a = 177 - 182`
`a = -5`

Now we have the values for `a` and `b`:
`a = -5`
`b = 14`

Thus, the function that describes this relationship is:
`y = -5 + 14x`

    To deduce a function that describes the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can regard ax^0 as the constant term (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 as the linear term (since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself).

Given that ax^0 is a constant, we can call it c. Thus, the function simplifies to y = c + bx.

We have to find values for b and c that fit the pairs of inputs and outputs provided. We can find this linear relationship by observing the changes in output when the input changes.

If we examine the increase in output from one input to the next, we can estimate the slope (b):

Output difference between input 13 and 14: 191 - 177 = 14
Output difference between input 7 and 8 (assuming a consistent pattern past the given data): the difference must be the same as between 13 and 14, which is 14.

Notice that for each increase of 1 in x, y increases by 14. Therefore, we can tentatively identify b as 14.

Now, let's find the constant term (c). We can substitute an input-output pair into the equation y = c + bx to find c. Let's use the pair (3, 37):

37 = c + 14*3
37 = c + 42
c = -5
