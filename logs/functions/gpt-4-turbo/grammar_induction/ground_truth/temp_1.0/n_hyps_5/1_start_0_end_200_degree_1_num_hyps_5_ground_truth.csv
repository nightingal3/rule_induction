"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we recognize that ax^0 simplifies to a because any number to the power of zero is 1, and the term bx^1 simplifies to bx because any number to the power of one is itself. Therefore, the simplified form is y = a + bx.

Now we need to determine a and b based on the inputs and outputs provided.

Let's consider two of the given input-output pairs to formulate the system of equations:

Using input-output pair (9, 167):

1. 167 = a + 9b

Using input-output pair (-10, -213):

2. -213 = a - 10b

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1. a + 9b = 167
2. a - 10b = -213

Next, let's solve for a and b. There are several methods to do this, but one of the simplest is to use the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:

(1) - (2): (a - a) + (9b - (-10b)) = (167 - (-213))
           0a + 19b = 380
              19b = 380
                b = 380 / 19
                b = 20

Now that we know b, we can substitute it back into either the first or second original equation to solve for a. Let's use equation 1:

a + 9b = 167
a + 9(20) = 167
a + 180 = 167
a = 167 - 180
a = -13

Now we have determined the values of a and b:

a = -13
b = 20

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -13 + 20x

Or, if you prefer the form you specified:

Output: y = -13x^0 + 20x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first understand that ax^0 is effectively a constant term since any number to the zero power is 1, and bx^1 is a linear term since any number to the first power is the number itself. Therefore, the function we are trying to describe is a linear equation of the form y = a + bx.

We have pairs of inputs and outputs (x, y):

(-10, -213), (9, 167), (4, 67), (-3, -73), (20, 387)

We can use any two of these points to determine the coefficients 'a' and 'b'. However, using just two points might not give us the exact function for all points unless the data perfectly follows a linear relationship. We can attempt to find 'a' and 'b' that most closely fit all the points.

Let's take the two of the points to construct two equations and solve for 'a' and 'b':
Using points (-10, -213) and (20, 387), we have:

For x = -10, y = -213: -213 = a + b(-10)
For x = 20, y = 387: 387 = a + b(20)

Let's solve this system of equations:

-213 = a - 10b        -> (1)
387 = a + 20b        -> (2)

Now, let's add equation (1) and equation (2) to solve for 'a':

(-213) + 387 = (a - 10b) + (a + 20b)
174 = 2a + 10b

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'a':

87 = a + 5b            -> (3)

Now, let's subtract equation (1) from (3) to solve for 'b':

87 - (-213) = (a + 5b) - (a - 10b)
300 = 15b

Divide both sides by 15:

b = 20

Now that we have 'b', we can solve for 'a' using either of the two original equations. Let's use equation (1):

-213 = a - 10(20)
-213 = a - 200

Add 200 to both sides to solve for a:

a = -13

The function, using the points (-10, -213) and (20, 387), that best describes the data given is:

y = -13 + 20x

Please note this is an approximation using two of the data points, and if the data points do not lie exactly on a line, this function will not perfectly describe all the points. A more sophisticated method such as least squares regression would be used to find the best-fitting line for all the points if they do not all lie on the same straight line.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a linear function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can use the general linear equation form y = ax^1 + bx^0, which simplifies to y = ax + b.

We can use two points to determine the values of a and b. Let's pick two input-output pairs from the given data:

Using input 4 and output 67:
67 = a(4) + b ...(1)

Using input 9 and output 167:
167 = a(9) + b ...(2)

Let's solve these two equations simultaneously:

From (1):
b = 67 - 4a ...(3)

Now substitute (3) into (2):

167 = 9a + (67 - 4a)
167 = 9a + 67 - 4a
167 - 67 = 5a
100 = 5a
a = 20

Now, put the value of a into (3) to find b:

b = 67 - 4(20)
b = 67 - 80
b = -13

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that fits the given inputs and outputs, we need to recognize that \( ax^0 \) is just a constant because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any non-zero x. So, our function can be simplified to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

We have to find the values of constants \( a \) and \( b \) which gives us the best-fit line for the given data points. We can use two points from the given data to set up a system of equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's take the points (9, 167) and (-10, -213).

From the point (9, 167), we have:
\[ 167 = a + 9b \]
From the point (-10, -213), we have:
\[ -213 = a - 10b \]

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations. First, let's multiply the second equation by 1 to make it easier to eliminate variable \( a \):

\[ -213 = a - 10b \]
\[ 213 = -a + 10b \]

Adding this to the first equation:

\[ 167 + 213 = a + 9b - a + 10b \]
\[ 380 = 19b \]
\[ b = \frac{380}{19} \]
\[ b = 20 \]

Now that we have \( b \), we can plug that back into one of the original equations to solve for \( a \). Using \( b = 20 \) in the first equation:

\[ 167 = a + 9(20) \]
\[ 167 = a + 180 \]
\[ a = 167 - 180 \]
\[ a = -13 \]

So the function that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) is:

\[ y = -13 + 20x \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given points, we first need to understand that ax^0 is just a, since any number raised to the power of zero is one. Therefore, we are looking for a function in the form of y = a + bx.

Given this form, we have two parameters a and b to find. To do this, we can use two of the provided points to form two equations and solve for a and b. Let's take the points (-10, -213) and (20, 387).

We have two equations now:
1. -213 = a + b(-10)
2. 387 = a + b(20)

Let's solve this system of equations by first arranging the terms:

1. -213 = a - 10b
2. 387 = a + 20b

Now let's solve for a and b. We can do this by adding the two equations together to eliminate a:

(-213) + 387 = (a - 10b) + (a + 20b)

This simplifies to:

174 = 2a + 10b

Divide through by 2:

87 = a + 5b

Now we have an equation relating a and b. To find a specific solution for a and b, let's rearrange the first equation to solve for a:

-213 = a - 10b
a = -213 + 10b

Now substitute this expression for a into the equation we just derived:

87 = (-213 + 10b) + 5b
87 = -213 + 15b
87 + 213 = 15b
300 = 15b
b = 300 / 15
b = 20

Now that we have b, we can solve for a by putting b back into a = -213 + 10b:

a = -213 + 10(20)
a = -213 + 200
a = -13

So, the function that fits the given points is:

y = -13 + 20x

Which in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we need to find the coefficients a and b that will satisfy the equation for all given input-output pairs. 

Let's first note that x^0 is always 1 for any x that is not zero, so we will treat ax^0 as a constant the coefficient a. Our function then simplifies to y = a + bx. 

To solve for a and b, let's take two of the input-output pairs:

For input 0, output -3: 
-3 = a + b*0 => -3 = a => a = -3 (this is because anything multiplied by zero is zero)

Now we know that a = -3, we can use this information and another pair to find b. Let's use the pair input -18, output 339:
339 = -3 + b*(-18) 
342 = -18b 
b = 342 / -18 
b = -19

    To determine the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the constants a and b. The constant a represents the y-intercept where x is 0, and the constant b represents the slope of the line as this is a linear function.

Given the input-output pairs, we can observe that the output when input is 0 is -3. Since x^0 is 1 for any x except for x=0 (where it is undefined), we have found our a value: a = -3.

So, our function now is:

y = -3 + bx.

We can then use any other given input-output pair to solve for b. Let's use the input-output pair (5, -98):

-98 = -3 + b * 5.

Now, we solve for b:

-98 + 3 = 5b,

b = -95 / 5,

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 = a + bx that fits the provided input-output pairs, we can set up a system of linear equations using two pairs of data points to solve for the coefficients a and b.

When x = 0, y = a*1 + b*0 → y = a → -3 = a

This gives us a direct value for a:
a = -3

Now, we need to solve for b. We can do this by inserting another input-output pair into the equation. Let's use the pair (5, -98):

    ","To find the output for the input x=14 using the derived function y = -6 - 5x, substitute 14 for x:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 and the provided data, we can deduce that ax^0 is a constant term (since x^0 equals 1 for any value of x) and bx^1 is a linear term (since x^1 is x itself). To find the constants a and b, we need at least two points to solve the system of equations created by the input-output pairs.

Let's use the first two data points to find a and b:

For Input: 5, Output: -31
-31 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-31 = a + 5b ---- (1)

For Input: 9, Output: -51
-51 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
-51 = a + 9b ---- (2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

a + 5b = -31
a + 9b = -51

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:

(9b - 5b) + (a - a) = -51 + 31
4b = -20
b = -5

Now use this value of b to find a:

a + 5(-5) = -31
a - 25 = -31
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

So the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = -6x^0 - 5x^1
y = -6 - 5x

To confirm this function, let's check it against the other provided data points:

For Input: -11, Output should be 49

49 = -6 + 55
49 = 49 (Confirmed)

For Input: -4, Output should be 14

14 = -6 + 20
14 = 14 (Confirmed)

For Input: -12, Output should be 54

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can consider that ax^0 is a constant because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, ax^0 = a. The form is essentially y = a + bx, where a and b are constants we need to determine.

Let's use the given input-output pairs to figure out a and b.

1. For input 5 and output -31:

-31 = a + 5b

2. For input 9 and output -51:

-51 = a + 9b

3. For input -11 and output 49:

4. For input -4 and output 14:

14 = a - 4b

5. For input -12 and output 54:

54 = a - 12b

From the above pairs, we have a system of equations that can be solved for a and b. Let's choose two of them to solve:

Using the first and the second equation:

-31 = a + 5b
-51 = a + 9b

Now subtracting the second equation from the first, we eliminate a:

(−31) - (−51) = (a + 5b) - (a + 9b)
20 = -4b
b = -5

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find a. Let's use the first one:

-31 = a + 5(-5)
-31 = a - 25
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants \(a\) and \(b\). Here, \(x^0\) is equal to 1 since any number to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the form simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can solve this by taking any two pairs of inputs and outputs and setting up a system of linear equations. Let's take the pairs (7, -98) and (17, -218) as examples.

Using the first pair (7, -98):

\[-98 = a + b(7)\]

Using the second pair (17, -218):

\[-218 = a + b(17)\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \(-98 = a + 7b\)
2. \(-218 = a + 17b\)

Let's solve for \(a\) and \(b\) from these equations.

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

\((-218) - (-98) = (a + 17b) - (a + 7b)\)

This simplifies to:

\[-218 + 98 = 10b\]
\[-120 = 10b\]
\[b = -12\]

Now, we'll substitute \(b\) in one of the equations to find \(a\). We'll use the first equation:

\[-98 = a + 7(-12)\]
\[-98 = a - 84\]
\[a = -98 + 84\]
\[a = -14\]

Now we have both \(a\) and \(b\):

\[a = -14\]
\[b = -12\]

The function in the required form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is then:

\[y = -14x^0 + (-12)x^1\]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of coefficients a and b. Since ax^0 is always a (because any number to the power of 0 is 1), we are actually finding a function of the form y = a + bx.

Let's use two points to compute the values of a and b. We can take any two, but for the sake of simplicity, let's use the points (7, -98) and (17, -218).

For the point (7, -98), we have:
-98 = a + 7b  (1)

For the point (17, -218), we have:
-218 = a + 17b (2)

Now, we can solve these two linear equations to find the values of a and b. Subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a and find b:

-218 - (-98) = (a + 17b) - (a + 7b)
-218 + 98 = 10b
-120 = 10b
b = -12

Now, use the value of b to find a using either of the original equations. Let's use equation (1):

-98 = a + 7b

-98 = a - 84
a = -98 + 84

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we can use the method of least squares to find the coefficients a and b.

However, since this is a simple linear relationship, we can find a and b by setting up a system of linear equations using two of the provided input-output pairs. Let's use the input-output pairs (7, -98) and (17, -218) to calculate the coefficients.

If we take the function `y = ax^0 + bx^1` and plug in the first pair (x=7, y=-98), we get:
-98 = a*7^0 + b*7
-98 = a + 7b

Using the second pair (x=17, y=-218), we get:
-218 = a*17^0 + b*17
-218 = a + 17b

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. a + 7b = -98
2. a + 17b = -218

We can solve for a and b by subtracting the first equation from the second to eliminate a:
(17b - 7b) = (-218 + 98)
10b = -120
b = -120/10
b = -12

Now we can substitute the value of b back into either of the original equations to find a. We'll use the first equation:
a + 7(-12) = -98
a - 84 = -98
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

So the coefficients are a = -14 and b = -12. Therefore, the function describing the relationship between the inputs and outputs, within the prescribed form, is:

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data, we need to interpret this as a linear function in the form of y = a + bx (since x^0 is 1).

For two data points, we can directly calculate the coefficients a and b. However, with more than two data points, we may not have an exact fit if the data does not lie perfectly on a line. Nonetheless, for simplicity, let's use two of the given points to determine the coefficients.

For instance, we can use the following two points to solve for a and b:
Input: 7, Output: -98 → -98 = a + 7b
Input: -6, Output: 58 → 58 = a - 6b

Now let's solve this system of linear equations:

From the first equation,
a = -98 - 7b (1)

Substitute the value of a into the second equation:
58 = (-98 - 7b) - 6b
58 = -98 - 7b - 6b
58 = -98 - 13b
58 + 98 = -13b
156 = -13b
b = -156 / 13
b = -12

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into equation (1) to solve for a:
a = -98 - 7(-12)
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

So our function is y = -14 + (-12)x, and in your requested format, that would be:

y = -14x^0 - 12x^1

Please note that this function is derived from only two points and may not perfectly describe all the given points, as linear relationships rarely perfectly fit more than two real-world data points unless they are inherently linear. To find the best approximation across all data points, we would use methods like least squares regression, which might not result in a perfect integer fit.

where 'a' is the y-intercept and 'b' is the slope of the line.

We can use two data points to calculate 'a' and 'b'. Let's use the points (7, -98) and (17, -218).

First, let's find 'b' (the slope):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-218 - (-98)) / (17 - 7)
b = (-218 + 98) / (10)
b = (-120) / (10)

    The form `y = ax^0 + bx^1` is essentially the form of a linear equation where \( a \) is the y-intercept and \( b \) is the slope.

1. \( -169 = a + b(-11) \)
2. \( 265 = a + b(20) \)

Now, let's solve for \( a \) and \( b \). It is easier to solve for \( b \) first, so we'll rearrange the above equations:

1. \( -169 = a - 11b \)    => \( a = -169 + 11b \)
2. \( 265 = a + 20b \)

Substitute equation (1) into equation (2):

\( 265 = (-169 + 11b) + 20b \)
\( 265 = -169 + 11b + 20b \)
\( 265 + 169 = 31b \)
\( 434 = 31b \)
\( b = 434 / 31 \)

Now divide both sides by 2:

Now, substitute the value of b back into equation 1 to find a:
a = -155 + 10b
a = -155 + 10(14)
a = -155 + 140
a = -15

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 for the function, we recognize ax^0 as a constant since any number to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, we have y = a + bx. To find the values of a and b, we can use any two data points such as:

Input: 9, Output: 160
Input: -4, Output: -61

Plugging these into the equation gives us two simultaneous equations:

1. 160 = a + 9b
2. -61 = a - 4b

Now let's solve for a and b using these equations:

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate a:

160 - (-61) = (a + 9b) - (a - 4b)
160 + 61 = 9b + 4b
221 = 13b
b = 221/13
b = 17

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using either equation 1 or 2. Let's use equation 1:

160 = a + 9(17)
160 = a + 153
a = 160 - 153

    To find the values of a and b that define the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can set up a system of equations using the input-output pairs provided. Because ax^0 is equivalent to a (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's use two input-output pairs to solve for a and b:

For input 9, output 160:
160 = a + b(9)

For input -20, output -333:
-333 = a + b(-20)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1) 160 = a + 9b
2) -333 = a - 20b

We can use substitution or elimination to solve for a and b. I'll use the elimination method:

Multiply equation 1) by 20 and equation 2) by 9 to eliminate a when we subtract one equation from the other:

1) 3200 = 20a + 180b
2) -2997 = 9a - 180b

Now, add the two equations:

3200 - 2997 = 20a + 180b + 9a - 180b
203 = 29a
a = 203 / 29
a ≈ 7

With the value of a, we can substitute it back into either equation to find b. We'll use equation 1):

160 = 7 + 9b
153 = 9b
b = 153 / 9
b = 17

Therefore, the function is approximately y = 7 + 17x. However, to check if the function is accurate for all given points, let's plug in all the inputs:

For input 9:
y = 7 + 17(9) = 7 + 153 = 160 (matches given output)

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we need to determine the values of a and b. In this form, ax^0 is simply a, since any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1. The function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to create a system of linear equations and solve for a and b.

Using the input-output pairs (9, 160) and (-4, -61), we can set up the following equations:

For input 9: 160 = a + 9b
For input -4: -61 = a - 4b

Now, we have the system of equations:
1) a + 9b = 160
2) a - 4b = -61

Let's solve this system using substitution or elimination. In this case, we'll use elimination:

Subtract the second equation from the first one to eliminate a:
(1) - (2): (a + 9b) - (a - 4b) = 160 - (-61)
This simplifies to:
13b = 221
Solving for b, we get:
b = 221 / 13
b = 17

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into one of our original equations to solve for a. Let's use the first equation:

a + 9b = 160
a + 9(17) = 160
a + 153 = 160
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

\( 160 = a + 9b \) (1)

For the input 13 and output 228:
\( 228 = a + 13b \) (2)

because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any \( x \) that is not 0. We need to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). To do that, we can use two points from the given data and set up a system of equations. Let's take the points (9, 160) and (-4, -61) for convenience.

From the first point (9, 160):

\[ 160 = a + 9b \]

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

\( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), because any number (except zero) raised to the power of 0 is 1, and any number to the power of 1 is the number itself.

Now, the input-output pairs can be rewritten as follows for our simplified function:

For input -2: \( 17 = a - 2b \) ... (1)

Add the two equations to eliminate \( a \):

\( 17 + (-145) = a - 2b + a + 7b \)
\( -128 = 2a + 5b \)
\( -128/2 = a + (5/2)b \)
\( -64 = a + (5/2)b \) ... (3)

Now, substitute the value of 'a' from equation (1) into equation (3):

\( 17 = -64 - (5/2)b - 2b \)
\( 17 = -64 - (9/2)b \)
\( 17 + 64 = -(9/2)b \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1` that fits the given data points, we need to determine the values of `a` and `b`. The form `y = ax^0 + bx^1` simplifies to `y = a + bx` because `x^0` is 1 for any x that is not zero.

Given data points:

1. (20, -307)
2. (-1, 8)
3. (20, -307) (repeated, so it doesn't provide new information)
4. (12, -187)
5. (18, -277)

We can set up two equations using two of the unique data points to solve for `a` and `b`. 

Let's choose points (1) and (2) for this:

From point (1): -307 = a + 20b
From point (2): 8 = a - b

Now we have a system of two equations which we can solve:

Equation A: -307 = a + 20b
Equation B: 8 = a - b

We can solve for `a` and `b` by using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution:

From Equation B:
a = 8 + b

Substituting `a` into Equation A:
-307 = (8 + b) + 20b
-307 = 8 + 21b
-307 - 8 = 21b
-315 = 21b
b = -315 / 21
b = -15

Substituting the value of `b` back into the expression for `a`:
a = 8 + b
a = 8 - 15
a = -7

So, the function that describes the data is:
y = -7x^0 + (-15)x^1
Simplifying, we get:
y = -7 - 15x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we should write it in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Notice that ax^0 is actually just a, because any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1.

We have several data points:

1. When x = 20, y = -307
2. When x = -1, y = 8
3. When x = 12, y = -187
4. When x = 18, y = -277

Given that we see the same input yielding the same output on multiple occasions (e.g., x = 20 gives y = -307), we can suspect that the function is deterministic and possibly linear.

First, let's identify the slope (b) of our linear equation y = a + bx:

For points (20, -307) and (-1, 8), the slope b can be calculated as:
b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (8 - (-307)) / (-1 - 20)
b = (8 + 307) / (-21)
b = 315 / -21
b = -15

Now that we have identified the slope as -15, we can solve for a using one of the points. Let's use the point (20, -307):

-307 = a + (-15)(20)
-307 = a - 300
a = -307 + 300
a = -7

Now we have both a and b, so we can write the function as:
y = (-7)x^0 + (-15)x^1

Simplifying this we get:
y = -7 - 15x

Therefore, the function is:
y = -7 - 15x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to analyze the given pairs of inputs and outputs. Since ax^0 is equal to a for any value of x (because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is just bx, we are actually looking for a function of the form y = a + bx.

Given the pairs (20, -307), (-1, 8), (20, -307), (12, -187), and (18, -277), we notice that the input of 20 corresponding to the output of -307 is repeated, which doesn't add new information for determining our coefficients a and b. We can ignore one of these repeated pairs for our calculation.

Let's use the pairs (-1, 8) and (20, -307) since they will provide a clear system of linear equations to solve for a and b:

From (-1, 8):
8 = a - b

From (20, -307):
-307 = a + 20b

Now we will solve this system of linear equations. First, let's write down the equations:

1)  8  = a - b
2)  -307 = a + 20b

To solve the system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a:

(-307) - 8 = (a + 20b) - (a - b)
-315 = 21b
b = -315 / 21
b = -15

Now substitute b back into equation 1 to find a:

8 = a - (-15)
8 = a + 15
a = 8 - 15
a = -7

So the function fitting the given input-output pairs is:

y = -7 + (-15)x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we need to interpret it as a linear equation:

\(y = ax^0 + bx^1\)
\(y = a + bx\)

where \(a\) and \(b\) are constants, \(x\) is the input, and \(y\) is the output. This is equivalent to the linear equation \(y = mx + c\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(c\) is the y-intercept.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can figure out the values of \(a\) and \(b\). However, since we have more than two points, we can't find a single unique solution that goes through all the points unless the points all lie on the same straight line. In this case, it's likely we'll need to find the best fit line that minimizes error across all points. Since that involves more computation, first let's just see if the given points lie on a straight line by checking consistency.

Let's use the first two data points and solve the system of equations:

For Input: 20, Output: -307,
\(-307 = a + 20b\)

For Input: -1, Output: 8,
\(8 = a - b\)

Now to simplify and solve for \(a\) and \(b\), we can take the second equation and add \(b\) to both sides to get \(a\), then substitute into the first equation:

\(a = 8 + b\)

Substitute \(a\) in the first equation:
\(-307 = (8 + b) + 20b\)
\(-307 = 8 + 21b\)
\(-315 = 21b\)
\(b = -15\)

Now, find \(a\):
\(a = 8 + b\)
\(a = 8 - 15\)
\(a = -7\)

Let's verify this solution with the other provided points to ensure that they are consistent with the found values of \(a\) and \(b\). Checking the third and fourth points:

For Input: 12, Output: -187
\(-187 = -7 + (-15 \cdot 12)\)
\(-187 = -7 - 180\)
\(-187 = -187\)  (This matches!)

\(-277 = -7 + (-15 \cdot 18)\)

\(-277 = -277\)  (This matches!)

Since all the given points agree with our calculated values of \(a\) and \(b\), the function we're looking for is:

Let's use the points (0, 12) and (13, -66):

    To find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) for the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can use two of the given input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations. The general form of the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) that is not zero.

Let's use the input-output pairs (13, -66) and (-20, 132) to set up our equations:

1. Using the pair (13, -66):
   -66 = a + b(13)
   -66 = a + 13b ----(1)

2. Using the pair (-20, 132):
   132 = a + b(-20)
   132 = a - 20b ----(2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
-66 = a + 13b ----(1)
132 = a - 20b ----(2)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply equation (1) by 20 and equation (2) by 13:
-1320 = 20a + 260b ----(3)
1716 = 13a - 260b ----(4)

Now, add equations (3) and (4) to eliminate \( b \):
-1320 + 1716 = 20a + 260b + 13a - 260b
396 = 33a
a = 396 / 33
a = 12

Now that we have \( a \), we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find \( b \). We'll use equation (1):

This specific function form is a simple linear relationship where ax^0 is a constant (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is a term that grows linearly with x. Essentially, we are looking for a function:

Looking at point 4, we can quickly determine the value of 'a' because when x = 0, bx^1 = 0, leaving us with y = a. So from the fourth point:

12 = a + b(0)
a = 12

With 'a' determined, we can find 'b' by plugging the value of 'a' into another data point. Let's use the first data point:

269 + 325 = 33b

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we can use the given data points to derive the constants a and b in the equation \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \).

First, we notice that the term \( ax^0 \) is actually just \( a \), since anything raised to the 0th power is 1. Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Now we can use two of the provided data points to create a system of equations to solve for a and b. Let's use the following points: (-17, -325) and (16, 269). Plugging these into the equation gives us:

For the first point (-17, -325):
\[ -325 = a + b(-17) \]
\[ -325 = a - 17b\ \tag{1} \]

For the second point (16, 269):
\[ 269 = a + b(16) \]
\[ 269 = a + 16b \tag{2} \]

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

\[
\begin{align*}
-325 &= a - 17b \\
269 &= a + 16b

\]

We can solve for a and b by adding these two equations together to eliminate a:

\[
\begin{align*}
-325 + 269 &= (a - 17b) + (a + 16b) \\
-56 &= 2a - b \\
b &= 2a + 56

We can use equation (2) to solve for a by substituting \( b \) with \( 2a + 56 \):

\[
\begin{align*}
269 &= a + 16b \\
269 &= a + 16(2a + 56) \\
269 &= a + 32a + 896 \\
269 &= 33a + 896 \\
269 - 896 &= 33a \\
-627 &= 33a \\
a &= -19

\[
\begin{align*}
b &= 2a + 56 \\
b &= 2(-19) + 56 \\
b &= -38 + 56 \\
b &= 18

Let's consider two data points to calculate the slope (b):
For example, take (x1, y1) = (-17, -325) and (x2, y2) = (-5, -109), we can use them to find the slope b.

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-109 - (-325)) / (-5 - (-17))
b = (216) / (12)

    The equation you're asking for is a linear equation in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is 1 for any x except for 0 and x^1 is simply x. 

To determine the constants a and b, we can use two of the provided input/output pairs to create a system of linear equations.

Let's use the following two pairs: (x_1, y_1) = (-17, -325) and (x_2, y_2) = (16, 269).

Based on the function form y = a + bx, we have:

1. For x_1: -325 = a + b(-17)
2. For x_2: 269 = a + b(16)

Now, let's solve this system of equations for a and b:

From 1:
a = -325 + 17b  ----> Equation (3)

Now substitute a from Equation (3) into Equation 2:

269 = (-325 + 17b) + 16b
269 = -325 + 17b + 16b
269 = -325 + 33b
269 + 325 = 33b
594 = 33b
b = 594 / 33
b = 18

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into Equation (3) to find a:

a = -325 + 17b
a = -325 + 17(18)
a = -325 + 306
a = -19

Therefore, the function is:
y = -19 + 18x

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we must determine the values of the coefficients a and b.

Notice that ax^0 simplifies to a since anything to the power of zero is 1.

Therefore, the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's solve the coefficients a and b using two of the provided input-output pairs. We can pick the pairs (Input: -17, Output: -325) and (Input: 16, Output: 269).

So substituting these values into the equation y = a + bx gives us two equations:
1. -325 = a - 17b
2. 269 = a + 16b

These can be solved using methods of linear algebra. Let's first line them up and then use the elimination method:

a - 17b = -325  ... (1)
a + 16b = 269   ... (2)

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

(-17b - 16b) = (-325 - 269)
-33b = -594

Solve for b:

b = -594 / -33
b = 18

Now, we can substitute b back into either equation to solve for a. Using equation (2):

a + 16*18 = 269
a + 288 = 269
a = 269 - 288
a = -19

    To find a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we recognize this is a linear equation with two unknowns, \(a\) and \(b\). Since \(x^0\) is always 1, the function simplifies to \(y = a + bx\). Here, \(a\) is the y-intercept and \(b\) is the slope of the function.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations to solve for \(a\) and \(b\). A quick method to find the slope \(b\) is to use two points, and then use one point to solve for the y-intercept \(a\). We will use the points (10, 142) and (-10, -158).

First, we calculate the slope \(b\):
\[ b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]
\[ b = \frac{-158 - 142}{-10 - 10} \]
\[ b = \frac{-300}{-20} \]
\[ b = 15 \]

Now that we have \(b\), we can use one of the points to find \(a\). Let's use the point (10, 142):

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data, we first recognize that the term ax^0 is actually a constant term because x^0 = 1 for any x ≠ 0. The function we are looking for is essentially a linear function of the form y = a + bx where a and b are constants that we need to determine.

To find the constants a and b, we can use two points from the given data to set up a system of equations. Taking two points, for example, (10, 142) and (-10, -158), we can set up the following two equations:

1) 142 = a + 10b

We can solve this system of equations for a and b.

Adding the two equations:

(142 = a + 10b) + (-158 = a - 10b)
142 - 158 = a + 10b + a - 10b

a = -8

Let's use two of the given pairs to determine the values of a and b. The pair (x=10, y=142) and the pair (x=-10, y=-158) can be used:

For the first pair:
1) 142 = a + b(10)

For the second pair:
2) -158 = a + b(-10)

We have a system of two linear equations. We can solve for a and b by simultaneously solving these equations. Let's first add the two equations to eliminate the a term:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we can recognize that `ax^0` is always 1 (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), so it simplifies to just `a`. Therefore, our function simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

Our aim is now to determine the values of `a` and `b` that fit the data provided. We can do this by setting up a system of equations based on the input-output pairs and solving for `a` and `b`.

Here are the equations based on the given data:

1. When input `x = -1`, output `y = -8`:
`-8 = a + b(-1)`, which simplifies to `a - b = -8` (Equation 1)

2. When input `x = 5`, output `y = 76`:
`76 = a + b(5)`, which simplifies to `a + 5b = 76` (Equation 2)

Let's use the input-output pairs for -1 and 5 to calculate `a` and `b`, and then we'll verify with the other pairs to ensure our function holds true.

From Equation 1: a = -8 + b
Substituting this into Equation 2 gives us a system of equations:

a - b = -8
a + 5b = 76

Substitute a from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
(-8 + b) + 5b = 76
-8 + 6b = 76
6b = 84
b = 14

Find a using the value of b in Equation 1:
a - 14 = -8
a = -8 + 14
a = 6

5. For x = -6, y = 44:
44 = a - 6b

To solve for a and b, we can either use two input-output pairs to set up two equations and solve them simultaneously or use more pairs and apply a least squares method to find the best fitting line. However, with the values given, it seems that they might not all lie on the same line, which would mean that there is no single linear function y = a + bx that fits all the data points.

As a pattern recognition system, let's try to find the best fitting line using the two points that seem to suggest the most obvious linearity: points (1, 2) and (-6, 44). We will calculate the slope (b) first and then the intercept (a).

Using the points (1, 2) and (-6, 44):
Slope (b) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (44 - 2) / (-6 - 1)
b = 42 / -7
b = -6

Now let's find the intercept (a) using the point (1, 2):
2 = a + (-6)(1)
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

So the best fitting line using just these two points would be:
y = 8 - 6x

However, this function does not match the other given input-output pairs, suggesting that the actual relationship is probably not linear or that there is an error in the data. If we were to specifically use the formula y = ax^0 + bx^1, we would use the values of a and b we calculated:

Function:
Output: y = 8x^0 - 6x^1
Simplified further: y = 8 - 6x

But please note that this linear function will not accurately describe all given input-output pairs; it only fits the specific pairs (1, 2) and (-6, 44). The other provided data points require a different function or indicate some inconsistency in the data set.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we will need to fit the data to the provided function form: y = ax^0 + bx^1.

This is akin to a linear function y = a + bx, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the line. We need to find the values of a and b that best fit the given data.

Given the data points:
(1, 2), (-19, 122), (17, -94), (15, -82), (-6, 44),

we will use two of the points to determine the values of a and b. Let's use the first two data points for this calculation.

For point (1, 2):
2 = a*1^0 + b*1
2 = a + b

For point (-19, 122):
122 = a*(-19)^0 + b*(-19)
122 = a - 19b

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) 2 = a + b
2) 122 = a - 19b

Let's solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination.

From equation (1):
a = 2 - b

Substitute a into equation (2):
122 = (2 - b) - 19b
122 = 2 - 20b
120 = -20b
b = -6

Now that we have b, we can find a:
a = 2 - (-6)
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

Thus, the function describing the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = 8x^0 - 6x^1

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), let's consider ax^0 as a constant (since x^0 = 1 for any x ≠ 0) and bx^1 as a linear term. This simplifies to y = a + bx.

We need to determine the values of a and b that fit the data points provided. To do this, we'll use two data points to set up a system of linear equations and solve for a and b.

Let's use the first two data points, (1, 2) and (-19, 122):

1. For the point (1, 2): 2 = a + b(1)  -> Equation (1): a + b = 2
2. For the point (-19, 122): 122 = a + b(-19) -> Equation (2): a - 19b = 122

We can now solve this system of equations. Subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):

(a - 19b) - (a + b) = 122 - 2
a - 19b - a - b = 120
-20b = 120
b = -6

Now, we can substitute value of b into Equation (1):

a - 6 = 2
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

    Given the data points provided, we are looking for the best function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 where a and b are constants, x is the input, and y is the output. The term ax^0 is effectively a constant because any number to the power of 0 is 1.

To determine the values of a and b that best fit the given input-output pairs, we can use two of the data points to set up a system of equations:

Using input 1 and output 2:
2 = a(1)^0 + b(1)^1
2 = a + b

Using input -19 and output 122:
122 = a(-19)^0 + b(-19)^1
122 = a - 19b

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

1) a + b = 2
2) a - 19b = 122

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate variable a:

(a - 19b) - (a + b) = 122 - 2
a - a - 19b - b = 120
-20b = 120

Now, solving for b:
b = 120 / -20
b = -6

With the value of b found, we substitute it back into equation 1) to find a:
a + (-6) = 2
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

Now we know that a = 8 and b = -6, we can write the function that describes the relationship:

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that make the equation hold for all given input-output pairs. Remember that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) that is not zero, so \( ax^0 \) is effectively \( a \) since \( a \cdot 1 = a \).

Given the form \( y = a + bx \), let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). By choosing two input-output pairs and forming a system of equations, we can solve for the values of the constants \( a \) and \( b \). Let's choose the pairs (1, 2) and (-19, 122):

For the input 1 and output 2:
\( 2 = a + b(1) \)
\( 2 = a + b \) ...(1)

For the input -19 and output 122:
\( 122 = a + b(-19) \)
\( 122 = a - 19b \) ...(2)

Now we have a system of two equations. We can solve this system by using substitution, elimination, or any other method for solving linear equations. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiply equation (1) by 19 to eliminate \( b \):
\( 38 = 19a + 19b \) ...(3)

Add equation (2) to equation (3) to eliminate \( b \):
\( 38 + 122 = 19a + a \)
\( 160 = 20a \)
\( a = 160 / 20 \)
\( a = 8 \)

Now that we have \( a \), we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find \( b \):
\( 2 = 8 + b \)
\( b = 2 - 8 \)
\( b = -6 \)

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

\( y = 8 - 6x \)

Or, written explicitly in the exact form requested:

    To determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) in the given function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we'll first simplify the function to its mathematical equivalents, knowing that \(x^0 = 1\) for any \(x\). Our function then simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Given this, we want to find \(a\) and \(b\) such that this equation holds true for all the given input-output pairs. Let's use two data points to solve for \(a\) and \(b\):

Using the input-output pair (-17, -292):
\[ -292 = a + b(-17) \]
\[ -292 = a - 17b \]

Using the input-output pair (1, 14):
\[ 14 = a + b(1) \]
\[ 14 = a + b \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
\[ a - 17b = -292 \]
\[ a + b = 14 \]

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
\[ -18b = -306 \]
\[ b = \frac{-306}{-18} \]
\[ b = 17 \]

For the input 1 and output 14:

14 = a + b  --(1)

For the input -6 and output -105:
-105 = a + b(-6)

Solving these two equations simultaneously will give us the values of a and b.

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:

    To write the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first need to recognize that \( ax^0 \) is simply \( a \) because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, and \( bx^1 \) is \( bx \) since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself.

We're looking for \( y = a + bx \). To find \( a \) and \( b \), we need to solve the system of equations given by the input-output pairs provided. Let's use two of the points to create a system of equations:

Using the points (-17, -292) and (1, 14):
1. For the point (-17, -292): \( -292 = a - 17b \)
2. For the point (1, 14): \( 14 = a + b \)

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( -292 = a - 17b \)
2. \( 14 = a + b \)

We can solve this system for \( a \) and \( b \). Starting with equation 2, we can solve for \( a \):

\( a = 14 - b \)

Now, substitute the expression for \( a \) into equation 1:

\( -292 = (14 - b) - 17b \)
\( -292 = 14 - b - 17b \)
\( -292 = 14 - 18b \)
\( -18b = -292 - 14 \)

Let's denote:

Using two points to calculate the parameters a and b:

Let's use points (1) and (4) (-7, 130) and (16, -330).

By substituting the coordinates of these points into the equation y = a + bx we get two equations:

For point (1): 130 = a - 7b
For point (4): -330 = a + 16b

Now, let's solve this system of linear equations:

Substitute a into the second equation:

Using the two data points (x1, y1) = (−7, 130) and (x2, y2) = (14, −290), we can form the following system of linear equations:

1. For (x1, y1): 130 = a + b(−7)
2. For (x2, y2): −290 = a + b(14)

Now we can solve for a and b:

From equation 1: 130 = a - 7b. Which can be rearranged to: a = 130 + 7b ... (3)

Substituting a from equation 3 into equation 2 we get:

−290 = 130 + 7b + 14b

-330 - (-290) = (a + 16b) - (a + 14b)
-40 = 2b
b = -20

Now that we have the value of b, we can plug it into any of the four equations to find a. Using the first equation:

130 = a - 20(-7)
130 = a + 140
a = 130 - 140
a = -10

    To determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) for the function in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\), we can use two points from the given input and output pairs to create a system of linear equations. However, since the function is linear and we want the best fit for all given data points, we generally would use all points to find an approximation.

Here, though, since you ask specifically for the exact form with two terms, let's use two data points to determine \(a\) and \(b\) exactly.

We can choose any two pairs of the given inputs and outputs. Let's take the pairs (-7, 130) and (14, -290).

Using the first data point (-7, 130):
\[130 = a + b(-7)\]
\[130 = a - 7b \tag{1}\]

Using the second data point (14, -290):
\[-290 = a + b(14)\]
\[-290 = a + 14b \tag{2}\]

We now have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).

From equation \((1)\):
\[a = 130 + 7b\]

Substitute \(a\) from the above equation into equation \((2)\):
\[-290 = 130 + 7b + 14b\]
\[-290 = 130 + 21b\]
\[-290 - 130 = 21b\]
\[-420 = 21b\]
\[b = -420 / 21\]
\[b = -20\]

Now, substitute \(b\) into the equation for \(a\):
\[a = 130 + 7(-20)\]
\[a = 130 - 140\]
\[a = -10\]

Therefore, the function that best fits the two chosen points is:
\[y = -10 + (-20)x\]
\[y = -10 - 20x\]

However, keep in mind this function is exactly accurate only for the two data points used to create it. To check against all points, we would verify if the same \(a\) and \(b\) coefficients also satisfy the other given data points. If they do not, this would suggest the relationship is, in reality, not perfectly linear, or some of the data points might include errors.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first recognize that \( ax^0 \) is the constant term (since \( x^0 \) is always 1) and \( bx^1 \) is the linear term (as \( x^1 \) is simply x).

We can rewrite the function as \( y = a + bx \).

With two points, we can determine the exact values of a and b by solving a system of linear equations. However, we have five points, which might constitute an overdetermined system, which could be indicative of inconsistencies if there are errors in the data or noise. If the points all lie on a perfect line, it means our data is consistent, and we can find the values for \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's consider any two points from the data to find \( a \) and \( b \). We can use the points (14, -290) and (-7, 130):

From the point (14, -290):
\[ -290 = a + b(14) \]
\[ -290 = a + 14b \]

From the point (-7, 130):
\[ 130 = a + b(-7) \]
\[ 130 = a - 7b \]

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables (a and b). We can solve it using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

\[ -290 = a + 14b \quad \text{(1)} \]
\[ 130 = a - 7b \quad \text{(2)} \]

Multiply equation (2) by 2 to align the coefficients for \( a \):

\[ 260 = 2a - 14b \quad \text{(2') multiplied by 2} \]

Now add equation (1) to the modified equation (2'):

\[ -290 + 260 = (a + 2a) + (14b - 14b) \]
\[ -30 = 3a \]

Solve for \( a \):

\[ a = \frac{-30}{3} \]
\[ a = -10 \]

Now, insert the value of \( a \) into equation (1) to solve for \( b \):

\[ -290 = -10 + 14b \]
\[ -280 = 14b \]
\[ b = \frac{-280}{14} \]
\[ b = -20 \]

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\[ y = -10 + (-20)x \]
\[ y = -10 - 20x \]

Written explicitly in the form requested, this is \( y = -10x^0 - 20x^1 \). However, since \( x^0 \) equals 1, it's more conventional to write just the numerical constant:

\[ y = -10 - 20x \]

    To write a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we will need to determine the correct values for the coefficients a and b. The term ax^0 represents a constant value (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 represents a linear term (since x raised to the power of 1 is just x).

Let's start by noticing the linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. For that, we can set up two equations using two sets of inputs and outputs. Using the points (2, 15) and (7, 50) should allow us to solve for a and b because the x-values are different:

For the input 2, output 15:
15 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1
15 = a + 2b  (Equation 1)

For the input 7, output 50:
50 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1
50 = a + 7b  (Equation 2)

Now we have a system of two linear equations. We can solve this by substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method by subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(50 - 15) = (a + 7b) - (a + 2b)
35 = 5b
b = 35 / 5
b = 7

Now plug the value of b into one of the equations to find a:

15 = a + 2(7)
15 = a + 14
a = 15 - 14
a = 1

    To determine the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first need to understand that \( ax^0 \) is just \( a \) because any number raised to the zero power is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \). We shall now find \( a \) and \( b \) using the given input-output pairs.

Given the pairs:
- For \( x = -14 \), \( y = -97 \)
- For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 50 \)
- For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 15 \)

We have two equations with the two unknowns \( a \) and \( b \):
1. \( -97 = a + (-14)b \)
2. \( 50 = a + 7b \)
3. \( 15 = a + 2b \)

We can solve this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \). The quickest way to find a solution with the given data is to take any two pairs and solve the equations together. Let's use pairs (2) and (3) for convenience.

From (3) we have:
\( 15 = a + 2b \)  -- equation (i)

From (2) we have:
\( 50 = a + 7b \)  -- equation (ii)

Let's subtract equation (i) from equation (ii) to eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( b \):
\( 50 - 15 = (a + 7b) - (a + 2b) \)
\( 35 = 5b \)
\( b = 7 \)

Now, we can use the value of \( b \) to find \( a \). Substitute \( b = 7 \) into equation (i):
\( 15 = a + 2(7) \)
\( 15 = a + 14 \)
\( a = 15 - 14 \)

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we will essentially be looking for a linear equation y = a + bx, which is equivalent because x^0 is equal to 1.

Given the following pairs of input and output:

1. Input: -14, Output: -97
2. Input: 7, Output: 50
3. Input: 2, Output: 15

We can substitute the input and output values into the general linear equation form to create a system of equations:

1. -97 = a + b(-14)
2. 50 = a + b(7)
3. 15 = a + b(2)

We can solve the system of equations by first subtracting equation (3) from equation (2):

50 - 15 = (a + b(7)) - (a + b(2))
35 = b(5)

Now solve for b:

b = 35 / 5
b = 7

We can substitute the value of b back into either equation (2) or (3), let's use equation (3):

1) Using the input/output pair (2, 15):
15 = a + b(2)

2) Using the input/output pair (7, 50):
50 = a + b(7)

Now, we have two linear equations:
1) 15 = a + 2b
2) 50 = a + 7b

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate a and solve for b:
50 - 15 = (a + 7b) - (a + 2b)

b = 35 / 5

1) For the input -14, the output is -97:
-97 = a + b(-14)

2) For the input 2, the output is 15:
15 = a + b(2)

We now have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

-97 = a - 14b
15 = a + 2b

We can solve this system for a and b by first isolating a in one of the equations and then substituting it into the other:

From equation 2:
15 = a + 2b
a = 15 - 2b  (Equation 3)

Now substitute Equation 3 into Equation 1:
-97 = (15 - 2b) - 14b
-97 = 15 - 2b - 14b
-97 = 15 - 16b
-97 - 15 = -16b

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between the given inputs (x) and outputs (y), we'll need to work with the given data points to determine the coefficients a and b.

The given form is actually a linear function of the form y = a + bx, where:
- a is the y-intercept, which is the constant term (ax^0 is equivalent to a as anything raised to the power of zero is 1).
- b is the slope of the line, representing the rate of change of y with respect to x.

We have five data points provided:
(5, -26), (1, -14), (-14, 31), (-5, 4), and (-8, 13).

Let's try to solve for a and b using the standard linear regression method. We can use two points to create two equations and then solve for a and b.

Point 1 (x1, y1): (5, -26)
Point 2 (x2, y2): (1, -14)

Using the point-slope form:

1. For the first point: -26 = a + 5b
2. For the second point: -14 = a + 1b

Now we have a system of linear equations:
-26 = a + 5b ...(1)
-14 = a + 1b ...(2)

Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to isolate b:
-26 - (-14) = a + 5b - (a + b)
-12 = 4b
b = -3

Now that we have the value for b, we can solve for a using either of the two equations. We will use equation (2):

-14 = a + 1(-3)
-14 = a - 3
a = -11

So the function in the required form is:
y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -11x^0 - 3x^1
y = -11 + (-3)x
y = -11 - 3x

However, let's verify this by checking the other given points. If all the other points satisfy this equation, then it is a good description of the data.

    To find a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that approximates the given data, we need to determine the constants a and b. However, a linear function ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to a + bx because x^0 is always 1 for any non-zero x.

Given this form, a represents the y-intercept of the function, and b represents the slope.

Looking at the pairs of inputs and outputs:

(5, -26)
(1, -14)

We could try to solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b that would provide the best fit for the given points.

However, because we have 5 equations and only 2 unknowns, this system is likely overdetermined, meaning there probably isn't one solution that fits all points exactly, assuming that the underlying relationship is indeed linear. In such a case, the best approach is usually to perform a least squares regression analysis to find the best-fitting a and b.

Since I cannot perform such a regression within the constraints of this environment, I'll instead select two points and solve the system, knowing that the resulting equation might not perfectly fit all the points.

Let's choose the points (5, -26) and (1, -14) for simplicity:

For (5, -26):
-26 = a + 5b | (1)

For (1, -14):
-14 = a + b | (2)

Now, subtract (2) from (1) to solve for b:
(-26) - (-14) = (a + 5b) - (a + b)
-12 = 4b
b = -3

Now, plug the value of b back into (2) to solve for a:
-14 = a + b
-14 = a - 3
a = -11

This gives us an approximate linear function of:
y = -11 + (-3)x

However, please bear in mind that this linear function is based on the arbitrary selection of two data points out of five and likely does not perfectly fit all the provided data points.

A common method for finding a best-fit linear equation is by using the method of least squares. However, this typically requires more computation than what can be described in a simple text format. Instead, I will estimate the values of a and b using two points from the given set which seem to best fit a line. Let's choose the points (1, -14) and (5, -26) for this purpose because their x-values represent the smallest magnitude, which often gives us a clearer analysis of the increment.

Substituting the two points into the equation y = a + bx gives us two simultaneous equations:

-14 = a + 1b
-26 = a + 5b

Let's solve these equations to find the values of a and b:

From the first equation, we can express a in terms of b:
a = -14 - b

Now, substitute this expression for a into the second equation:
-26 = (-14 - b) + 5b
-26 = -14 + 4b
-12 = 4b
b = -12 / 4
b = -3

Now find a using the expression a = -14 - b:
a = -14 - (-3)
a = -14 + 3
a = -11

So, the function that approximately describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -11 + (-3)x
Or, y = -11 - 3x

This function is an estimation. Finding the precise function would require either two points that perfectly represent the pattern without any outliers or a least squares fitting process.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs given, we can observe that ax^0 is a constant term (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), while bx^1 is simply bx, since anything raised to the power of 1 is itself. Thus, the relationship we're looking for can be simplified to y = a + bx.

We have the following pairs of input and output:

(5, -26), (1, -14), (-14, 31), (-5, 4), (-8, 13)

Now, we have to calculate the values of coefficients a and b that make the relationship y = a + bx hold for the given points. We can do this by setting up two equations from two of the points and then solving for a and b. However, because we're not given a method to determine which two points we should use for a perfect fit (as normally would require a system of equations for all points or a least-square method to find an approximate solution), I can perform a rough estimation by selecting any two points and calculating a and b based on those points.

Let's use the points (5, -26) and (1, -14) to set up the system of equations:

For input 5, output -26:
-26 = a + 5b

For input 1, output -14:
-14 = a + 1b

By solving the system of equations, we subtract the second equation from the first:

-26 - (-14) = (a + 5b) - (a + b)
-12 = 4b
b = -3

Now that we have b, we substitute it back into any of the two equations to find a; let's use the second one:

-14 = a + 1 * (-3)
-14 = a - 3
a = -11

Thus, our function is y = -11 + (-3)x or y = -11 - 3x.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, where y is the output and x is the input, we are basically looking for a linear equation of the form y = a + bx, since x^0 is always 1 and x^1 is just x.

We can determine the coefficients a and b by setting up a system of linear equations using the input-output pairs provided. We'll use two pairs to derive a system of equations and solve for a and b:

Using the input-output pair (-9, 64) we get:
64 = a + b(-9) --> Equation 1

Using the input-output pair (-3, 22) we get:
22 = a + b(-3) --> Equation 2

To solve for a and b, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply Equation 2 by 3 to eliminate a when we subtract the equations:
66 = 3a + b(-9)

Now subtract Equation 1 from this new equation:
66 - 64 = (3a + b(-9)) - (a + b(-9))
2 = 2a
a = 1

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we have the following equations:

1. For input -9, output 64:
64 = a - 9b

2. For input -3, output 22:
22 = a - 3b

3. For input 9, output -62:

4. For input -5, output 36:
36 = a - 5b

5. For input -16, output 113:
113 = a - 16b

With these five equations, we can try to solve for a and b. However, because we have more equations than unknowns, this system is overdetermined, and it might not have an exact solution unless we use a method like least squares to approximate one.

But to find an exact solution, since we cannot satisfy all equations exactly with a single line (given the nature of the provided points), we typically would pick two points to calculate the slope (b) first and then use that slope to calculate the intercept (a). However, just by inspection we can guess that the data does not describe a simple linear relationship because the output does not change consistently with changes in the input.

Nevertheless, let's try solving for b using the first two points:

From the first equation: 64 = a - 9b
From the second equation: 22 = a - 3b

Now, subtract the second equation from the first to solve for b:

(64 - 22) = (-9b) - (-3b)
42 = -6b
b = -7

Now let's solve for a using the value for b:

64 = a - 9(-7)
64 = a + 63
a = 64 - 63
a = 1

So the function that best fits the first two points is:

y = 1 - 7x

But, this function won't exactly fit the remaining points; it is an approximate solution based on two of the data points. If we need the function that fits all points perfectly, we would need a more complex function or we would need to use an approximation method to find the best fit line for all the data points.

    The relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) needs to be delineated in the form of a linear function, y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since ax^0 is equivalent to a because any number raised to the power of zero is one, the linear function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Given the input-output pairs, we will attempt to find the constants a and b that make the function y = a + bx describe the data as best as possible.

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for a and b. We can take inputs -9 and 9, and their outputs 64 and -62, for example.

For the first pair (input: -9, output: 64):
64 = a + b(-9)

For the second pair (input: 9, output: -62):
-62 = a + b(9)

We now have a system of two equations with two variables:
1) 64 = a - 9b
2) -62 = a + 9b

We can solve this system by adding the two equations together to solve for a:
64 + (-62) = a - 9b + a + 9b
2 = 2a
a = 1

Now that we have a value for a, we can substitute it back into either equation to find b. Let's use equation 2):

    To write a function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are essentially looking to find a linear function of \( x \), since \( ax^0 \) is a constant (any number to the zero power is 1), and \( bx^1 \) is just \( bx \). So we are looking for \( y = a + bx \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constant coefficients we need to determine from the given input-output pairs.

However, five input-output pairs are more than necessary for determining a linear function, which typically requires only two pairs. This excess of information suggests that the data might not be perfectly linear, or there could be an error in the data. 

To identify \( a \) and \( b \), we will assume that the data describes a linear relationship, despite the potential nonlinearity. We can use two of the data points to find the coefficients. Let's use the first two data points (-9, 64) and (-3, 22) for this purpose. Using these points, we have two equations:

1. \( 64 = a + b(-9) \)
2. \( 22 = a + b(-3) \)

Now, we will solve this system of equations:

Subtract the second equation from the first:
\( 64 - 22 = a + b(-9) - (a + b(-3)) \)
\( 42 = a - a + b(-9 + 3) \)
\( 42 = -6b \)

Now solve for \( b \):
\( b = -7 \)

Using the value of \( b \) in one of the equations to solve for \( a \):
\( 22 = a - 7(-3) \)
\( 22 = a + 21 \)
\( a = 1 \)

Thus, the coefficients are \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -7 \), which gives us the function:
\[ y = 1 - 7x \]
\[ or \]
\[ y = -7x^1 + 1x^0 \]

This is the best fit linear function based on the two points we selected. However, it should be noted that because we have five points and because a perfect linear relationship is not guaranteed with the given data, this function may not accurately predict other outputs.

Using the pair (Input: 6, Output: -99), we have:

-99 = a + 6b

We can solve this system using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix methods.

Using elimination, we can multiply the second equation by 20 and the first one by 6 to eliminate a:

-99 * 20 = 20a + 120b

Let's denote:

- a as the y-intercept (the value of y when x is 0)
- b as the slope of the line (the change in y divided by the change in x)

The function will need to capture a linear relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y). However, without more information, there can be many lines that fit these points, or there might be no single line that fits all of them exactly if they do not lie in a perfect line.

To narrow it down, we will calculate the slope (b) using two of the data points and then solve for a. Let's use (Input: -20, Output: 265) and (Input: 6, Output: -99) to calculate the slope.

Given the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can simplify this to \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 = 1 \). Now, let's plug in the given points:

We have too many equations for a system of two unknowns, which is often the case in real-world data. We can either find a least-squares approximation that minimizes the errors between the actual outputs and the outputs predicted by our linear model, or simply determine if there's a consistent linear relationship and calculate two equations to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \). 

However, by inspecting the values, we see that the changes in the outputs are not proportional to the changes in the inputs, indicating that a linear relationship might not be the best fit.

For instance, comparing the pair (-20, 265) and (-10, 125), we see that halving \( x \) does not halve \( y \). Similarly, comparing (-10, 125) and (-5, 55) shows inconsistent differences. However, to attempt to find an approximate linear relationship, we might average the inputs and outputs and solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using standard linear regression techniques.

Since this inconsistency would require more complex methods than simple linear equations to determine the function, I will attempt to find an approximate function using two of the data points for simplicity's sake:

Using the points (-20, 265) and (-10, 125):
\( a + b(-20) = 265 \) → Equation 1
\( a + b(-10) = 125 \) → Equation 2

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate \( a \):
\( -20b - (-10b) = 265 - 125 \)
\( -20b + 10b = 140 \)
\( -10b = 140 \)
\( b = -14 \)

Now we can solve for \( a \) using either equation 1 or 2; using equation 2:
\( a - 10(-14) = 125 \)
\( a + 140 = 125 \)
\( a = 125 - 140 \)
\( a = -15 \)

The approximate function is thus:
\( y = -15 + (-14)x \)
\( y = -15 - 14x \)

For example, take the inputs and outputs (-20, 265) and (-5, 55):

1. Substituting x = -20 and y = 265 into the equation y = a + bx gives us:
   265 = a - 20b

2. Substituting x = -5 and y = 55 into the equation y = a + bx gives us:
   55 = a - 5b

Now, let's solve this system for a and b.

From equation 2, express a in terms of b:
a = 55 + 5b

Substitute this expression for a into equation 1:
265 = (55 + 5b) - 20b
265 = 55 + 5b - 20b
265 = 55 - 15b
210 = -15b
b = -14

Now that we have b, substitute it back into the expression for a:
a = 55 + 5(-14)
a = 55 - 70
a = -15

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs from the data given is:
y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -15x^0 - 14x^1
Simplified further to:
y = -15 - 14x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    ","To find the output using our derived function y = -15 - 14x for the input x = -17, we plug the value into the equation:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can use the standard linear equation form y = ax^1 + bx^0, which simplifies to y = ax + b. 

We are given five points:
(-10, -54), (4, 2), (-20, -94), (4, 2), and (-4, -30)

Since we have duplicate points (4, 2), we need only to consider four unique data pairs to determine the coefficients a and b.

It appears to be a straightforward linear relationship, so we need two points to solve for a and b. We will use the points (-10, -54) and (4, 2) to set up a system of equations:

1) For x = -10, y = -54:
-54 = a(-10) + b  =>  -10a + b = -54  ... (Equation 1)

2) For x = 4, y = 2:
2 = a(4) + b  =>  4a + b = 2  ... (Equation 2)

Now, we need to solve this system of equations for a and b. We can subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate b and solve for a:

-10a + b - (4a + b) = -54 - 2
-10a + b - 4a - b = -56
-14a = -56
a = -56 / -14
a = 4

With the value of a found, we can substitute back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find b. Let's use Equation 2:

4a + b = 2
4(4) + b = 2
16 + b = 2
b = 2 - 16
b = -14

Thus, the function that describes the relationship between the input x and the output y, based on the given unique data points, is:

y = 4x - 14

    To find the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are actually looking for a linear equation of the form \( y = a + bx \) (since \( x^0 \) is 1 for any x except for x = 0). We are given pairs of inputs and outputs that we can use to determine the constants \(a\) (y-intercept) and \(b\) (slope) of this linear function.

Let's establish two equations using two pairs of inputs and outputs from the given data. We’ll use the first and the third data points for this purpose (-10, -54) and (-20, -94).

From the first data point:
-54 = a + b(-10)  (1)

From the third data point:
-94 = a + b(-20)  (2)

If we subtract equation (1) from equation (2), we get:

-94 - (-54) = a - a + b(-20) - b(-10)
-40 = -10b
b = 4

Now that we have the value for b, we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find a:

-54 = a - 40
a = -54 + 40
a = -14

    To find a linear relationship in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are essentially looking for \( y = a + bx \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants.

Given the data points:

We can identify \( b \) by finding the slope between any two distinct points. Let's use the points (-10, -54) and (4, 2) to find \( b \):

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's first understand the formula provided:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1, and a number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself. We need to find values for \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the given input-output pairs.

Let's use the given input-output pairs to create a system of equations:

For Input: -10, Output: -54
\[ -54 = a + b(-10) \]

For Input: 4, Output: 2
\[ 2 = a + b(4) \]

We now have two equations with two unknowns:
1. \( -54 = a - 10b \)
2. \( 2 = a + 4b \)

By solving this system of equations simultaneously, we can find the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the method of substitution or elimination. I prefer the elimination method.

Let's multiply the second equation by 2.5 to add it to the first equation in order to eliminate \( a \). The second equation will become:

\[ 5 = 2.5a + 10b \]

Now we add equations 1 and the modified second equation:

\( -54 = a - 10b \)
\( 5 = 2.5a + 10b \)

Adding these together:

\( -54 + 5 = a - 10b + 2.5a + 10b \)
\( -49 = 3.5a \)

Now solve for \( a \):

\( a = -49 / 3.5 \)
\( a = -14 \)

Now we plug \( a = -14 \) back into the second original equation to find \( b \):

\[ 2 = -14 + 4b \]
\[ 16 = 4b \]
\[ b = 4 \]

With \( a = -14 \) and \( b = 4 \), our function is:

\[ y = -14x^0 + 4x^1 \]
\[ y = -14 + 4x \]

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, it's evident that ax^0 reduces to a since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, and bx^1 is simply bx because anything raised to the power of 1 is itself.

So, we have y = a + bx, a linear equation with a as the y-intercept and b as the slope.

To find a and b, we can use two points from the provided data to set up a system of equations. Let's use the points (-10, -54) and (4, 2).

Using (-10, -54):
-54 = a + b(-10)
-54 = a - 10b ... (1)

Now using (4, 2):
2 = a + b(4)
2 = a + 4b ... (2)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve these equations by using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination.

First, we can multiply equation (2) by 2.5 to align the a term with equation (1).

2.5(2) = 2.5(a + 4b)
5 = 2.5a + 10b ... (3)

Next, we add equation (1) and equation (3) together to eliminate a:

-54 = a - 10b
+ 5 = 2.5a + 10b
-----------------
-49 = 3.5a

Divide both sides by 3.5 to solve for a:

a = -49 / 3.5
a = -14

Now that we have a, we can plug it back into any of the original equations to solve for b. Let's use equation (1):

-54 = -14 - 10b
-10b = -54 + 14
-10b = -40

Divide both sides by -10:

b = 4

Given the pairs:

b = (-2 - (-20)) / (-2 - (-11))
b = (18) / (9)
b = 2

\( -2 = a + b(-2) \) ... (equation 1)

And using the Input -11 and Output -20:

    To find the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we must determine the constants `a` and `b` that fit the given data points. Recall that `x^0` is 1 for any x that is not 0, so `ax^0` is just `a`. So the function simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

Given the symmetrical output for symmetrical inputs -17 and 17, we can infer that a constant `a` is close to or equal to zero because their absolute output values are nearly the same, suggesting that the y-intercept is at or near the origin. However, since the outputs for 17 and -17 are not exactly symmetrical (-310 versus 302), `a` will not be strictly zero but a small value to adjust for that difference.

The outputs increase by about 18 each time `x` is increased by one, suggesting that `b` is around 18.

Using two points to determine `b`, let's choose (10, 176) and (12, 212). The slope `b` can be calculated using:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (212 - 176) / (12 - 10)

176 = a + 18 * 10
176 = a + 180
a = 176 - 180
a = -4

So, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which is essentially \( y = a + bx \), we can use two of the given input-output pairs to solve for the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's take the input-output pairs (10, 176) and (17, 302) to form two equations:

1. For input 10: \( 176 = a + 10b \)
2. For input 17: \( 302 = a + 17b \)

Now, let's solve this system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

\( 302 - 176 = a + 17b - (a + 10b) \)
\( 126 = 7b \)
\( b = 18 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can back substitute into the first equation:

\( 176 = a + 10 \cdot 18 \)
\( 176 = a + 180 \)
\( a = 176 - 180 \)
\( a = -4 \)

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are essentially finding a linear relationship where \( ax^0 = a \) (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1) and \( bx^1 = bx \). Thus, we want to find a function of the form \( y = a + bx \).

Looking at the given input-output pairs, let's assume the relationship is linear and use two points to determine the coefficients a and b. Let's use the points (10, 176) and (12, 212).

We will set up a system of linear equations using these two points:

For the point (10, 176), the equation is \( a + 10b = 176 \).
For the point (12, 212), the equation is \( a + 12b = 212 \).

Now, we are going to solve this system of equations for a and b. Let's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:
\( (a + 12b) - (a + 10b) = 212 - 176 \)
\( 2b = 36 \)
\( b = 18 \).

Now that we have b, let's substitute it back into the first equation to find a:
\( a + 10(18) = 176 \)
\( a + 180 = 176 \)
\( a = 176 - 180 \)
\( a = -4 \).

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first observe that \( ax^0 \) is another way of writing \( a \), since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Given the data, we can now try to identify the constants \( a \) and \( b \). We notice that when the input is positive, the output is positive, and when the input is negative, the output is negative; this suggests that the constant \( b \), which is multiplied by \( x \), is positive because it preserves the sign.

To find \( b \), we can take any two points and calculate the slope, which is the change in \( y \) divided by the change in \( x \):

Using the points (10, 176) and (12, 212), we calculate \( b \) as follows:
\( b = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{212 - 176}{12 - 10} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

Now that we have \( b = 18 \), let's use one of the points to solve for \( a \). Let's use the point (10, 176):

\( 176 = a + 18 \cdot 10 \)
\( 176 = a + 180 \)
\( a = 176 - 180 \)

    The provided data points are:
(-16, 297)
(18, -315)
(-5, 99)
(5, -81)

To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants a and b. 

Since ax^0 is the same as a (because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), therefore y = a + bx.

We can set up a system of equations using the data points provided to solve for a and b. However, since we have more than two points, we have an overdetermined system. Still, we can try to find a as a common offset for all data points and b as the coefficient for x.

Let's use the points (-16, 297) and (18, -315) to set up two equations:

For (-16, 297):
297 = a + b(-16)

For (18, -315):
-315 = a + b(18)

Now, let's solve this system of linear equations.

From the first equation:
a = 297 + 16b ...equation (1)

Substitute a from equation (1) into the second equation:
-315 = (297 + 16b) + 18b
-315 = 297 + 16b + 18b
-315 = 297 + 34b

Now, solve for b:
34b = -315 - 297
34b = -612
b = -612 / 34
b = -18

Now plug the value of b into equation (1) to find a:
a = 297 + 16(-18)
a = 297 - 288
a = 9

Therefore, the function we are looking for is:
y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = 9 - 18x

Please note that while this linear function matches the two points (-16, 297) and (18, -315), it may not perfectly fit the rest of the points, because a perfect fitting might not be achievable with a linear function for all the provided points. Let's test the function with the remaining points to see if it fits:

For (-5, 99):
Expected output = 99
Our function output = 9 - 18(-5) = 9 + 90 = 99 (Fits)

For (5, -81):
Expected output = -81
Our function output = 9 - 18(5) = 9 - 90 = -81 (Fits)

Interestingly, our linear function fits all given points, which means the set of data points lie on the line described by the equation:

    To find a linear function that fits the provided input-output pairs, we can use the standard form of a linear equation, which is y = ax + b. This is equivalent to the form y = ax^1 + bx^0; this is what you asked for, with a representing the slope of the line and b the y-intercept.

Let's denote the inputs as `x` and the outputs as `y`. We have the following pairs of `(x, y)`: (-16, 297), (18, -315), (-16, 297), (-5, 99), and (5, -81). The first and third pairs are identical, which confirms that for x = -16, y = 297 consistently.

To find the coefficients a and b, we need at least two unique points. Let's take the points (-16, 297) and (18, -315) for our calculation.

We have two equations based on the two points:

1. 297 = a*(-16) + b 
2. -315 = a*18 + b

Now we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find a and b.

From equation 1:
297 = -16a + b
b = 297 + 16a ... (3)

From equation 2:
-315 = 18a + b
-315 = 18a + (297 + 16a) [using equation 3]
-315 = 18a + 297 + 16a
-315 = 34a + 297
-315 - 297 = 34a
-612 = 34a
a = -18

Now that we have a, we put it back into equation 3 to find b:
b = 297 + 16*(-18)
b = 297 - 288
b = 9

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the data, we can first simplify the form to:

y = a + bx

This is because, by definition, x^0 is equal to 1 for any x that is not equal to zero. Now, we have two unknowns, 'a' and 'b', and we can use the given input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations and solve for 'a' and 'b'.

Let's use the first two input-output pairs to form our equations:

1) Plug in (-16, 297) into the equation y = a + bx:
297 = a - 16b

2) Plug in (18, -315) into the equation y = a + bx:
-315 = a + 18b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

a - 16b = 297
a + 18b = -315

Adding the two equations will cancel out 'a' and allow us to solve for 'b':

( (a - 16b) + (a + 18b) ) / 2 = (297 - 315) / 2
(2a + 2b) / 2 = -18 / 2
a + b = -9

Now, from the equation a + b = -9, we need to isolate one of the variables (let's solve for 'a'):

a = -9 - b

Substitute this expression for 'a' into one of the original equations (I'll use the first one):

-9 - b - 16b = 297
-9 - 17b = 297
-17b = 297 + 9
-17b = 306
b = -306 / 17
b = -18

Now that we have the value for 'b', we can use it to solve for 'a':

a + (-18) = -9
a - 18 = -9
a = -9 + 18
a = 9

So, the function that fits the data provided is:

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first note that \( ax^0 \) can be simplified to \( a \), since \( x^0 \) is 1 for any \( x \) that is not 0. Thus, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We have two coefficients to determine: \( a \) and \( b \). To do this, we need at least two unique points to solve for these two unknowns. Let's use the points (-16, 297) and (18, -315).

From the point (-16, 297), we can write:
\( 297 = a + b(-16) \)
\( 297 = a - 16b \)   ...(1)

From the point (18, -315), we can write:
\( -315 = a + b(18) \)
\( -315 = a + 18b \)   ...(2)

We now have a system of linear equations:

\( a - 16b = 297 \)   ...(1)
\( a + 18b = -315 \)   ...(2)

To solve this system, we can add equation (1) to equation (2) to eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( b \):

\( (a - 16b) + (a + 18b) = 297 - 315 \)
\( 2a + 2b = -18 \)
\( 2a = -18 - 2b \)
\( a = -9 - b \)

Now we substitute the value of \( a \) from this equation into equation (1):

\( -9 - b - 16b = 297 \)
\( -17b = 297 + 9 \)
\( -17b = 306 \)

    To define a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of coefficients a and b such that the function fits the given input-output pairs.

First, let's simplify the terms:

- \( ax^0 \) is essentially \( a \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x that is not 0.
- \( bx^1 \) is just \( bx \) because \( x^1 = x \).

So, the function will look like y = a + bx.

Given the data pairs:

- x = -16, y = 297
- x = 18, y = -315
- x = -16, y = 297 (This is a repetition of the first data pair)
- x = -5, y = 99
- x = 5, y = -81

We will use the first and second input-output pairs to solve for a and b.

Let's set up two equations based on those pairs:

For x = -16, y = 297:
1) 297 = a + b(-16)

For x = 18, y = -315:
2) -315 = a + b(18)

Now let's solve these two equations simultaneously.

From equation 1) we get:
297 = a - 16b
So, a = 297 + 16b -- (3)

Substituting equation (3) into equation 2), we get:
-315 = (297 + 16b) + 18b
-315 = 297 + 34b
-612 = 34b
b = -612 / 34
b = -18

Now we put the value of b back into equation (3):
a = 297 + 16(-18)
a = 297 - 288
a = 9

So the function is:

b = 518 / 37
b = 14

The inputs and outputs provide us with a system of equations:

3. a + b(-15) = -223
4. a + b(6) = 71

We have multiple equations, but we only need two of them to solve for the two unknowns, a and b. We'll use equations (1) and (2):

a - 18b = -265 (1)
a + 19b = 253  (2)

We can solve this system of equations using various methods (substitution, elimination, matrix method, etc.). Let's use the elimination method:

Add (1) and (2) to eliminate a:

a - 18b = -265

a + 19b = 253
------------
2a + b = -12

Next, divide by 2 to solve for a:

2a + b = -12
2a = -12 - b
a = (-12 - b) / 2

Now we'll substitute the value of a back into one of the original equations to solve for b. Let's use equation (1):

a - 18b = -265
(-12 - b)/2 - 18b = -265
-12 - b - 36b = -530
-37b = -530 + 12

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the given data points, we can interpret this as looking for a linear function y = b * x + a, where b is the coefficient of x and a is the constant term. Since x^0 is always 1, the term ax^0 is just a constant.

Let's use two points from the provided data to determine the coefficients a and b. We'll use the following points:

(1) x=-18, y=-265
(2) x=19, y=253

Let's set up two equations based on these points and our function y = b * x + a:

For point (1):
-265 = b * (-18) + a ... (3)

For point (2):
253 = b * 19 + a ... (4)

Now let's solve these two equations to find a and b. We'll first multiply equation (3) by 19 and equation (4) by 18 to eliminate a when we add them together:

19 * (-265) = 19b * (-18) + 19a ... (5)
18 * 253 = 18b * 19 + 18a ... (6)

(5) becomes:

    To determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) for the function in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we must note that \(x^0\) is always 1 for any non-zero \(x\). Therefore, the term \(ax^0\) is simply \(a\).

Given this, the function simplifies to \(y = a + bx\). To find \(a\) and \(b\), we can use two input-output pairs to solve for these variables.

Let's use the following two pairs as an example: (x = -18, y = -265) and (x = 19, y = 253).

When \(x = -18\), \(y = -265\):
-265 = a + b(-18) ...(1)

When \(x = 19\), \(y = 253\):
253 = a + b(19) ...(2)

Now, solve these two equations simultaneously:

From equation (1):
\(a = -265 + 18b\) ...(3)

Substitute \(a\) from equation (3) into equation (2):

\(253 = -265 + 18b + 19b\)
\(253 = -265 + 37b\)
\(253 + 265 = 37b\)
\(b = 518 / 37\)
\(b = 14\)

Now that we have \(b\), we can substitute back into equation (3) to find \(a\):

\(a = -265 + 18(14)\)
\(a = -265 + 252\)
\(a = -13\)

Hence, the function is \(y = -13 + 14x\).

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can use two data points to solve for the coefficients a and b. The function simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is 1 for any value of x except x = 0.

Let's use the given data points to form a system of equations. We shall use the following two points: (x1, y1) = (-18, -265) and (x2, y2) = (19, 253).

For the first point (-18, -265):
-265 = a + b(-18)

For the second point (19, 253):
253 = a + b(19)

Now, we have the following system of equations:
1) a - 18b = -265
2) a + 19b = 253

We will solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Adding the two equations together to eliminate a, we get:

(a - 18b) + (a + 19b) = (-265) + (253)
2a + b = -12

Now, we can solve for b:
b = -12 - 2a

To find a, we can plug the value of b back into one of our original equations. We'll use the second equation for this purpose:

a + 19(-12 - 2a) = 253
a - 228 - 38a = 253
-37a = 253 + 228
-37a = 481
a = -481 / 37
a = -13

Now that we have a value for a, we can find b:
b = -12 - 2(-13)
b = -12 + 26
b = 14

    To determine the a and b coefficients in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we should understand that the ax^0 term is a constant value, since any number to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, ax^0 simplifies to a. The bx^1 term simplifies to bx, since any number to the power of 1 is itself. Therefore, the function can be simplified to y = a + bx.

Given the input-output pairs, we can form a system of equations to solve for a and b. Let's use a pair of points to form two equations and solve for a and b.

From Input: 0 and Output: -15, we get:

-15 = a + b(0)
-15 = a.

So we already have the value of a: a = -15.

To find b, we can use any other point. Let's use the point with Input: -5 and Output: -35:

-35 = a + b(-5)
-35 = -15 + b(-5)

y = a + bx

Now, let's use two data points to calculate the values of `a` and `b`. We can pick any two points, but I'll choose (0, -15) and (-5, -35) to make the calculations straightforward.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants a and b.

First, observe that ax^0 is just a (because anything to the power of zero is 1), and bx^1 is bx (because anything to the power of one is itself). Thus, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We can use two of the input-output pairs to find out the values of a and b.

(0, -15), (-5, -35), (-4, -31), (5, 5), (-12, -63)

Let's start by looking at the first point (0, -15). When x = 0, we get y = -15. Applying this to the function y = a + bx, we get:

-15 = a

Now we know that ""a"" is -15.

    The data provided suggests a linear relationship between the input x and the output y. The requested form of the function is y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since any number (except 0) to the power of 0 is 1.

To determine the coefficients a and b, we can use two points from the data to form a system of linear equations. For convenience, let's use the points (9, 133) and (-14, -212).

1. From the point (9, 133):
133 = a + b(9)

2. From the point (-14, -212):
-212 = a - b(14)

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:
1. a + 9b = 133
2. a - 14b = -212

Solve for a in the first equation:
a = 133 - 9b

Substitute a into the second equation:

133 - 23b = -212

Now solve for b:
-23b = -212 - 133

b = -345 / -23
b = 15

a = 133 - 135

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that relates the given inputs (x) to the outputs (y), we can first simplify the equation by understanding that x^0 is always equal to 1 for any x (except when x = 0). So, the equation simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Given we have pairs of x and y values, we can create a system of equations to solve for a and b. However, we only need two points to determine a linear function. Let's use the first two points (9, 133) and (19, 283).

For the input 9:

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can set up a system of linear equations using the provided input-output pairs. Note that x^0 is always 1, so ax^0 becomes a constant term a.

We can use two of the input-output pairs to solve for a and b:

Using the input-output pair (9, 133):
133 = a(9)^0 + b(9)
133 = a + 9b

Using the input-output pair (-14, -212):
-212 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)
-212 = a - 14b

Now we have two equations:
1) 133 = a + 9b 
2) -212 = a - 14b

We can solve this system of equations by the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

By adding equation 1 to equation 2, we get:
133 + (-212) = (a + a) + (9b - 14b)
-79 = 2a - 5b
-79/2 = a - (5/2)b
-79/2 = a - 2.5b

Now let's isolate a by solving for b using equation 1):
133 = a + 9b
a = 133 - 9b

Now we substitute a from the second equation into the first:
-79/2 = (133 - 9b) - 2.5b
Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
-79 = 266 - 18b - 5b
-79 = 266 - 23b
Add 79 to both sides and subtract 266 from both sides:
0 = 187 - 23b
Now divide both sides by -23:
b = 187 / 23
b = 8.1304 (approximately, though this should be an exact value since we are working with whole numbers)

Now that we have b, let’s solve for a:
a = 133 - 9b
a = 133 - 9(8.1304)
a = 133 - 73.1736
a = 59.8264 (once again, it should be an exact value)

The unusual decimal values suggest there should be exact whole numbers, but given the values provided and following the mathematical process, these values for a and b are what we would use. 

Let's now check our work with the third input-output pair (19, 283). If our values for a and b are correct, they should satisfy this equation:
283 = a(19)^0 + b(19)
283 = a + 19b

Using our found values a = 59.8264 and b = 8.1304:
283 ≈ 59.8264 + 19(8.1304)
283 ≈ 59.8264 + 154.4776
283 ≈ 214.304

This does not align with the expected output of 283, indicating that our found values of a and b do not accurately model the relationship for all data points provided. Such discrepancies could be due to rounding during the calculations or a mistake made in the calculation process. To get the exact values of a and b, we would need to ensure that they work for all given input-output pairs accurately. Given the nature of rounding throughout the problem here, I'd recommend reevaluating with precise arithmetic to maintain any whole numbers or fractions that have been lost.

Since in the real calculation we expect whole numbers and these calculations have provided unusual decimals, let me re-calculate with that assumption:

Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs:

For input 9 and output 133:
133 = a(9)^0 + b(9)
133 = a + 9b
Since 9b is a multiple of 9, and 133 is a 1 followed by a double-digit number ending in 3, a likely assumption (without loss of generality) would be that b is also a number ending in 3 or 8, since only these will give a number ending in 3 when multiplied by 9. Let's assume b = 13 (which is a common choice based on the pattern we observe).

133 = a + 9(13)
133 = a + 117
a = 133 - 117
a = 16

Now let's check this with another pair:

For input -14 and output -212:
-212 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)
-212 = a - 14b
-212 = 16 - 14(13)
-212 = 16 - 182
-212 = -166 (which is incorrect, meaning our initial guess for b was wrong)

Revisiting our list of numbers ending in 3 or 8 that could be a potential b, let's try b = 18:
133 = a + 9(18)
133 = a + 162
a = 133 - 162
a = -29

Now we check with the second pair:
-212 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)
-212 = -29 - 14(18)
-212 = -29 - 252
-212 = -281 (which is again incorrect)

Given that we are not obtaining the correct values, it suggests that there might be an error in the process or that we aren't capturing something about the pattern. Under the assumption that there is a linear relationship and we should be working with integers, let's find integers a and b that work for all pairs. 

The correct approach involves not assuming but calculating. We will use two equations created from two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve them simultaneously and get exact integer values for a and b.

From the first and second pair:
1) 133 = a + 9b
2) -212 = a - 14b

Let's solve for a and b from these equations. Multiply the second equation by 1 to easily eliminate a when we add both equations:

1) 133 = a + 9b (multiply by 14)
2) -212 = a - 14b (multiply by 9)

Doing the multiplication:

1) 1862 = 14a + 126b
2) -1908 = 9a - 126b

Now if we add both equations we eliminate b:

-46 = 23a
a = -2

Now we know value of a, we can substitute it back in 1):

133 = -2 + 9b
135 = 9b
b = 15

So the function that accurately describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -2x^0 + 15x^1

y = -2 + 15x

1. \(133 = a + 9b\)
2. \(283 = a + 19b\)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously for \( a \) and \( b \). Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

The simplest way to find \(a\) (the y-intercept) and \(b\) (the slope) is to solve the system of equations that comes from the given input-output pairs. However, we really only need two points to determine a linear function, yet we have been given five.

Now that we have \(b\), we can solve for \(a\) by substituting \(b\), \(x\), and \(y\) into the equation \(y = a + bx\) using one of the points. Let's use the point (9, 133):

\[ 133 = a + 15 \cdot 9 \]
\[ 133 = a + 135 \]
\[ a = 133 - 135 \]
\[ a = -2 \]

So, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\[ y = -2 + 15x \]
\[ y = 15x^1 - 2x^0 \]

Hence, the output is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the given data points, we need to find the values of a and b that make the equation fit all the points.

The given data points are:
1. (2, 59)
2. (-16, -301)
3. (-5, -81)
4. (3, 79)
5. (-2, -21)

Since ax^0 is essentially a constant (because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), let's first try to deduce the pattern for bx^1. The bx^1 part should be such that when you multiply b by the input x, you get the corresponding output y, except for that constant term.

A quick examination of the provided data points:

For input 2, output 59:
bx^1 = b*2

For input -16, output -301:
bx^1 = b*(-16)

For input -5, output -81:
bx^1 = b*(-5)

For input 3, output 79:
bx^1 = b*3

For input -2, output -21:
bx^1 = b*(-2)

We can see that the rate of change between the inputs and the outputs seems to be proportional, suggesting that b might be a constant. Let's find the differences in y over the differences in x:

For the pair of points (2, 59) and (-16, -301):
Δy = 59 - (-301) = 360
Δx = 2 - (-16) = 18
b = Δy / Δx = 360 / 18 = 20

For the pair of points (-16, -301) and (3, 79):
Δy = 79 - (-301) = 380
Δx = 3 - (-16) = 19
b = Δy / Δx = 380 / 19 = 20

This suggests b = 20. We can verify this with other points as well, but it seems consistent.

So, now let's rewrite the function as:
y = a + 20x

Now we need to find the constant term a. We can plug in one of the points to solve for a. Let's use (2, 59):

59 = a + 20*2
59 = a + 40
a = 59 - 40
a = 19

The function that seems to fit the provided data points is:

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since any number raised to the power of zero is 1, we can use two of the given pairs of inputs and outputs to form a system of linear equations and solve for a and b.

Let's take the input-output pairs (2, 59) and (-2, -21) to form two equations:

From the pair (2, 59):
59 = a + b(2)    [1]

From the pair (-2, -21):
-21 = a + b(-2)   [2]

Solving equations [1] and [2] simultaneously for a and b:

Add equations [1] and [2]:
59 - 21 = a + 2b + a - 2b
38 = 2a
a = 19

Substitute a into equation [1]:
59 = 19 + 2b
2b = 59 - 19
2b = 40
b = 20

Thus, the function that describes the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) is:

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first need to understand that \( x^0 \) is equal to 1 for any x that is not zero. Thus, the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) simplifies to \( y = a + bx \). 

Given this form, we need to find the values of a and b that best fit the given input-output pairs. This can be done using two of the provided pairs to create a system of equations and solve for a and b.

Let's pick the input-output pairs (2, 59) and (-2, -21) to create our equations. Substituting x and y with the respective values, we have:

For the input 2:
\( 59 = a + 2b \)

For the input -2:
\( -21 = a - 2b \)

Now we can solve this system of equations for a and b.

Adding the two equations:

\( 59 + (-21) = a + 2b + a - 2b \)
\( 38 = 2a \)
\( a = 19 \)

Substituting the value of a in either of the two original equations, let's use \( 59 = a + 2b \):

\( 59 = 19 + 2b \)
\( 40 = 2b \)
\( b = 20 \)

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs for the provided data points is:

Given the data points:

To do this, we can choose two of the data points to form a system of linear equations. Let's use the points (2, 59) and (-16, -301):

From the point (2, 59):
59 = a + 2b    ... (1)

From the point (-16, -301):
-301 = a - 16b   ... (2)

To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. I will use the elimination method:

Multiply equation (1) by 8 to match the b coefficient in equation (2):

472 = 8a + 16b   ... (3)

Now add equation (2) to equation (3):

472 - 301 = (8a + a) + (16b - 16b)

a = 19

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can recognize that x^0 is always 1 for any x that is not zero. So the term with a is essentially a constant term. The term with b then represents a linear dependency on x. Our task is to find a and b such that y = a + bx fits the given input and output pairs.

Let's use the two of the input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations that we can then solve for a and b.

Using the input-output pair (2, 59):

59 = a * 2^0 + b * 2
59 = a + 2b

Using the input-output pair (-16, -301):

-301 = a * (-16)^0 + b * (-16)
-301 = a - 16b

We now have a system of two equations:

1. 59 = a + 2b
2. -301 = a - 16b

We can solve for a and b by using simultaneous equations. By subtracting the second equation from the first, we can eliminate a:

59 - (-301) = (a - a) + (2b - (-16b))
360 = 18b

Now, divide by 18 to solve for b:

b = 360 / 18
b = 20

Now we can use the value of b to solve for a in either of the two equations. Let's use the first equation:

59 = a + 2b
59 = a + 2(20)
59 = a + 40

Subtract 40 from both sides to solve for a:

a = 59 - 40

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can interpret ax^0 + bx^1 as y = a + bx, since x^0 equals 1 for any x except for x = 0, which isn't in our input set.

Given that y = a + bx, we can use two of the input-output pairs to solve for a and b. Let's use the following two pairs:

For input 13, output 55:
55 = a + 13b ...(1)

For input -20, output -44:
-44 = a - 20b ...(2)

Now we can solve this system of equations for a and b. Multiplying equation (2) by -1, we get:

Adding equation (1) and equation (3) cancels a out:
55 + 44 = a + 13b - a + 20b

b = 99 / 33
b = 3

This means that our function has the form y = a + bx.

We can use any two (input, output) pairs to determine the coefficients a and b. Let's use the first and second pairs given:

Pair 1: (13, 55) gives us the equation 55 = a + b(13).
Pair 2: (-20, -44) gives us the equation -44 = a + b(-20).

Now we have two equations with two variables (a and b):

1. 55 = 13b + a
2. -44 = -20b + a

Rearrange each equation to solve for a:

1. a = 55 - 13b
2. a = -44 + 20b

Now, set both expressions for a equal to each other to solve for b:

55 - 13b = -44 + 20b
55 + 44 = 33b
99 = 33b
b = 99 / 33
b = 3

Let's use two of the given points to calculate ""a"" and ""b"". Choose two points, for example (13, 55) and (-20, -44).

1) For the point (13, 55):

We can solve for ""a"" and ""b"" by subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:

99 = 33b

Now we divide both sides by 33 to solve for b:

b = 99 / 33
b = 3

With the value of b, we can substitute it back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for a. Let's use Equation 1:

y = a + bx

We need to solve for `a` and `b` using the given input-output pairs. This is essentially solving a linear equation since the relationship is linear as suggested by the power of x being 1 (linear term). Generally, two distinct points are required to determine the equation of a straight line. However, since multiple points are given here, we can either use two points to calculate the equation (understanding that it might not fit all points perfectly if the data does not fall on a perfect straight line), or we can use a method such as linear regression to find the best fit line that minimizes the error across all given points.

We will use two points to find `a` and `b`. Let's choose (x1, y1) = (-11, 72) and (x2, y2) = (-3, 8) to set up our system of equations:

y1 = a + bx1
y2 = a + bx2

72 = a - 11b

y = a + bx

Given that x^0 is always 1 for any value x ≠ 0, we need to find a and b such that the equation fits the given input-output pairs.

Let's set up a system of equations using the provided input-output pairs:

For input -11 (x = -11):
a + b(-11) = 72

For input -3 (x = -3):
a + b(-3) = 8

For input -7 (x = -7):
a + b(-7) = 40

We need to solve for a and b. It's not possible for the true system to be solved with simple linear algebra techniques because we have more equations than we have variables (overdetermined system). In the given scenario where we have more equations than unknowns, we would usually apply a method such as least squares fitting to find the best approximation for a and b, which minimizes the error across all given points.

However, since the request here is to pick the coefficients a and b that describe the data as well as I can using the given function form, we can start by looking at the pairs where the output is zero, which should help isolate the term ""a"" if b were to be zero or nearly zero:

For input -2 (x = -2):
a + b(-2) = 0
a - 2b = 0
a = 2b

If we suppose that the pattern might be a simple linear one and that a = 2b (it's a big assumption, but it simplifies the process), we can then plug this into another equation to try and find a value for b.

Let's take:
a + b(18) = -160

Substituting a from the equation we derived above:
2b + b(18) = -160
2b + 18b = -160
20b = -160
b = -160 / 20
b = -8

Now let's use this value of b to find a:
a = 2b
a = 2(-8)
a = -16

Therefore, the function in the exact form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits this assumption would be:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients 'a' and 'b' for a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we should note that ax^0 is a because anything raised to the power of 0 equals 1. So the function simplifies to y = a + bx. To find 'a' and 'b', we can use two data points to set up a system of equations.

Let's take two inputs and outputs for which we know the values:

1) Using the Input: -2 and Output: 0, we have 0 = a - 2b.
2) Using the Input: -3 and Output: 8, we have 8 = a - 3b.

Now, we have two equations to solve for 'a' and 'b':

0 = a - 2b         (Equation 1)
8 = a - 3b         (Equation 2)

If we subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2, we get:

8 = a - 3b - (a - 2b)
8 = a - 3b - a + 2b
8 = -b

Thus, b = -8.

Now, to find 'a', we substitute 'b' into Equation 1:

0 = a - 2(-8)
0 = a + 16

So, a = -16.

The function that describes the relationship between the given inputs and outputs is:

y = -16 + (-8)x

    Given the input/output pairs, we can translate these into coordinate points like this: (-11, 72), (-3, 8), (-2, 0), (18, -160), (-7, 40). We need to find the constants `a` and `b` such that the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 fits the data.

The term ax^0 is just a, since any number (including x) raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. What we need to do is solve for `a` and `b`.

Looking at the third data point (-2, 0), we can immediately find `b` since `a - 2b = 0`, which simplifies to `a = 2b`. We can use this information from one of the remaining points to solve for `a` and `b`. Let's use the second point (-3, 8):

Substituting `a` with `2b`:
8 = 2b - 3b
8 = -b

Therefore; b = -8.

Now replace `b` with -8 in `a = 2b`:
a = 2(-8)
a = -16

The estimated function that fits the provided data points would be:
y = -16 + (-8)x

y = -16 - 8x

However, note that since the data points do not all lie on a straight line, this function will not perfectly fit all the points; it will be an approximation based on a subset of the provided points. If you need a function that perfectly fits all the points, a linear function (with just `a` and `b`) will not suffice as the pattern suggests a more complex relationship, possibly requiring a higher degree polynomial or another form of non-linear function.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can note that \( ax^0 = a \) (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), and \( bx^1 = bx \) (since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself). So, we are essentially looking for a function of the form:

\( y = a + bx \)

We can use the provided input-output pairs to find the values of a and b. Let's consider two pairs of input-output to set up our equations:

For input -11, output 72:
\( 72 = a + b(-11) \) --> Equation 1

For input -3, output 8:
\( 8 = a + b(-3) \) --> Equation 2

Now let's solve these two linear equations to find the values of a and b. 

From Equation 2:
\( 8 = a - 3b \)
\( a = 8 + 3b \) --> This is our equation for a in terms of b.

Now substitute this expression for a into Equation 1:
\( 72 = (8 + 3b) - 11b \)
\( 72 = 8 + 3b - 11b \)
\( 72 = 8 - 8b \)
\( 8b = 8 - 72 \)
\( 8b = -64 \)
\( b = -64 / 8 \)
\( b = -8 \)

Now that we have b, we can find a using the equation \( a = 8 + 3b \):
\( a = 8 + 3(-8) \)
\( a = 8 - 24 \)
\( a = -16 \)

Hence, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

\( y = -16 + (-8)x \)
\( y = -16 - 8x \)

However, the function should better be written in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) as the task specifies, which simplifies to:

\( y = -16x^0 - 8x^1 \)

With \( x^0 = 1 \) and \( x^1 = x \), the final function is:

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is 1 for any x except for x = 0, we need to figure out the values of a and b that fit the given input-output pairs.

Given the pairs:
(11, -204), (-4, 66), (-17, 300), (-15, 264), (20, -366),

we can set up a system of equations based on these pairs. For each pair (x, y), we have:

y = a + bx

By substituting in the values, we get:

-204 = a + b(11)
66 = a - b(4)
300 = a - b(17)
264 = a - b(15)
-366 = a + b(20)

Now, let's solve this system. We can start by trying to eliminate one of the variables. However, since we have more than two equations, it is not a simple matter of just subtracting one equation from another to eliminate a variable.

We can use the method of least squares or other numerical approaches to find the best fit line, but here we need to recognize a pattern or simplify the equations.

To find the pattern, let's look at the differences between the y values for consecutive inputs:

66 - (-204) = 270 (for inputs -4 and 11)
300 - 66 = 234 (for inputs -17 and -4)
264 - 300 = -36 (for inputs -15 and -17)
-366 - 264 = -630 (for inputs 20 and -15)

Looking at the changes in x:
11 - (-4) = 15
-4 - (-17) = 13
-15 - (-17) = 2
20 - (-15) = 35

We divide the change in output by the change in input to see if there's a consistent rate (b):
270 / 15 = 18
234 / 13 = 18
-36 / 2 = -18
-630 / 35 = -18

So, it appears that the b value (slope) is -18, as adding inputs results in a decrease of outputs at a consistent rate per unit x when moving from one pair to the next. However, the fact that we have both -18 and 18 here suggests that the b value should be -18 because increasing x leads to decreasing y.

So we can conclude that b = -18.

Now using one of the equations to find a:

66 = a - b(4)
66 = a - (-18)(4)
66 = a + 72
a = 66 - 72
a = -6

So the function that describes the data is:

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to solve for the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\). The given form simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), because \(x^0 = 1\) no matter the value of \(x\) (except for \(x = 0\)). Thus, the equation simplifies to the linear form \( y = a + bx \).

To find these coefficients, we will use two of the given data points to set up a system of linear equations. Let's use the points (11, -204) and (20, -366).

For input 11, output -204:
\( -204 = a + 11b \)  (1)

For input 20, output -366:
\( -366 = a + 20b \)  (2)

Now we need to solve this system of equations for \(a\) and \(b\).

First, let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

\( -366 - (-204) = a + 20b - (a + 11b) \)
\( -366 + 204 = 20b - 11b \)
\( -162 = 9b \)
\( b = -162 / 9 \)
\( b = -18 \)

Now that we have \(b\), we can solve for \(a\) using either of the original equations. Let's use equation (1):

\( -204 = a + 11(-18) \)
\( -204 = a - 198 \)
\( a = -204 + 198 \)
\( a = -6 \)

So, the coefficients are \(a = -6\) and \(b = -18\), and the function is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first need to recognize that this is a linear function of the form y = b * x + a, since x^0 is always 1 and x^1 is simply x. 

We will now use two points from the given data to solve for the coefficients a and b. Let's choose the points (11, -204) and (-4, 66).

Using these two points, we create two equations based on the form y = bx + a:

For the point (11, -204):
-204 = b*11 + a  ... (1)

For the point (-4, 66):
66 = b*(-4) + a  ... (2)

Now, let's solve these two equations:

From equation (1):
-204 = 11b + a  ... (3)

From equation (2):
66 = -4b + a  ... (4)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's subtract equation (4) from equation (3):

-204 - 66 = 11b - (-4b)
-270 = 11b + 4b
-270 = 15b
b = -270 / 15
b = -18

Now we can use the value of b to find a by plugging it into equation (3) or (4), I'll use equation (3):

-204 = 11*(-18) + a
-204 = -198 + a
a = -204 + 198

    To derive a function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we can notice that the term ax^0 is essentially a constant (since any number raised to the 0 power is 1). This means the function we are looking for is essentially a linear function of the form y = a + bx, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope.

Let's consider two pairs of points to formulate two equations to solve for a and b:

1. Using the inputs 11 and -4:

For the point (11, -204):
-204 = a + 11b

2. Subtract the second equation from the first one to eliminate a and solve for b:

We need to derive a function of the form:

This can be simplified to:

y = a + bx

Now, let's use two of the data points to solve for a and b. I will choose the points (11, -204) and (-4, 66) for this purpose. Plugging these into the equation gives us two separate equations:

-204 = a + 11b (1)
66 = a - 4b (2)

Now, let's solve this system of linear equations for a and b.

Multiplying equation (2) by 11 to eliminate a, we get:

726 = 11a - 44b (3)

Now, adding equation (1) to equation (3) cancels out a:

-204 + 726 = a + 11b + 11a - 44b
522 = 12a - 33b
12a = 522 + 33b
a = (522 + 33b) / 12 (4)

Now, we can take this expression for a and substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find b. I will substitute it into equation (2):

And we need to find a function of the form:

\[ y = a \cdot x^0 + b \cdot x^1 \]

which simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

because \(x^0\) is 1 for any x other than 0.

To find the best values of \(a\) and \(b\), we would typically use a method such as linear regression. However, given the format of the task and the method of communication here, we need a manual calculation or an educated guess to find the solution.

Considering the question is designed for a pattern recognition system, this means this isn’t a linear system since the linear regression would generally not pass through every point in the given dataset as we have more than two points.

However, let's attempt to calculate this linearly assuming it's a simple system. We can use two points to define a line. Let's use the first two given points (-12, 9) and (20, -55) to find the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\).

Using the two-point form of the line equation:

\[ y - y_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1) \]

Plugging in our two points:

\[ y - 9 = \frac{-55 - 9}{20 - (-12)}(x - (-12)) \]
\[ y - 9 = \frac{-64}{32}(x + 12) \]
\[ y - 9 = -2(x + 12) \]
\[ y = -2x - 24 + 9 \]
\[ y = -2x - 15 \]

Therefore, using the points (-12, 9) and (20, -55), our function is:

\[ y = -15 + (-2)x \]

In the desired format, it becomes:

\[ y = -15 \cdot x^0 - 2 \cdot x^1 \]

However, this function is very unlikely to fit all other given points since we just used two points to draw the line, and a straight line cannot typically pass through more than two points unless all the points are perfectly collinear, which they are not in most real-world cases. 

For the most accurate representation considering all five points in the dataset, a higher-degree polynomial or a different type of model would likely be necessary, and the line described above would be an approximation. For the purpose of the task as presented, let's use this approximation:

    To find a function that describes the given input-output pairs, we need to find the coefficients `a` and `b` in the equation `y = ax^0 + bx^1` that best fit these pairs. Since `x^0` is always 1, the equation simplifies to `y = a + bx`. This is a linear equation of the form `y = mx + c`, where `m` is the slope and `c` is the y-intercept.

Let’s use two pairs of points to solve for `a` and `b`. Taking two input-output pairs, for instance (-12, 9) and (20, -55), we can set up two equations:

1. For (-12, 9):  9 = a - 12b
2. For (20, -55): -55 = a + 20b

Now we have a system of linear equations:

9 = a - 12b
-55 = a + 20b

Let's solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we can quickly use elimination:

Adding both equations:

9 + (-55) = a - 12b + a + 20b
-46 = 2a + 8b
-23 = a + 4b ... [Equation 3]

Now let's solve Equation 3 for `a`:

a = -23 - 4b

Substitute `a` into one of the original equations (we’ll use the first one):

9 = (-23 - 4b) - 12b
9 = -23 - 4b - 12b
9 = -23 - 16b
9 + 23 = -16b
32 = -16b
b = -32/16
b = -2

Now let’s solve for `a` using `b = -2` in Equation 3:

a = -23 - 4(-2)
a = -23 + 8
a = -15

So the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, based on the two points we chose, is:

y = -15 + (-2)x

9 = a - 12b
-55 = a + 20b

Solving for a from the first equation:
a = 9 + 12b

Substituting this into the second equation:
-55 = (9 + 12b) + 20b
-55 = 9 + 32b
-64 = 32b
b = -64 / 32
b = -2

Now we substitute the value of b back into the equation for a:
a = 9 + 12(-2)
a = 9 - 24
a = -15

So our estimated function would be:
y = -15 + (-2)x

In the exact form requested: y = -15x^0 - 2x^1.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are essentially looking for a linear function of the form y = b * x + a, because x^0 is always 1 (for any x except x = 0) and x^1 is just x. Our task is to determine the values of constants a and b that fit the data provided in the inputs and outputs.

Given the pairs of input/output:

(-12, 9)
(20, -55)
(-4, -7)
(-10, 5)
(8, -31)

We can set up two equations using two pairs of inputs/outputs to solve for a and b. Let's use the first two pairs:

1) For input -12, output 9:
9 = a * (-12)^0 + b * (-12)
9 = a - 12b

2) For input 20, output -55:
-55 = a * 20^0 + b * 20
-55 = a + 20b

We now have a system of two equations:
a - 12b = 9
a + 20b = -55

Let's solve this system for a and b:

From the first equation a = 9 + 12b
Plugging this into the second equation we get:
9 + 12b + 20b = -55
32b = -55 - 9
32b = -64
b = -64 / 32
b = -2

Now we can solve for a using the b we just found:
a - 12*(-2) = 9
a + 24 = 9
a = 9 - 24
a = -15

So the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is y = -15 * x^0 - 2 * x^1 or, simplified:

    To find a function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the provided data points, we will be solving for the constants a and b. The term ax^0 equals a, since any number raised to the power of zero is 1.

So, the function simplifies to: y = a + bx

Let's use two of the given input-output pairs to set up a system of equations and solve for a and b.

Choosing the pairs (-12, 9) and (20, -55):

1) For input -12 and output 9:
9 = a + b(-12)
9 = a - 12b

2) For input 20 and output -55:
-55 = a + b(20)
-55 = a + 20b

Now we have the following system of equations:

a - 12b = 9       (1)
a + 20b = -55     (2)

We can solve for a and b using the elimination method, by adding equations (1) and (2):

(a - 12b) + (a + 20b) = 9 - 55
2a + 8b = -46
a + 4b = -23       (3)

Now, let's use equation (1) to express a in terms of b:

a - 12b = 9
a = 9 + 12b        (4)

Substitute (4) into (3):

9 + 12b + 4b = -23
9 + 16b = -23
16b = -23 - 9
16b = -32
b = -32 / 16
b = -2

Now that we have b, we can find a using equation (4):

a = 9 + 12(-2)
a = 9 - 24
a = -15

So, the function that best describes the relationship between the given inputs and outputs is:

y = a + bx
y = -15 - 2x

Therefore, the function in the exact form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

    The given data points suggest a linear relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). A linear function can be written in the form of y = ax + b, where a is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since the provided form is y = ax^0 + bx^1, it's equivalent to y = bx + a because x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0 and bx^1 is just bx. This form implies that a is the y-intercept and b is the slope.

To find the coefficients a (y-intercept) and b (slope), we can use two data points to set up a system of linear equations. After solving the system, we can determine the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a). Let's use the two data points (-16, 82) and (14, -98) for this calculation.

For the point (-16, 82):
82 = b(-16) + a  ... (1)

For the point (14, -98):
-98 = b(14) + a  ... (2)

We can solve this system of equations to determine a and b.

In equation (1):
82 = -16b + a  ... (3)

In equation (2):
-98 = 14b + a  ... (4)

Multiply equation (3) by 14 and equation (4) by 16 to eliminate a by adding the equations:

14(82) = 14(-16b) + 14a  =>  1148 = -224b + 14a  ... (5)
16(-98) = 16(14b) + 16a  => -1568 = 224b + 16a  ... (6)

By adding equation (5) and (6):
1148 - 1568 = (-224b + 224b) + (14a + 16a)
-420 = 30a
a = -420 / 30
a = -14

Now, we know the value of a. Let's find b by substituting the value of a into equation (3) or (4):

82 = -16b - 14 (using equation (3))
96 = -16b
b = 96 / -16
b = -6

Therefore, the linear function that best describes the given data is:

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to recognize that \( ax^0 \) is equivalent to a constant since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x value that isn't zero. Therefore, the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) essentially simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), where \( a \) is the y-intercept and \( b \) is the slope of the line.

Given the data points, we can use two of them to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the points (-16, 82) and (14, -98):

For point (-16, 82):
\( 82 = a + b(-16) \) ... (1)

For point (14, -98):
\( -98 = a + b(14) \) ... (2)

Now we have a system of equations that we can solve:

(1) -> \( 82 = a - 16b \)
(2) -> \( -98 = a + 14b \)

To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. I will choose the method of elimination:

Multiply equation (1) by 14 and equation (2) by 16:

\( 14 \times 82 = 14a - 16b \times 14 \)
\( 16 \times -98 = 16a + 14b \times 16 \)

This results in:

\( 1148 = 14a - 224b \) ... (3)
\( -1568 = 16a + 224b \) ... (4)

Adding equations (3) and (4) to eliminate \( b \):

\( -420 = 30a \)
\( a = -420 / 30 \)
\( a = -14 \)

Now substitute \( a \) into equation (1):

\( 82 = -14 - 16b \)
\( 96 = -16b \)
\( b = 96/-16 \)
\( b = -6 \)

    Given the pairings of inputs and outputs, we want to identify the values of \(a\) and \(b\) in the function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\) that describes the relationship between them. Here \(ax^0\) is equal to \(a\) because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1, making it a constant term. The term \(bx^1\) is equivalent to \(bx\), as anything raised to the power of 1 is itself. We are therefore looking for a linear function \(y = a + bx\).

To identify the values of \(a\) and \(b\), let's use the provided input-output pairs to generate a system of equations. Choosing two pairs to form two equations:

1. Using the input-output pair (-16, 82):
\[a + b(-16) = 82\]

2. Using the input-output pair (14, -98):
\[a + b(14) = -98\]

We now solve this system of equations for \(a\) and \(b\). Multiplying the first equation by 14 and the second equation by 16 to eliminate \(a\) when we add the equations:

\[14a - 16b(14) = 14(82)\]
\[16a + 16b(14) = 16(-98)\]

Adding these equations gives us:

\[14a - 16b(14) + 16a + 16b(14) = 14(82) + 16(-98)\]
\[30a = 14(82) - 16(98)\]
\[30a = 1148 - 1568\]
\[30a = -420\]
\[a = -420 / 30\]
\[a = -14\]

Now, take the value of \(a\) and substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for \(b\):

\[-14 - 16b = 82\]
\[-16b = 82 + 14\]
\[-16b = 96\]
\[b = 96 / (-16)\]
\[b = -6\]

    To find the values of a and b that define the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, which describes the relationship between the given inputs (x) and the corresponding outputs (y), we need to use two points to create a system of equations. This function is a straight line where ax^0 is equivalent to a (since x^0 is always 1) and bx^1 is equivalent to bx. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Here are two points from the given data:

1. x = -16, y = 82
2. x = -11, y = 52

Let's use these points to create two equations:

1. When x = -16, y = 82: 82 = a + b(-16)
2. When x = -11, y = 52: 52 = a + b(-11)

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. a - 16b = 82
2. a - 11b = 52

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:
( a - 16b ) - ( a - 11b) = 82 - 52
-16b + 11b = 30
-5b = 30
b = -6

Now we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into either of the equations to find the value of a. Let's use the second equation:

If we can find a consistent rate of change between the inputs and outputs, we can determine \( b \), the slope of the line that this linear function represents. Then we can find \( a \), which is the y-intercept.

Let's compute the change between two given points and see if there is a consistent rate of change:

For the input/output pairs \((-16, 82)\) and \((-11, 52)\), the rate of change is:
\[ (52 - 82) / (-11 + 16) = (-30) / (5) = -6 \]

Let's verify if this rate of change holds for other pairs. For \((-18, 94)\) and \((-16, 82)\):
\[ (82 - 94) / (-16 + 18) = (-12) / (2) = -6 \]

It appears that the rate of change \( b \) between outputs and inputs is consistent at \( -6 \). Now we should find \( a \) by using one of the input/output pairs:

Let's take the input/output pair \((-16, 82)\) to solve for \( a \). Plugging these values into the equation gives us:

    Based on the inputs and outputs provided, we can deduce that there is a linear relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). However, with only a few points, it is not possible to use linear regression with absolute certainty. However, given that we are asked to write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is the same as y = a + bx (since x^0 = 1 for any x that isn't zero), we can proceed by attempting to find a and b that fit the given data points.

Let's analyze the given input-output pairs to find a pattern:

1. For input -18:
   y = -75
   -75 = a -18b

2. For input -1:
   y = -7
   -7 = a - b

3. For input 3:
   y = 9
   9 = a + 3b

4. For input 2:
   y = 5
   5 = a + 2b

The input-output pair (-18, -75) is given twice, which doesn't provide us with any additional information. We have three unique equations for three different inputs. Let's try to solve these equations simultaneously to find a consistent a and b. If we cannot solve them consistently, the set of points likely does not represent a function of this form, or there might be an error in one or more points.

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives:
-75 - (-7) = a - 18b - (a - b)
-68 = -17b
b = 4

Now we can substitute the value of b into the second equation to find a:
-7 = a - 4
a = -3

Now we have a and b, let's write the function:
y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -3 + 4x

However, to confirm, let's check the third and fourth point:

For x = 3 (third point):
y = -3 + 4(3)
y = -3 + 12
y = 9 (which matches the output)

For x = 2 (fourth point):
y = -3 + 4(2)
y = -3 + 8
y = 5 (which matches the output)

Function: y = -3 + 4x

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of 'a' and 'b' that work for all given inputs and outputs. The ax^0 term simplifies to 'a' since any number to the power of zero is 1.

Let's rearrange the equation to the following form, which is equivalent:

y = a + bx

Now let's use two points given to solve for 'a' and 'b'. We will use the points (6, 74) and (-5, -25).

For input 6:
74 = a + b(6)

For input -5:
-25 = a + b(-5)

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1) 74 = 6b + a
2) -25 = -5b + a

We can solve this system by subtracting the second equation from the first:

(74 - (-25)) = (6b + a) - (-5b + a)
99 = 11b

Now, divide both sides by 11 to solve for 'b':

b = 99 / 11
b = 9

Now that we have 'b', we can substitute it back into either equation to solve for 'a'. Let's use the first equation:

74 = 6(9) + a
74 = 54 + a
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

Now we have determined that 'a' = 20 and 'b' = 9. The function is:

y = 20 + 9x

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to figure out the constants \( a \) and \( b \) such that they satisfy the given input-output pairs.

Given the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), this simplifies to:

\( y = a + bx \) (since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x)

Now let's plug in the inputs (x) and outputs (y) that we have:

For input 6:
\( 74 = a + 6b \)

For input 19:
\( 191 = a + 19b \)

\( -79 = a - 11b \)

For input -5:
\( -25 = a - 5b \)

For input -10:
\( -70 = a - 10b \)

We have a system of linear equations. To find \( a \) and \( b \), we can use any two of the equations and solve them simultaneously. Let's use the first two equations:

1. \( 74 = a + 6b \)
2. \( 191 = a + 19b \)

If we subtract equation 1 from equation 2, we eliminate \( a \) and get:

\( 191 - 74 = (a + 19b) - (a + 6b) \)
\( 117 = 13b \)
\( b = 117 / 13 \)
\( b = 9 \)

Let's plug the value of \( b \) back into the first equation:

\( 74 = a + 6 * 9 \)
\( 74 = a + 54 \)
\( a = 74 - 54 \)
\( a = 20 \)

    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs with a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can observe that ax^0 is equal to a since any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx, which is a linear equation. 

We can determine the constants a and b by using two of the given input-output pairs to set up a system of equations. Let's use the input-output pairs (6, 74) and (19, 191):

For input 6:
a + 6b = 74     (1)

For input 19:
a + 19b = 191   (2)

Now, we can solve this system for a and b.

First, let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a:

(19b - 6b) = (191 - 74)
13b = 117
b = 9

Now that we have the value for b, we can use it to find a using either equation (1) or (2). Let's use equation (1):

a + 6b = 74
a + 6*9 = 74
a + 54 = 74
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

    To find a function describing the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), and based on the given input-output pairs, we suspect a linear relationship since the function requested is in the form of a line: y = ax^0 + bx^1.

This simplifies to:
y = a + bx
since x^0 is 1 for any x except for x = 0.

From the given pairs, we can see that the input is multiplied by 10 and then added or subtracted by a certain number to get the output. To solve for 'a' and 'b' we need at least two pairs of inputs and outputs. Looking at the given pairs, let's consider the first two:

1. For input 6, output 74:
74 = a + 6b

2. For input 19, output 191:
191 = a + 19b

We now have a system of linear equations and can solve for 'a' and 'b'.

Subtracting the first equation from the second should help us find 'b':
(191 - 74) = (a + 19b) - (a + 6b)
117 = 13b
b = 117 / 13
b = 9

We can now plug in the value of 'b' into one of our original equations to find 'a'. Using the first equation:

Thus, \( x^0 = 1 \). So, the equation simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Now, let's use the given input-output pairs to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \).

Using the input 6 and output 74, we get:
\( 74 = a + 6b \) ... (1)

Using the input 19 and output 191, we get:

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, note that ax^0 is a constant term because any number x raised to the power of 0 equals 1. If we denote ax^0 as c (where c is a constant), the function simplifies to y = c + bx^1, which further simplifies to y = c + bx since x^1 is just x.

To find the values of c and b, we can use two points from the given data and solve the system of equations. Let's use the points (6, 8) and (-5, -25).

Using the point (6, 8):

8 = c + 6b  (1)

Using the point (-5, -25):

-25 = c - 5b  (2)

Now, we solve for c and b by using these two equations. Let's multiply equation (2) by -1 to make it easier to eliminate c:

25 = -c + 5b  (3)

Now, add equation (3) to equation (1):

8 + 25 = c + 6b - c + 5b

    To determine the coefficients a and b for the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to observe the pattern of inputs and outputs provided. The ax^0 term is equivalent to a, since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. The bx^1 term is simply bx, since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself. We can therefore rewrite the function as y = a + bx.

Let's look at the given inputs and outputs to identify a pattern:

1. When x = 6, y = 8
2. When x = -5, y = -25
3. When x = -3, y = -19
4. When x = -10, y = -40
5. When x = -14, y = -52

We notice that when x increases or decreases, y changes in what seems to be a linear fashion.

To find the coefficient b, let's look at the changes in y when x changes:

From (2) to (1), x increases by 11 (from -5 to 6), and y increases by 33 (from -25 to 8). So for each increase of 1 in x, y increases by 33/11 which is 3. This suggests that b = 3.

To confirm this, let's use another pair of points. From (4) to (3), x increases by 7 (from -10 to -3), and y increases by 21 (from -40 to -19), which also gives us b = 3.

Now we just need to find the value of a. Using the point (1) where x = 6 and y = 8:

    To determine the constants a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find a relationship that explains all the given input-output pairs. The term ax^0 corresponds to a constant term since x^0 is always 1 for any x not equal to zero.

Let's use two pairs of data points to determine a and b:

Using the input-output pair (-5, -25):
\-25 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)
-25 = a + (-5b)
-25 = a - 5b ...(1)

Using the input-output pair (6, 8):
8 = a(6)^0 + b(6)
8 = a + 6b ...(2)

Now, we have a system of two equations (1) and (2):

-25 = a - 5b
8 = a + 6b

Let's solve this system for a and b.

Adding these two equations:

-25 + 8 = a - 5b + a + 6b
-17 = 2a + b
b = -17 - 2a ...(3)

Substitute equation (3) into equation (2):

8 = a + 6(-17 - 2a)
8 = a - 102 - 12a
8 = -102 - 11a
11a = -102 - 8
11a = -110
a = -110 / 11
a = -10

    To find a function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we need to determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) that make the function fit the given input-output pairs. 

Given the data, we can notice that the output seems to decrease by a consistent amount when the input decreases. This suggests a linear relationship. We can use two sets of points to determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\).

Let's use the input-output pairs \((-5, -25)\) and \( (6, 8) \) to set up two equations.

For the input -5 and output -25:
\[
-25 = a(-5)^0 + b(-5)^1

\[

\]

For the input 6 and output 8:
\[
8 = a(6)^0 + b(6)^1
\]
\[
8 = a + 6b
\]

Now, we have two simultaneous equations that we can solve for \(a\) and \(b\):

1. \(a - 5b = -25\)
2. \(a + 6b = 8\)

We can solve these equations using the method of addition. Multiply the first equation by 6 and the second equation by 5 to eliminate \(a\):

\(6a - 30b = -150\)
\(5a + 30b = 40\)

Adding these equations gives us:
\(11a = -110\)
\(a = -110 / 11\)
\(a = -10\)

Now we can substitute \(a = -10\) into one of the original equations to find \(b\). Using the second equation:

\(-10 + 6b = 8\)

\(6b = 18\)

4. (-10, -40)
5. (-14, -52)

We can notice a pattern in the outputs relative to the inputs that all outputs are indeed multiples of the inputs and are also offset by some constant amount.

Let's consider the second point (-5, -25) and the third point (-3, -19) to find out the pattern. If we assume the relationship is linear, then the change in output divided by the change in input between two data points should give us the slope \( b \) of the function.

For the two points (-5, -25) and (-3, -19):
Change in output (Δy) = -19 - (-25) = -19 + 25 = 6

We can use two points to determine the values of a and b. Let's take the points (9, 29) and (2, 8).

For the first point (9, 29):
29 = a + b*9

For the second point (2, 8):
8 = a + b*2

We have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for a and b using these two equations:

From the second equation:
8 = a + 2b  -> Equation 1

Subtract Equation 1 from the first equation:
29 - 8 = a + 9b - (a + 2b)
21 = 7b
b = 21 / 7
b = 3

Now we have the value for b, so we can solve for a using Equation 1:
8 = a + 2*3
8 = a + 6
a = 8 - 6
a = 2

Now that we have a and b, we can write the function:
y = a + bx
y = 2 + 3x

So the function in the exact form as requested is:
Output: y = 2x^0 + 3x^1

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given input-output pairs, we first recognize that ax^0 is effectively a constant (since any nonzero number to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is a term with a variable directly proportional to x. Essentially, we are looking for a linear function of the form:

y = a + bx

where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the line. With the given points, we can create a system of equations and solve for a and b.

For the point (9, 29), the equation is:
29 = a + b(9)

For the point (2, 8), the equation is:
8 = a + b(2)

We can use these two equations to solve for a and b. Let's call these Equation 1 and Equation 2, respectively:

Equation 1: 29 = a + 9b
Equation 2: 8 = a + 2b

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate a:

(29 - 8) = (a + 9b) - (a + 2b)
21 = 7b

Now, we solve for b:

b = 21 / 7
b = 3

Now, we can substitute b back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find a. Let's use Equation 2:

8 = a + 3(2)
8 = a + 6
a = 8 - 6
a = 2

Now that we have both a and b, we can write our function:

y = a + bx
y = 2 + 3x

This function should fit all the given points, and in the requested format y = ax^0 + bx^1, it would be:

y = 2x^0 + 3x^1

    To create a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to identify the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that make the function fit the given input-output pairs. We know that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) (excluding \( x = 0 \)), and \( x^1 = x \). Therefore, the function reduces to \( y = a + bx \).

We can use two points to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \).

For instance, let's take the input-output pairs (2, 8) and (-1, -1):

1. For the input 2, the output 8 gives us the equation \( 8 = a + 2b \).
2. For the input -1, the output -1 gives us the equation \( -1 = a - b \).

Now, let's solve for \( a \) and \( b \):
From the second equation, we can express \( a \) in terms of \( b \):
\[ a = -1 + b \]

Substitute this expression for \( a \) in the first equation:
\[ 8 = (-1 + b) + 2b \]
\[ 8 = b + 2b - 1 \]
\[ 8 + 1 = 3b \]
\[ 9 = 3b \]
\[ b = 3 \]

Now solve for \( a \) using the value of \( b \):

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Let's consider the general form of the function you've requested:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Since x^0 equals 1 for any x (except for x=0):

y = a*1 + bx
y = a + bx

Now, we need to determine the constants a and b that will define the function based on your data points. With two parameters to determine, we typically need two data points to solve for both. Here, you've provided five data points which usually means an exact solution may not exist due to potential inconsistencies or noise in the data. However, we will use the method to solve for a and b.

We are looking for 'a' and 'b' so that the following equations are satisfied based on the given inputs and outputs:

For input -16, output 109:
109 = a - 16b

For input -3, output 18:
18 = a - 3b

For input 2, output -17:
-17 = a + 2b

For input 12, output -87:
-87 = a + 12b

For input 5, output -38:
-38 = a + 5b

This is a system of linear equations. To solve for 'a' and 'b', we'd normally use two equations, but to account for more than two points, we can use linear regression or another method to find the best fit for this system. For the purpose of this explanation, I'll solve these equations with matrices or use a more straightforward approach that's consistent with how a pattern recognition system might work assuming no noise and perfect linearity: an exact solution. Let's use the first two to derive a possible function, then check if it holds true for the other points:

Equation 1:
109 = a - 16b

Equation 2:
18 = a - 3b

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

91 = -13b
b = -91/13
b = -7

Now that we have 'b', we substitute it back into one of the equations to solve for 'a':

18 = a - 3(-7)
18 = a + 21
a = 18 - 21
a = -3

So the function according to the first two points is:

y = -3 + (-7)x
y = -3 - 7x

Checking it against the other data points:

For input 2, output should be -17:
-17 = -3 - 7(2)
-17 = -17 (True)

For input 12, output should be -87:
-87 = -3 - 7(12)

    To derive the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 from the given data points, we must determine the values of a and b that satisfy the equation for all provided input-output pairs. In the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, ax^0 is constant because x^0 is always 1. Hence, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can now use the given input-output pairs to create a system of equations to solve for a and b. The input-output pairs given are:

1. For input -16, output 109: 109 = a + b(-16)
2. For input -3, output 18: 18 = a + b(-3)

4. For input 12, output -87: -87 = a + b(12)
5. For input 5, output -38: -38 = a + b(5)

Let's pick two pairs of points to solve for a and b:

Using points (-3, 18) and (2, -17):
18 = a - 3b (1)
-17 = a + 2b (2)

Let's multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 3 to eliminate a when we add the two equations:

36 = 2a - 6b (3)
-51 = 3a + 6b (4)

Adding (3) and (4):
-15 = 5a

Now, we solve for a:
a = -3

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for any x except for x=0), we need to figure out the values of a and b that make the function match the given input-output pairs. Since this form is a linear equation, we can use two points to solve for a and b.

Let's choose two of the given points to create a system of linear equations:

Using the points (x1, y1) = (-16, 109) and (x2, y2) = (2, -17):

1. 109 = a + b(-16)
2. -17 = a + b(2)

Solving the system:
From equation 1:
109 = a - 16b   =>    a = 109 + 16b  ...(3)

Now substitute a into equation 2 from equation 3:
-17 = (109 + 16b) + 2b
-17 = 109 + 18b
-17 - 109 = 18b
-126 = 18b
b = -126 / 18
b = -7

    To find out the function that describes the input-output relationship in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to realize that \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) (since any non-zero number to the power of 0 is 1), and \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \) (since any number to the power of 1 is itself). Thus, the function we are looking for is actually in the form of a simple linear function:

\( y = a + bx \)

Now, let's use two input-output pairs to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). It's easiest to choose pairs that might give us simple numbers. Looking at the provided data, let's use the input-output pairs (-3, 18) and (2, -17):

For the input -3 and output 18:
\( 18 = a + b(-3) \)
\( 18 = a - 3b \) --- (1)

For the input 2 and output -17:
\( -17 = a + b(2) \)
\( -17 = a + 2b \) --- (2)

Now, let's solve this system of two equations with two unknowns (a and b).

Multiply both sides of equation (2) by 3:
\( 3(-17) = 3a + 3(2b) \)
\( -51 = 3a + 6b \) --- (3)

Add equation (1) to equation (3):
\( (18) + (-51) = (a - 3b) + (3a + 6b) \)
\( -33 = 4a + 3b \)

Now, we can subtract equation (1) from the result:
\( (-33) - (18) = (4a + 3b) - (a - 3b) \)
\( -51 = 3a + 6b \) --- This is equation (3), which we have already used.

It appears we made an error in our calculations, as we derived equation (3) again. Let's correct the procedure by solving equations (1) and (2) correctly.

Let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
\( (-17) - (18) = (a + 2b) - (a - 3b) \)
\( -35 = 5b \)
\( b = -7 \)

Now, we can substitute \( b \) into either equation (1) or (2) to solve for \( a \). We'll use equation (1):

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to recognize that \( ax^0 = a \) because any number raised to the zero power is 1. So, the equation simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Given our inputs and outputs, we can create a system of equations to solve for \(a\) and \(b\). Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to create our system. For instance, we can use:

1. Using the point (-16, 109):
\[ a + b(-16) = 109 \]

2. Using the point (2, -17):
\[ a + b(2) = -17 \]

Now, let's solve this system. First, we can rewrite our equations:

1. \( -16b + a = 109 \)       [Equation 1]
2. \( 2b + a = -17 \)         [Equation 2]

Let's solve Equation 2 for \(a\):

\[ a = -17 - 2b \]           [Equation 3]

Next, we substitute Equation 3 back into Equation 1:

\[ -16b + (-17 - 2b) = 109 \]
\[ -18b - 17 = 109 \]
\[ -18b = 109 + 17 \]
\[ -18b = 126 \]
\[ b = -7 \]

    The function described follows a linear pattern, so it can be written in the form of a line equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, where a is the y-intercept when x=0, and b is the slope of the line.

Given that ax^0 is always a (since any number to the power of zero is 1), and bx^1 is simply bx, the form simplifies to y = a + bx. 

To find the values of a and b that describe the linear relationship between x (input) and y (output), we need to solve the system of linear equations using two of the provided input-output pairs. We can pick any two points to find the slope (b). Let's use the points (-9, 162) and (17, -254):

1) For x = -9: 162 = a + b(-9)
2) For x = 17: -254 = a + b(17)

Solve these two equations to find a and b:

From equation 1, we have:

From equation 2, we have:

    To determine the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we can observe that \(ax^0\) is essentially a constant because \(x^0 = 1\) for any x that is not zero. Thus, the function can be simplified to \(y = a + bx\). Our goal now is to find the constants \(a\) and \(b\) that fit the given input-output pairs.

We have the following pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y):

1. \(x = -9\),  \(y = 162\)
2. \(x = 17\), \(y = -254\)
3. \(x = -4\), \(y = 82\)
4. \(x = -18\), \(y = 306\)
5. \(x = -14\), \(y = 242\)

Looking at the inputs and outputs, we can see if there's a pattern that links the \(x\) values to the \(y\) values. Since \(y\) seems to be decreasing as \(x\) is increasing based on the first two points, and vice versa, as \(x\) decreases \(y\) increases, we are likely dealing with a negative slope that is linearly related. 

To find the specific values for \(a\) and \(b\), we must solve the linear equations based on the input-output pairs. However, we only need two pairs to solve the linear equation because a line is determined fully by two points.

Let's take the first and second pairs:

1. For \(x = -9\), \(y = 162\), we have \(162 = a - 9b\).
2. For \(x = 17\), \(y = -254\), we have \(-254 = a + 17b\).

Now we can solve this system of equations. Let's multiply the second equation by 9 and the first by 17 to eliminate \(a\):

1. \(17 * 162 = 17a - 153b\)
2. \(9 * -254 = 9a + 153b\)

Now, we sum both equations:

\(17 * 162 + 9 * -254 = 17a - 153b + 9a + 153b\)

After performing the multiplications:

\(2754 - 2286 = 26a\)

\(468 = 26a\)

\(a = \frac{468}{26} = 18\)

Now we have \(a\). To find \(b\), we can insert \(a\) into one of the original equations:

\(162 = 18 - 9b\)

\(144 = -9b\)

\(b = -\frac{144}{9} = -16\)

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we notice that ax^0 is a constant (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is a linear term (since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself). Our function will look like:

y = a + bx

We need to determine the values of a and b that make this function fit the given input-output pairs. Observing the pairs, it's evident that the output increases when the input is negative, suggesting that b is negative. Also, a seems to be affecting the intercept or the value of y when x is 0.

Let's assume a linear relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), and also note the symmetry in the growth of y concerning inputs - we can probably guess that since (x, y) pairs (-9, 162) and (-18, 306) are given, doubling the input (-9 to -18) seems to double the output (162 to 306); this symmetry suggests the slope (b) should be the same as the input since they scale equally.

Checking with the pair (x, y) = (-9, 162):

y = a + (-9)b
162 = a - 9b

Now using the pair (x, y) = (-18, 306):

y = a + (-18)b
306 = a - 18b

Solving the system of equations formed by these two pairs:

162 = a - 9b
306 = a - 18b

Subtract the first equation from the second one:

306 - 162 = a - 18b - (a - 9b)

144 = -9b
b = -16

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the pattern of the inputs (x) and their corresponding outputs (y), let's find the constants a and b that fit the relationship in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

First, let's examine the provided input-output pairs:

1. (-9, 162)
2. (17, -254)
3. (-4, 82)
4. (-18, 306)
5. (-14, 242)

Notice that ax^0 is just a because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Now, let's see if we can determine a pattern to derive a and b:

For the input -9 (where x = -9):
a + b(-9) = 162

For the input 17 (where x = 17):
a + b(17) = -254

Let's try to solve these two equations as a system to find a and b.

From the first equation, we can isolate a:
a = 162 + 9b   ---- (1)

Now, substituting for a in the second equation:
162 + 9b + 17b = -254
26b = -254 - 162
26b = -416
b = -416 / 26
b = -16

Now, let's substitute b back into equation (1) to find a:
a = 162 + 9(-16)
a = 162 - 144
a = 18

So the function that fits the given points is:
y = 18 - 16x

To ensure this function fits all the provided input-output pairs, test it with the other given points:

For x = -4:
y = 18 - 16(-4) 
y = 18 + 64 
y = 82

For x = -18:
y = 18 - 16(-18)
y = 18 + 288
y = 306

For x = -14:
y = 18 - 16(-14)
y = 18 + 224
y = 242

The function passes all the tests, so the final function describing the relationship is:

    To find a function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that fits the given inputs and outputs, we recognize that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any value of \( x \) (except for \( x = 0 \)), and \( x^1 = x \). Thus, the function simplifies to:

\( y = a + bx \)

To determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \), we can use any two points from the given inputs and outputs to set up a system of linear equations. Let's use the input-output pairs (-9, 162) and (17, -254) to derive the function.

For the input -9:

\( 162 = a + b(-9) \)
\( 162 = a - 9b \) ... (1)

For the input 17:

\( -254 = a + b(17) \)
\( -254 = a + 17b \) ... (2)

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) \( 162 = a - 9b \)
2) \( -254 = a + 17b \)

Subtract equation (1) from (2) to eliminate \( a \):

\( -254 - 162 = (a + 17b) - (a - 9b) \)

\( -416 = 26b \)

\( b = -416 / 26 \)

\( b = -16 \)

Now substitute \( b \) back into equation (1) to solve for \( a \):

\( 162 = a - 9(-16) \)

\( 162 = a + 144 \)

\( a = 162 - 144 \)

\( a = 18 \)

    To find a linear relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b. The function in the given form simplifies to:

y = a + bx

where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the line.

Given the pairs (x, y), we can set up a system of linear equations to solve for a and b:

1. 350 = a + b * 18
2. 230 = a + b * 12
3. -270 = a + b * (-13)
4. 70 = a + b * 4
5. 310 = a + b * 16

However, we need to use only two points to solve for a and b since more than two will generally result in an overdetermined system that might not have an exact solution.

Let's use the first two points to set up our system:

350 = a + 18b
230 = a + 12b

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:

120 = 6b

b = 120 / 6
b = 20

Now we need to find a by plugging b back into one of the initial equations:

230 = a + 12b
230 = a + 12*20
230 = a + 240

Now solving for a:

a = 230 - 240
a = -10

So the linear function that fits these points is:

y = -10 + 20x

Note that this function is based on the assumption that the relationship is perfectly linear and will capture exactly the given two points. To find the best fit for all given points, one would typically use a regression analysis, which might not return a perfect fit due to potential deviation from linearity or measurement errors. However, for the simple linear function as requested, the above equation is the one determined using the first two points.

    To come up with the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data points, we first need to understand the form of the function. The expression ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to a + bx, since any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

The job is to find the appropriate constants 'a' and 'b' such that the linear function y = a + bx approximates the given input-output pairs as closely as possible.

We can use two points to determine the linear function. Let's use the points (18, 350) and (12, 230).

The slope b can be computed as the change in y divided by the change in x:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (230 - 350) / (12 - 18)
b = (-120) / (-6)
b = 20

Now, we have y = a + 20x. We can solve for 'a' by plugging in one of the points. Let's use (12, 230):

230 = a + 20(12)
230 = a + 240
a = 230 - 240
a = -10

Therefore, the function that best captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -10 + 20x

Note, however, that this function doesn't exactly fit all the other given points, but it's the best linear estimate using the two chosen points. To fit all points exactly, a higher degree polynomial or other form of curve fitting would be required, and even then, some form of error metric would need to be applied to determine the ""best"" fit if the data is not perfectly linear.

    To find a linear relationship in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 = 1 for all x except 0), we can use two points to solve for a and b. Using any two distinct points:

Let's take the points (18, 350) and (12, 230).

We can set up two equations from these points:

1) 350 = a + b * 18
2) 230 = a + b * 12

Now we'll subtract the second equation from the first to solve for b:

350 - 230 = a + b * 18 - (a + b * 12)
120 = 18b - 12b
120 = 6b
b = 20

Using the value of b to solve for a, we can substitute b into either equation. I'll use the second equation:

230 = a + 20 * 12
230 = a + 240
a = 230 - 240
a = -10

    To derive the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 using the given data points, we have to determine the coefficients 'a' and 'b'. Here, x^0 is always equal to 1, because any number raised to the power of zero is 1. So our function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can find 'a' and 'b' by creating a system of linear equations based on the data points provided. For example:

Using the data point (18, 350):
350 = a + 18b

Using the data point (12, 230):
230 = a + 12b

We will use two of the data points to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Let's use the data points (18, 350) and (12, 230). Setting up the equations:

1) 350 = a + 18b
2) 230 = a + 12b

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which is equivalent to \( y = a + bx \) (since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x), we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the data given.

With two points, we could find the exact line that fits those two points, but since we are given more than two points, we aim for the best possible fit which may not pass exactly through all points (due to the possibility of noise or error in real-world data). However, in the context of this task, we will assume that there is a perfect fit.

Let's take two points from the data to calculate the slope (\(b\)):

Using the points (12, 230) and (16, 310), we can find the slope:

\[ b = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{310 - 230}{16 - 12} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \]

Now that we have \( b \), we can solve for \( a \) using one of the points. Let's use the point (12, 230):
