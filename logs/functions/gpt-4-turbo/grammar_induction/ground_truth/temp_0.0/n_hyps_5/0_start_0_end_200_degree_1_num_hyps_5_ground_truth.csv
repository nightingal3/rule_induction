"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) (which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x that is not zero), we need to find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the input-output pairs provided.

We can use two of the input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the following two pairs:

1) Input: \( -10 \), Output: \( -213 \)
2) Input: \( 20 \), Output: \( 387 \)

From input 1, we have the equation:
\( -213 = a + b(-10) \) or \( a - 10b = -213 \)

From input 2, we have the equation:
\( 387 = a + 20b \)

Now we solve the system of equations:

From equation 1:
\( a = -213 + 10b \) (1)

Substitute \( a \) into equation 2:
\( 387 = (-213 + 10b) + 20b \)
\( 387 = -213 + 30b \)
\( 600 = 30b \)
\( b = 20 \)

Now, we substitute \( b \) back into equation (1) to find \( a \):
\( a = -213 + 10(20) \)
\( a = -213 + 200 \)
\( a = -13 \)

The function that describes the relationship between input and output is:
\( y = -13 + 20x \)

Therefore, the function in the exact form requested is:
**Output: \( y = -13x^0 + 20x^1 \)**

    ","Using the function \( y = -13 + 20x \), we can calculate the output for the input 15:

\( y = -13 + 20(15) \)

\( y = 287 \)

Therefore, the output is:

    The function you've requested takes the form of a linear equation, y = ax^0 + bx^1. This simplifies to y = a + bx, since anything raised to the power of zero is 1 (x^0 = 1). Now, we need to determine the constants a and b that fit the provided inputs and outputs as best as possible.

Given a linear equation:
y = a + bx

Let's use two data points to solve for a and b. We'll take the inputs and outputs (-10, -213) and (9, 167) for this purpose. Substituting these values into the equation, we get two equations:

1. -213 = a - 10b
2. 167 = a + 9b

Now, we will solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

From equation 1:
a = -213 + 10b ... (3)

Substitute equation 3 into equation 2:
167 = (-213 + 10b) + 9b
167 = -213 + 19b
167 + 213 = 19b
380 = 19b
b = 380 / 19
b = 20

Now, put the value of b back into equation 3:
a = -213 + 10(20)
a = -213 + 200
a = -13

So the function that describes the data is:
y = -13 + 20x

Therefore, the function in the requested form is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \). Given that \( x^0 \) is always 1, we can rewrite the function as:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Based on the provided data points, we can set up a system of equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use two points to find the slope \( b \) first. For example, we can take the points (-10, -213) and (20, 387) to set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{387 - (-213)}{20 - (-10)} = b \]
\[ b = \frac{600}{30} = 20 \]

Now that we have \( b \), we can find \( a \) using one of the points. Let's use the point (4, 67):

\[ 67 = a + 20 \cdot 4 \]
\[ 67 = a + 80 \]
\[ a = 67 - 80 \]
\[ a = -13 \]

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we'll use the given form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since we have a linear relationship (given by the exponent 1 on the x term), we're essentially looking for the equation of a straight line, which is typically given as y = mx + c where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept. Given the form requested, a aligns with c (the y-intercept, since x^0 is 1) and b aligns with m (the slope).

Let's denote two pairs of input and output values as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Using these points, we can find the slope b of the line using the formula:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Let's use the pairs (-10, -213) and (20, 387) to calculate b:

b = (387 - (-213)) / (20 - (-10))
b = (387 + 213) / (30)
b = 600 / 30
b = 20

Now that we have b, we can find a by plugging one of the points and our found value of b back into the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1:

-213 = a(1) + 20(-10)
-213 = a - 200
a = -213 + 200
a = -13

So, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, we need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that best describe the given input-output pairs.

This equation is essentially a linear equation of the form \( y = mx + c \) where \( m \) is the slope and \( c \) is the y-intercept. Here, \( a \) corresponds to \( c \) (y-intercept) and \( b \) to \( m \) (slope).

Using two points from the given data, we can solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the points (-10, -213) and (20, 387) to establish a system of equations:

For the input -10:
\( -213 = a + b(-10) \)
\( -213 = a - 10b \) ... (1)

For the input 20:
\( 387 = a + b(20) \)
\( 387 = a + 20b \) ... (2)

Now, let's solve this system of equations. We can employ the method of elimination or substitution. 

If we add these two equations together, we can eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( b \):

\( (-213) + 387 = (a - 10b) + (a + 20b) \)
\( 174 = 2a + 10b \)
\( 87 = a + 5b \) ... (3)

Now we'll subtract equation (1) from (3) to solve for \( b \):

\( 87 - (-213) = (a + 5b) - (a - 10b) \)
\( 300 = 15b \)
\( b = 300 / 15 \)
\( b = 20 \)

Using \( b = 20 \) in equation (1), we can solve for \( a \):

\( -213 = a - 10(20) \)
\( -213 = a - 200 \)
\( a = -213 + 200 \)
\( a = -13 \)

Therefore, the function we are looking for is:
\[ y = -13 + 20x \]

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

    To find the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can note that since \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any \( x \) except for \( x = 0 \), the term involving \( ax^0 \) is simply a constant term \( a \). The term \( bx^1 \) is simply \( bx \). Therefore, the function we are looking for is linear and takes the form:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Given the inputs and outputs, we have the following system of equations:

1. For input -18: \( a - 18b = 339 \)
2. For input 0: \( a = -3 \) (This tells us directly that \( a = -3 \))
3. For input 5: \( -3 + 5b = -98 \)
4. For input -3: \( -3 - 3b = 54 \)
5. For input -16: \( -3 - 16b = 301 \)

We can use the value of \( a \) we obtained directly from the second equation to find \( b \). Let's use the third equation as an example:

\(-3 + 5b = -98 \)
\( 5b = -98 + 3 \)
\( 5b = -95 \)
\( b = -95 / 5 \)

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can recognize that any term involving x^0 is simply 1, as any number raised to the power of zero equals one. So, ax^0 is a constant term, let's call it c (where c = a). The term bx^1 is a linear term with respect to x, let's call the coefficient of x, b, the slope of the function. Thus, what we have is a linear function:

y = c + bx

To determine the constants c and b, we can use two points from the given data. Let's select the points (0, -3) and (-18, 339), which will give us two equations to solve for c and b.

For the input zero, the function simplifies to y = c because bx will be zero. Therefore, from the point (0, -3), we can directly find c:

-3 = c + b(0)
c = -3

Now, we have the value for c, it's time to find b using the point (-18, 339):

339 = c - 18b
Since we already found out that c = -3, we can substitute it in:

339 = -3 - 18b

Next, add 3 to both sides to isolate the term containing b:

339 + 3 = -18b
342 = -18b

Now divide both sides by -18 to solve for b:

342 / -18 = b
b = -19

Putting it all together, we get the final function:

y = -3 - 19x

    To determine the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can first recognize that in this expression \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because any number to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \). Our job is now to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that will satisfy the given input-output pairs.

We have the points \((-18, 339)\), \((0, -3)\), \((5, -98)\), \((−3, 54)\), and \((-16, 301)\) to use for this purpose.

We can immediately find \( a \) by looking at the input-output pair \((0, -3)\). This tells us when \( x=0 \), \( y=-3 \), so:

\[ -3 = a \]
\[ a = -3 \]

The values for \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy the given points are \( a = -3 \) and \( b = -19 \). Therefore, our function is:

Since you've provided multiple points, we'll use two points to determine the equation of the line and then check if this equation fits all the other points.

b = (Output2 - Output1) / (Input2 - Input1)
b = (-98 - (-3)) / (5 - 0)

Let's use two data points to determine a and b. We'll first use the points (5, -31) and (9, -51).

For the point (5, -31):

-31 = a + 5b
a = -31 - 5b ... (Equation 1)

For the point (9, -51):
-51 = a * 9^0 + b * 9

a = -51 - 9b ... (Equation 2)

We can now use these two equations to solve for a and b. By setting Equation 1 equal to Equation 2:

-31 - 5b = -51 - 9b
-31 + 51 = -9b + 5b
20 = -4b
b = -5

Now we can substitute b back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find a. Using Equation 1:

a = -31 - 5b
a = -31 - 5(-5)
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

Therefore, a is -6 and b is -5, so the function that describes the data is:

y = -6 + (-5)x
y = -5x - 6

We can use any two input-output pairs to solve for a and b, so let's use these two.

y = -6 * x^0 + (-5) * x^1
Which simplifies to:
y = -6 + (-5)x

Therefore, the function is y = -6 - 5x.

    To determine the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x values) and outputs (y values), we need to understand that the function is being requested in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is always 1 for any x that isn't zero, and x^1 is just x.

Now, we can use two of the provided input-output pairs to determine the values of a and b.

Let's pick the inputs 5 and 9 with their corresponding outputs -31 and -51.

For the input 5:
-31 = a + b(5)

For the input 9:
-51 = a + b(9)

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1) a + 5b = -31
2) a + 9b = -51

To solve for a and b, we subtract the first equation from the second:
(a + 9b) - (a + 5b) = -51 - (-31)
a + 9b - a - 5b = -51 + 31
4b = -20
b = -5

Now that we have the value for b, we can plug it back into one of the equations to solve for a. We'll use equation 1):
a + 5(-5) = -31
a - 25 = -31
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

Now we have both coefficients: a = -6 and b = -5. Thus, the function that describes the data is:
y = -6 + (-5)x
or simply:
y = -6 - 5x

    The given form y = ax^0 + bx^1 can be simplified as:

To determine the coefficients a and b, we can use two of the provided input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations. Let's choose the pairs (5, -31) and (9, -51):

For input 5: -31 = a + b(5)
For input 9: -51 = a + b(9)

Now we have two equations:

1. -31 = a + 5b
2. -51 = a + 9b

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

-51 - (-31) = a + 9b - (a + 5b)
-20 = 4b
b = -5

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into either equation to solve for a. We'll use the first equation:

-31 = a - 25
a = -31 + 25

Given that ax^0 is just a (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), our equations simplify to:

y = a + bx

We have the following pairs (x, y) from the inputs and outputs:

(7, -98)
(17, -218)
(5, -74)
(3, -50)
(-6, 58)

Let's use the pair (7, -98) and (17, -218) to set up two equations to solve for a and b:

For x=7, y=-98:
-98 = a + 7b  [Equation 1]

For x=17, y=-218:
-218 = a + 17b [Equation 2]

To find ""a"" and ""b"", we can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate ""a"" and solve for ""b"":

(-218) - (-98) = (a + 17b) - (a + 7b)
-218 + 98 = 17b - 7b
-120 = 10b
b = -120 / 10
b = -12

Now that we have ""b"", we can use it to find ""a"" using one of the initial equations. Let's use Equation 1:

-98 = a + 7(-12)
-98 = a - 84
a = -98 + 84

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we need to determine the constants a and b. Since ax^0 is a constant term (because any number to the zero power is 1), ax^0 will simply be a. Therefore, the function will simplify to y = a + bx.

Given that we have multiple pairs of inputs and outputs, we can form a system of equations to solve for a and b. Now, let's take two of the input-output pairs to form such equations. We’ll use the input-output pairs (7, -98) and (-6, 58):

For x = 7, y = -98: 
-98 = a + b(7)

For x = -6, y = 58:
58 = a + b(-6)

Now, we have a system of two linear equations:
1) a + 7b = -98
2) a - 6b = 58

To solve for a and b, let's subtract the second equation from the first one:

(1) - (2) =>
(a + 7b) - (a - 6b) = -98 - 58
a + 7b - a + 6b = -156
13b = -156
b = -156 / 13
b = -12

Now we have the value for b. We can insert it back into either the first or second equation to find a. We'll use the first equation:

a + 7(-12) = -98
a - 84 = -98
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

So the function that describes the relationship is y = -14 + (-12)x, or y = -14 - 12x.

To find the coefficients a and b, we can use two input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations. Let's use the pairs (7, -98) and (-6, 58):

1. For input 7: -98 = a + 7b
2. For input -6: 58 = a - 6b

Now, we solve this system of equations for a and b. We can use various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. I will use the substitution method here.

First, we'll solve the first equation for a:

a = -98 - 7b

Now, we substitute this into the second equation:

58 = (-98 - 7b) - 6b
58 = -98 - 13b
58 + 98 = -13b
156 = -13b
b = -156 / 13
b = -12

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into the equation for a:

a = -14

The function that describes the data is therefore y = -14 + (-12)x, or more simply:

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that relates the given inputs (x) to the outputs (y), we will first note that ax^0 is equivalent to a, because any number (except zero) raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Our goal is to determine the values of a and b that will satisfy the given input-output pairs. We will take two of the pairs and form a system of equations to solve for a and b.

Let's take the pairs (7, -98) and (-6, 58):

For the pair (7, -98):
-98 = a + b(7)

For the pair (-6, 58):
58 = a + b(-6)

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1) a + 7b = -98
2) a - 6b = 58

We can solve this system of equations by using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
(1) - (2): (a + 7b) - (a - 6b) = -98 - 58
a + 7b - a + 6b = -156
13b = -156

Now divide both sides by 13:
b = -156 / 13
b = -12

Now let's use b = -12 in one of the original equations to solve for a. We'll use equation 1:

a + 7(-12) = -98
a - 84 = -98
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

Thus, the coefficients of the function are a = -14 and b = -12. The function is:

    Given the data points and the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, let's determine the values of 'a' and 'b'.

The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx, because x^0 is always 1 for any x ≠ 0.

We can use the given data points to set up the following equations:

For input 7, output -98: -98 = a + b(7)
For input 17, output -218: -218 = a + b(17)
For input 5, output -74: -74 = a + b(5)
For input 3, output -50: -50 = a + b(3)
For input -6, output 58: 58 = a + b(-6)

We have more equations than variables, which is generally a sign of an overdetermined system that may not have an exact solution unless the data fits perfectly. In this case, we will use two of these equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'. A common approach is to choose two of the points and solve the resulting system of linear equations.

Let's use the points (7, -98) and (-6, 58) to set up the following system:

-98 = a + 7b          (1)
58 = a - 6b           (2)

We can solve this system by multiplying equation (2) by 1 and adding it to equation (1):

-98 = a + 7b         (1)
58 = a - 6b          (2)
-------------------
-40 = 2a + b        (3)

Now we can solve equation (3) for 'a':

-40 = 2a + b
2a = -40 - b  
a = (-40 - b)/2        (4)

Next, we can use one of the original equations to solve for 'b'. Let's use equation (1).

-98 = a + 7b        
Substitute the expression for 'a' from equation (4) into this equation:

-98 = (-40 - b)/2 + 7b        
-98 = -20 - (1/2)b + 7b       
-78 = (13/2)b       
b = -78 * (2/13)       
b = -12       

Using the value for 'b', we can solve for 'a' with equation (4):

a = (-40 - b)/2        
a = (-40 - (-12))/2        
a = (-40 + 12)/2        
a = -28/2        
a = -14       

So the function that best fits the given data points would be:

y = a + bx

Observing the outputs, it seems that there is a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. The term ax^0 is simply a since x^0 = 1 for any x. The term bx^1 is just bx. So the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

Since both equal a, we can set them equal to each other:

-197 + 13b = 83 - 7b

Now we solve for b:

20b = 280
b = 14

Now we can use the value of b to solve for a using one of the equations above, let's use equation 2:

83 = a + 14(7)
83 = a + 98
a = 83 - 98
a = -15

So, the function that describes the data provided is:

y = -15 + 14x

    To determine the coefficients $a$ and $b$ for the function $y = ax^0 + bx^1$, we can use two of the given points to set up a system of equations since $x^0 = 1$ and $x^1 = x$. This simplifies the function to:

$y = a + bx$

Let's use the points (9, 160) and (13, 228).

For the input 9:
$160 = a + b \cdot 9$

For the input 13:
$228 = a + b \cdot 13$

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) $160 = a + 9b$
2) $228 = a + 13b$

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second to eliminate $a$ and solve for $b$:

$(228 - 160) = (a + 13b) - (a + 9b)$
$68 = 4b$
$b = \frac{68}{4}$
$b = 17$

Now, substitute the value of $b$ back into either of the original equations to find $a$. We'll use the first equation:

$160 = a + 9 \cdot 17$
$160 = a + 153$
$a = 160 - 153$
$a = 7$

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

    To determine the coefficients a and b for the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that ax^0 is equivalent to a (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is simply bx (since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself). Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We need to find the values of a and b that fit the given inputs and outputs. Since two points are enough to determine a straight line, let's use two of the provided data points to set up a system of linear equations.

Let's take the points (x1, y1) = (9, 160) and (x2, y2) = (13, 228) and plug them into the function:

For (9, 160):
160 = a + b*9

For (13, 228):
228 = a + b*13

This is a system of two linear equations with two unknown variables a and b. We can solve this system by various methods, such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's use the substitution method:

From the first equation:
a = 160 - 9b

Now plug the expression of a into the second equation:
228 = (160 - 9b) + 13b
228 = 160 + 4b

Solve for b:
4b = 228 - 160
4b = 68
b = 17

Now substitute the value of b back into the expression we found for a:
a = 160 - 9*17
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

So the function that fits the given data points is:
y = 7 + 17x

This function should reasonably fit the other provided points as well. To confirm, let's check it with one more data point, for example, the point (15, 262):

y = 7 + 17*15
y = 7 + 255

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to solve for the constants a and b. The term ax^0 is a constant because any number to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can set up a series of equations:

1. a + 9b = 160
2. a + 13b = 228
3. a - 4b = -61
4. a + 15b = 262
5. a - 20b = -333

We can solve for a and b using any two of these linear equations. For simplicity, we'll use equations 1 and 3.

From equation 1: a = 160 - 9b
Substitute this value for a in equation 3: 160 - 9b - 4b = -61
Combine like terms: 160 - 13b = -61
Subtract 160 from both sides: -13b = -61 - 160
Simplify: -13b = -221
Divide by -13: b = 17

Now, plug the value of b into equation 1 to solve for a:
a + 9(17) = 160
a + 153 = 160
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first recognize that ax^0 is simply a constant (since any number to the power of 0 is 1). Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given that we have several input-output pairs, we can calculate the values of a and b by using two pairs to set up a system of linear equations.

Let's take two input-output pairs (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and plug them into the equation:

For x1 = 9 and y1 = 160:
160 = a + 9b   (1)

For x2 = 13 and y2 = 228:
228 = a + 13b  (2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for a and b using several methods, such as substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):

228 - 160 = (a + 13b) - (a + 9b)
68 = 4b
b = 68 / 4
b = 17

Now, we will plug the value of b back into equation (1) or (2) to find a. Let’s use equation (1):

160 = a + 9(17)
160 = a + 153
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

Thus, the function is:

    To find the function that best captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can recognize this as a linear equation in the form:

y = a + bx

Here, ax^0 is simply a, because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1, and bx^1 is bx, because anything raised to the power of 1 is itself. With this understanding, we need to determine the constants a and b.

We can use the given input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations and then solve for a and b. However, with more than two pairs, we won't be able to determine a single solution unless all the points lie perfectly on a line, which may not be the case. So our goal is to find a and b that provide a best fit for our data points. 

Given the linear function y = a + bx, let's use two of the given data points to solve for a and b. We can use the points (9,160) and (-4,-61):

1. For the input 9 (x = 9), the output is 160 (y = 160):
160 = a + 9b  ...(equation 1)

2. For the input -4 (x = -4), the output is -61 (y = -61):
-61 = a - 4b  ...(equation 2)

Now we solve the system of equations. First, let's solve equation 2 for a:

a = -61 + 4b  ...(equation 3)

Next, we can substitute equation 3 into equation 1:

160 = (-61 + 4b) + 9b
160 = -61 + 13b
160 + 61 = 13b
221 = 13b
b = 221 / 13
b = 17

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into equation 3 to find a:

a = -61 + 4b
a = -61 + 4(17)
a = -61 + 68
a = 7

So, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs for the points given is:

y = 7 + 17x

Let's use the input-output pairs (-2, 17) and (7, -145) to solve for a and b:

1. For the input x = -2 and output y = 17:
17 = a + b(-2)

2. For the input x = 7 and output y = -145:
-145 = a + b(7)

Now, we have the system of equations:
1) 17 = a - 2b
2) -145 = a + 7b

To solve this system, let's multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 2 to eliminate variable a:

1) 119 = 7a - 14b
2) -290 = 2a + 14b

By adding these two equations, we get:
119 - 290 = (7a + 2a) + (-14b + 14b)
-171 = 9a

Solving for a:
a = -171 / 9
a = -19

2b = -36
b = -36 / 2
b = -18

Now we have the values for a and b:

    The function described by these points seems to be a linear function, represented as y = ax^0 + bx^1. To determine the coefficients a and b, we can use two points to solve the system of equations:

1. Using (x1, y1) = (-2, 17) in y = ax^0 + bx^1, we get:  
17 = a * (-2)^0 + b * (-2)  
17 = a - 2b  

2. Using (x2, y2) = (7, -145) in y = ax^0 + bx^1, we get:  
-145 = a * 7^0 + b * 7  
-145 = a + 7b  

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

a - 2b = 17  
a + 7b = -145  

By solving this system, we can determine the values of a and b:

a - 2b = 17           | *(-1)
a + 7b = -145

-(a - 2b) = -17
a + 7b = -145

- a + 2b = 17
a + 7b = -145

Adding the two equations to eliminate a:

9b = -128  
b = -128 / 9  
b = -14.222...

Now plug the value of b back into the first equation:

a - 2(-14.222...) = 17  
a + 28.444... = 17  
a = 17 - 28.444...  
a = -11.444...

Since the coefficients should be integers for this kind of function, it seems we have made an error because our current solution a = -11.444... and b = -14.222... are not providing us with integer values. This suggests either that more than two points should be used (indicating a possible non-linear relationship), or there may have been rounding or data-entry errors.

We could verify our solution using a different pair of points or using all the points to attempt to find the best fit line through a least-squares approximation, but let's check another pair of points to see if there is a simple linear relationship before moving on to a more complex solution.

Using (x1, y1) = (-10, 161) and (x2, y2) = (9, -181), we set up a new system of equations:

161 = a + b(-10)  
-181 = a + b*9  

Again solving the system for a and b:

a - 10b = 161  
a + 9b = -181  

Multiply the second equation by -1 to prepare for elimination:

a - 10b = 161  
-a - 9b = 181  

Now add to eliminate a:

-19b = 342  
b = -18

Now that we have b, plug it back into one of the equations to solve for a:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the coefficients a and b that fit the given input-output pairs. The term ax^0 is just a since anything to the power of zero is 1. Therefore, the function we are looking for simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have several pairs of inputs and outputs to work with, but since some inputs are repeated and pairs like (20, -307) appear more than once, we can treat them as confirmations of consistency and use just a couple of distinct points to determine the function.

Let's use the two distinct points (20, -307) and (-1, 8) to determine the coefficients a and b:

If we plug the first point into the equation we get:

-307 = a + 20b  (Equation 1)

For the second point we get:

8 = a - b       (Equation 2)

Now, we have a system of linear equations that we can solve simultaneously to find a and b.

From Equation 2, we can express a as follows:

a = 8 + b       (Equation 3)

We can substitute the expression for a from Equation 3 into Equation 1 to solve for b:

-307 = (8 + b) + 20b
-307 = 8 + 21b
-307 - 8 = 21b
-315 = 21b
b = -315 / 21
b = -15

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using Equation 3:

a = 8 + b
a = 8 + (-15)
a = -7

Therefore, the function that fits the given data points is:

y = -7 + (-15)x

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify this to y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 for any x that is not equal to zero.

We have several pairs of input (x) and output (y) data points: 
(20, -307), (-1, 8), (12, -187), and (18, -277). 

Since there are more than two data points, there is not guaranteed to be a single unique solution, and with the given data points, we can attempt to find the best-fit line that would follow the form y = a + bx.

Let's use two data points to derive the coefficients a and b.

Using the first data point (20, -307):
-307 = a + 20b ----(1)

Using the second data point (-1, 8):
8 = a - b ----(2)

From equation (2), we can extract a:
a = 8 + b ----(3)

Substitute (3) into (1) to solve for b:
-307 = (8 + b) + 20b
-307 = 8 + 21b
-307 - 8 = 21b
-315 = 21b
b = -15

Now plug the value of b back into equation (3) to solve for a:
a = 8 + (-15)
a = -7

    To find a function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that describes the relationship between the inputs \( x \) and the outputs \( y \), we first note that \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any \( x \) except 0. Therefore, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using any two distinct data points from the given data. Let's use the following two points: (20, -307) and (-1, 8).

Using these points, we set up a system of linear equations:
1. For input 20: \( -307 = a + 20b \)
2. For input -1: \( 8 = a - b \)

Now, we solve this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \):

From equation 2:
\( a = 8 + b \)

Plugging this into equation 1 gives us:
\( -307 = (8 + b) + 20b \)
\( -307 = 8 + 21b \)
\( -315 = 21b \)
\( b = -15 \)

    To determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) in the function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which can also be written as \(y = a + bx\) since \(x^0 = 1\), we can use two points from the provided input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations.

However, we notice that the same input of 20 produces the same output of -307, which is consistent across two data points, suggesting that the outputs for other inputs are also derived from the same linear function.

Let's take two distinct input-output pairs to solve for \(a\) and \(b\):

1. \(x = 20\), \(y = -307\)
2. \(x = -1\), \(y = 8\)

Now we have the following equations:

1. \(-307 = a + 20b\)
2. \(8 = a - b\)

Let's solve this system of equations for \(a\) and \(b\).

From the second equation, we can express \(a\) as:

\(a = 8 + b\)

Now substitute this expression into the first equation:

\(-307 = (8 + b) + 20b\)
\(-307 = 8 + 21b\)
\(-307 - 8 = 21b\)
\(-315 = 21b\)
\(b = -15\)

Now we can solve for \(a\):

\(a = 8 + b\)
\(a = 8 - 15\)
\(a = -7\)

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we'll need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that will be able to generate the outputs given the inputs provided.

First, let's understand the terms of the function:

- \( ax^0 \): Since any number (except 0) raised to the power of 0 is 1, \( ax^0 \) is effectively just \( a \).
- \( bx^1 \): Since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself, \( bx^1 \) is just \( bx \).

So the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We can use two of the input-output pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). For example, let's use the following pairs:

\( x = 0 \), \( y = 12 \) gives us \( 12 = a + b(0) \) which simplifies to \( a = 12 \).

Now let's take another pair:

\( x = 13 \), \( y = -66 \) gives us \( -66 = a + b(13) \).

We have already established that \( a = 12 \), so we replace \( a \) with 12 to solve for \( b \):

\( -66 = 12 + b(13) \)
\( -66 - 12 = b(13) \)
\( -78 = b(13) \)
\( b = -78 / 13 \)
\( b = -6 \)

So the function is \( y = 12 + (-6)x \) which simplifies to \( y = 12 - 6x \).

To verify this function with all provided data points:

For \( x = 13 \), \( y = 12 - 6(13) = 12 - 78 = -66 \)
For \( x = -20 \), \( y = 12 - 6(-20) = 12 + 120 = 132 \)
For \( x = 18 \), \( y = 12 - 6(18) = 12 - 108 = -96 \)

For the input 0 (which simplifies the equation):
\( y = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1 \)
\( 12 = a \cdot 1 + b \cdot 0 \)
\( 12 = a \)

\( y = a(13)^0 + b(13)^1 \)

Since ax^0 is always a (because x^0 is 1 for all x except for x=0), we can consider the constant term as a. The term bx^1 is simply bx, since any number raised to the power of 1 is itself.

From the data, we have the following equations:

1. a + b(13) = -66
2. a + b(-20) = 132
3. a + b(18) = -96
4. a + b(0) = 12        // this tells us directly that a = 12, since b(0) is 0
5. a + b(11) = -54

We can use any of the equations 1, 2, 3, or 5 to solve for b now that we know that a = 12. Let's use equation 1 as it has simpler numbers:

12 + b(13) = -66

This simplifies to:

We are given a series of input (x) and output (y) pairs to work from. Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to form a system of linear equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \). We can use the pairs (13, -66) and (0, 12) for convenience since the second pair will immediately give us \( a \) directly because \( x = 0 \) eliminates the \( bx \) term.

From the input-output pair (0, 12):

\[ 12 = a(0^0) + b(0) \]

Substituting the first point into the equation:
For \( x = -17 \), \( y = -325 \)

Second Equation:

Now, subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate `a` and solve for `b`:

-216 = -12b
b = 18

Use the value of `b` to solve for `a` by substituting `b` into either equation (1) or (2). Let's use equation (2):

Therefore, the function simplifies to `y = a + bx`.

Now, we will use two data points to calculate `a` and `b`. Let's take the two points `(x1, y1) = (-17, -325)` and `(x2, y2) = (16, 269)`.

From the first point, substituting `x1` and `y1` into our simplified function:

From the second point, substituting `x2` and `y2` into our simplified function:
269 = a + b(16) ... (2)

Now we have a system of linear equations which we can solve for `a` and `b`. Let's solve for `b` first by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):

Now we need to find a value for either a or b, let's find b first. We can rearrange one of the initial equations for a and then substitute it into our third equation. Let's rearrange the second equation:

269 = a + 16b
a = 269 - 16b

Now substitute a into the third equation:

-56 = 2(269 - 16b) - b
-56 = 538 - 32b - b
-56 = 538 - 33b
33b = 538 + 56
33b = 594
b = 594 / 33
b = 18

Now we have the value for b, we can substitute it into the equation for a:

a = 269 - 16b
a = 269 - 16(18)
a = 269 - 288
a = -19

So the function that best describes this data in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = -19 + 18x

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we essentially need to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the given input-output pairs. Since \(x^0\) is always 1, the term \(ax^0\) simplifies to \(a\). So the function simplifies to a linear function \( y = a + bx \).

Let's analyze two input-output pairs to create a system of equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Using the input-output pair (-17, -325):
\( y = a + b(-17) \)
\( -325 = a - 17b \) ... (1)

Using the input-output pair (-5, -109):
\( y = a + b(-5) \)
\( -109 = a - 5b \) ... (2)

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) \( -325 = a - 17b \)
2) \( -109 = a - 5b \)

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate \( a \):
\( -325 - (-109) = (-17b) - (-5b) \)
\( -216 = -12b \)
\( b = \frac{-216}{-12} \)
\( b = 18 \)

Now, let's substitute \( b \) back into equation (2) to find \( a \):
\( -109 = a - 5(18) \)
\( -109 = a - 90 \)
\( a = -109 + 90 \)
\( a = -19 \)

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the provided data points, we notice that ax^0 is just a, since any number to the power of zero is one. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. Here, a represents the y-intercept and b is the slope of the linear function.

We can find the values of a and b by examining two of the given input-output pairs and setting up a system of equations. Let's use input-output pairs (10, 142) and (-10, -158).

For the input 10:
1. 142 = a + b(10)

For the input -10:
2. -158 = a + b(-10)

Now, let's solve these two equations to find the values of a and b.

From equation 1:
142 = a + 10b
a = 142 - 10b --(3)

Substituting a into equation 2:
-158 = (142 - 10b) + b(-10)
-158 = 142 - 10b - 10b
-158 = 142 - 20b
-158 - 142 = -20b
-300 = -20b
b = 15

Substitute the value of b back into equation 3:
a = 142 - 10(15)
a = 142 - 150
a = -8

Let's use two points from the provided data to calculate \( b \) (the slope):

For example, taking the inputs 10 and -10 and their respective outputs 142 and -158:

\( b = (Output2 - Output1) / (Input2 - Input1) \)
\( b = (-158 - 142) / (-10 - 10) \)
\( b = (-300) / (-20) \)
\( b = 15 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can use one of the points to solve for \( a \) (the y-intercept):

Using the point (10, 142):

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we first understand that x^0 is always 1, so ax^0 is simply a constant term, 'a'. Then, we can rewrite the function in the more familiar form: y = a + bx.

We can use two points from the given data to calculate 'a' and 'b'. Let's take the points (10, 142) and (-10, -158).

For x = 10:
142 = a + 10b

For x = -10:
-158 = a - 10b

Now, we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve this system of equations using various methods, such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations.

Let's use elimination:

(1) 142 = a + 10b
(2) -158 = a - 10b

Add (1) and (2):
142 - 158 = a + 10b + a - 10b
-16 = 2a
a = -8

Now, we'll substitute 'a' back into one of the earlier equations to solve for 'b':

From the input-output pairs provided, we observe that the output increases as the input increases, suggesting that b is positive, and we need to find the exact value for a and b that fits all pairs.

Let's consider two pairs of inputs and outputs to set up a system of equations. For instance, using the inputs 10 and -10:

For input 10 and output 142:
142 = a + b(10)

For input -10 and output -158:
-158 = a + b(-10)

Now, let's establish the system of equations:

1) 142 = a + 10b
2) -158 = a - 10b

We can solve for a and b by adding both equations to eliminate b:

(142 = a + 10b) + (-158 = a - 10b)

which simplifies to:

-16 = 2a

Dividing by 2:

a = -8

Now, we can substitute the value of a back into one of the original equations to solve for b. Using the first equation (142 = a + 10b):

142 = -8 + 10b

Adding 8 to both sides:

150 = 10b

The function simplifies to:
y = a + bx

We essentially need to find the values of a and b that make the function fit the data points provided. However, with only the information given, we can't use traditional least squares regression, so let's approach it systematically to find a and b.

From the given data points, we can create equations. We would need at least two points to find a unique solution for the two unknowns, a and b. Having more than two points can provide a system of equations that can be solved using methods such as least squares, but for simplicity's sake, let's see what we can derive from a pair of points.

Let's take two points, (10, 142) and (-10, -158), and setup two equations with the unknowns a and b:

1. For the input 10:
142 = a + 10b

2. For the input -10:
-158 = a - 10b

Now we have a system of linear equations. We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Adding both equations to eliminate a:
(142) + (-158) = (a + 10b) + (a - 10b)
-16 = 2a
a = -8

Now substitute the value of a back into one of the equations to find b:
142 = -8 + 10b
150 = 10b
b = 15

Therefore, we've found values of a and b that match perfectly for the given points (10, 142) and (-10, -158). Let's check if these coefficients also work for the other given points.

For the input 15:
y = -8 + 15(15) = -8 + 225 = 217 (matches the given output)

For the input -4:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we need to write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. This simplifies to y = a + bx because anything raised to the zeroth power is 1.

The function can be thought of as a linear equation y = mx + c where 'm' is the slope and 'c' is the y-intercept. In this case, 'a' corresponds to 'c' (the y-intercept) and 'b' is the slope (change in y divided by change in x).

We can use two data points to calculate 'b'. For instance, using the points (5, 76) and (3, 48):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (76 - 48) / (5 - 3)
b = 28 / 2
b = 14

Now, with 'b' known, we can solve for 'a' using one of the points:

Here, ax^0 is a constant term because any number x raised to the power of 0 equals 1. Thus, ax^0 is the same as a*1, or simply a.

bx^1 is a linear term, since any number x raised to the power of 1 is just x. Therefore, bx^1 is the same as b*x.

Given that the function is linear and in the form y = a + bx, we can determine the constants a and b by using two data points to solve a system of linear equations.

From the data provided:

For Input -1:

We can use two points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the first two points given:

Point 1 (Input: -1, Output: -8):

38 + 122 = 19a + 19b + a - 19b
160 = 20a
a = 160 / 20
a = 8

Now that we have a, we can substitute this value back into equation (1) to find b:
2 = 8 + b
b = 2 - 8
b = -6

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 8 - 6x

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, this simplifies to y = a + bx, as x^0 is 1 for any value of x other than zero. To determine the values of a and b, we need to solve a system of linear equations using the provided input-output pairs.

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to create our system of equations:

For Input 1, Output 2:
2 = a + b * 1    ...(1)

For Input -19, Output 122:
122 = a + b * (-19) ...(2)

Now let's solve these equations for a and b. First, we rewrite the equations:

1) a + b = 2
2) a - 19b = 122

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a:

(a - 19b) - (a + b) = 122 - 2

This simplifies to:

-20b = 120

Solve for b:

b = 120 / -20
b = -6

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using either equation (1) or (2). Let's use equation (1):

a + (-6) * 1 = 2
a - 6 = 2
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

Now that we have both a and b, we can write the function:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = 8 + (-6)x
y = 8 - 6x

So the function that fits the given input-output pairs is:

    To find the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), we need to determine the values of the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) that will fit the given input-output pairs.

Let's denote by \( x \) the input and by \( y \) the output, then we have:

1. \( y = a + bx \) when Input \( x = 1 \), Output \( y = 2 \)
2. \( y = a + bx \) when Input \( x = -19 \), Output \( y = 122 \)
3. \( y = a + bx \) when Input \( x = 17 \), Output \( y = -94 \)
4. \( y = a + bx \) when Input \( x = 15 \), Output \( y = -82 \)
5. \( y = a + bx \) when Input \( x = -6 \), Output \( y = 44 \)

We have two unknowns and five equations. Normally, we would use two pairs of input-output to solve for \( a \) and \( b \), but since we have additional points, we will have to find the best fit that approximates all the given points. In practice, this is done by methods like least squares regression. However, for a literal exact fit with contradicting points like these, an exact solution might not exist.

Instead, we will solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using two of the given points (random choice or you may use more sophisticated methods to choose which points are best to use), and that solution will exactly satisfy those two points but may not fit the others perfectly:

Let's use these two points for our calculation:

1. When \( x = 1 \), \( y = 2 \)
2. When \( x = -19 \), \( y = 122 \)

We now have a system of two linear equations:
\( 2 = a + 1 \cdot b \)
\( 122 = a - 19 \cdot b \)

We solve this system to find \( a \) and \( b \):

\( a = 2 - b \)

Substitute \( a \) into the second equation:

\( 122 = (2 - b) - 19 \cdot b \)
\( 122 = 2 - 20 \cdot b \)
\( 120 = -20 \cdot b \)
\( b = -6 \)

Now we substitute \( b \) into the equation \( a = 2 - b \):

\( a = 2 - (-6) \)
\( a = 2 + 6 \)
\( a = 8 \)

So the function that fits the two points \( (1, 2) \) and \( (-19, 122) \) exactly is:

\( y = 8 + (-6)x \)
\( y = 8 - 6x \)

However, this function will not fit the other three points exactly. To perfectly fit all given points would typically require a more complex model, such as a higher-degree polynomial. In practical applications, fitting a function to data points usually involves compromises and some degree of error tolerance, and the chosen model depends on the underlying relationship and the nature of the data.

    To solve for the coefficients a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since anything raised to the power of zero is 1, we need to set up a system of linear equations using the given input-output pairs. Since we have more than two pairs, we will use the method of least squares or similar techniques to find the best fit. However, for the simplicity of this exercise, let's just use two of the pairs to solve for a and b.

Taking the input-output pairs (1, 2) and (-19, 122), we can set up the following equations:

For input 1 and output 2:
2 = a + b * 1

For input -19 and output 122:
122 = a + b * (-19)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

1) a + b = 2
2) a - 19b = 122

We can solve this system of equations by using substitution or elimination. I'll use elimination for this example.

Multiply the first equation by 19 to align the coefficients of a:

19a + 19b = 38
a - 19b = 122

Now, add the two equations together to eliminate b:

20a = 160
a = 160 / 20
a = 8

Now, plug the value of a into one of the original equations to find b:

8 + b = 2

    To find a linear function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that fits the given inputs and outputs, it is essentially finding a function of the form \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x and \( x^1 = x \).

Given the data points:

(1, 2), (-19, 122), (17, -94), (15, -82), (-6, 44)

To find the constants \( a \) and \( b \), we need a system of equations based on the given points, but since we have more than two data points, this means we would be looking for a 'best fit' line if the points do not all lie exactly on a single line, which cannot be determined from the given points directly without more information (such as minimizing the sum of the squared errors).

However, we can check if these points can fit exactly into a linear function by checking if the change in y over the change in x (the slope) is consistent across all pairs of points.

Let's calculate the slope (\( m \)) from the first two data points:

For (1, 2) and (-19, 122):
\( m = \frac{122 - 2}{-19 - 1} = \frac{120}{-20} = -6 \)

Let's see if the same slope fits the other points:
For (17, -94) and (15, -82):
\( m = \frac{-94 + 82}{17 - 15} = \frac{-12}{2} = -6 \)

So for the those pairs, the slope (b) is consistent. But let's quickly check a third pair to be sure.

For (-6, 44) and (1, 2):
\( m = \frac{2 - 44}{1 - (-6)} = \frac{-42}{7} = -6 \)

The slope is indeed consistent across these pairs. Therefore, \( b = -6 \).

Now let's solve for \( a \) using one data point. I will use (1, 2):

2 = a + (-6)*1
2 = a - 6
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

So the linear function for the given data points is:

    To find a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use two of the given input-output pairs to solve for the constants a and b. This form is equivalent to y = a + bx since x^0 = 1 for any x that is not zero.

Using the two input-output pairs (1, 14) and (-6, -105), we can set up the following two equations:

1. For the input 1 and output 14: 
   14 = a + b * 1

   This simplifies to:
   14 = a + b     ...(1)

2. For the input -6 and output -105: 
   -105 = a + b * (-6)

   This simplifies to:
   -105 = a - 6b   ...(2)

Now let's solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b. We can start by rewriting equation (1):

   a = 14 - b      ...(3)

Now, let's substitute this expression for a into equation (2):

   -105 = (14 - b) - 6b
   -105 = 14 - b - 6b
   -105 = 14 - 7b
   -119 = -7b
   b = 17

Plugging the value of b into equation (3) to find a:

   a = 14 - 17

    To determine the coefficients 'a' and 'b' in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need two points to solve the system of equations. Given that x^0 = 1 for any non-zero x, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's use two of the given points to form the system of equations. I will take the points (1, 14) and (-17, -292):

For (1, 14):

14 = a(1^0) + b(1) 
14 = a + b  ..........(1)

For (-17, -292):

-292 = a(-17^0) + b(-17)

Now we can solve the system of equations (1) and (2) for 'a' and 'b'. Let's start by solving equation (1) for 'a':

a = 14 - b ...........(3)

Substituting equation (3) into equation (2), we get:

-292 = (14 - b) - 17b
-292 = 14 - b - 17b
-292 = 14 - 18b

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 given a set of input and output pairs, we can interpret ax^0 as a constant (since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 as a linear term. Therefore, the function essentially looks like:

y = a + bx

The request for the explicit form suggests that we need to find specific values for a and b that fit the data points given. To find these values, we can use two data points to set up two equations and solve for 'a' and 'b'.

Let's select the following two inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: -17, Output: -292
Input: 1, Output: 14

Using the first point (-17, -292), we get the equation:
-292 = a + b(-17)

Using the second point (1, 14), we get the equation:
14 = a + b(1)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1. -292 = a - 17b
2.    14 = a + b

We can solve these equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

First, we add the two equations together to eliminate 'a':

(-292) + 14 = (a - 17b) + (a + b)
-278 = 2a - 16b

Now, divide the entire equation by 2:

-139 = a - 8b

Now, let's isolate 'a' from the first equation:

a = 14 - b

Substitute this 'a' into the second equation:
-139 = (14 - b) - 8b
-139 = 14 - 9b
-139 - 14 = -9b
-153 = -9b
b = -153 / -9
b = 17

Now that we have the value for 'b', we substitute it back into the equation a = 14 - b to find 'a':

a = 14 - 17
a = -3

- b is the slope of the line (the change in y for a one-unit change in x)

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can use two of them to solve for a and b. Let's use the following two pairs:

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the input (x) and output (y) given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first note that ax^0 is a constant term because any number to the power of zero is 1. So ax^0 becomes a. The term bx^1 simplifies to bx since any number to the power of one is itself. Hence, the function must be of the form:

y = a + bx

Given the data points:

1. When x = -7, y = 130
2. When x = 14, y = -290
3. When x = -12, y = 230
4. When x = 16, y = -330

We can set up a system of equations using two of the points to find the coefficients a and b.

Using points (1) and (2), we get two equations:

1) 130 = a - 7b
2) -290 = a + 14b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Multiplying the first equation by 2 to eliminate 'a' when subtracted from the second equation, we get:

2 * 130 = 2a - 14b
-290 = a + 14b

Subtracting these two equations will eliminate a and give us the value for b:

(260 - (-290)) = (2a - a) - (14b + 14b)
550 = -28b
b = -550 / 28
b = -19.642857...

Since b is a constant slope for a line, we generally expect this value to be the same for all points if the points lie on the same straight line. Let's compute 'a' using b and one of the points. Taking equation (1):

130 = a - 7b
130 = a - 7(-19.642857...)
a = 130 - 7(-19.642857...)
a = 130 + 137.5
a = 267.5

Now, we have:

a = 267.5
b = -19.642857...

However, the values of a and b we've determined must be the same for all provided data points, and since we've used approximations for b (due to fractional simplification), let's make sure these coefficients make sense for the other points.

For the third point (x = -12, y = 230), let's see if our a and b work:

y = a + bx
230 = 267.5 - 19.642857...(-12)

Multiplying -19.642857... by -12 should approximately give the difference between 267.5 and 230 to satisfy the equation. However, we expect rounding errors because we carried an approximation earlier. To fit all points exactly, b has to be a rational number with an exact fraction, not an endless decimal.

Since our function must be exact and we shouldn't rely on approximations here, let's use the exact form of b as a fraction we know fits all given points.

Between points 1 and 2, the slope b (change in y divided by the change in x) would be:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-290 - 130) / (14 - (-7))
b = (-420) / (21)
b = -20

Now let's find the exact value for a using b = -20 and point (x = -7, y = 130):

130 = a - 7(-20)
130 = a + 140
a = 130 - 140
a = -10

So the exact function that fits the given points would be:

y = -10 + (-20)x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the coefficients a and b for the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1), we need to use the provided input-output pairs. This function is a linear equation in the form of y = a + bx, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the line.

We have several points given: (-7, 130), (14, -290), (-12, 230), (16, -330), and (16, -330). Since the last two points are the same, they provide no additional information.

We will use two of the remaining unique points to determine the coefficients a and b. Let's take the points (-7, 130) and (14, -290).

Using the first point (-7, 130), we can set up the equation:
130 = a + b(-7)  =>  1) 130 = a - 7b

Using the second point (14, -290), we set up the equation:
-290 = a + b(14) =>  2) -290 = a + 14b

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1) 130 = a - 7b
2) -290 = a + 14b

Let's solve this system of equations by first multiplying the first equation by 1 to keep it unchanged and the second equation by 1 to keep it unchanged as well:

1) 130 = a - 7b   =>  130 = a - 7b
2) -290 = a + 14b =>  -290 = a + 14b

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

130 - (-290) = (a - a) + (-7b - 14b)
420 = 0a - 21b
b = 420 / -21
b = -20

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either equation 1 or 2 to find a. Using equation 1:

130 = a - 7(-20)
130 = a + 140
a = 130 - 140
a = -10

So the coefficients are a = -10 and b = -20. Thus, the function in the specified form is:

y = -10x^0 - 20x^1
Simplified, the function is:
y = -10 - 20x

    To determine the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we need to find the constants \(a\) and \(b\). The given form simplifies to \(y = a + bx\) because \(x^0 = 1\) for any \(x\), except when \(x = 0\).

Let's use the given data points to find \(a\) and \(b\).

For the input/output pair (-7, 130), our equation becomes:
130 = a - 7b

For the input/output pair (14, -290), our equation becomes:
-290 = a + 14b

We now have a system of two linear equations with two variables:
1) 130 = a - 7b
2) -290 = a + 14b

Let's solve this system of equations. Multiply the first equation by 2 to help eliminate \(a\):
2 * 130 = 2a - 14b
260 = 2a - 14b  (3)

Now, add equation (2) and equation (3) together to eliminate \(a\):

-290 =  a + 14b
260 =  2a - 14b
-----------------
-30 = 3a

Now, divide both sides by 3 to find \(a\):

-30 / 3 = a
a = -10

With the value of \(a\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \(b\):

130 = -10 - 7b
140 = -7b
b = -20

Now we have found \(a\) and \(b\). The function is therefore:

Given that x^0 is 1 for any x other than 0, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Now we can use two of the given input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations and solve for a and b.

Let's choose the input-output pairs (x1, y1) = (-7, 130) and (x2, y2) = (14, -290).

Using the first pair:
130 = a + b(-7)
130 = a - 7b  ... (1)

Using the second pair:
-290 = a + b(14)
-290 = a + 14b  ... (2)

Now, let's solve the system of equations (1) and (2).

From (1), isolate a:
a = 130 + 7b  ... (3)

Substitute a from (3) into (2):
-290 = (130 + 7b) + 14b
-290 = 130 + 21b
-420 = 21b
b = -420 / 21
b = -20

Now, using the value of b to find a via equation (3):

Given the data points, let's use two of them to solve for \(a\) and \(b\):

1. Using the data point (2, 15):
\(15 = a + 2b\)

2. Using the data point (7, 50):
\(50 = a + 7b\)

Now we have a system of linear equations that we can solve for \(a\) and \(b\). Let's solve for \(b\) first by subtracting the first equation from the second one:

\(50 - 15 = a + 7b - (a + 2b)\)
\(35 = 5b\)

We're given a set of input-output pairs:

(-14, -97)
(7, 50)
(2, 15)

We can use any two pairs to determine the coefficients a and b. I'll use the pairs (-14, -97) and (7, 50) to set up a system of linear equations.

From the pair (-14, -97):

-97 = a + b(-14)

From the pair (7, 50):

50 = a + b(7)

We now have a system of two linear equations with two variables:

1) a - 14b = -97
2) a + 7b = 50

To solve this system, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. I'll use the method of elimination.

Multiply the second equation by 2 to align the a's:

2a + 14b = 100

Now add this result to the first equation:

(a - 14b) + (2a + 14b) = -97 + 100
3a = 3

Divide by 3 to solve for a:

a = 1

Now we'll substitute a back into one of the original equations to solve for b. I'll substitute a into the second equation:

We will use two points to solve for a and b. Let's take the points (7, 50) and (2, 15):

Using the point (7, 50):
50 = a + 7b

And using the point (2, 15):
15 = a + 2b

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

- a and b are coefficients we need to determine.
- x^0 is always 1, since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.
- x^1 is just x, since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself.

Our equation simplifies to y = a + bx, as x^0 is 1 and x^1 is x.

Now we need to find the values of a and b that fit the data given. Since the outputs for -14 and 7 are consistently -97 and 50, respectively, we can set up the following two equations based on the given inputs and outputs:

1) -97 = a + b(-14)
2)  50 = a + b(7)

We have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve these two linear equations to find the values of a and b.

50 = -97 + 21b
147 = 21b
b = 7

We can now substitute b back into equation (3) to find the value of a:

a = -97 + 98
a = 1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The function describing the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is essentially a linear function. The general form for a linear function is:

y = a + bx,

where a is the y-intercept (what y equals when x = 0) and b is the slope (the rate at which y changes per unit increase in x).

To find a and b, we need to look at the given input-output pairs and setup a system of equations to solve for a and b. Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to form two equations:

For input -9 and output 64:
64 = a + b(-9)   [1]

For input -3 and output 22:
22 = a + b(-3)   [2]

Now we will solve these two equations simultaneously to find a and b.

Subtract equation [2] from equation [1] to eliminate a:

64 - 22 = a - a - 9b + 3b
42 = -6b
b = -7

Now, substituting b back into equation [2] to solve for a:

22 = a + (-7)(-3)
22 = a + 21
a = 1

So the function in the exact form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

Output: y = 1x^0 - 7x^1
Or simplified:
Output: y = 1 - 7x

This function seems to capture the given data points reasonably, although without additional data points we cannot be certain this is the exact relationship, especially if the actual relationship is not linear or involves a polynomial of a higher degree or some other non-linear transformation.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the linear function that best fits the given data points, we can start by assuming a function of the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

Since \( x^0 \) is equal to 1 for any value of \( x \) (except when \( x = 0 \)), this simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Now, we need to find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) that make this equation fit the data. By substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation, we get these 5 equations:

1. \( 64 = a - 9b \)
2. \( 22 = a - 3b \)
3. \( -62 = a + 9b \)
4. \( 36 = a - 5b \)
5. \( 113 = a - 16b \)

We can use any two pairs of equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \) because we are looking for a linear relationship and hence we need just two points to determine the line. However, since the data is given without any indication of errors, and might not fit perfectly to a line, it is best to find \( a \) and \( b \) using a method that considers all points, such as linear regression. Since you asked for an exact form from the given points, we will use two equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

By comparing equations 2 and 3 we can eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( b \):

\[ (22 - (-62)) = (-3b - 9b) \]
\[ 84 = -12b \]
\[ b = -7 \]

Then we can use this value of \( b \) and substitute it back into any of the original equations to solve for \( a \). We'll use equation 2:

\[ 22 = a - 3(-7) \]
\[ 22 = a + 21 \]
\[ a = 22 - 21 \]
\[ a = 1 \]

    To determine the coefficients a and b for the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we must realize that x^0 is always 1 for any non-zero x, thus ax^0 is just a. The function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We now need to find the values of a and b that best fit the given input-output pairs. This can be done by setting up a system of linear equations using the provided data points and solving for a and b.

Let's use two of the given pairs to set up our system:

From the pair (-9, 64), we get:
64 = a + b(-9)

From the pair (-3, 22), we get:
22 = a + b(-3)

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. 64 = a - 9b
2. 22 = a - 3b

Subtract the second equation from the first to potentially eliminate a and solve for b:

64 - 22 = a - a -9b + 3b
42 = -6b
b = -7

Now that we have b, we can solve for a. We will use the second equation for this purpose:

22 = a - 3(-7)
22 = a + 21
a = 22 - 21
a = 1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can rewrite this as y = a + bx since x^0 is equal to 1 for all x ≠ 0. The task is to find the constants a and b that define the line which best fits the given data points.

The following are the input-output pairs:

1. x = -9, y = 64
2. x = -3, y = 22
3. x = 9, y = -62
4. x = -5, y = 36
5. x = -16, y = 113

With only two constants a and b, this would typically translate to a linear function if the relationship between inputs and outputs is linear. However, looking at the five given points, it is not immediately clear that they fall on a straight line. Nevertheless, let's start with a basic line-fitting approach and see where it takes us.

A common way to solve for a and b in cases such as this is to use a least squares fit, assuming that the errors between our model's predictions and the actual data are normally distributed. However, without further computations, it's impossible to determine the exact values of a and b here, because this is generally done with matrix operations or numerical optimization methods that are beyond simple inspection.

For the sake of this exercise, let's try to eyeball a solution using two of the points to derive a basic linear formula.

Let's take the first two points:

For x = -9, y = 64, we have 64 = a - 9b.
For x = -3, y = 22, we have 22 = a - 3b.

Let's set up a system of equations:

1. a - 9b = 64
2. a - 3b = 22

Solving this system for a and b, we can subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(1) - (2):
(a - 9b) - (a - 3b) = 64 - 22
a - 9b - a + 3b = 42
-6b = 42
b = -7

Substitute b = -7 into equation 2 to solve for a:

a - 3(-7) = 22
a + 21 = 22
a = 22 - 21
a = 1

Therefore, the function is approximately 
y = 1 - 7x.

This linear function is an approximation and may not capture the exact relationship, especially because a true fit would almost certainly not be exactly linear given the varied outputs. However, for the scope of this question and without the use of more sophisticated methods, this is a reasonable estimate. Please be aware that especially with this few points and the large variability between them, the actual relationship might be better captured using nonlinear methods or higher-order polynomials.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we recognize that ax^0 is essentially a constant term (since any non-zero number to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is a linear term (x to the first power is just x). This form is a linear equation y = b*x + a.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can interpret these as (x, y) coordinates: (-9, 64), (-3, 22), (9, -62), (-5, 36), and (-16, 113). We can use pairs of these points to calculate the slope (b) of the line.

The slope b is calculated using the formula: b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Let's use the first two points (-9, 64) and (-3, 22) to calculate the slope.

b = (22 - 64) / (-3 - (-9))
b = (-42) / (6)
b = -7

Now that we have the slope, we can use it with one of the points to find the y-intercept, a.

We can use the point (-9, 64) and the formula y = b*x + a.

64 = -7*(-9) + a

    To capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, where a and b are constants, we must first understand that x^0 equals 1 for any x that isn't 0. Since the formula is effectively y = a + bx, we can create a system of equations using the input and output pairs to determine a and b.

Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to create a system of equations. We will use the pairs (-20, 265) and (6, -99).

Using the pair (-20, 265):

265 = a + b(-20)

a - 20b = 265            (1)

Using the pair (6, -99):

-99 = a + b(6)

a + 6b = -99           (2)

Now, we need to solve this system of linear equations for a and b.

Let's multiply equation (2) by 20 and add it to equation (1) to eliminate variable a:

(20a + 120b = -1980) + (a - 20b = 265)

21a + 100b = -1715

Now let's solve for b:

100b = -1715 - 21a

Since we have an additional unknown a, we need to use either elimination or substitution with another pair of points. Let's choose the pair (-5, 55) for this purpose:

55 = a - 5b          (3)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

a - 20b = 265        (1)

a - 5b = 55            (3)

Let's subtract equation (3) from equation (1) to solve for b:

( a - 20b ) - ( a - 5b ) = 265 - 55

a - 20b - a + 5b = 210

-15b = 210

b = -14

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into one of our equations to find a:

a - 20b = 265

a - 20(-14) = 265

a + 280 = 265

a = 265 - 280

a = -15

Now that we have values for a and b, we can write the function:

y = -15x^0 - 14x^1

    To find a function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1` that describes the data, we can notice that `ax^0` is equivalent to `a` since any number to the power of 0 is 1. So the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We need to determine `a` and `b` using the input-output pairs we have. Since we have more than two points, we'll likely use a statistical method to find the best fitting line, such as the method of least squares. However, in this simplified form, let's try to manually find a and b that fit our data.

Given two pairs, we can set up two equations and solve for the two unknowns. Let’s pick the following two input-output pairs to construct our linear equations:

For input -20 (output 265):
265 = a + b(-20)

For input 6 (output -99):
-99 = a + b(6)

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1) 265 = a - 20b
2) -99 = a + 6b

Let's solve this system:

From equation 1):
a = 265 + 20b

Substitute a into equation 2):
-99 = (265 + 20b) + 6b
-99 = 265 + 26b
-364 = 26b
b = -364 / 26
b = -14

Now substitute b into equation 1):

a = -15

Ideally, you would use a more sophisticated method like least squares for a best fit line over all the points if you want the relationship that fits all points as well as possible.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since any number to the power of 0 is 1, we need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the given inputs and outputs.

Let's start by rearranging the function in the standard form of a linear equation, which is \( y = mx + c \), where \( m \) is the slope (change in y divided by the change in x) and \( c \) is the y-intercept (the value of y when x = 0). This is equivalent to \( y = bx + a \), with \( b \) representing the slope and \( a \) representing the y-intercept.

Given the data points, we can calculate the change in y over the change in x between any two points to estimate the slope \( b \):

Take the inputs -20 and -15 with outputs 265 and 195 respectively:

Slope between the two points (\( b \)) can be calculated as:
\[ b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{195 - 265}{-15 - (-20)} = \frac{-70}{5} = -14 \]

Let's verify this slope with another pair of points to make sure it's consistent. Using the inputs -5 and -10 with outputs 55 and 125 respectively:

\[ b = \frac{125 - 55}{-10 - (-5)} = \frac{70}{5} = 14 \]

Incorporating this with the negative slope factor from before, we have conflicting slopes, but let's continue with these two examples. Usually, such differences would suggest the relationship is not linear, but since we are required to find a linear approximation, we must assume there was a mistake and that the data should yield the same slope.

Assuming the slope \( b = -14 \), let's find \( a \) by plugging one of the points into the equation:

\[ 265 = a -14(-20) \]
\[ a = 265 - 280 \]
\[ a = -15 \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, let's first consider the structure of this function.

The term ax^0 is a constant because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So, ax^0 becomes simply a. The term bx^1 is just bx because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself.

Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Now we need to find the values of the coefficients a and b that will fit the given input-output pairs. We have the following pairs to consider:

For input -10 and output -54:
-54 = a + b(-10)

For input 4 and output 2:
2 = a + b(4)

For input -20 and output -94:
-94 = a + b(-20)

For input -4 and output -30:
-30 = a + b(-4)

We can use any two distinct pairs from above to form a system of linear equations to solve for a and b. Let's use the following two distinct pairs:

-54 = a - 10b (1)
2 = a + 4b (2)

Now, we can solve for a and b using these two equations:

From equation (1) we have:
a = -54 + 10b (3)

Now we will substitute a from (3) into equation (2):

2 = (-54 + 10b) + 4b
2 = -54 + 14b
56 = 14b
b = 4

Now that we have b, we can solve for a. Substitute b = 4 into equation (3):

a = -54 + 10(4)
a = -54 + 40
a = -14

So the function that describes the relationship between the input x and the output y is:

y = -14 + 4x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to understand that \( ax^0 \) is a constant term since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Hence \( ax^0 = a \cdot 1 = a \), which is our constant term. The term \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \) since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself.

Now, we need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) such that the function fits the given inputs and outputs.

We have two distinct points that we can use to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \):

1. Input: 4, Output: 2
2. Input: -4, Output: -30

Using the first point (4, 2):

\[ 2 = a \cdot 4^0 + b \cdot 4^1 \]
\[ 2 = a + 4b \]

Using the second point (-4, -30):

\[ -30 = a \cdot (-4)^0 + b \cdot (-4)^1 \]
\[ -30 = a - 4b \]

We now have a system of linear equations:

\[ a + 4b = 2 \]
\[ a - 4b = -30 \]

Adding these two equations will allow us to solve for \( a \):

\[ a + 4b = 2 \]
\[ + \] 
\[ a - 4b = -30 \]
\[ -------------- \]
\[ 2a = -28 \]

Solving for \( a \):

\[ a = -28 / 2 \]
\[ a = -14 \]

Next, we can substitute the value of \( a \) into one of our original equations to solve for \( b \). Let's use \( a + 4b = 2 \):

\[ -14 + 4b = 2 \]
\[ 4b = 2 + 14 \]
\[ 4b = 16 \]
\[ b = 16 / 4 \]
\[ b = 4 \]

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\[ y = -14x^0 + 4x^1 \]

Or more simply:

\[ y = -14 + 4x \]

    To determine the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can consider the given points and plug them into the equation. The term \( ax^0 \) equals \( a \) since \( x^0 \) is 1 for any \( x \) that is not zero. So we need to identify the values of \( a \) and \( b \).

Given the data points, we can set up a system of equations. Let's use two points to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). For example, we can use the points (-10, -54) and (4, 2).

For the point (-10, -54):

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]
\[ -54 = a + (-10)b \]
\[ -54 = a - 10b \]
\[ (1) \]

Using the point (4, 2):

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]
\[ 2 = a + (4)b \]
\[ (2) \]

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns. We can solve this system for \( a \) and \( b \).

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

\[ -54 = a - 10b \]
\[ 2 = a + 4b \]

Subtracting the second from the first:

\[ -56 = -14b \]

Solving for \( b \):

\[ b = \frac{-56}{-14} = 4 \]

Now we substitute the value of \( b \) back into (2) to solve for \( a \):

\[ 2 = a + 4(4) \]
\[ 2 = a + 16 \]
\[ a = 2 - 16 \]
\[ a = -14 \]

Therefore, the function in the exact form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) is:

\[ y = -14x^0 + 4x^1 \]
\[ y = -14 + 4x \]

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the given input-output pairs, we need to determine the constants a and b. The term ax^0 is simply a, as anything to the power of 0 is 1, and bx^1 is the same as bx, since anything to the power of 1 is itself.

Given the input-output pairs:

For x = -10, y = -54 gives us the equation: -54 = a - 10b
For x = 4, y = 2 gives us the equation: 2 = a + 4b
For x = -20, y = -94 gives us the equation: -94 = a - 20b
For x = 4 (repeated), y = 2 gives us the same equation as before: 2 = a + 4b
For x = -4, y = -30 gives us the equation: -30 = a - 4b

We can use the two unique equations from the different values of x (-10 and 4) to solve for a and b.

-54 = a - 10b   ... (1)
2 = a + 4b      ... (2)

Let's solve this system of equations. We can multiply equation (2) by 2 to help eliminate a:

2 * 2 = 2a + 2 * 4b
4 = 2a + 8b       ... (3)

Now let's add equation (1) to equation (3):

-54 + 4 = (a - 10b) + (2a + 8b)
-50 = 3a - 2b

Now, we want to isolate a, so let's multiply equation (2) by 3:

3 * 2 = 3a + 3 * 4b
6 = 3a + 12b      ... (4)

Subtract equation (4) from equation (-50 = 3a - 2b):

-50 - 6 = 3a - 2b - (3a + 12b)
-56 = -14b

Solving for b:

b = -56 / -14
b = 4

We can substitute this value back into equation (2) to solve for a:

2 = a + 4(4)
2 = a + 16

Subtract 16 from both sides to solve for a:

2 - 16 = a
a = -14

Thus, the function is:

y = -14x^0 + 4x^1
y = -14 + 4x

We can use any two pairs of inputs and outputs to determine the values of a and b. Let's take the input-output pairs (-11, -20) and (-8, -14).

For the first pair, when the input is -11 and the output is -20, the equation is:
-20 = a + b(-11)
-20 = a - 11b   [1]

For the second pair, when the input is -8 and the output is -14:
-14 = a + b(-8)
-14 = a - 8b   [2]

We now have a system of two equations:
[1] -20 = a - 11b
[2] -14 = a - 8b

We can solve for a and b by subtracting equation [2] from equation [1]:

(-20) - (-14) = (a - 11b) - (a - 8b)
-6 = -3b
b = -6 / -3
b = 2

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it into either equation [1] or [2] to find a. We'll use equation [2]:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we need to determine the coefficients ""a"" and ""b"". This form is essentially y = a + bx, because x^0 is equal to 1 and x^1 is x. So we are looking for a linear relationship of the form y = a + bx.

Using two data points, we can set up a system of equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Let's use the following two points: (-11, -20) and (-2, -2).

For the first point:
-20 = a * (-11)^0 + b * (-11)
-20 = a + b * (-11)

For the second point:
-2 = a * (-2)^0 + b * (-2)
-2 = a - 2b

Now we have two equations with two variables:

1) a - 11b = -20
2) a - 2b = -2

We can solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. I'll use elimination:

Multiply the second equation by 5.5 (to make the 'b' coefficients equal in magnitude):

1) a - 11b = -20
2) 5.5a - 11b = -11

Now subtract the second equation from the first equation:

1) a - 11b = -20
- 
2) 5.5a - 11b = -11
----------------------
-4.5a = -9

Divide by -4.5 to solve for 'a':

a = -9 / -4.5
a = 2

Now use this 'a' value in either equation to solve for 'b'. Let's use equation 2:

2 - 2b = -2
-2b = -4
b = -4 / -2

1. For input -11 and output -20: -20 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)
2. For input -2 and output -2: -2 = a(-2)^0 + b(-2)

Since x^0 is always 1, these equations simplify to:

1. -20 = a - 11b
2. -2 = a - 2b

Now let's solve this system of linear equations for a and b. We can use the method of substitution or elimination. For simplicity, let's use elimination by multiplying the second equation by 5.5 (to equalize the coefficient of b with the first equation):

5.5 * (-2 = a - 2b) ⇒ -11 = 5.5a - 11b

Now we have the system:

1. -20 = a - 11b
2. -11 = 5.5a - 11b

Let’s subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

-20 - (-11) = a - 11b - (5.5a - 11b)
-9 = a - 11b - 5.5a + 11b
-9 = -4.5a
a = 2

The equation can be thought of as y = a + bx where:
- a is the y-intercept, the value of y when x is 0.
- b is the slope, the rate at which y changes per unit increase in x.

Given the symmetry in input-output pairs (-17, -310) and (17, 302), it's evident that b is approximately 18 since the increase of 34 in x yields an increase of 612 in y (from -310 to 302), and 612/34 = 18.

Solve for b:
b = 126 / 7
b = 18

Now that we have b, we can solve for a by plugging b into equation (3):

176 = a + 10(18)
176 = a + 180
a = 176 - 180
a = -4

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find a linear relationship that fits the given input-output pairs, we can use the general form of the linear equation you've provided: \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\), since \(x^0 = 1\) for any x except for x = 0.

Looking at the inputs and outputs, it seems that when the input is positive, the output is close to but slightly less than \(18 \times \text{Input}\), and when the input is negative, the output is slightly more than \(18 \times \text{Input}\). 

To determine the coefficients a and b, we can use any two points to form a system of linear equations. Let's use the points (17, 302) and (-17, -310):

For the point (17, 302):
\(302 = a + 17b\)

For the point (-17, -310):
\(-310 = a - 17b\)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Adding both equations:
\[ 302 - 310 = a + 17b + a - 17b \]
\[ -8 = 2a \]
\[ a = -4 \]

Now, let's solve for b using the equation from the point (17, 302):
\[ 302 = -4 + 17b \]
\[ 306 = 17b \]
\[ b = \frac{306}{17} \]
\[ b = 18 \]

Thus, the function that fits the data is:

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to understand that \( ax^0 \) is essentially a constant because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x (except for x=0 where it's undefined). The term \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \). We therefore need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that will satisfy the given input-output pairs.

Given the pairs:

1. Input: -16, Output: 297
2. Input: 18, Output: -315
3. (Repeated, so we don't need to use it again)
4. Input: -5, Output: 99
5. Input: 5, Output: -81

Let us take two pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). It's often simpler to solve with pairs that are symmetric about the origin since their constant term will cancel each other out. We will use pairs 4 and 5.

For pair 4:
\( 99 = a \cdot (-5)^0 + b \cdot (-5) \)
\( 99 = a - 5b \)  ...[Equation 1]

For pair 5:
\( -81 = a \cdot 5^0 + b \cdot 5 \)
\( -81 = a + 5b \)  ...[Equation 2]

Adding Equations 1 and 2 to eliminate \( b \), we get:
\( 99 - 81 = a - 5b + a + 5b \)
\( 18 = 2a \)
\( a = 9 \)

Substitute \( a = 9 \) back into Equation 1 or 2 to solve for \( b \), let's use Equation 2:
\( -81 = 9 + 5b \)
\( -81 - 9 = 5b \)
\( -90 = 5b \)
\( b = -18 \)

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the given input-output pairs, we first need to recognize that ax^0 is mathematically the same as a constant term (since any number to the power of zero is 1), and bx^1 is simply bx (since any number to the power of one is itself). Therefore, our function will look like y = a + bx.

Given the data pairs:

- When x = -16, y = 297
- When x = 18, y = -315
- When x = -16, y = 297 (repeated)
- When x = -5, y = 99
- When x = 5, y = -81

We have a repeated data pair (-16, 297), which doesn't provide us with any new information so we can disregard one instance of it for the calculation. We have four unique pairs to work with.

We need to find constants a and b that satisfy all four input-output pairs. To do this, we can set up a system of equations based on the input-output pairs and solve for a and b.

Let's set up the system of equations using the given pairs:

For x = -16, y = 297:
297 = a + b(-16) => 297 = a - 16b [1]

For x = 18, y = -315:
-315 = a + b(18) => -315 = a + 18b [2]

For x = -5, y = 99:
99 = a + b(-5) => 99 = a - 5b [3]

For x = 5, y = -81:
-81 = a + b(5) => -81 = a + 5b [4]

To solve for a and b, we can use any two of these equations and solve the system. Let's use equations [1] and [2]:

297 = a - 16b [1]
-315 = a + 18b [2]

Adding the two equations, we eliminate a:

297 - 315 = (a - 16b) + (a + 18b)
-18 = 2a + 2b
-9 = a + b
a = -9 - b [5]

Now, let's replace a in equation [1] with the expression we found in [5]:

297 = (-9 - b) - 16b
297 = -9 - 17b
306 = -17b
b = -306 / 17
b = -18

Now we use the expression for a from [5] and plug in the value of b:

a = -9 - (-18)
a = -9 + 18
a = 9

We have now found a and b. The equation that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = 9x^0 - 18x^1
y = 9 - 18x

This is the function that describes the relationship based on the given data points.

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to solve for the constants a and b. The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 equals 1 for any x other than 0.

We have the following pairs of inputs and outputs:

1. Input: -16 => Output: 297
2. Input: 18 => Output: -315
3. Input: -16 => Output: 297 (repeated, not needed for calculation)
4. Input: -5 => Output: 99
5. Input: 5 => Output: -81

Let's apply these input-output pairs to our formula:

For Input = -16 and Output = 297:
297 = a + b(-16)

For Input = 18 and Output = -315:
-315 = a + b(18)

We now have a system of two equations:

1) 297 = a - 16b
2) -315 = a + 18b

Let's solve this system for a and b.

First, let's rearrange the equations for a:
a = 297 + 16b (from 1)
a = -315 - 18b (from 2)

Now set both equations for a equal to each other and solve for b:
297 + 16b = -315 - 18b
34b = -612
b = -612 / 34
b = -18

Now we'll substitute b back into one of the equations to find a. We can use either, so let's use the first one:
a = 297 + 16b
a = 297 + 16(-18)
a = 297 - 288
a = 9

    To find the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1` that fits the given inputs and outputs, we need to find the values of `a` and `b` such that the outputs match the given inputs.

This equation can be simplified to:

y = a + bx

Since ax^0 is always a (because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1), we can write our function as y = a + bx. Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we have the following equations:

1) a - 16b = 297  (Input: -16, Output: 297)
2) a + 18b = -315 (Input: 18, Output: -315)
3) a - 16b = 297  (Duplicate of the first pair, can be ignored)
4) a - 5b = 99    (Input: -5, Output: 99)
5) a + 5b = -81   (Input: 5, Output: -81)

We can see that 1) and 3) are duplicates, so we only need to use one of them. We have two pairs of equations with opposite input values (4) and 5)). Notice that adding these two equations will eliminate b:

a - 5b + a + 5b = 99 + (-81),
2a = 18,
a = 9.

Now that we have a, we can use it to find b using either one of the pairs:

9 + 18b = -315,
18b = -315 - 9,
18b = -324,
b = -324 / 18,
b = -18.

So the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 9 - 18x

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we want to find the coefficients a and b that best describe the relationship between the inputs and the outputs. Here, ax^0 is a constant since any number to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, we have:

y = a + bx

Now, we need to find the values of a and b using the provided input-output pairs. Let's use the two distinct pairs (-16, 297) and (18, -315) to set up our system of equations:

For the input -16:
297 = a + b(-16)
297 = a - 16b ... (Equation 1)

For the input 18:
-315 = a + b(18)
-315 = a + 18b ... (Equation 2)

We can solve this system of equations using various methods, such as substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Adding Equation 1 to Equation 2 to eliminate a gives us:
297 - 315 = a - 16b + a + 18b
-18 = 2a + 2b
-9 = a + b ... (Equation 3)

Now, let's multiply Equation 1 by 18 and Equation 2 by 16:
18(297) = 18a - 288b
16(-315) = 16a + 288b

Adding these two equations to eliminate b gives us:
18(297) + 16(-315) = (18a + 16a)
5346 - 5040 = 34a

    To solve this problem, I'll assume the relationship between the input (x) and the output (y) is linear, which can be described by the function y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since ax^0 is a constant (because any number to the power of zero is 1), we can rewrite the function as y = a + bx, where a and b are coefficients we need to determine.

Let's use the given input-output pairs to find a and b. Here are two pairs from the data provided:

1) For input x = -18, output y = -265:
-265 = a + b(-18)

2) For input x = 19, output y = 253:
253 = a + b(19)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

a - 18b = -265
a + 19b = 253

Solving this system with the method of substitution or elimination will give us the values of a and b. Let's use elimination:

Adding the two equations, we eliminate a:
a - 18b + a + 19b = -265 + 253
2a + b = -12

Now, let's isolate b:
b = -12 - 2a

Let's substitute b from the first equation (using x = -18, y = -265):
a - 18(-12 - 2a) = -265
a + 216 + 36a = -265
37a = -265 - 216
37a = -481

Now we solve for a:
a = -481 / 37
a = -13 (approximation)

We can substitute this approximated value of a into the equation for b:
b = -12 - 2(-13)
b = -12 + 26
b = 14

    To determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) in the function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\) because \(x^0\) is \(1\) for any \(x\) that isn't \(0\), we can use two of the given input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations.

Let's use the input-output pairs \((-18, -265)\) and \( (19, 253)\).

Substituting the first pair into the function, we get:
\( -265 = a + b(-18) \)

Substituting the second pair into the function, we get:
\( 253 = a + b(19) \)

To solve for \(a\) and \(b\), we can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

\( (253) - (-265) = (a + 19b) - (a - 18b) \)
\( 253 + 265 = a + 19b - a + 18b \)

We can set this up as a system of equations:

Let's solve for \( a \) and \( b \) by using these two equations.

The first equation is:

\[ -265 = a - 18b \]
\[ a = -265 + 18b \]

Let's substitute \( a \) into the second equation:

\[ 253 = -265 + 18b + 19b \]
\[ 253 = -265 + 37b \]
\[ 37b = 253 + 265 \]
\[ 37b = 518 \]

We can use two of the given data points to calculate the coefficients \( a \) (y-intercept) and \( b \) (slope) of the line. Let's use the following two data points for our calculation:

Point 1: (x1, y1) = (-18, -265)
Point 2: (x2, y2) = (19, 253)

Now let's set up two equations based on the two points and the line equation \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \):

1. \( -265 = a + b(-18) \)
2. \( 253 = a + b(19) \)

Now we will solve these two linear equations for \( a \) and \( b \):

\( -265 + 253 = (a - 18b) + (a + 19b) \)
\( -12 = 2a + b \)

Since we have \( 2a \) on the right side, we'll subtract \( b \) from both sides to isolate \( a \):

\( -12 - b = 2a \)
\( a = \frac{-12 - b}{2} \)        ...(5)

Now let's subtract equation (3) from equation (4) to eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( b \):

We can now use the point (x₁, y₁) = (-18, -265) and substitute 'b' into the equation to find 'a':

\[ -265 = a + 14(-18) \]
\[ -265 = a - 252 \]
\[ a = -265 + 252 \]
\[ a = -13 \]

So, 'a' is -13.

The function that seems to capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that ax^0 is a constant term (since any number to the power of zero is 1) and bx^1 is simply bx (because any number to the power of one is itself).

Given the input and output pairs, we need to extract the constant term (a) and the coefficient of x (b) from the data.

Let's look at the given pairs:

1. When x = 0, y = -15. This immediately gives us the constant term, because when x is 0, the term involving x (bx) goes away, and we’re left with y = a*1, so a = -15.

Now, we only need to find the value of b. Let's use one of the other points for that:

2. When x = 5, y = 5. Plugging these into the equation, we get:

5 = -15 + b*5

Now, let's solve for b:

b*5 = 5 + 15

b*5 = 20

b = 20 / 5

b = 4

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

y = -15 + 4x

y = -15x^0 + 4x^1

    We have a series of inputs (x) and outputs (y), and we need to find the relationship in the form of a linear equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx, because x^0 is 1 for any x except for x = 0.

Let's analyze the given points:

1. When x = 0, y = -15 implies that a = -15, because the term bx will be zero and y should then equal a (the constant term).

Now that we know a = -15, the equation takes the form: y = -15 + bx.

2. Let's find the coefficient b using two points: (x1, y1) = (-5, -35) and (x2, y2) = (5, 5).

We can use the point-slope form of a line equation to solve for b:

y2 - y1 = b(x2 - x1),

5 - (-35) = b(5 - (-5)),

-35 = -15 + b(-5)
-35 + 15 = -5b

b = 4

-15 = a + b(0) => -15 = a

We now have our a coefficient.

For the input-output pair (-5, -35):

    To determine the function that models the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can observe that the output increases as the input increases, which suggests a linear relationship between x and y. Our function is in the form of:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Where:
- y is the output.
- x is the input.
- a and b are constants we need to determine.

Since ax^0 is a constant (because anything raised to the 0 power is 1), we can replace ax^0 with just 'a'. Hence, our function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, let's plug in the values to find 'a' and 'b'.

For Input: 0, Output: -15, we get:
-15 = a + b(0)
-15 = a

Now we know that 'a' is -15.

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given input-output pairs, we must determine the constants a and b.

The general form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx, because x^0 is equal to 1 for any x except for x = 0 (it is a mathematical constant that any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 is 1).

133 = a + 9(15)
133 = a + 135
a = 133 - 135

    To come up with a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the given input-output relationship, one can notice that x^0 is always 1 for any x not equal to zero, so ax^0 is essentially a constant term a. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx, which is a linear function.

Let's use two data points to determine the coefficients a and b:

Using the points (9, 133) and (19, 283), let's set up two equations based on the form y = a + bx:

1. For the input 9:
133 = a + b(9)

2. For the input 19:
283 = a + b(19)

Now, let's solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

From equation 1:
a = 133 - 9b

Substitute the expression for a from equation 1 into equation 2:
283 = (133 - 9b) + 19b
283 = 133 + 10b
150 = 10b
b = 15

Therefore, the function is equivalent to y = a + bx where a and b are constants.

To find the constants a and b, we need to create a system of equations using the data pairs provided. Let's use two pairs of input/output values to solve for a and b.

Using inputs 9 and 19 with their respective outputs 133 and 283:

1. For input 9 and output 133:
133 = a + 9b

2. For input 19 and output 283:
283 = a + 19b

Now, we can solve this system of equations for a and b. We can do this by using the elimination method, subtracting equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a:

(283 = a + 19b) - (133 = a + 9b)
150 = 10b
b = 15

For the second point (-2, -21):
-21 = a + b(-2) [Equation 2]

Now we'll solve this system of equations simultaneously.

Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2 to eliminate b, we get:
59 - 21 = a + 2b + a - 2b
38 = 2a
a = 19

Now insert the value of a into Equation 1 to solve for b:
59 = 19 + b(2)
59 - 19 = 2b
40 = 2b
b = 20

Thus, a = 19 and b = 20, and the function is:
y = 19 + 20x

    Given the input-output pairs, I will calculate the coefficients 'a' and 'b' for the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for any x that is not zero.

Let's use two of the given input-output pairs to calculate 'a' and 'b'. I'll use the pairs (2, 59) and (-16, -301).

Pair 1: Input = 2, Output = 59,
59 = a + b(2)

Pair 2: Input = -16, Output = -301,
-301 = a + b(-16)

Now we have a system of equations:

1) 59 = a + 2b
2) -301 = a - 16b

Let's solve this system for 'a' and 'b'.

From equation 1, we can express 'a' in terms of 'b':
a = 59 - 2b

Now substitute 'a' from this expression into equation 2:

-301 = (59 - 2b) - 16b
-301 = 59 - 18b
-360 = -18b
b = 20

Now, using the value of b, we can find a:

a = 59 - 2(20)
a = 59 - 40
a = 19

Thus, the function that describes the data appears to be y = 19 + 20x. However, let's verify this function with the other given points to ensure there's no mistake:

For input -5:
y = 19 + 20(-5)
y = 19 - 100
y = -81

For input 3:
y = 19 + 20(3)
y = 19 + 60
y = 79

For input -2:
y = 19 + 20(-2)
y = 19 - 40
y = -21

The verification matches the given outputs, so the function that describes the data is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the data, we need to find the values of the coefficients a and b.

This form is essentially the linear equation y = a + bx, where ax^0 = a (since any number raised to the 0th power is 1) and bx^1 = bx (since any number raised to the 1st power is itself).

First, we can take any two given input-output pairs to construct a system of equations to solve for a and b. Let's use the pairs (13, 55) and (-20, -44):

For input 13: 55 = a + b(13)
For input -20: -44 = a + b(-20)

We now have a system of two equations:

1) 55 = a + 13b
2) -44 = a - 20b

Let's solve this system by using the method of elimination or substitution. I'll subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate a:

55 - (-44) = (a + 13b) - (a - 20b)
55 + 44 = a + 13b - a + 20b
99 = 33b

Now, solve for b:

b = 99 / 33
b = 3

Now we have the value for b, we can substitute it back into equation 1 to find a:

55 = a + 13(3)
55 = a + 39
a = 55 - 39
a = 16

So the function that describes the data is:

y = 16 + 3x

Or, in the requested form:

y = 16x^0 + 3x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 based on the gave input-output pairs, we need to understand that ax^0 is essentially a constant term (since x^0 is always equal to 1), and bx^1 is simply bx (because any number to the power of 1 is itself). So we are looking for a linear function of the form:

y = a + bx

Now, let's analyze the input-output pairs given:

1. For input 13, output is 55, so:
55 = a + 13b

2. For input -20, output is -44:
-44 = a - 20b

3. For input 15, output is 61:
61 = a + 15b

4. For input -1, output is 13:
13 = a - b

5. For input -14, output is -26:
-26 = a - 14b

To simplify the process of finding 'a' and 'b', we can use any two of these equations and solve them as a system of linear equations. Let's use equations (1) and (4) because they have numbers that are easy to work with.

Equation (1): 55 = a + 13b -> a = 55 - 13b
Equation (4): 13 = a - b

Plugging the expression for 'a' from equation (1) into equation (4), we get:
13 = (55 - 13b) - b
13 = 55 - 13b - b
13 = 55 - 14b
14b = 55 - 13
14b = 42
b = 42 / 14
b = 3

Now, since we have the value for b, we can use it to find 'a' from either equation (1) or (4). Using equation (1):
a = 55 - 13b
a = 55 - 13(3)
a = 55 - 39
a = 16

So, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:
y = a + bx
y = 16 + 3x

Thus, in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, the function would be:
y = 16x^0 + 3x^1

y = 4

Therefore, the output is:

Output: 4",4,True,"[3, 16]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we must remember that x^0 is always 1 for any x that isn't 0. Therefore, y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx. We are looking for values of 'a' and 'b' that fit the given data points. We can set up a system of equations using the given input-output pairs to solve for a and b.

To illustrate this with two points:

1. Using the input 13 and output 55:
55 = a(13^0) + b(13)
55 = a + 13b

2. Using the input -20 and output -44:
-44 = a(-20^0) + b(-20)
-44 = a - 20b

We can now solve this system of equations to find the values of 'a' and 'b'. To simplify the process, we can substitute the values of 'a' and 'b' from one equation into the other. However, because we have more than two points, we need to ensure that whatever 'a' and 'b' we find, the equation must fit all points. This means we need to use a method to find a best-fit line, such as least squares, but it can also be done with simple algebra if the points lie on a straight line.

Let's use the given points to create more equations and then we will solve the system:

3. Using the input 15 and output 61:
61 = a + 15b

4. Using the input -1 and output 13:
13 = a - b

5. Using the input -14 and output -26:
-26 = a - 14b

Now, we will solve one of these equations for 'a' and substitute that into the other equations. It's easiest to solve the equation from point 4 for 'a', since the coefficients are simple:

a = 13 + b

Substitute a into the first equation:
55 = (13 + b) + 13b
55 = 13 + 14b
42 = 14b
b = 3

Now substitute b back into the equation for 'a':

a = 13 + 3
a = 16

So the function that best describes the data set given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = 16 + 3x

It should be noted that without analyzing the error for all points or using a least squares fit, this is an approximation, but it fits the given points precisely:

For input 13: y = 16 + 3(13) = 16 + 39 = 55 (matches the output)
For input -20: y = 16 + 3(-20) = 16 - 60 = -44 (matches the output)
And so on for the other points. Therefore, the function describing this data is:

y = 16 + 3x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To define the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of the coefficients a and b. Given that x^0 equals 1 for any value of x (excluding x=0), this simplifies our function to y = a + bx. Now, we just need to find the values of a and b that result in the outputs given for each corresponding input.

Let's use two sets of inputs and outputs to set up two equations in order to solve for a and b:

For Input: 13, Output: 55
55 = a + b(13)

For Input: -20, Output: -44
-44 = a + b(-20)

We now have the following system of equations:

1) a + 13b = 55
2) a - 20b = -44

Let's solve this system for a and b:

From equation 1:
a = 55 - 13b

Substitute the above expression for a in equation 2:
(55 - 13b) - 20b = -44
55 - 13b - 20b = -44
55 - 33b = -44
-33b = -44 - 55
-33b = -99
b = -99 / -33
b = 3

Now, let's find a by substituting b = 3 into equation 1:
a + 13(3) = 55
a + 39 = 55
a = 55 - 39
a = 16

Thus, our function is y = a + bx, where a = 16 and b = 3:

    To find the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we want to determine the values of the constants \( a \) and \( b \). Given that \( x^0 \) is 1 for any x (except for x=0), the equation simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Let's use two points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). We'll use the input-output pairs (13, 55) and (-20, -44). Substituting the respective values into the equation gives us two equations:

\( y_1 = a + b(13) \) which becomes \( 55 = a + 13b \)

\( y_2 = a + b(-20) \) which becomes \( -44 = a - 20b \)

Now we solve this system of equations:

\( 55 = a + 13b \) ...(1)
\( -44 = a - 20b \) ...(2)

We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) by using the elimination or substitution method. I'll use the elimination method here:

Add the two equations together to eliminate \( a \):

\( 55 - 44 = (a + 13b) + (a - 20b) \)
\( 11 = 2a - 7b \) ...(3)

Now solve equation (3) for \( a \), we can divide both sides by 2 to get:

\( a - \frac{7}{2}b = \frac{11}{2} \) ...(4)

Returning to equation (1):

\( 55 = a + 13b \)

Now we substitute \( a \) from equation (4) into this equation:

\( 55 = \frac{11}{2} + \frac{7}{2}b + 13b \)
\( 55 = \frac{11}{2} + \frac{33}{2}b \)

Multiply through by 2 to clear the fraction:

\( 110 = 11 + 33b \)
\( 99 = 33b \)
\( b = 3 \)

Now substitute the value of \( b \) into equation (4) to find \( a \):

\( a - \frac{7}{2}(3) = \frac{11}{2} \)
\( a - \frac{21}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \)
\( a = \frac{11}{2} + \frac{21}{2} \)
\( a = \frac{32}{2} \)
\( a = 16 \)

    To derive a function y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which is a linear function in the form y = b * x + a, where a represents the y-intercept and b represents the slope of the line), we need to solve for a and b using the given input-output pairs.

We can use two input-output pairs to form two equations and solve for a and b. Let's use the pairs (-11, 72) and (-3, 8).

1) For the input -11 and output 72:
72 = a * (-11)^0 + b * (-11)
Since any number to the 0 power is 1, we can simplify this to:
72 = a - 11b

2) For the input -3 and output 8:
8 = a * (-3)^0 + b * (-3)
Similarly, this simplifies to:
8 = a - 3b

Now we have a system of two equations:
a - 11b = 72     ...(1)
a - 3b = 8       ...(2)

We can solve for a and b by subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):
(a - 11b) - (a - 3b) = 72 - 8
-11b + 3b = 64
-8b = 64
b = 64 / -8
b = -8

Now that we have b, we can plug it back into equation (2) to solve for a:

So, we need to find constants a and b such that y = a + bx fits the given set of input-output pairs.

8 = a + b(-3) → Equation 1

For the input 18 and output -160:
-160 = a + b(18) → Equation 2

a = 8 + 3b ... (3)

Now, substitute a from Equation (3) into Equation 2:

-160 = (8 + 3b) + 18b
-160 = 8 + 21b
-168 = 21b
b = -8

For \( x = -3 \):

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

\( 72 - 8 = a - 11b - (a - 3b) \)

\( a = 2b \)
\( a = 2(-8) \)
\( a = -16 \)

So our function is:
\( y = -16 + (-8)x \)
or simplified,
\( y = -16 - 8x \).

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given input-output pairs, we can treat this as a linear regression problem where x is the input and y is the output.

First, remember that x^0 is always 1 for any x that is not 0, so we are really looking for a function of the form y = a + bx, which is a linear equation with y-intercept a and slope b.

To solve this, we should find the best values for a and b based on the data provided. In most cases, the best approach would involve creating a system of equations or using linear algebra techniques like the least squares method to estimate the optimal values.

However, since we don't have the tools for complex calculations here, we can attempt to determine the pattern with the given data and find a solution by observation and inspection.

Let's transform the inputs and outputs into such equations:
1. For input 11: y = a + 11b = -204
2. For input -4: y = a - 4b = 66
3. For input -17: y = a - 17b = 300
4. For input -15: y = a - 15b = 264
5. For input 20: y = a + 20b = -366

Now let's try to find the pattern by examining the differences between inputs and corresponding changes in the outputs:

From input 11 to input 20, an increase of 9 in x corresponds to a decrease of 162 in y:
(a + 20b) - (a + 11b) = -366 - (-204)
9b = -162
b = -162 / 9
b = -18

Now we can use the value of b to find a by substituting it into one of the equations. Let's use input -4 for this:
a - 4(-18) = 66
a + 72 = 66
a = 66 - 72
a = -6

Now we have both values a and b, and we can write the function:
y = -6 + (-18)x
y = -6 - 18x

Writing it in the exact form requested:
Output: y = -6x^0 - 18x^1

    ","Using the function y = -6 - 18x, we can calculate the output for the input 7.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first need to understand that \( ax^0 \) is equal to \( a \) (since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 equals 1). Therefore, the function is essentially a linear function in the form of \( y = a + bx \).

Based on this, we can use two points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's take the following two points from the given data: (11, -204) and (-4, 66). We can create a system of two equations:

1. \( -204 = a + 11b \)
2. \( 66 = a - 4b \)

Now we can solve these equations simultaneously to find \( a \) and \( b \).

First, we'll multiply the second equation by 11 to align the \( a \) terms:

\( 66 * 11 = a * 11 - 4b * 11 \)
\( 726 = 11a - 44b \)

Now we have two equations that we can use to eliminate one of the variables:

\( -204 = a + 11b \)
\( 726 = 11a - 44b \)

Let's multiply the first equation by 11, so we can add the equations to eliminate \( a \):

\( -204 * 11 = 11a + 121b \)
\( 726 = 11a - 44b \)

Adding these up:

\( -2244 + 726 = 11a + 121b + 11a - 44b \)
\( -1518 = 22a + 77b \)

We can simplify this by dividing by 22:

\( -69 = a + 3.5b \)

Now let's isolate \( a \) in the second original equation:

\( 66 = a - 4b \)
\( a = 66 + 4b \)

Substitute this into the last equation we derived:

\( -69 = (66 + 4b) + 3.5b \)
\( -135 = 7.5b \)
\( b = -18 \)

Now we can substitute \( b \) back into \( a = 66 + 4b \) to find \( a \):

\( a = 66 + 4(-18) \)
\( a = 66 - 72 \)
\( a = -6 \)

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

\( y = -6 + (-18)x \)
\( y = -6 - 18x \)

This is already simplified and in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), so:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we need to understand the terms ax^0 and bx^1.

- ax^0 is a constant term because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So ax^0 will be a constant a.
- bx^1 is a linear term because any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself. So bx^1 will be bx.

We have the following pairs of inputs and outputs (x, y):

1. (11, -204)
2. (-4, 66)
3. (-17, 300)
4. (-15, 264)
5. (20, -366)

We need to solve for the coefficients a and b such that y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which simplifies to y = a + bx).

Using two pairs of inputs/outputs to set up a system of two equations, we can solve for a and b.

For simplicity, let's pick the following two points: (11, -204) and (-4, 66).

So we have two equations to solve for a and b:

1. -204 = a + 11b
2. 66 = a - 4b

Let's solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. I will use elimination:

Multiply both sides of the second equation by 11 to match the coefficient of b in the first equation:

11 * 66 = 11a - 44b   -> (1)
726 = 11a - 44b

Now we can subtract equation (1) from the first equation:

-204 - 726 = a + 11b - (11a - 44b)
-930 = -10a + 55b
93 = a - 5.5b

Now we have a new system:
1. 66 = a - 4b
2. 93 = a - 5.5b

Subtract the first equation from the second:

93 - 66 = (a - 5.5b) - (a - 4b)
27 = -1.5b
b = -18

Now we plug in the value of b into one of our original equations to find a:

66 = a - 4(-18)
66 = a + 72
a = -6

So the final function is:

y = -6x^0 - 18x^1
y = -6 - 18x

Please note that this function is exactly derived from the two points that were chosen, and while it reflects the relationship between x and y for these points, it may not perfectly predict the output for all possible inputs unless all given points lie exactly on a line defined by this function.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, where a and b are constants, we'll need to find the values of a and b that best fit the given input-output pairs.

The equation can be simplified to y = a + bx since x^0 = 1 for any x that isn't zero.

For each input-output pair (x, y), we have:

For x = 11: y = a + b(11) = -204
For x = -4: y = a + b(-4) = 66
For x = -17: y = a + b(-17) = 300
For x = -15: y = a + b(-15) = 264
For x = 20: y = a + b(20) = -366

We have a system of equations, and we can use any two pairs to find the values of a and b. Let's use the first two pairs for simplicity:

1) a + 11b = -204
2) a -  4b = 66

Now, let’s solve this system of equations. By subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

(1) - (2) => (a + 11b) - (a - 4b) = -204 - 66
=> a + 11b - a + 4b = -270
=> 15b = -270
=> b = -270 / 15
=> b = -18

Using the value of b in the second equation:

a - 4(-18) = 66
a + 72 = 66
a = 66 - 72
a = -6

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for any x except for x = 0, we need to determine the constants a and b such that this linear function fits the given input-output pairs.

Given the pairs:
- (11, -204) -> -204 = a + 11b
- (-4, 66) -> 66 = a - 4b
- (-17, 300) -> 300 = a - 17b
- (-15, 264) -> 264 = a - 15b
- (20, -366) -> -366 = a + 20b

We can set up a system of equations from these pairs. To solve for a and b, we need to use two of these equations. Let me show you the process using the first two equations:

1) -204 = a + 11b
2) 66 = a - 4b

Now we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a and solve for b:

-204 - 66 = (a + 11b) - (a - 4b)
-270 = 15b
b = -270 / 15
b = -18

Now we'll plug this value of b into one of the original equations to find a. Let's use equation 2:

    Based on the provided inputs and outputs, we can set up a linear system to find the coefficients a and b for the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. This form simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is always 1 for any x that is not zero.

Let's create equations based on the inputs and outputs:

For the input -12 and output 9:
9 = a + b(-12)

For the input 20 and output -55:
-55 = a + b(20)

For the input -4 and output -7:
-7 = a + b(-4)

For the input -10 and output 5:
5 = a + b(-10)

For the input 8 and output -31:
-31 = a + b(8)

We have a system of five equations with two unknowns. However, we do not necessarily need to use all five equations because it's possible that some of them are outliers or that the system has no exact solution due to measurement errors or noise in the data. We may use various methods such as least squares to find the best fit line for the given points.

But assuming these points should exactly fit a line, we can take any two points to solve for a and b. Let's pick two equations to form a system with two variables:

Using the inputs -12 and 20 with their corresponding outputs 9 and -55:

1) 9 = a - 12b
2) -55 = a + 20b

These can be solved simultaneously. First, let's solve the first equation for a:

a = 9 + 12b

Now plug this into the second equation:

-55 = (9 + 12b) + 20b

Combine like terms:

-55 = 9 + 32b
-55 - 9 = 32b
-64 = 32b

Divide by 32 to get b:

b = -64 / 32
b = -2

Now plug b back into the equation for a:

a = 9 + 12(-2)
a = 9 - 24
a = -15

So the function with the given linear form that fits the two points (-12, 9) and (20, -55) is:

y = -15 + (-2)x
y = -15 - 2x

For input -4: y = -15 - 2(-4) = -15 + 8 = -7 [this matches the output for -4]
For input -10: y = -15 - 2(-10) = -15 + 20 = 5 [this matches the output for -10]
For input 8: y = -15 - 2(8) = -15 - 16 = -31 [this matches the output for 8]

    Firstly, the general form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to:

y = a + bx

This is because anything to the power of zero is 1, so ax^0 is just a, and x^1 is just x.

Given this form, let's plug in the input-output pairs to create a system of equations:

1. For Input: -12, Output: 9
9 = a + (-12)b

2. For Input: 20, Output: -55

5. For Input: 8, Output: -31
-31 = a + (8)b

Now we have a system of linear equations. Since we have 5 equations with only 2 unknowns, the system is overdetermined. Typically, with more equations than unknowns, there's no perfect solution that satisfies all equations (unless some of the equations are dependent). However, we can try to find the best approximate solution using the method of least squares or any other statistical method that fits a line to the data points.

But the system asked for an exact fit, and with an overdetermined system, we might not have a consistent solution that fits perfectly. However, for the sake of the exercise, I'll show you how to solve for 'a' and 'b' using two of the equations, keeping in mind that the solution might not perfectly fit the other data points.

Let's use the first and second equations as an example:

9 = a - 12b
-55 = a + 20b

Now we solve these two equations simultaneously:

Add the two equations:
9 - 55 = a - 12b + a + 20b
-46 = 2a + 8b
-23 = a + 4b ... (3)

Now subtract the second equation from the first:
9 + 55 = a - 12b - (a + 20b)
64 = -32b
b = -2

Substitute 'b' into equation (3):
-23 = a + 4(-2)
-23 = a - 8
a = -15

The estimated function that relates inputs to outputs using just the first two data points is:
y = -15 - 2x

Again, this function is unlikely to perfectly fit the other points given the overdetermined nature of the original problem, but it fits the first two points exactly. A more sophisticated method like least squares regression or another type of fitting would be necessary to find the function that best describes all data points.

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find the coefficient values for a and b that best fit the given data.

The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 = 1 for any x that is not zero. (Note that we only have nonzero x values in our data, so we do not need to worry about the case where x = 0).

Let's consider the function in this simpler form:

y = a + bx

We can construct a system of equations using the given input-output pairs as follows:

1. a -12b = 9     (for input -12)
2. a + 20b = -55  (for input 20)
3. a - 4b = -7    (for input -4)
4. a -10b = 5     (for input -10)
5. a + 8b = -31   (for input 8)

We now have five equations with two unknowns, which typically would be over-determined. However, we can use these equations to find values for a and b that fit all of these points as closely as possible. In the real world, this would typically be done using methods such as least squares regression. However, because this system is exactly solvable (since it was probably contrived for this exercise), we shall proceed by solving for a and b.

By looking at the system of equations, we can see that if we add equations 1 and 2, we eliminate variable a:

a - 12b + a + 20b = 9 - 55
2a + 8b = -46
a + 4b = -23  (divide the entire equation by 2)

Now, we have a new equation with the same coefficients for a and b as equation 3:

a + 4b = -23  (from the addition of equations 1 and 2)
a - 4b = -7   (from input -4)

We can now add these two equations to solve for a:

a + 4b + a - 4b = -23 - 7
2a = -30
a = -15

Now that we have the value for a, we can solve for b using one of the original equations. Let's use equation 1:

a - 12b = 9

-12b = 24
b = -2

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) 9 = a - 12b
2) -55 = a + 20b

We can use the method of elimination or substitution to solve this system. For simplicity, let's use elimination. We can multiply the first equation by 20 and the second equation by 12 and then add the equations together to eliminate a:

20(9) = 20a - 20(12b)
12(-55) = 12a + 12(20b)

This gives us:

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the given inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b. This is essentially a linear equation of the form y = a + bx, since x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0.

Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to set up a system of equations:
1. For x = -12 and y = 9, the equation is 9 = a - 12b
2. For x = 20 and y = -55, the equation is -55 = a + 20b

Now, we can solve for a and b using these two equations.

From equation 1:
9 = a - 12b  =>  a = 9 + 12b  [Eq.1a]

Substitute the expression for a from Eq.1a into the second equation:

-55 = 9 + 32b
-55 - 9 = 32b
-64 = 32b
b = -64 / 32

a = 9 - 24
a = -15

Hence, the function is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we can recognize that ax^0 is essentially a constant term (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is a linear term in x. Thus, the general form is equivalent to:

y = a + bx

where a is the constant term and b is the coefficient of the x term.

Given the data points:
(-16, 82),
(-11, 52),
(14, -98),
(-18, 94),
(3, -32),

we need to determine the values of the constants 'a' and 'b' so that the line y = a + bx best fits these points.

To do this by hand is quite complex and involves either using methods such as least squares regression or solving a system of equations. However, for initial insights, we can use two points to find the slope (b) and then solve for the y-intercept (a).

Using the two points (-16, 82) and (14, -98), we can calculate the slope (b):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Substitute (x1, y1) = (-16, 82) and (x2, y2) = (14, -98):

b = (-98 - 82) / (14 - (-16))
b = (-180) / (30)
b = -6

So our function has the form:

y = a - 6x

Next, we can solve for 'a' using one of the points. Let's use the point (-16, 82):

82 = a - 6(-16)
82 = a + 96
a = 82 - 96
a = -14

Thus, the function that describes this data is:

y = -14 - 6x

This is in the requested form where the constant term (-14) corresponds to ax^0 and the linear coefficient (-6) to bx^1:

Output: y = -14x^0 - 6x^1

However, this method assumes that the provided data points all lie on a perfectly straight line, which may not be the case. In practical applications, a more robust statistical analysis would be performed to determine the best fit line for the data, especially with more than two points. If a precise fit is desired, advanced methods like least squares regression would be required to minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs over all the given data points.

    ","To find the output for the input 17 using the function y = -14 - 6x, we substitute x with 17:

y = -14 - 6(17)
y = -14 - 102
y = -116

Therefore, the output for the input 17 is -116.

Output: -116",-116,True,"[-6, -14]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first recognize that:

- ax^0 is simply a, since any number (except zero) raised to the power of zero is 1.
- bx^1 is bx, since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself.

We therefore need to find constants a and b such that:
y = a + bx

Let's use two data points to derive a system of equations and solve for a and b.

First, take the points (-16, 82) and (14, -98).

For the input -16 (x = -16), the output y is 82:
82 = a + b(-16) ... (1)

For the input 14 (x = 14), the output y is -98:
-98 = a + b(14) ... (2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

82 = a - 16b
-98 = a + 14b

Let's solve for a and b.

We can sum equations (1) and (2):

82 + (-98) = a - 16b + a + 14b
-16 = 2a - 2b

Divide both sides by 2:
-8 = a - b ... (3)

Now, let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

82 - (-98) = a - 16b - (a + 14b)
180 = -30b

Dividing both sides by -30:
b = -6

Now we will substitute b = -6 into equation (3) to solve for a:

-8 = a - (-6)
-8 = a + 6
a = -14

So, the function that describes the data is:

Output: y = -14 + (-6)x

Or simplifying by removing the parentheses:

Output: y = -14 - 6x

y = -104

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we will let y = ax^0 + bx^1, which can be simplified to y = a + bx, since x^0 is always 1.

Given the inputs and outputs, we have the following system of equations:

1. When x = -16, y = 82: 82 = a - 16b
2. When x = -11, y = 52: 52 = a - 11b
3. When x = 14, y = -98: -98 = a + 14b
4. When x = -18, y = 94: 94 = a - 18b
5. When x = 3, y = -32: -32 = a + 3b

With these five equations, we have a system with only two unknowns (a and b). We can use the method of substitution or elimination to solve for a and b. However, the method requires two equations. Since we have more than two, we can use linear regression or solve a matrix equation. But to keep it simple, we can check if there is a common difference between the x values and their respective y values.

Observing the pattern in changes of x and corresponding y values:

x: -16 ==> y: 82
x: -11 ==> y: 52 (increase x by 5, decrease y by 30)
x: 14  ==> y: -98 (increase x by 25, decrease y by 150)
x: -18 ==> y: 94 (decrease x by 32, increase y by 192)
x: 3   ==> y: -32 (increase x by 21, decrease y by 126)

Looking at the increases and decreases in x and y values, they don't give a direct linear relationship. But let's use the two closest x values to try and solve for a and b using linear equations:

Using equations 1 and 2 (inputs -16 and -11):
82 = a - 16b
52 = a - 11b

Subtract the second equation from the first:
(82 - 52) = (-16b + 16b) + (a - a)
30 = -5b
b = -6

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using one of the equations:
82 = a - 16(-6)
82 = a + 96
a = 82 - 96
a = -14

Therefore, the function that fits the given points is:

y = -14 + (-6)x

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can recognize this as a linear equation \( y = a + bx \), where \( a \) is the y-intercept and \( b \) is the slope of the line.

Given the data points:

1. (-16, 82)
2. (-11, 52)
3. (14, -98)
4. (-18, 94)
5. (3, -32)

We need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that fit these points well. Notice that since we only have two parameters, we cannot perfectly fit all points if the data is not perfectly linear. However, we can still attempt to find the best linear approximation possible.

First, note that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) different from zero (and since we're working with real numbers, this is always true), so the equation reduces to \( y = a + bx \).

Calculating \( b \) (slope):

We can use two points to find the slope. Let's take points (14, -98) and (-16, 82):

\( b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \)

\( b = \frac{-98 - 82}{14 - (-16)} \)

\( b = \frac{-180}{14 + 16} \)

\( b = \frac{-180}{30} \)

\( b = -6 \)

Now that we have the slope (\( b \)), we can substitute one of the points to find \( a \). Let's use point (14, -98):

\( -98 = a + (-6) \cdot 14 \)

\( -98 = a - 84 \)

\( a = -98 + 84 \)

\( a = -14 \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the given input-output relationship, we need to understand that ax^0 will always be a constant because any number raised to the zeroth power is 1. So ax^0 is equivalent to saying ""a"". Then bx^1 is just bx because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself. So we are looking for a function of the form y = a + bx.

Given the input-output pairs, we want to find values for a and b such that:

y = a + bx

We have the following pairs to work with:

1. Input: -16 Output: 82 -- (1)
2. Input: -11 Output: 52 -- (2)
3. Input: 14 Output: -98 -- (3)
4. Input: -18 Output: 94 -- (4)
5. Input: 3 Output: -32 -- (5)

Let's plug in these input-output pairs into our function:

1. 82 = a - 16b
2. 52 = a - 11b
3. -98 = a + 14b
4. 94 = a - 18b
5. -32 = a + 3b

Now, let's solve this system of equations to find a and b. One way to do this is to pick any two equations and solve them as a system to find a and b. We can optionally eliminate a from these equations by subtracting one from another:

(4) - (1): 94 - 82 = (a - 18b) - (a - 16b)
12 = -2b
b = -6

Now that we have b, let's find a. Plug b into one of the original equations; for instance, equation (1):

82 = a - 16b
82 = a - 16(-6)
82 = a + 96
a = 82 - 96
a = -14

    To write the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y), we note that ax^0 is simply a, since any number to the power of 0 is 1. So our function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have several pairs of (x, y) to work with:

1. (-18, -75)
2. (-1, -7)
3. (3, 9)
4. (2, 5)

We can use any two pairs to solve for a and b. Let's use pairs (1) and (3) for this purpose.

From pair (1):
-75 = a - 18b

From pair (3):
9 = a + 3b

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1) -75 = a - 18b
2) 9 = a + 3b

Let's solve for a and b by using the method of substitution or elimination. If we add equation 1 to equation 2, we can cancel out a and solve for b:

-75 + 9 = (a - 18b) + (a + 3b)
-66 = 2a - 15b

Now let's isolate for a in equation 2 and substitute it in the equation we just found:

a = 9 - 3b

Substituting into -66 = 2a - 15b:

-66 = 2(9 - 3b) - 15b
-66 = 18 - 6b - 15b
-66 = 18 - 21b
-66 - 18 = -21b
-84 = -21b

b = 84 / 21
b = 4

Now substitute b back into the equation for a:

a = 9 - 3b
a = 9 - 3(4)
a = 9 - 12
a = -3

Our function is thus y = a + bx, where a = -3 and b = 4:

\[ -7 = a - b \]

2. Using input 2 and output 5 gives us the equation:

Now, we can use these two equations to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Let's first rearrange the first equation to solve for 'a':

\[ a = -7 + b \]

Substituting this into the second equation:
\[ 5 = (-7 + b) + 2b \]

Let's take the pairs when \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 3 \):

When \( x = -1 \), the equation is:
\( -7 = a + b(-1) \) or \( -7 = a - b \) (Equation 1)

When \( x = 3 \), the equation is:
\( 9 = a + b(3) \) or \( 9 = a + 3b \) (Equation 2)

Solving these two equations simultaneously will give us the values for \( a \) and \( b \).

We can multiply Equation 1 by 3 to eliminate \( a \) when added to Equation 2:

Let's take the inputs 6 and 19 and their corresponding outputs 74 and 191:

For input 6: 
74 = a + b(6)

For input 19:
191 = a + b(19)

We now have two equations:
1. 74 = a + 6b
2. 191 = a + 19b

To solve for a and b, we can isolate a in the first equation and then substitute it into the second:

From equation 1:
a = 74 - 6b

Now substitute a into equation 2:
191 = (74 - 6b) + 19b
191 = 74 + 13b
117 = 13b
b = 117 / 13
b = 9

Now that we have the value of b, we can use it to find a:
a = 74 - 6(9)
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

So the function that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:
y = 20 + 9x

To confirm that this function is consistent with all provided data points, let's plug the other input values (-11, -5, and -10), one by one, into this equation:

For input -11:
y = 20 + 9(-11)
y = 20 - 99
y = -79

For input -5:
y = 20 + 9(-5)
y = 20 - 45
y = -25

For input -10:
y = 20 + 9(-10)
y = 20 - 90
y = -70

All these calculated outputs match the given outputs, confirming that the function y = 20 + 9x captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs accurately.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) for the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can plug in the given points to form equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \). However, since \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because any number raised to the zeroth power is 1, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Now let's use two points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). We'll choose two points, \( (6, 74) \) and \( (-10, -70) \), to set up a system of equations. 

For the input \( x = 6 \) and output \( y = 74 \):
\[ 74 = a + 6b \]
For the input \( x = -10 \) and output \( y = -70 \):
\[ -70 = a - 10b \]

We now have two equations with two unknowns:
1. \( 74 = a + 6b \)
2. \( -70 = a - 10b \)

We can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply both sides of the first equation by 10 and the second equation by 6 (we want to eliminate \( a \) by getting the coefficients in front of \( a \) to match and then subtract one equation from the other):

10(74) = 10a + 60b   -> 740 = 10a + 60b
6(-70) = 6a - 60b   -> -420 = 6a - 60b

Now, add the two equations:

740 + (-420) = (10a + 60b) + (6a - 60b)
320 = 16a

Dividing both sides by 16 gives us:

a = 320 / 16
a = 20

Now we can substitute \( a \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( b \). We'll use the first equation:

74 = 20 + 6b

Subtract 20 from both sides:

74 - 20 = 6b
54 = 6b

Divide both sides by 6:

b = 54 / 6
b = 9

Therefore, the function that best describes the data provided is:

\[ y = 20 + 9x \]

This satisfies the requirement to write the function explicitly in the exact form Output: \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \). So the final function is:

\[ y = 20 \cdot x^0 + 9 \cdot x^1 \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ y = 20 + 9x \]

    From the provided input and output pairs, we shall attempt to deduce the values of a and b in the function of the form: \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \).

Let's analyze the given pairs:

Using Input: 6, Output: 74:
\( 74 = a(6^0) + b(6^1) \)
\( 74 = a + 6b \)

Using Input: 19, Output: 191:
\( 191 = a(19^0) + b(19^1) \)
\( 191 = a + 19b \)

Using Input: -11, Output: -79:
\( -79 = a(-11^0) + b(-11^1) \)
\( -79 = a - 11b \)

Using Input: -5, Output: -25:
\( -25 = a(-5^0) + b(-5^1) \)
\( -25 = a - 5b \)

Using Input: -10, Output: -70:
\( -70 = a(-10^0) + b(-10^1) \)
\( -70 = a - 10b \)

The \( x^0 \) term is 1 for any input, so we have a set of simple linear equations. To determine a and b, let's rearrange the equations and solve them simultaneously.

From the pair Input: -11, Output: -79:
\( a - 11b = -79 \) ... [1]

And from the pair Input: 6, Output: 74:
\( a + 6b = 74 \) ... [2]

Now, let's subtract equation [1] from equation [2] to solve for b:
\( (a + 6b) - (a - 11b) = 74 - (-79) \)
\( a + 6b - a + 11b = 74 + 79 \)
\( 17b = 153 \)
\( b = 153 / 17 \)
\( b = 9 \)

Now we will substitute the value of b back into equation [2]:
\( a + 6(9) = 74 \)
\( a + 54 = 74 \)
\( a = 74 - 54 \)
\( a = 20 \)

We have found the values for a and b, so the function is:
\( y = a \cdot x^0 + b \cdot x^1 \)
\( y = 20 \cdot x^0 + 9 \cdot x^1 \)
\( y = 20 + 9x \)

    To determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) in the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can look at the given input-output pairs and recognize that \( ax^0 \) is simply \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any \( x \) (except when \( x = 0 \), which is not the case here), and \( bx^1 \) is simply \( bx \) because \( x^1 \) is simply \( x \). So, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Now, let's find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) by plugging in the pairs of inputs and outputs:

For Input: 6, Output: 74, we have
\( 74 = a + 6b \)  - Equation (1)

For Input: 19, Output: 191, we have
\( 191 = a + 19b \) - Equation (2)

We can solve these equations for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use Equation (1) and Equation (2) for determining \( b \) first. If we subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2), we can eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( b \):

\( (191 - 74) = (a - a) + (19b - 6b) \\
117 = 13b \\
b = 117 / 13 \\
b = 9 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can plug this back into Equation (1) to find \( a \):

\( 74 = a + 6 \cdot 9 \\

    The relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) can be captured using a linear function of the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Given that ax^0 is equivalent to a (since any number raised to the zeroth power is 1) and bx^1 is just bx (since any number to the first power is the number itself), we can simplify the function to:

y = a + bx.

Looking at the input and output pairs, let's try to determine the values of 'a' and 'b'.

For the input x = -5, the output y = -25. Substituting these values into the equation gives:
-25 = a - 5b.

For the input x = -3, the output y = -19. Substituting these values gives:
-19 = a - 3b.

Now let's solve these two equations simultaneously.

From the first equation:
a = -25 + 5b.

Substitute a from the first equation into the second equation:
-19 = (-25 + 5b) - 3b,
-19 = -25 + 2b,

Now that we've found b, let's find a:

The term \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any non-zero value of \( x \). So the equation simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Let's use two of the given points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). I'll use the points (-5, -25) and (6, 8).

Using the point (-5, -25):
\[ -25 = a + b(-5) \]
\[ -25 = a - 5b \]
\[ 5b - a = 25 \]

1. For input 6: 8 = a + b(6)
2. For input -5: -25 = a + b(-5)

Now we have two linear equations with two variables:

1. 8 = a + 6b
2. -25 = a - 5b

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b. Let's multiply the second equation by 1 to make elimination easier:

Plugging \( a \) from the second equation into the first one:
\( 29 = (-1 + b) + 9b \)

Combine like terms:
\( 29 = 10b - 1 \)

Add 1 to both sides:
\( 30 = 10b \)

Divide both sides by 10:
\( b = 3 \)

Substitute \( b \) back into equation (2) to find \( a \):
\( -1 = a - 3 \)

Add 3 to both sides:
\( a = 2 \)

    To solve for the coefficients a and b that describe the relationship between the input x and the output y, we can use the two given points to form a system of equations and solve for a and b. We can use the points (9, 29) and (2, 8) to ensure we have a unique solution:

1) For the input 9, output 29:
29 = a * 9^0 + b * 9^1
29 = a + 9b

2) For the input 2, output 8:
8 = a * 2^0 + b * 2^1
8 = a + 2b

Now we have two equations:

I) 29 = a + 9b
II) 8 = a + 2b

We can solve this system of equations by subtracting equation II from equation I to eliminate a and solve for b:

29 - 8 = (a + 9b) - (a + 2b)
21 = 7b
b = 3

Plugging b = 3 into equation II to solve for a:

8 = a + 2 * 3
8 = a + 6
a = 2

Now that we have the values of a and b, we can define the function:

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use two points to determine the coefficients 'a' and 'b'. This formula is equivalent to y = a + bx, since x^0 = 1 for any non-zero x.

Let's use the two points (2, -17) and (5, -38) to determine the coefficients.

We can setup the system of equations as follows:

1) For the point (2, -17): 
-17 = a + 2b 

2) For the point (5, -38): 
-38 = a + 5b

Now we can solve this system of equations for a and b.

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a.

-38 - (-17) = (a + 5b) - (a + 2b)
-38 + 17 = a + 5b - a - 2b
-21 = 3b
b = -21 / 3
b = -7

Now let's substitute b back into equation 1.

-17 = a + 2(-7)
-17 = a - 14
a = -17 + 14
a = -3

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given inputs and outputs, we can notice first that ax^0 is just a constant since any number to the power of zero is one. So this simplifies to y = a + bx.

To solve this, we need to determine the constants 'a' and 'b'. We can use any two points to solve the linear equation. Let's take the first two pairs (-16, 109) and (-3, 18).

Using these two points, we can create a system of linear equations:

1. From the pair (-16, 109), we get the equation
109 = a + b(-16) or 109 = a - 16b

2. From the pair (-3, 18), we get the equation
18 = a + b(-3) or 18 = a - 3b

Now we have a system of equations:
a - 16b = 109
a - 3b = 18

To solve for 'a' and 'b', we subtract the second equation from the first one:

(a - 16b) - (a - 3b) = 109 - 18
a - 16b - a + 3b = 91
-13b = 91

Now solving for 'b':
b = 91 / -13
b = -7

Now that we have the value of 'b', we can plug it into one of the original equations to find 'a':

a - 3b = 18
a - 3(-7) = 18
a + 21 = 18
a = 18 - 21
a = -3

Now we have the values for 'a' and 'b':

    To find a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we are essentially looking for a linear function of \( x \) because \( ax^0 = a \) (since \( x^0 \) is 1 for any \( x \) that isn't 0) and \( bx^1 = bx \) (since \( x^1 \) is \( x \)).

The general form of a linear function is \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept. To align this with our required format, \( a \) will be equivalent to \( b \) (y-intercept), and \( b \) will be equivalent to \( m \) (slope).

We have a set of inputs and outputs which correspond to \( x, y \) pairs. We cannot find a linear function that perfectly matches all the given points because they do not lie on a single straight line, but we can try to find a function that fits the data as well as possible using these points.

However, if we want to go through the calculation process and use two points to find a linear equation that would fit two of the data points exactly, here's how you would do it:

Let's take two points, \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \), and calculate the slope \( m \) as follows:

\( m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \)

We can select any two points from the given dataset. For simplicity, I'll use:

\( (x_1, y_1) = (-16, 109) \)
\( (x_2, y_2) = (12, -87) \)

Now, we will calculate the slope \( m \):

\( m = \frac{-87 - 109}{12 - (-16)} \)
\( m = \frac{-196}{28} \)
\( m = -7 \)

So our tentative slope is \( -7 \). We can now use the slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \) to find \( b \). We'll use one of our points to solve for \( b \):

\( 109 = -7(-16) + b \)
\( 109 = 112 + b \)
\( b = 109 - 112 \)
\( b = -3 \)

Thus, the linear function that passes through the points \( (-16, 109) \) and \( (12, -87) \) is:

\( y = -7x - 3 \)

Keep in mind that this linear function will not fit the other points exactly, as they do not all lie on the same line. This function is a potential ""best fit"" that captures the linear relationship for the specific pairs of points chosen.

If we consider that this is a linear function, we can use two points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's take the points (Input, Output): (-16, 109) and (2, -17).

For the point (-16, 109), we have:
\[ 109 = a - 16b \] (1)

For the point (2, -17), we have:
\[ -17 = a + 2b \] (2)

Multiply equation (2) by 8 to get a new equation that will help us eliminate \( a \) when summing up with equation (1):

2. For Input 17 (Output -254): -254 = a + b(17)

    To capture the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we need to find constants a and b such that the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 accurately represents the given data points. The term ax^0 is simply a since any number to the power of zero is one. Thus, we need to determine the values of a and b in the linear equation y = a + bx.

Let's try to deduce a pattern from the given pairs of inputs and outputs. 

If we look at the input-output pairs: 

(-9, 162) and (-18, 306), if we double the input from -9 to -18, the output exactly doubles from 162 to 306. This suggests a direct proportionality and therefore the term involving b is likely the dominant term. The same pattern is true for input-output pairs (-4, 82) and (-14, 242), and (17, -254), suggesting that the input is directly proportional to the output, only with a negative slope. 

Given the form y = a + bx and the fact that the function seems to be primarily linear with a negative slope due to the fact that increasing x leads to a lower y, we should try to find b first.

Considering the first data point (-9, 162), if we apply the direct proportional relationship, let's say the change in output divided by the change in input equals b:

For the first two data points:
(162 - 306) / (-9 - (-18)) = b
(-144) / (9) = b
b = -16

Now let's apply the same ratio for another pair of data points to verify our found b:

(82 - 242) / (-4 - (-14)) = b
(-160) / (10) = b
b = -16

The calculated value of b remains consistent across different data points, suggesting that b = -16.

Now let's find a:

Using the data point (-9, 162) and the value we found for b:
162 = a + (-16)(-9)
162 = a + 144
a = 162 - 144
a = 18

    To find the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we note that this is a linear equation, where `x` is the input, `y` is the output, `a` is the y-intercept, and `b` is the slope of the line. The term `ax^0` will always equal `a`, since any number (except zero) to the power of 0 is 1.

To determine the values of `a` and `b`, we can use two data points to set up two equations and solve for `a` and `b`. Let's use the following two data points:

For Input: -9, Output: 162
For Input: 17, Output: -254

Let's set up the equations based on these points:

1) For x = -9, y = 162: `a * (-9)^0 + b * (-9) = 162`
Since (-9)^0 = 1, we simplify to:
`a - 9b = 162` --- (1)

2) For x = 17, y = -254: `a * (17)^0 + b * 17 = -254`
Since (17)^0 = 1, we simplify to:
`a + 17b = -254` --- (2)

Now we will solve these two linear equations simultaneously. We can do this by adding equation (1) and (2) to eliminate `a`. Adding (1) and (2) we get:

`(a - 9b) + (a + 17b) = 162 - 254`
`2a + 8b = -92`

Divide through by 2 to solve for `a`:
`a + 4b = -46` --- (3)

Now let's subtract equation (1) from (3), we can eliminate `a`:
`(a + 4b) - (a - 9b) = -46 - 162`
`13b = -208`

Solving for `b` we get:
`b = -208 / 13`
`b = -16`

Now let's find `a` by substituting the value of `b` into equation (3):
`a + 4(-16) = -46`
`a - 64 = -46`
`a = -46 + 64`
`a = 18`

1. \( 350 = a + 18b \)
2. \( 230 = a + 12b \)
3. \( -270 = a - 13b \)
4. \( 70 = a + 4b \)
5. \( 310 = a + 16b \)

To solve for \(a\) and \(b\), we need to find a set of values that satisfies all these equations. Since we only have two parameters \(a\) and \(b\) but five equations, it's likely that no exact solution exists that will satisfy all these equations perfectly due to potential over-determination. However, we can still attempt to find an approximate solution that might serve as a rough fit for the data using a method like least squares.

But for the sake of simplification, let's try to solve it using the first two equations:

1. \( 350 = a + 18b \)
2. \( 230 = a + 12b \)

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \(a\):

\( 350 - 230 = a + 18b - (a + 12b) \)
\( 120 = 6b \)
\( b = 20 \)

Now we can plug \(b\) back into one of the equations to find \(a\). Let's use the second equation, \( 230 = a + 12b \):

\( 230 = a + 12 \cdot 20 \)
\( 230 = a + 240 \)
\( a = 230 - 240 \)
\( a = -10 \)

So, an approximate function that might capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\[ \text{Output: } y = -10 + 20x \]

Note that this function is a simple linear fit and may not perfectly predict other data points, but it seems to be consistent with the data points provided within a reasonable margin.

Therefore, the output is:

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first have to recognize that ax^0 is just a constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1). The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 can be simplified to y = a + bx.

We are given five data points:
1. (18, 350)
2. (12, 230)
3. (-13, -270)
4. (4, 70)
5. (16, 310)

To find a and b, we can set up a system of linear equations using two of the data points and solve for a and b. Let's use points (18, 350) and (12, 230).

For the first point (18, 350):
350 = a + 18b

For the second point (12, 230):
230 = a + 12b

Now, we need to solve this system of equations. We can do this by using the subtraction method to eliminate a.

Subtract the second equation from the first one:
(350 - 230) = a + 18b - (a + 12b)
120 = 6b
b = 20

Now that we have b, we can plug it back into either equation to solve for a. Let's use the first equation:
350 = a + 18 * 20
350 = a + 360
a = 350 - 360
a = -10

Now we have a and b:
a = -10
b = 20

The function can thus be written as:
y = -10 + 20x

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is equivalent to y = a + bx (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), we need to determine the values of a and b that best fit the given input-output pairs.

We can use two of the provided points to form a system of equations and solve for a and b. Let's take the inputs 18 and 12 with their corresponding outputs 350 and 230:

1) For Input 18 (Output 350):
350 = a + b(18)

2) For Input 12 (Output 230):
230 = a + b(12)

Now, let's solve this system of two equations with two unknowns. First, solve the second equation for a:

a = 230 - b(12)

Now substitute this expression for a in the first equation:

350 = (230 - b(12)) + b(18)
350 = 230 + b(18) - b(12)
350 - 230 = b(18 - 12)
120 = b(6)
b = 20

Now that we have b, we can use it to solve for a using either of the original equations. Let's use the second one:

230 = a + b(12)
230 = a + 20(12)
230 = a + 240
a = 230 - 240
a = -10

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first interpret ax^0 as the constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), whereas bx^1 is the term that describes the linear relationship between x and y (since x^1 is just x). In other words, we are looking for a function:

y = a + bx

To determine the coefficients a and b, we can use two of the given input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations. Let's use the pairs (18, 350) and (12, 230).

For the input 18, output 350:
350 = a + b(18)

For the input 12, output 230:
230 = a + b(12)

We now have two equations:
1) 350 = a + 18b
2) 230 = a + 12b

We can solve this system by subtracting the second equation from the first, to eliminate the a term and solve for b:

(350 - 230) = (a + 18b) - (a + 12b)
120 = 6b
b = 120 / 6
b = 20

Now that we have the value for b, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for a. We can use the second equation:

230 = a + 20(12)
230 = a + 240
a = 230 - 240

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first recognize that \( ax^0 \) is just \( a \) because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. The function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Now we need to find the constants `a` and `b` such that \( y = a + bx \) fits the given input-output pairs as closely as possible. We can do this by setting up a system of equations using two of the input-output pairs and solving for `a` and `b`.

Let's use the following two pairs: (18, 350) and (12, 230).

For the input 18:
\( 350 = a + 18b \) ... (1)

For the input 12:
\( 230 = a + 12b \) ... (2)

Now solving for `a` and `b` using these two equations:

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate `a`:
\( 350 - 230 = a + 18b - (a + 12b) \)
\( 120 = 6b \)
\( b = 20 \)

Now that we have `b`, we can solve for `a` using either equation (1) or (2). Using equation (2):
\( 230 = a + 12b \)
\( 230 = a + 12(20) \)
\( 230 = a + 240 \)
\( a = 230 - 240 \)
\( a = -10 \)

Therefore, the function that fits these points is:
\( y = -10 + 20x \)

Given the constraints of the problem, we disregard any minor errors due to rounding or measurement inaccuracies, assuming that the function \( y = -10 + 20x \) perfectly fits all given data points. If it was necessary to account for all data points and they did not fit the linear model exactly, a least squares regression or another method would be needed to find the best approximation.

For input 13: 
Output = 177 
177 = a*(13)^0 + b*(13)^1
177 = a + 13b

For input 14:

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. 177 = a + 13b

We can solve this system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second equation to eliminate a:

(191 = a + 14b) - (177 = a + 13b)
14 = b

Now with the value of b, we can substitute it back into either equation to find a. Using the first equation:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand what ax^0 and bx^1 represent. The term ax^0 is a constant because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, so ax^0 is a. The term bx^1 is a linear term because any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself, so bx^1 is bx. The function then simplifies to y = a + bx.

Now, we need to determine the values of a and b. We can do this by forming a system of linear equations using the provided input-output pairs and then solving for a and b.

1) a + b(13) = 177

When the input is 14, the output is 191:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data points, let’s first understand the formula components:

- bx^1 is a linear term depending solely on the input, as x to the power of 1 is x. Therefore, bx^1 is just bx.
