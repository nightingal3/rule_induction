"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a linear function in the form y=ax^0 + bx^1 that approximately fits these data points, we will organize the data in a way that highlights the pattern between the inputs (x) and outputs (y).

Given data pairs are:
(-10, -213), (9, 167), (4, 67), (-3, -73), (20, 387)

We recognize that ax^0 is simply a, because x^0 = 1 for any x. So the function we are looking for simplifies to:
y = a + bx

Let's analyze the pattern in the changes of x and y:

For x increased from -3 to 4 (a change of 7), y increased from -73 to 67 (a change of 140), which implies that for each unit change in x, y changes by (140/7) = 20.

Therefore, it seems like b could be 20; we will use two points to calculate 'a'. Let's use the points (4, 67) and (-10, -213) since they are reasonably spaced apart.

For the point (4, 67), the assumed function gives:
67 = a + 20(4)
67 = a + 80
a = 67 - 80
a = -13

Now we should cross-check with the second point (-10, -213) to see if 'a' and 'b' work:

-213 = a + 20(-10)
-213 = a - 200
-213 + 200 = a
-13 = a

Since a is consistent across both points, the function that describes the data is:

y = -13 + 20x

Or, in the form requested:

Output: y = -13x^0 + 20x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that fits the data points given, we need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\). The function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), since \( x^0 \) is \( 1 \) for any \( x \) that isn't zero.

First, create two equations using two sets of input-output pairs to solve for \(a\) and \(b\).

Let's choose the inputs -10 and 9, with the corresponding outputs -213 and 167. So, we have:

1. For input -10: \( -213 = a + b(-10) \)
2. For input 9: \( 167 = a + b(9) \)

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( -213 = a - 10b \)
2. \( 167 = a + 9b \)

Next, solve the system by using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution for simplicity. Solve the first equation for \(a\):

\( a = -213 + 10b \)

Now substitute this expression for \(a\) in the second equation:

\( 167 = (-213 + 10b) + 9b \)
\( 167 = -213 + 19b \)
\( 380 = 19b \)
\( b = 20 \)

Now that we have \(b\), we can solve for \(a\) using \(a = -213 + 10b\):

\( a = -213 + 10(20) \)
\( a = -213 + 200 \)
\( a = -13 \)

Thus, the function that describes the relationship between these input-output pairs is:

\( y = -13 + 20x \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) for the given function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\) as \(x^0 = 1\) for any non-zero \(x\), we need to solve for \(a\) and \(b\) using the given input-output pairs. We'll use two pairs to set up a system of equations.

Let's use the pairs (4, 67) and (-10, -213) to set up our equations:

1) For the input \(x = 4\), \(y = 67\):
\(67 = a + 4b\)  [Equation 1]

2) For the input \(x = -10\), \(y = -213\):
\(-213 = a - 10b\)  [Equation 2]

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously:

Multiply Equation 1 by 2.5 to eliminate \(a\):

\(2.5(67) = 2.5(a) + 2.5(4b)\)
\(167.5 = 2.5a + 10b\)  [Equation 3]

Now add Equation 2 and Equation 3:

\(-213 = a - 10b\)
\(167.5 = 2.5a + 10b\)
------------------
\(-45.5 = 3.5a\)

Divide both sides by 3.5 to solve for \(a\):

\(a = \frac{-45.5}{3.5}\)
\(a = -13\)

Now that we have \(a\), we plug it into Equation 1 to solve for \(b\):

\(67 = -13 + 4b\)
\(80 = 4b\)

\(b = \frac{80}{4}\)
\(b = 20\)

So, our function with the determined coefficients is:

\(y = -13 + 20x\)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to interpret the desired form y = ax^0 + bx^1 as a linear equation, where a and b are coefficients we need to solve for. The equation simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is 1 for all x ≠ 0.

Since we have several pairs of inputs and outputs, we can form a system of equations to solve for the coefficients a and b. However, given we’re being asked to provide a function in a specified form and based on the provided data, we can attempt to solve it using two points to find a linear function that best fits the data.

Let's select two pairs of inputs and outputs as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). We will use the first and last given pairs: (-10, -213) and (20, 387).

We can form two equations from these points:
1. -213 = a + b(-10)
2.  387 = a + b(20)

Now, let's solve these two equations to find a and b.

First, rewrite the equations:
1.  a - 10b = -213
2.  a + 20b = 387

Now solve for a and b by using the method of elimination or substitution. If we add equation 1 to equation 2, we get:

a - 10b + a + 20b = -213 + 387
2a + 10b = 174
a + 5b = 87  ... (3)

Next, it looks like it would be easier to use equation 1 to express a in terms of b and substitute into equation (3).

From equation 1:
a = -213 + 10b ... (4)

Substitute (4) into (3):
-213 + 10b + 5b = 87
15b = 87 + 213
15b = 300
b = 20

Now, we’ll substitute b back into equation 4 to find a:
a = -213 + 10(20)
a = -213 + 200
a = -13

Thus, the function that seems to best describe the relationship between the input and output, based on the two selected data points, is:

Output: y = -13 + 20x

Keep in mind that with more data points, the derived function might differ, and more sophisticated fitting methods such as least squares might be needed to provide a better fit for the data.

    To derive the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the given data points, we need to determine the values of coefficients 'a' and 'b'. This equation can also be written as y = a + bx, since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

To find 'a' and 'b', we need two data points from the provided list. Let's pick two points to form a system of linear equations:

Using Input: -10, Output: -213
-213 = a + b(-10)

Using Input: 4, Output: 67
67 = a + b(4)

We now have two equations:

1) -213 = a - 10b
2)   67 = a + 4b

Let's solve for 'a' and 'b':

From equation (2), we can express 'a' in terms of 'b':
a = 67 - 4b

Now, substitute this expression into equation (1):
-213 = (67 - 4b) - 10b
-213 = 67 - 4b - 10b
-213 = 67 - 14b
-213 - 67 = -14b
-280 = -14b
b = -280 / -14
b = 20

Now that we have 'b', plug it into the expression for 'a':
a = 67 - 4b
a = 67 - 4(20)
a = 67 - 80
a = -13

Therefore, our function can be written as:
y = ax^0 + bx^1

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x is the input and y is the output, and recognizing that x^0 is always equal to 1 for any x != 0, the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

The goal is to find the values of a and b that best describe the given data points. To do this, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the function and solve for a and b.

Let's use the input-output pairs for two distinct points to form a system of equations:

1. Using the input-output pair (0, -3):
-3 = a + b(0)
-3 = a

Now we know that a = -3.

2. Using the input-output pair (5, -98):
-98 = a + b(5)
-98 = -3 + 5b
-95 = 5b
b = -19

We have found a = -3 and b = -19. Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = -3 + (-19)x

y = -3 - 19x.

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that maps the given inputs to their respective outputs, we need to determine the coefficients ""a"" and ""b"" that will satisfy the given input-output pairs.

Since ax^0 is always ""a"" (because x^0 is 1 for any non-zero x), and bx^1 is just ""b * x"", we can rewrite the function as:

y = a + bx

Let's substitute the provided input-output pairs into the function and create a system of equations to solve for ""a"" and ""b"".

Using the input-output pair (0, -3):
-3 = a + b(0) => -3 = a (since b(0) = 0)

Using the input-output pair (-18, 339):
339 = a + b(-18)

Now, let's substitute the value of ""a"" from the first equation into the second one:

339 = (-3) + b(-18)
342 = -18b
b = 342 / -18
b = -19

Now we have found the value of ""b"". We already know that ""a"" is -3 from the first pair. Therefore, the function that maps the given inputs to their respective outputs is:

y = -3 + (-19)x

    To determine the coefficients `a` and `b` for the function `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we notice that `ax^0` is always equal to `a` (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and `bx^1` is simply `bx` (since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself).

From the data points, we have:

1. When input `x = 0`, output `y = -3`. The equation becomes:
   `-3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)`,
   `-3 = a + 0`, hence `a = -3`.

Knowing that `a = -3`, we can determine `b` using one of the other points. Let's use the point (5, -98):

2. When input `x = 5`, output `y = -98`. The equation becomes:
   `-98 = a(5)^0 + b(5)`,
   `-98 = -3 + 5b`, solving for `b`:
   `5b = -98 + 3`,
   `5b = -95`,
   `b = -19`.

Now we have our values for `a` and `b`; hence, the function is:

Given that \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Let's use two input-output pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

1. Using the input-output pair (0, -3), we get:
   \( a + b \cdot 0 = -3 \)
   \( a = -3 \) (since \( b \cdot 0 \) is 0)

Now that we have \( a \), we only need to solve for \( b \):

2. Using the input-output pair (-18, 339), we substitute \( a \) with -3 to find \( b \):

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a linear function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which is equivalent to \( y = a + bx \), we need to determine the constants \( a \) (intercept) and \( b \) (slope) based on the given inputs and outputs.

Let's use two points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). It's often simplest to use points with the smallest x-values due to smaller numbers being easier to work with, but we can use any two points. Let's use the following two points for our calculation: (5, -31) and (-4, 14).

Now, we’ll start by using the general form \( y = a + bx \) to create two equations based on these points:

For the input 5:
\( -31 = a + 5b \) (Equation 1)

For the input -4:
\( 14 = a - 4b \) (Equation 2)

We now have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve these equations using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's use elimination in this case:

Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2 to eliminate \( a \):

\( -31 + 14 = a + 5b + a - 4b \)
\( -17 = 2a + b \)
\( b = -17 - 2a \) (Equation 3)

To find \( a \), we can now substitute \( b \) from Equation 3 back into one of the original equations. Let's use Equation 1:

\( -31 = a + 5(-17 - 2a) \)
\( -31 = a - 85 - 10a \)
\( -31 = -85 - 9a \)
\( 9a = -85 + 31 \)
\( 9a = -54 \)
\( a = -54 / 9 \)
\( a = -6 \)

Now that we have \( a \), we can find \( b \) by plugging \( a \) into Equation 3:

\( b = -17 - 2(-6) \)
\( b = -17 + 12 \)
\( b = -5 \)

So the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\( y = -6 + (-5)x \)

Or more simply:

\( y = -6 - 5x \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients a and b for the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand the relationship between the given inputs (x values) and outputs (y values). Since ax^0 is always equal to a (because any number raised to the 0th power is 1), and bx^1 is just bx (since any number raised to the first power is itself), our function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can use two points from the given data to solve for a and b. Let's use the points (5, -31) and (9, -51):

For the input 5:
-31 = a + b(5)

For the input 9:
-51 = a + b(9)

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1) a + 5b = -31
2) a + 9b = -51

Let's solve the system by subtracting equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a:

a + 9b - (a + 5b) = -51 - (-31)
a + 9b - a - 5b = -51 + 31
4b = -20
b = -20 / 4
b = -5

Now we can substitute b into either equation (I'll use equation 1) to find a:

a + 5(-5) = -31
a - 25 = -31
a = -31 + 25
a = -6

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

Output: y = -6x^0 - 5x^1

    To determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) in the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), we need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that will fit the given input-output pairs.

Given the linear form, we can create two equations using two input-output pairs to solve for the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's use the pairs (7, -98) and (-6, 58). We can set up the following equations:
1) For input 7:
\[ -98 = a + 7b \]

2) For input -6:
\[ 58 = a - 6b \]

Now we can solve this system of linear equations to find \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the method of elimination or substitution.

Multiplying the first equation by 6 and the second by 7 to eliminate \( a \) we get:
\[ 6(-98) = 6a + 42b \]
\[ 7(58) = 7a - 42b \]

Which simplifies to:
\[ -588 = 6a + 42b \]
\[ 406 = 7a - 42b \]

Adding these two equations to eliminate \( b \) yields:
\[ -588 + 406 = 6a + 7a \]
\[ -182 = 13a \]

Solving for \( a \) gives:
\[ a = -182 / 13 \]
\[ a = -14 \]

Now we can substitute \( a \) back into one of the original equations to find \( b \). Let's substitute \( a \) back into the first equation:
\[ -98 = -14 + 7b \]

Adding 14 to both sides:
\[ -84 = 7b \]

Dividing by 7:
\[ b = -84 / 7 \]
\[ b = -12 \]

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:
\[ y = -14 + (-12)x \]
\[ y = -14 - 12x \]

So the function in the requested form is:
\[ y = -14x^0 - 12x^1 \]

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of the coefficients a and b. The term ax^0 is a constant since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1; therefore, ax^0 simplifies to a. The term bx^1 is simply bx since anything raised to the power of 1 is itself. So we are looking for a function in the form y = a + bx.

We can use two data points to form a system of linear equations and solve for a and b. Let's use the points (7, -98) and (17, -218):

1. For the input 7:
-98 = a + b(7)
-98 = a + 7b

2. For the input 17:
-218 = a + b(17)
-218 = a + 17b

Now we have a system of two equations:
(1) -98 = a + 7b
(2) -218 = a + 17b

We can solve for a and b using the elimination method. First, let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a:

-218 - (-98) = (a + 17b) - (a + 7b)
-218 + 98 = a + 17b - a - 7b
-120 = 10b
b = -120 / 10
b = -12

Now we can solve for a by substituting the value of b back into either equation (1) or (2). Let's use equation (1):

-98 = a + 7(-12)
-98 = a - 84
a = -98 + 84
a = -14

Now that we have the values of a and b, we can write the function:

y = a + bx
y = -14 - 12x

But we need to write the function in the exact form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which translates to:

y = -14x^0 - 12x^1

y = -14*1 - 12x

1. \( x = 7 \), \( y = -98 \)
2. \( x = 17 \), \( y = -218 \)

For the first point (7, -98), our function becomes:
\[ -98 = a + b(7) \]
\[ -98 = a + 7b \]

For the second point (17, -218), our function becomes:
\[ -218 = a + b(17) \]
\[ -218 = a + 17b \]

We have a system of two linear equations:
1. \( a + 7b = -98 \)
2. \( a + 17b = -218 \)

Let's solve this system by the method of substitution or elimination. I will use elimination here:

\[ (a + 17b) - (a + 7b) = -218 - (-98) \]
\[ a + 17b - a - 7b = -218 + 98 \]
\[ 10b = -120 \]
\[ b = -120 / 10 \]
\[ b = -12 \]

For the input -6:
a - 6b = 58       (5)

We can solve this system using various methods like substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's use elimination to find 'a' and 'b'. We can subtract (1) from (2) to help eliminate 'a':

(2) - (1): (a + 17b) - (a + 7b) = -218 - (-98)
10b = -120

From the above, we find:

Let’s subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate 'a' and solve for 'b':

(a + 20b) - (a - 13b) = 265 - (-197)
a + 20b - a + 13b = 265 + 197
33b = 462
b = 462 / 33
b = 14

a - 13(14) = -197
a - 182 = -197
a = -197 + 182
a = -15

83 = a + b(7)

This system of equations can be written as:
1. a - 10b = -155
2. a + 7b = 83

Let's solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. I'll use substitution in this case.

First, solve Equation 1 for a:
a = -155 + 10b

Now, substitute the expression for a into Equation 2 and solve for b:
-155 + 10b + 7b = 83
17b = 83 + 155
17b = 238
b = 238 / 17
b = 14

Next, substitute b back into the expression for a:
a = -155 + 10(14)
a = -155 + 140
a = -15

Now we have the values of a and b:
a = -15
b = 14

So the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = -15 + 14x

y = 237

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can start by recognizing that the function needs to be in the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

Given that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any value of x that is not zero, we can simplify this to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

We can use two points to solve for variables a and b. Let's take the pairs (9, 160) and (13, 228) and set up two equations based on the function:

1. For input 9 (x=9), output 160 (y=160):
\[ 160 = a + 9b \]

2. For input 13 (x=13), output 228 (y=228):
\[ 228 = a + 13b \]

Now we can solve for a and b.

First, let's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

\[ 228 - 160 = (a + 13b) - (a + 9b) \]
\[ 68 = 4b \]
\[ b = 17 \]

Now, we use the value of b to find a. Substitute b back into the first equation:

\[ 160 = a + 9(17) \]
\[ 160 = a + 153 \]
\[ a = 160 - 153 \]
\[ a = 7 \]

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of a and b that fit the provided inputs and outputs.

Firstly, it is important to recognize that ax^0 is just a since any number raised to the power of zero is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can use the given input-output pairs to set up equations and solve for a and b.

Let's consider two input-output pairs to set up a system of equations:

Using Input: 9, Output: 160, we get:
160 = a + b*9

Using Input: 13, Output: 228, we get:
228 = a + b*13

Now, we have the following system of linear equations:
1. a + 9b = 160
2. a + 13b = 228

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we get:
(228 - 160) = (a + 13b) - (a + 9b)
68 = 4b
b = 17

Plugging the value of b back into equation 1, we get:
a + 9 * 17 = 160
a + 153 = 160
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a linear function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\) that fits these data points, we need to determine the constants \(a\) and \(b\). The term \(ax^0\) is essentially \(a\) because any nonzero number to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the equation simplifies to \(y = a + bx\), which is a standard linear equation \(y = mx + c\) where \(m\) is the slope and \(c\) is the y-intercept.

However, since we're provided with several points, we can't solve directly for \(a\) and \(b\) without more information because a linear function may not perfectly fit all of these points unless they all lie exactly on a straight line, which is rare with real-world data. Still, we can use a method like least squares regression to find the best fit line for these points.

Without performing numerical analysis, which is beyond our conversational capability, we cannot give you the exact coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) that describe the relationship perfectly.

For the sake of this exercise, and under the presumption that this exact form is non-negotiable, we could establish a system of equations from the given input-output pairs and solve for \(a\) and \(b\). Since we have five points and only two variables, we would need to use only two of the points to find \(a\) and \(b\), or we could calculate the best fit line using all the points which would be least squares regression—something that also goes beyond a simple pattern recognition exchange.

Let's arbitrarily take two points to set up our equations. Using (9, 160) and (13, 228):

160 = a + 9b
228 = a + 13b

We can solve these equations for \(a\) and \(b\). Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

228 - 160 = a + 13b - (a + 9b)
68 = 4b
b = 17

Substituting \(b\) back into the first equation:

160 = a + 9(17)
160 = a + 153
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

So our function, using this method and these two points, would be:

y = 7 + 17x

However, this function will not perfectly fit all of the given points because it was derived using only two of the points provided. The other points will not lie on the line described by this equation unless by coincidence. To achieve the best fit for all points, one would need to perform a least squares regression analysis.

    To find the values of a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we must recognize that ax^0 is equivalent to a, because any number (except zero) to the power of zero is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. To solve for a and b, we need to set up a system of equations based on the inputs and the corresponding outputs given. Let's take two sets of inputs and outputs to set up our equations:

For input 9 (x = 9), the output is 160 (y = 160):
160 = a + 9b      (1)

For input 15 (x = 15), the output is 262 (y = 262):
262 = a + 15b     (2)

Now we will solve the system of equations for a and b.

First, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a:
262 - 160 = (a + 15b) - (a + 9b)
102 = 6b
b = 102 / 6

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to find the coefficients a and b such that the output y corresponds to the given input x for all the provided pairs. The term \( ax^0 \) simplifies to a, as any number raised to the 0th power is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to the linear form \( y = a + bx \).

Our function now looks like this: \( y = a + bx \).

We have to find the values of a and b that will fit all the given input-output pairs. Let's call these pairs (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ... etc. We can then set up a system of linear equations by substituting the input values for x and the output values for y:

For Input 9, Output 160: \( 160 = a + 9b \)
For Input 13, Output 228: \( 228 = a + 13b \)
For Input -4, Output -61: \( -61 = a - 4b \)
For Input 15, Output 262: \( 262 = a + 15b \)
For Input -20, Output -333: \( -333 = a - 20b \)

We can solve this system using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. However, this is an overdetermined system (we have more equations than unknowns), which usually requires methods like least squares fitting to find the best approximation for a and b.

One approach to finding a solution is to use the first three points to determine a possible solution for a and b:

From the 3rd equation, with input -4, output -61:
\( -61 = a - 4b \)

From the 1st equation, with input 9, output 160:
\( 160 = a + 9b \)

We have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for a and b using these two equations:

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a and solve for b:
\( 160 - (-61) = a + 9b - (a - 4b) \)
\( 221 = 13b \)
\( b = \frac{221}{13} \)
\( b ≈ 17 \)

Now we use b to find a using either of the previous equations. Let's use the first equation:

\( 160 = a + 9(17) \)
\( 160 = a + 153 \)
\( a = 160 - 153 \)
\( a = 7 \)

The proposed function would thus be \( y ≈ 7 + 17x \). We can verify this function using the other given points to see if the proposed coefficients reasonably fit all the points.

\( y = 7 + 17(15) \)
\( y = 7 + 255 \)
\( y = 262 \) (which matches the given output for input 15)

\( y = 7 + 17(-20) \)

    The provided data points suggest a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs, which is consistent with the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. The ax^0 term is a constant (because x^0 = 1 for any x except 0), while the bx^1 term is just bx, because x^1 = x. Thus, we are looking for a function of the form:

y = a + bx

To find the coefficients a and b, we need to solve a system of equations based on the provided data points. Since we have more than two points, the system might be overdetermined, but we can still attempt to find a best-fit line. However, for a perfect solution (exact fit), we would need more than one point but we already have five points, which suggests a pattern that can be used to deduce the coefficients a and b.

Let's examine the pattern more closely:

Input: -2 → Output: 17
Input: 7 → Output: -145
Input: -10 → Output: 161
Input: 9 → Output: -181
Input: -20 → Output: 341

A quick way to determine the relationship involves examining the changes in output relative to the changes in input.

For instance:

When the input changes from -2 to 7 (increase of 9 units), the output changes from 17 to -145 (decrease of 162 units).
When the input changes from 7 to 9 (increase of 2 units), the output changes from -145 to -181 (decrease of 36 units).

By looking at these differences, we can see that for an increase of 1 unit in the input, the output decreases by 18 units, hence b is -18.

Now we need to find a. We can use any of the data points for this. Let's use the first one:

Input: -2

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to calculate a and b:

For input -2, output 17:
\( 17 = a - 2b \)

For input 7, output -145:
\( -145 = a + 7b \)

Now we have a system of two linear equations that we can solve for a and b:

1) \( a - 2b = 17 \)
2) \( a + 7b = -145 \)

Let's solve for a from the first equation:

\( a = 17 + 2b \)

Now substitute the value of a into the second equation:

\( (17 + 2b) + 7b = -145 \)
\( 17 + 9b = -145 \)
\( 9b = -145 - 17 \)
\( 9b = -162 \)

2. For input 7: \( -145 = a + b(7) \) or \( -145 = a + 7b \)

\[ a = 17 + 2b \]
\[ a = -145 - 7b \]

2) \( -145 = a + 7b \)

To solve for \( a \) and \( b \), let's multiply the first equation by 7 and the second by 2 to eliminate \( a \):

2) \( 2(-145) = 2a + 14b \) -> \( -290 = 2a + 14b \)

Now let's use two of the given input-output pairs to solve for b and c. We can use the pairs (20, -307) and (-1, 8) since they give us quick insight due to their simplicity. Plugging these into our equation yields two simultaneous equations:

1) For (20, -307): -307 = b(20) + c
2) For (-1, 8): 8 = b(-1) + c

Now solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of b and c. Start by simplifying each:

1) -307 = 20b + c
2) 8 = -b + c

Then, we can solve for c from equation 2:

2) c = b + 8

Now let's substitute c in equation 1 with the expression from equation 2:

For input 18: y = -15(18) - 7 = -270 - 7 = -277 ✓

The verification matches the other points, confirming our function is correct. Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are effectively looking for a linear function of the form y = b * x + a, because x^0 is 1 for any x that is not zero. Given that we have several pairs of inputs and outputs, we can use two pairs to solve for a and b.

Let's use the following two pairs of inputs and outputs:

1) x = 20, y = -307
2) x = -1, y = 8

Now plug these into the linear equation form:

For the first pair:
-307 = b * 20 + a

For the second pair:
8 = b * (-1) + a

Now we have a system of linear equations:

20b + a = -307
-b + a = 8

Let's solve this system for a and b. First, we'll solve the second equation for a:

a = b + 8

Now let's substitute a in the first equation:

20b + b + 8 = -307
21b = -307 - 8
21b = -315
b = -315 / 21
b = -15

Now that we have b, we can solve for a by plugging b back into the equation a = b + 8:

a = -15 + 8
a = -7

The function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is therefore:

y = -7x^0 - 15x^1

which simplifies to:

y = -15x - 7

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first recognize that \(x^0\) is always 1, so 'a' represents the constant term in the equation, and 'b' represents the slope of the line when we plot the inputs (x) versus outputs (y).

Given that we have multiple inputs and a corresponding output for each, we can use two of the points to determine the coefficients 'a' and 'b'. However, since the same input '20' gives the same output '-307' consistently, it reinforces the idea that we are working with a linear function.

Let's use the first and fourth data points to determine 'a' and 'b': (x_1 = 20, y_1 = -307) and (x_2 = 12, y_2 = -187).

The slope of the line (b) can be calculated by the change in the output divided by the change in the input:

\[ b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-187 - (-307)}{12 - 20} = \frac{120}{-8} = -15 \]

Now that we have the slope, we can find the constant term 'a'. We can use either of the points for this calculation. I'll use the first point (20, -307):

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]
\[ -307 = a(20^0) + (-15)(20) \]
\[ -307 = a + (-300) \]
\[ a = -307 + 300 \]
\[ a = -7 \]

So the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\[ y = -7x^0 - 15x^1 \]
\[ y = -7 - 15x \]

    To find the function in the desired form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since \(x^0 = 1\), we can use two data points to solve for the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\). Let's take the points (20, -307) and (-1, 8):

For the first point (20, -307), the equation is:
\[ -307 = a + 20b \]

For the second point (-1, 8), the equation is:
\[ 8 = a - b \]

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( -307 = a + 20b \)
2. \( 8 = a - b \)

To solve for \(a\) and \(b\), let's use the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method:

Adding the two equations together to eliminate \( a \):
\[ -307 + 8 = a + 20b + a - b \]
\[ -299 = 2a + 19b \]
\[ \frac{-299}{2} = a + \frac{19b}{2} \]
\[ a = \frac{-299}{2} - \frac{19b}{2} \]

Now replace \( a \) in the first equation with the expression from above:
\[ -307 = \left( \frac{-299}{2} - \frac{19b}{2} \right) + 20b \]
\[ -307 = \frac{-299}{2} - \frac{19b}{2} + 20b \]
\[ -307 = \frac{-299}{2} + \frac{40b}{2} - \frac{19b}{2} \]
\[ -307 = \frac{-299}{2} + \frac{21b}{2} \]
\[ -307 = \frac{-299 + 21b}{2} \]
\[ -614 = -299 + 21b \]
\[ 21b = -614 + 299 \]
\[ 21b = -315 \]
\[ b = \frac{-315}{21} \]
\[ b = -15 \]

Substitute \( b \) back into equation 2 to solve for \( a \):
\[ 8 = a - (-15) \]
\[ 8 = a + 15 \]
\[ a = 8 - 15 \]
\[ a = -7 \]

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

    To find the coefficients a and b for the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use two data points from the given input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations. Selecting the points (20, -307) and (-1, 8), we can set up the equations as follows:

For the input 20 and output -307:
-307 = a * 20^0 + b * 20^1
-307 = a + 20b        (1)

For the input -1 and output 8:
8 = a * (-1)^0 + b * (-1)^1
8 = a - b             (2)

Now let's solve for a and b using these two equations:

Adding equation (2) to equation (1) to eliminate b:
(-307) + 8 = (a + 20b) + (a - b)
-299 = 2a + 19b
-299 = 2a + 19b        (3)

Now, let's multiply equation (2) by 20 to align it with the coefficient of b in equation (1):
20 * 8 = 20 * a - 20 * b
160 = 20a - 20b         (4)

Now we'll add equation (4) to equation (1):
-307 + 160 = a + 20b + 20a - 20b
-147 = 21a

Now solve for a:
a = -147 / 21
a = -7

Substitute a back into equation (2) to solve for b:
8 = -7 - b
b = -7 - 8
b = -15

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we first observe that ax^0 is simply a since x^0 is always 1 for any x different from zero. Thus, this term represents the constant (intercept) portion of the equation. The term bx^1 is simply bx, as x^1 is x, and represents the slope portion of the linear equation.

Given that we have multiple inputs and outputs, we can find the slope (b) and intercept (a) by using two points and solving the system of linear equations.

Let's take two data points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):

Point 1: (13, -66)
Point 2: (-20, 132)

Using the equation y = a + bx, we set up two equations based on the above points:

Equation for Point 1: -66 = a + 13b
Equation for Point 2: 132 = a - 20b

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations to find the values of a and b. First, we can multiply the second equation by a suitable number so that when we add the equations, we can eliminate a or b. Let's multiply the second equation by 1 to keep things simple:

-66 = a + 13b          (Equation 1)
132 = a - 20b           (Equation 2)

Now let's subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate a:

-66 - 132 = (a + 13b) - (a - 20b)
-198 = 33b
b = -198 / 33
b = -6

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using one of the equations:

-66 = a + 13(-6)
-66 = a - 78
a = -66 + 78
a = 12

Thus, the linear function that fits the data points is:

y = 12 + (-6)x
y = 12 - 6x

In the required format:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = 12x^0 - 6x^1
y = 12 - 6x

    Given the data points, we are looking to create a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We have five data points:

1. f(13) = -66
2. f(-20) = 132
3. f(18) = -96
4. f(0) = 12
5. f(11) = -54

From the fourth data point where the input is 0, we can directly find the value of 'a' since any value raised to the power of 0 is 1 and multiplying b by 0 will eliminate the b term:

f(0) = a + b*0
12 = a

So, a = 12.

Now we have simplified our function to:

y = 12 + bx

To find the value of 'b', we can use any of the other data points. Let's use the first one:

f(13) = -66
-66 = 12 + b*13

Subtract 12 from both sides to solve for b:

-66 - 12 = b*13
-78 = b*13

Now divide by 13 to solve for b:

b = -78 / 13
b = -6

Our linear function y = 12 + bx now becomes:

y = 12 - 6x

Thus, in the explicit form required, the function will be:

We can use two of the given input/output pairs to determine the values of a and b. Let's select:

Input: 0, Output: 12
Input: 13, Output: -66

From the first input/output pair (0, 12), we can immediately determine that a = 12 because when x = 0, the bx term is eliminated, and we're left with y = a.

Now let’s use this knowledge and the second pair (13, -66) to find b:

-66 = 12 + b(13)

Now, we solve for b:

-66 - 12 = b(13)
-78 = b(13)
b = -78 / 13

Let's use the first two input-output pairs to create the system:

1. For input -17 (x = -17), output is -325 (y = -325):
   -325 = a + b(-17)

2. For input -5 (x = -5), output is -109 (y = -109):

Now we have the system of equations:
1. a - 17b = -325
2. a - 5b = -109

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:

    To find a linear function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can recognize this as the general equation for a straight line \( y = b_0 + b_1x \), where \( a = b_0 \) and \( b = b_1 \).

Given the points (-17, -325), (-5, -109), (16, 269), (-15, -289), and (-15, -289), we'll need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \).

As the last two points (-15, -289) and (-15, -289) are identical, they only provide the function with one unique piece of information.

Normally, we would need two unique points to determine the two unknowns in our linear equation. However, since we have more than two unique points, we can use linear regression methods to find the best fitting linear equation given the entire data set. Alternatively, if the data points are indeed co-linear, simple methods to solve for the coefficients using two points can also be used.

Let's simplify this based on the assumption that all the points exactly fit a line (which means the data is perfectly co-linear), and use the points (-17, -325) and (16, 269) to generate the linear equation:

We can set up two simultaneous equations based on the general linear form:

For x = -17, y = -325:
\[ -325 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17) \]
\[ -325 = a - 17b \]

For x = 16, y = 269:
\[ 269 = a(16)^0 + b(16) \]
\[ 269 = a + 16b \]

We now have two equations with two unknowns:

\[ -325 = a - 17b \]
\[ 269 = a + 16b \]

We can solve this by addition or substitution. Let's use addition:

\( (-325) + 269 = a - 17b + a + 16b \)
\( -56 = 2a - b \)
\( -56 + b = 2a \)
\( \frac{-56 + b}{2} = a \)

Now, let's express \( a \) in terms of \( b \) and substitute in one of the equations:

\[ -325 = \frac{-56 + b}{2} - 17b \]
\[ -650 = -56 + b - 34b \]
\[ -650 + 56 = -33b \]
\[ -594 = -33b \]
\[ b = \frac{-594}{-33} = 18 \]

Now that we have \( b \), let's find \( a \):

\[ a = \frac{-56 + b}{2} = \frac{-56 + 18}{2} = \frac{-38}{2} = -19 \]

Therefore, our function is:

\[ y = -19x^0 + 18x^1 \]

Or more simply:
\[ \boxed{y = -19 + 18x} \]

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the provided data points, we can rewrite the function in a more familiar linear form, since ax^0 is just a since x^0 = 1 for any x ≠ 0:

y = a + bx

We’re trying to find coefficients a and b such that this linear function fits the provided data. This formula represents a straight line where 'a' is the y-intercept and 'b' is the slope. We need at least two points to find the exact equation for this line, and since we've been given five, we can use that information to verify our result or to find the best approximation if the points do not sit perfectly on a line.

To solve for 'a' and 'b', we can set up a system of equations using two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):

y1 = a + bx1
y2 = a + bx2

We can pick two points from the given data, for example, (10, 142) and (-10, -158). Then we have:

142 = a + b(10)
-158 = a + b(-10)

We now have a system of two equations:

142 = a + 10b 
-158 = a - 10b

We can solve this system by adding the two equations to eliminate b:

(142) + (-158) = a + 10b + a - 10b
-16 = 2a
a = -8

Now that we have a, we can substitute it back into one of our original equations to solve for b:

142 = -8 + 10b
150 = 10b
b = 15

Thus our linear function, written as y = ax^0 + bx^1, with the values substituted in, is:

y = -8x^0 + 15x^1

Simplified, this is:

y = -8 + 15x

This function should fit the data given, but to be sure, we can plug in the others points to test it.

For x = 15:
y = -8 + 15(15)
y = -8 + 225
y = 217 (matches the output for the input 15)

For x = -4:
y = -8 + 15(-4)
y = -8 - 60
y = -68 (matches the output for the input -4)

For x = 13:
y = -8 + 15(13)
y = -8 + 195
y = 187 (matches the output for the input 13)

    To find a function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we first recognize that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x (except x ≠ 0), and \( bx^1 = bx \). Hence, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

To determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \), we can use two of the given input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations. Let's use the pairs (10, 142) and (-10, -158):

1. Using the input 10: \( 142 = a + b(10) \) or \( a + 10b = 142 \)
2. Using the input -10: \( -158 = a + b(-10) \) or \( a - 10b = -158 \)

Now, we have a system of two linear equations:
\( \begin{cases}
a + 10b = 142 \\
a - 10b = -158
\end{cases} \)

Adding these two equations, we eliminate \( b \), and we can solve for \( a \):
\( 2a = 142 - 158 \)
\( 2a = -16 \)
\( a = -8 \)

Now, we substitute \( a \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( b \):

\( -8 + 10b = 142 \)

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x is the input and y is the output, we need to understand that ax^0 is just a, because any number to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, our function simplifies to y = a + bx, which is a linear equation.

We have several pairs of points: (10, 142), (15, 217), (-10, -158), (-4, -68), (13, 187). We can use two of these points to calculate the values of a and b.

Let's use the points (10, 142) and (-10, -158):

For the point (10, 142), we substitute into the equation: 
142 = a + b(10)

For the point (-10, -158), we substitute into the equation:
-158 = a + b(-10)

Now we have two equations:
1. 142 = a + 10b
2. -158 = a - 10b

We can solve this system of equations by adding them together to eliminate b:

(142) + (-158) = (a + 10b) + (a - 10b)
-16 = 2a

Now we solve for a:
a = -16 / 2
a = -8

Let's use the following two points:
1. \(x_1 = 10 \), \(y_1 = 142\)
2. \(x_2 = -10\), \(y_2 = -158\)

We can form the following system of equations from these points:

(1) \( 142 = a + 10b \)

Let's take pairs (1) and (2) to set up our equations:

-8 = a - b
76 = a + 5b

Now let's solve the system of equations:

From (1) we get:
a = -8 + b

Substituting a from equation (1) into equation (2), we get:

76 = -8 + 6b
76 + 8 = 6b

y = a + bx

We need at least two points to determine a unique line. However, since we are given more than two points, it is possible for there to be no single line that precisely fits all the points unless they all lie on the same line.

Let's first check if a single line can fit all the points by calculating the slope (b) between each pair of points and see if it is consistent.

Using the points (1, 2) and (-19, 122), let's find the slope (b):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (122 - 2) / (-19 - 1)
b = 120 / (-20)
b = -6

Now let's use the points (17, -94) and (15, -82) to calculate the slope:

b = (-94 - (-82)) / (17 - 15)
b = (-94 + 82) / (2)
b = (-12) / (2)
b = -6

Given that the slope is the same for both pairs of points, there's a strong indication that all points may lie on the same line. We can test one more pair to be sure, like (-6, 44) and (15, -82):

b = (44 - (-82)) / (-6 - 15)
b = (44 + 82) / (-21)
b = 126 / (-21)
b = -6

The slope remains consistent across all pairs, so it is likely that all the points lie on the same line, and thus we can determine b is -6.

Let's use one of the points to solve for a. Again using the point (1, 2):

2 = a + (-6)*1
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

With a found to be 8 and b found to be -6, the function is:

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 and the pairs of inputs and outputs, let's find the constants a and b such that the function describes the relationship as accurately as possible.

The function reduces to y = a + bx, since x^0 is one for any x different from zero.

Let us consider two input-output pairs to create two equations and solve for a and b.

Using the input-output pairs (1, 2) and (-19, 122):

1. For input 1:
2 = a + b * 1
2 = a + b

2. For input -19:
122 = a + b * (-19)
122 = a - 19b

Now, we have a system of equations:
(1) a + b = 2
(2) a - 19b = 122

We will solve this system to find a and b.

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a:

(a - 19b) - (a + b) = 122 - 2
-19b - b = 120
-20b = 120

Now divide by -20 to solve for b:

b = 120 / -20
b = -6

Now let's plug the value for b into equation (1) to solve for a:

a + (-6) = 2
a - 6 = 2
a = 8

So, the function that models the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 8 - 6x

Or written in the requested form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1
Function: y = 8x^0 - 6x^1

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the given data points, we should recognize that ax^0 is simply a, since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Now we have to solve for a and b using the provided input-output pairs. Let's denote the inputs as x and the outputs as y:

1. Input: 1, Output: 2    --->   2  = a + b(1)
2. Input: -19, Output: 122 --->   122 = a + b(-19)
3. Input: 17, Output: -94  --->   -94 = a + b(17)
4. Input: 15, Output: -82  --->   -82 = a + b(15)
5. Input: -6, Output: 44   --->   44 = a + b(-6)

Let's take the first and the last data points to set up a system of linear equations:

For Input 1, Output 2:      2  = a + b(1)  --->  2  = a + b
For Input -6, Output 44:   44 = a + b(-6) --->  44 = a - 6b

Now we'll solve this system of linear equations. Subtract the second equation from the first:

(2 = a + b) - (44 = a - 6b)
-42 = 7b
b = -42 / 7
b = -6

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using one of our original equations. Using 2 = a + b:

2 = a + (-6)
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

Finally, putting a and b back into our original function form, we get:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = 8x^0 - 6x^1
y = 8 - 6x

So the function that describes the data is y = 8 - 6x.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we should note that ax^0 is equivalent to a, as any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the form is essentially y = a + bx.

Let's use two points to find the values of a and b. We will use the following two points from your list:

1) x = 1, y = 2

2) x = -19, y = 122

If we plug point 1 into the equation y = a + bx, we get:
2 = a + b(1)      ----> Equation 1: 2 = a + b

For point 2, plugging into the equation y = a + bx, we get:
122 = a + b(-19)  ----> Equation 2: 122 = a - 19b

We can solve this system of equations for a and b.

From Equation 1:
a + b = 2
a = 2 - b         ----> Equation 3

Substitute a from Equation 3 into Equation 2:
122 = (2 - b) - 19b
122 = 2 - 20b
120 = -20b
b = 120 / -20
b = -6

Now, substituting b back into Equation 3 to find a:
a = 2 - b
a = 2 - (-6)
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which is essentially \(y = a + bx\), we can use two data points to solve for a and b. The function is essentially a linear equation of the form \(y = mx + c\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(c\) is the y-intercept.

Let's use the given data pairs \((1, 2)\) and \((-19, 122)\) to form two equations:

For input \(1\), output \(2\):
\[2 = a + b \cdot 1\]
\[2 = a + b\] (Equation 1)

For input \(-19\), output \(122\):
\[122 = a + b \cdot (-19)\]
\[122 = a - 19b\] (Equation 2)

Now, let's solve this system of equations to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).

First, you can isolate \(a\) from Equation 1:
\[a = 2 - b\] (Equation 3)

Next, we substitute Equation 3 into Equation 2:
\[122 = (2 - b) - 19b\]
\[122 = 2 - 20b\]
\[120 = -20b\]
\[b = -6\]

Now that we have \(b\), we can find \(a\) by substituting \(b\) into Equation 3:
\[a = 2 - (-6)\]
\[a = 2 + 6\]
\[a = 8\]

Therefore, our function is:

Let's take two input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \):
Using the input-output pair (-17, -292) and (1, 14), we have two equations:

1. \( -292 = a - 17b \)
2. \( 14 = a + 1b \)

Now let's solve this system of equations. Starting with the second equation, we can solve for \( a \):

\( a = 14 - b \)

We can now substitute this expression for \( a \) in the first equation to find \( b \):

\( -292 = (14 - b) - 17b \)
\( -292 = 14 - 18b \)
\( -306 = -18b \)
\( b = 17 \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to recognize the pattern. The term ax^0 is essentially a constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is a linear term (since raising x to the power of 1 gives x itself).

Let's analyze the given inputs and outputs:

For x = -17, y = -292:
y = a*(-17)^0 + b*(-17)^1
-292 = a + (-17b)

For x = -6, y = -105:
y = a*(-6)^0 + b*(-6)^1
-105 = a + (-6b)

For x = -16, y = -275:
y = a*(-16)^0 + b*(-16)^1
-275 = a + (-16b)

For x = -18, y = -309:
y = a*(-18)^0 + b*(-18)^1
-309 = a + (-18b)

For x = 1, y = 14:
y = a*(1)^0 + b*(1)^1
14 = a + b

From the last equation, we directly have a relationship between a and b: a = 14 - b.

Let's substitute this relationship into one of the earlier equations to find the values of a and b. We can use the equation for x = -17:

-292 = (14 - b) + (-17b)
-292 = 14 - 18b
-306 = -18b
b = 17

Now, substitute the value of b back into the relationship between a and b:

a = 14 - b
a = 14 - 17
a = -3

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -3x^0 + 17x^1
y = -3 + 17x

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use the two data points to determine the coefficients a and b.

Let's take two data points. It's easiest to use (1, 14) as one of them because it simplifies the calculations:

1. For Input 1, Output 14:
y = a * 1^0 + b * 1^1
14 = a + b

2. Let's choose another point that would give us a simple equation, like (-6, -105):
y = a * (-6)^0 + b * (-6)^1
-105 = a - 6b

We have two equations now:
a + b = 14 (1)
a - 6b = -105 (2)

Let's solve this system of linear equations. First, we subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to find the value of b:

a - 6b - (a + b) = -105 - 14
-7b = -119
b = 17

Now we can plug the value of b back into equation (1) to find a:

a + 17 = 14
a = 14 - 17
a = -3

So the function that relates the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -3x^0 + 17x^1
Simplifying, since x^0 = 1, we get:

Output: y = -3 + 17x

Now, we'll use two points from the data provided to solve for \(a\) and \(b\). Let's select the points \((-6, -105)\) and \( (1, 14)\).

Using the point \((-6, -105)\), we get:
\[
-105 = a + b(-6) \quad \Rightarrow \quad -105 = a - 6b
\]

Using the point \((1, 14)\), we get:
\[
14 = a + b(1) \quad \Rightarrow \quad 14 = a + b
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

\[
\begin{align*}
-105 &= a - 6b \\
14 &= a + b

Subtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate \(a\), we get:

b = 17

The bx^1 term is simply bx because any number to the power of 1 is the number itself. Therefore, y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx.

Looking at the inputs and outputs:

- For input -17, output is -292: -292 = a - 17b
- For input -6, output is -105: -105 = a - 6b
- For input -16, output is -275: -275 = a - 16b
- For input -18, output is -309: -309 = a - 18b
- For input 1, output is 14:    14 = a + 1b

Let's choose two points to solve for a and b. We'll use the points (-17, -292) and (1, 14) for convenience.

From the point (-17, -292): -292 = a - 17b ...(1)
From the point (1, 14): 14 = a + b          ...(2)

Now let's solve this system of linear equations. We can use substitution or elimination. I will use elimination:

Multiply equation (2) by 17 to align it with the term 17b in equation (1):

17 * 14 = 17a + 17b which simplifies to 238 = 17a + 17b ...(3)

Now add equation (1) and equation (3):

-292 + 238 = a - 17b + 17a + 17b

-54 = 18a

Divide both sides by 18 to solve for a:

a = -54 / 18
a = -3

Now that we have a, we can substitute it into equation (2) to find b:

b = 14 + 3

    To capture the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the values of constants a and b that will allow us to represent the given pairs of inputs and outputs.

Since the term ax^0 is equivalent to a, because anything (except zero) raised to the power of zero is 1, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We are given the following pairs:
1. Input (x) = -7, Output (y) = 130, which gives the equation 130 = a - 7b
2. Input (x) = 14, Output (y) = -290, which gives the equation -290 = a + 14b
3. Input (x) = -12, Output (y) = 230, which gives the equation 230 = a - 12b
4. Input (x) = 16, Output (y) = -330, which gives the equation -330 = a + 16b
5. Input (x) = 16, Output (y) = -330, (repeated pair, same as above)

From pairs 2 and 4, we can set up a system of equations to solve for a and b:
-290 = a + 14b
-330 = a + 16b

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:
-40 = 2b
b = -20

Substitute b = -20 into the second equation:

2. `-290 = a + 14b`
3. `230 = a - 12b`
4. `-330 = a + 16b`

Since two inputs (14 and 16) have the same relationship, we don't need the redundancy, and we can ignore one of those pairs.

Let's use equations 1, 2, and 3 to solve for 'a' and 'b'.

From 1:
`a = 130 + 7b`    (equation 5)

Substitute equation (5) into equation (2):

`-290 = 130 + 21b`
`-420 = 21b`
`b = -20`

2) -290 = a + 14b

Let's multiply equation 1) by 2 to eliminate a:

2*130 = 2a - 14b

130 = b - 7a       (1)
-290 = b + 14a     (2)

We can solve these two linear equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

We can start by multiplying equation (1) by 2 to eliminate b when we add the equations:

260 = 2b - 14a     (3)
-290 = b + 14a      (2)

Now, adding equations (3) and (2):

260 + (-290) = (2b - 14a) + (b + 14a)
-30 = 3b

Now, dividing both sides by 3 to solve for b:

b = -10

Now we can substitute b back into either equation (1) or (2) to find a. We'll use equation (1):

130 = -10 - 7a

Adding 10 to both sides:

140 = -7a

Now, dividing both sides by -7 to solve for a:

a = -20

The linear function that fits the data points is:

y = -10 + (-20)x

or simply

y = -10 - 20x

There might be some round off-errors due to the manual calculation, but based on the given points, this function should describe the relationship quite closely.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the values of a and b that work for all given input-output pairs.

The term ax^0 simplifies to a because any number raised to the 0th power is 1. So, we need to find a function of the form y = a + bx.

Given the input-output pairs:

- When x = -7,  y = 130
- When x = 14, y = -290
- When x = -12, y = 230
- When x = 16, y = -330

To find b, we can use any two input/output pairs to find the slope (b) of the line. Let's use the first two points (-7, 130) and (14, -290). Using the slope formula:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Substitute the given points:

b = (-290 - 130) / (14 - (-7))
b = (-420) / (21)
b = -20

Now that we have the value for b, we can use any of the points to find the value for a. Let's use the point (-7, 130):

130 = a + (-20) * (-7)
130 = a + 140
a = 130 - 140
a = -10

So, the function that describes the data is:

y = -10 + (-20)x

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is always 1, we can plug in the known input-output pairs and create a system of equations to solve for a and b.

Let's use the first and fourth pairs of inputs and outputs for this purpose:

1. Using the pair Input: -14, Output: -97:

-97 = a + b(-14)

2. Using the pair Input: 2, Output: 15:

15 = a + b(2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1. -97 = a - 14b
2. 15 = a + 2b

Let's solve the second equation for a:

a = 15 - 2b

Now, substitute this expression for a into the first equation:

-97 = (15 - 2b) - 14b
-97 = 15 - 16b
-112 = -16b
b = 7

Now that we have b, we can find a:

a = 15 - 2(7)
a = 15 - 14
a = 1

Now we have values for a and b, we can write the function:

y = 1 + 7x

    To write the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants a and b such that they satisfy the given input-output pairs. The term ax^0 is equivalent to a constant value a since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Given the pairs:
1. Input: -14 Output: -97
2. Input: 7 Output: 50
3. Input: 2 Output: 15

Let's use two pairs to solve for a and b:

Using input 7 (output 50) and input 2 (output 15), we have:
1. 50 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1
2. 15 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1

Simplified, since anything to the power of 0 is 1, we have:
1. 50 = a + 7b
2. 15 = a + 2b

We can solve this system of equations by subtracting equation 2 from equation 1, to isolate b:

(50 - a) - (15 - a) = 7b - 2b
35 - a + a = 5b
35 = 5b
b = 35 / 5
b = 7

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into either equation to solve for a. Using equation 2:

15 = a + 2(7)
15 = a + 14
a = 15 - 14
a = 1

Now we have the values of a and b, so we can write the function as:

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = 1x^0 + 7x^1
y = 1 + 7x

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that relates the input to the output, we can use the given points to solve for a and b.

First, let's plug the given points into the equation and see if we can identify a pattern:

For Input: -14, Output: -97:
-97 = a(-14)^0 + b(-14)^1
-97 = a * 1 - 14b
-97 = a - 14b

For Input: 7, Output: 50:
50 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1
50 = a * 1 + 7b
50 = a + 7b

For Input: 2, Output: 15:
15 = a(2)^0 + b(2)^1
15 = a * 1 + 2b
15 = a + 2b

Now we have a system of equations with two unknowns and at least two distinct equations. We can solve for a and b. However, looking at the first and third equations:

For -14 → -97:
-97 = a - 14b

For 2 → 15:
15 = a + 2b

Since both of these equations have a as a term, we can set them equal to solve for b:

a - 14b = -97
a + 2b = 15

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:

-14b - 2b = -97 - 15
-16b = -112
b = 7

If we substitute b = 7 into the second equation:

a + 2(7) = 15
a + 14 = 15
a = 1

So, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that matches the given data is:

y = 1x^0 + 7x^1
y = 1 * 1 + 7x
y = 1 + 7x

    Given the form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, the term ax^0 simplifies to a because x^0 is always 1 for any x ≠ 0. So the equation we are looking to construct is y = a + bx.

Based on the input-output pairs given:

(-14, -97)
(-14, -97)
(7, 50)
(2, 15)
(7, 50)

we can see that for a consistent relationship, applying the same input should always yield the same output, which is the case here.

Now we will use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for a and b.

Let's use the pairs (7, 50) and (2, 15).

For (7, 50):
50 = a + 7b

For (2, 15):
15 = a + 2b

Now we have a system of two linear equations to solve:

1) 50 = a + 7b
2) 15 = a + 2b

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate a:

(50 - 15) = (a + 7b) - (a + 2b)
35 = 5b
b = 7

With b known, we can substitute it back into any of the two original equations to find a. We'll use equation 2):

15 = a + 2b
15 = a + 2(7)
15 = a + 14
a = 15 - 14
a = 1

Given the pairs of input and output:

1. For input -14, output is -97: -97 = a + b(-14)
2. For input 7, output is 50: 50 = a + b(7)
3. For input 2, output is 15: 15 = a + b(2)

We have two unique equations here since the first one is repeated:

-97 = a - 14b (1)
50 = a + 7b (2)
15 = a + 2b (3)

To find the values of a and b, we will use equations (2) and (3) to solve for a and b.

Subtracting equation (3) from equation (2), we get:
50 - 15 = a + 7b - (a + 2b)
35 = 5b
b = 7

Now, we substitute the value of b into the equation (2):

50 = a + 49
a = 50 - 49
a = 1

    To find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) for the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) that is not zero, we need at least two distinct points to derive a system of linear equations. Luckily, we have five points given here. However, we just need two to solve for the coefficients, but more points can help verify if a linear relationship is consistent across all provided data.

Let's take the first two points and set up our equations:

1. Using Input: 5, Output: -26:
\[ -26 = a + 5b \]

2. Using Input: 1, Output: -14:
\[ -14 = a + 1b \]

We have a system of two equations now:
\[ \begin{align*}
a + 5b & = -26 \\
a + b & = -14
\end{align*} \]

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( a \):
\[ \begin{align*}
(5b - b) & = (-26 - (-14)) \\
4b & = -12 \\
b & = -12 / 4 \\
b & = -3

Now let's plug \( b \) back into the second equation to find \( a \):
\[ \begin{align*}
a - 3 & = -14 \\
a & = -14 + 3 \\
a & = -11
\end{align*} \]

The function should therefore be:
\[ y = -11 + (-3)x \]

However, it's important to note that given more points, we should check if our derived coefficients are consistent across all the points provided. Let's do a quick check:

1. For Input: -14, the Output should be (our function predicts): \( y = -11 - 3(-14) = -11 + 42 = 31 \), which matches the given Output: 31.
2. For Input: -5, the Output should be: \( y = -11 - 3(-5) = -11 + 15 = 4 \), which matches the given Output: 4.

The equation simplifies to $y = a + bx$ because $x^0$ is always 1 for any x that is not 0. Now we have two unknowns (a and b), so we will need at least two points to solve for them. Using the given points (5, -26) and (1, -14):

   -14 = a + b

Now, we can solve the above system of linear equations to find the values of a and b:

From the second equation, we can express a in terms of b:
a = -14 - b

Then we'll substitute this expression for a back into the first equation:

-12 = 4b
b = -3

\(113 = a + b(-16)\)

With these 5 equations, we can solve for 'a' and 'b'. However, note that if the values form a consistent linear pattern, two points would be sufficient to determine the line. Since we have more than two points, it is likely that they might not perfectly align on a single line, and we might need to use a method like least squares regression to find the best fitting 'a' and 'b'. Here, for simplicity, I will demonstrate the system of equation method assuming the data perfectly fits the function (which in practical cases it often does not).

Using two of the equations to solve for 'a' and 'b':

Let's pick the two inputs and outputs of -9 and 64, and -3 and 22.

We have:
\(64 = a - 9b\) (1)
\(22 = a - 3b\) (2)

Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate 'a' and solve for 'b':
\(64 - 22 = a - 9b - (a - 3b)\)
\(42 = -6b\)
\(b = -7\)

Now that we have 'b', we can solve for 'a' using either equation (1) or (2). Let's use equation (2):
\(22 = a - 3(-7)\)
\(22 = a + 21\)
\(a = 1\)

Now, we've determined \(a = 1\) and \(b = -7\) under the assumption that the data fits perfectly to a linear model (which we cannot confirm solely with the information given). Therefore, the function would be:

Output: \(y = 1x^0 - 7x^1\)
Or simplifying,
Output: \(y = 1 - 7x\)

Therefore, the output is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we interpret ax^0 as a constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 as a linear term with respect to x.

So we have y = a + bx.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can create a system of equations. We will use two input-output pairs to solve for a and b.

Let's use the following two pairs: (-9, 64) and (-3, 22).

From the first pair:
64 = a + b(-9)
64 = a - 9b

From the second pair:
22 = a + b(-3)
22 = a - 3b

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) 64 = a - 9b
2) 22 = a - 3b

To solve for a and b, let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
(64 - 22) = (a - a) - (9b - 3b)
42 = -6b
b = -7

Now let's solve for a using b = -7:
64 = a - 9(-7)
64 = a + 63
a = 1

So the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes this dataset, we need to realize that ax^0 is simply a since anything to the power of zero is 1 (x^0 = 1). So, we're looking for constants a and b such that:

y = a + bx

Let's take two points from the dataset to form a system of equations to solve for a and b.

Using the given points (-9, 64) and (-3, 22):

1. For the input -9:
64 = a + b(-9)

2. For the input -3:
22 = a + b(-3)

Now we have two equations:
1. 64 = a - 9b
2. 22 = a - 3b

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b.

Let's subtract the second equation from the first:

64 - 22 = a - 9b - (a - 3b)
42 = -9b + 3b
42 = -6b
b = -7

    To determine the parameters for our function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to fit the parameters a and b to the provided input-output pairs. The a represents a constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1), and the b represents the coefficient for our linear term. 

Let's take two of the provided pairs to set up a system of linear equations:

For input -3 (output 22):
22 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
22 = a - 3b

For input 9 (output -62):
-62 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
-62 = a + 9b

You now have the following system of linear equations:
1) a - 3b = 22
2) a + 9b = -62

You can solve this system for a and b. First, let's add equation 1) to 2) to eliminate a:

(a - 3b) + (a + 9b) = 22 - 62
2a + 6b = -40
a + 3b = -20

Now, subtract equation 1) from this new equation:

(a + 3b) - (a - 3b) = -20 - 22
2a + 3b - a + 3b = -42
6b = -42

Now, divide by 6 to find b:

b = -42/6
b = -7

Now solve for a using one of the original equations with the found value of b:

a + 9(-7) = -62
a - 63 = -62
a = -62 + 63
a = 1

So our determined parameters are a = 1 and b = -7, and the function we are looking for is:

    To determine the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we need to understand that \(ax^0\) is effectively a constant (since \(x^0 = 1\) for any \(x\) that is not zero), and \(bx^1\) is simply \(bx\) because raising \(x\) to the power of 1 leaves \(x\) unchanged. 
Thus, our function will look like \(y = a + bx\).

We can use two data points to determine the constants \(a\) and \(b\). Let's use the following two points: (-20, 265) and (-15, 195).

For the first data point (-20, 265):

\(265 = a + b(-20)\)

\[ -99 = a + b(6) \]
\[ -99 = a + 6b \tag{2} \]

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for \(a\) and \(b\) by using equation (1) to substitute for \(a\) in equation (2).

From equation (1):
\[ a = 265 + 20b \]

Substitute \(a\) in equation (2) with the expression from equation (1):

Given that x^0 = 1 for all x (except for x = 0, where it is undefined but it's conventionally taken as 1), we can say that a is the constant term we are adding to bx to get y.

Given the data:

Solving the two equations together by adding equation (2) to equation (1), we get:

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify this to y = a + bx, because x^0 is 1 for all x except x = 0, and x^1 is just x.

Let's use our inputs and outputs as points to solve for a and b:

1. For input -10, output -54:
-54 = a + b(-10)
-54 = a - 10b ... (1)

2. For input 4, output 2:
2 = a + b(4)
2 = a + 4b ... (2)

3. For input -20, output -94:
-94 = a + b(-20)
-94 = a - 20b ... (3)

4. For input -4, output -30 (the second pair of input 4 has the same output, so it doesn't provide us with a new equation):
-30 = a + b(-4)
-30 = a - 4b ... (4)

We now have a system of equations consisting of (1), (2), and (4) that we can solve for a and b. Note that we only really need two distinct equations to solve for the two variables, so we will use the first and second equations:

From (1):
-54 = a - 10b

From (2):
2 = a + 4b

We can solve for a from equation (2) and substitute in (1), for example:
a = 2 - 4b ... (5)

Substitute (5) into (1):
-54 = (2 - 4b) - 10b
-54 = 2 - 4b - 10b
-54 = 2 - 14b
-54 - 2 = -14b
-56 = -14b
b = -56 / -14
b = 4

Now we put b back into equation (5) to find a:
a = 2 - 4(4)
a = 2 - 16
a = -14

    To determine the coefficients a and b that define the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to analyze the provided input-output pairs.

Given the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, simplifying x^0 to 1 (since any number to the power of zero is 1), the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

We can use the given input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations by substituting x with the inputs and y with the outputs:

1. -54 = a + b(-10)
2. 2 = a + b(4)
3. -94 = a + b(-20)
4. 2 = a + b(4) [Same as 2]
5. -30 = a + b(-4)

We can start by focusing on the second and fifth pairs because they involve smaller numbers which may be simpler to work with:

2 = a + 4b
-30 = a - 4b

Let's add these two equations to eliminate b:

(2 = a + 4b) + (-30 = a - 4b)
2 - 30 = a + 4b + a - 4b
-28 = 2a
a = -28 / 2
a = -14

Now that we have the value of a, we can substitute it into any of the above equations to solve for b. Let's use the second equation:

2 = a + 4b
2 = -14 + 4b
4b = 2 + 14
4b = 16
b = 16 / 4
b = 4

So the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find a function that captures the relationship between the inputs and the outputs, we'll look at it as a linear function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\) because \(x^0\) is 1 for all x except for x=0 and \(x^1\) is just \(x\).

Given that we have several pairs of inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of linear equations and solve for \(a\) and \(b\). However, since this is a linear relationship and we are looking for only two coefficients, it is enough to use two input-output pairs to determine \(a\) and \(b\).

Let's use two pairs of points to form two equations and solve for \(a\) and \(b\):

Using Input: -11 and Output: -20
-20 = a - 11b ---- (1)

Using Input: -2 and Output: -2
-2 = a - 2b ---- (2)

Now, let's solve these two equations to find \(a\) and \(b\).

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate \(a\) and solve for \(b\):
(-20) - (-2) = (-11b) - (-2b)
-20 + 2 = -11b + 2b
-18 = -9b
b = 2

Now that we have \(b\), we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to solve for \(a\). Let's use equation (2):

-2 = a - 2*2
-2 = a - 4
a = -2 + 4
a = 2

So, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    The function we are seeking is a linear function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, which simplifies to `y = a + bx` because `x^0` is 1 for all x except for x=0 (but that exception is not relevant for our linear function). Here, `a` is the y-intercept of the function (the value of y when x is 0), and `b` is the slope of the function (how much y increases for each unit increase in x).

To determine `a` and `b`, we can use two of the input-output pairs given. Let's use the following two points: (-11, -20) and (-2, -2).

Plugging them into the `y = a + bx` format, we get two equations:
1. -20 = a + b(-11)
2. -2 = a + b(-2)

Now we can solve this system of equations:

From equation 2, solve for `a`:
-2 = a - 2b
a = -2 + 2b    ...(3)

Now plug the expression for `a` from equation (3) into equation 1:
-20 = (-2 + 2b) - 11b
-20 = -2 + 2b - 11b
-20 = -2 - 9b
-18 = -9b
b = -18/-9
b = 2

Now plug the value of `b` back into equation (3) to solve for `a`:
a = -2 + 2(2)
a = -2 + 4
a = 2

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the data, we will use the given input-output pairs to determine the coefficients a and b.

First, let's notice that x^0 is always 1 for any x (except for x=0, but zero is not included in our inputs), so the term involving a is just a constant value. The term involving b is then bx since x^1 is x.

Now, let's follow these steps to determine a and b:

1. Choose two points to calculate the slope (b coefficient).
2. Use the slope and one of the points to calculate the y-intercept (a coefficient).

Let's use the points (-11, -20) and (-2, -2) to calculate the slope (b):

b = (output2 - output1) / (input2 - input1)
b = (-2 - (-20)) / (-2 - (-11))
b = (18) / (9)
b = 2

So now our function looks like this: y = a + 2x

Next, we'll solve for a using one of our points. Let's use the point (-11, -20):

-20 = a + 2(-11)

Let's use the following two points: (-11, -20) and (-2, -2). Substituting these into the equation gives us:

For (-11, -20):
-20 = a + b(-11)

For (-2, -2):
-2 = a + b(-2)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1) -20 = a - 11b
2) -2 = a - 2b

We can solve this system of equations for a and b. Let's rearrange equation 2) to isolate a:

a = -2 + 2b

Now substitute this expression for a into equation 1):

-20 = (-2 + 2b) - 11b
-20 = -2 + 2b - 11b
-20 + 2 = -9b

b = 2

99 - 9 = -5b
90 = -5b

b = -18

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the coefficients a and b that will satisfy the given input-output pairs. The term ax^0 is simply a, because x^0 is 1 for any x that is not zero. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have the following pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y):

1) x = -16, y = 297
2) x = 18, y = -315
3) x = -16, y = 297
4) x = -5, y = 99
5) x = 5, y = -81

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to set up a system of linear equations to solve for a and b. It would be efficient to use the pairs that give us different inputs for x to ensure we have a solvable system. For instance, we can choose pairs (2) and (4) or (2) and (5). Let's use pairs (2) and (4):

For x = 18, y = -315, we have:
-315 = a + 18b ...(1)

For x = -5, y = 99, we have:
99 = a - 5b ...(2)

Now we have a system of linear equations that we can solve using substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiply equation (2) by 18 to align the a coefficients:
1782 = 18a - 90b ...(3)

Multiply equation (1) by 5 to align the a coefficients:
-1575 = 5a + 90b ...(4)

Now add equations (3) and (4) to eliminate b:
1782 + (-1575) = (18a + 5a) + (-90b + 90b)
207 = 23a

Solving for a:
a = 207 / 23
a = 9

Now plug a into one of the original equations to find b. Using equation (1):
-315 = 9 + 18b
-315 - 9 = 18b
-324 = 18b

Solving for b:
b = -324 / 18
b = -18

Now we have both coefficients. So the function is:
y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = 9 + (-18)x
y = 9 - 18x

Therefore:

Output: y = 9 - 18x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the data, we'll first recognize that ax^0 is equivalent to a since x^0 equals 1 for any x that isn't zero. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We are given five points: (-16, 297), (18, -315), (-16, 297), (-5, 99), and (5, -81). The fact that (-16, 297) appears twice suggests that the function should produce consistent results for the same input.

To solve for a and b, we can use two of the distinct points to create a system of two linear equations and then solve for a and b.

Let’s use (-16, 297) and (18, -315):

For the point (-16, 297):
297 = a - 16b

For the point (18, -315):
-315 = a + 18b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:
1) 297 = a - 16b
2) -315 = a + 18b

We can solve for a and b using various methods such as substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination in this case:

Add the two equations:
297 + (-315) = (a - 16b) + (a + 18b)
-18 = 2a + 2b
-9 = a + b ... (equation 3)

Now let's subtract the second equation from the first:
297 - (-315) = (a - 16b) - (a + 18b)
612 = -34b
b = -18

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into equation 3:
-9 = a + (-18)
a = 9

So based on these two points, the function is:
y = 9 - 18x

Let's check this against all the provided points to ensure it fits:
For x = -16, y = 9 - 18(-16) = 9 + 288 = 297 ✓
For x = 18, y = 9 - 18(18) = 9 - 324 = -315 ✓
For x = -5, y = 9 - 18(-5) = 9 + 90 = 99 ✓
For x = 5, y = 9 - 18(5) = 9 - 90 = -81 ✓

Therefore, the function that fits the data is:

    To find the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we will interpret it as a linear function of \( x \) with two constants \( a \) and \( b \):

\[ y = a + bx \]

Now, we need to find the values for \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the given input-output pairs. Because this is a linear function, we only need two different points to determine the function uniquely. We have been given multiple pairs, and it seems that some of them are repeated, so we'll use two unique pairs to calculate \( a \) and \( b \). For example, we could take the points (-16, 297) and (18, -315) to form the following equations:

1) \( 297 = a - 16b \)

2) \( -315 = a + 18b \)

Now, we can solve this system of equations using elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

By adding both equations, we get:

\( 297 - 315 = a - 16b + a + 18b \)
\( -18 = 2a + 2b \)
\( -9 = a + b \)  (dividing both sides by 2)

Let's call this Equation 3.

Now, let's subtract the second equation from the first one:

\( 297 + 315 = a - 16b - (a + 18b) \)
\( 612 = -34b \)
\( b = -18 \)  (dividing both sides by -34)

Now that we have \( b \), we can find \( a \) using Equation 3:

\( -9 = a - 18 \)
\( a = 9 \)

So the function that fits the given pairs of data is:

\[ y = 9 - 18x \]

    The function requested is of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is a linear function that can be simplified to y = a + bx, where ""a"" is the y-intercept of the line and ""b"" is the slope of the line.

From the given pairs of inputs and outputs, we have the following equations based on the points provided:

1. For input -16: 297 = a + b(-16)
2. For input 18: -315 = a + b(18)
3. The third input-output pair is the same as the first, and so provides no new information.
4. For input -5: 99 = a + b(-5)
5. For input 5: -81 = a + b(5)

We have two unique pairs of equations that we can use to solve for ""a"" and ""b"". Let's use equations 2 and 5, as they represent the inputs as positive and negative versions of a number, which can make calculations somewhat easier:

For input 18: -315 = a + b(18)           ...(1)
For input 5: -81 = a + b(5)              ...(2)

We can solve these two equations using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's multiply the second equation by 18/5 to align the b terms:

(18/5) * (-81) = (18/5) * a + b(18)
-291.6 = 3.6a + b(18)

Now, we have a new system:

-315 = a + b(18)   ...(1)
-291.6 = 3.6a + b(18)   ...(3)

Subtract equation (3) from equation (1):

-315 - (-291.6) = a + b(18) - (3.6a + b(18))
-23.4 = -2.6a

Now solve for ""a"":

a = -23.4 / -2.6
a = 9

Substitute ""a"" into one of the original equations to find ""b"", let's use equation (2):

-81 = 9 + b(5)
-81 - 9 = 5b
-90 = 5b
b = -90 / 5
b = -18

y = 9x^0 - 18x^1

    Given the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we can simplify this to `y = a + bx`, because `x^0` is equal to 1 for any x other than 0.

We have pairs of input (x) and output (y) which we can substitute into the simplified equation to solve for `a` and `b`.

Consider two of the provided data points to create a system of equations:

1. For input x = -18, output y = -265:
   -265 = a + b(-18)

2. For input x = 19, output y = 253:
   253 = a + b(19)

Now we can write out the two equations as:

1. a - 18b = -265  (Equation 1)
2. a + 19b = 253   (Equation 2)

By adding both equations, we can solve for `a`:

(a - 18b) + (a + 19b) = -265 + 253
2a + b = -12

This equation still has two variables. We need to isolate one variable to solve for the other, which we can by using both equations. We can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(a + 19b) - (a - 18b) = 253 - (-265)
19b + 18b = 253 + 265
37b = 518

Dividing both sides by 37 to solve for `b`:

b = 518 / 37
b = 14

Now we can plug the value of `b` back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for `a`. We use Equation 1 for this purpose:

a - 18(14) = -265
a - 252 = -265
a = -265 + 252
a = -13

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the input-output pairs, we can attempt to find a linear relationship that fits the data in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1. This is essentially a linear function y = b * x + a, since x^0 equals 1 for all x that is not zero, and a and b are constants that we need to determine.

We can solve for a and b using a system of linear equations derived from the given input-output pairs, but since we only have to describe the function and not calculate the actual coefficients, we can express it based on the pattern we see from the pairs.

Let's start by looking for a pattern in the coefficients by comparing the change in output to the change in input:

From the first and second input-output pairs:
When input changes from -18 to 19, a total change of 37, the output changes from -265 to 253, a change of 518.

From the third and fourth input-output pairs:
When input changes from -15 to 6, a total change of 21, the output changes from -223 to 71, a change of 294.

The change in output is consistently 14 times the change in input (518 ÷ 37 = 14 and 294 ÷ 21 = 14), indicating that b is likely 14.

Now let's find a by substituting one of the input-output pairs into y = ax^0 + 14x. We can use the pair with the input of 6 and the output of 71.

71 = a(1) + 14(6)
71 = a + 84
a = 71 - 84
a = -13

Thus, our function that captures the relationship between the input x and the output y seems to be:

y = -13x^0 + 14x^1

y = -13 + 14x

    Given that the function needs to be in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, which simplifies to `y = a + bx` because `x^0 = 1` for all x ≠ 0, we have a linear relationship where `a` is the y-intercept, and `b` is the slope of the line.

To find the best fitting `a` and `b` for the given data, we can use two data points to form a system of linear equations and solve for `a` and `b`.

Let's take two of the given points, for example, (-18, -265) and (19, 253):

1) For input -18, output -265:
-265 = a - 18b

2) For input 19, output 253:
253 = a + 19b

Now we have a system of two equations:

-265 = a - 18b   ... (1)
253 = a + 19b   ... (2)

We can solve this system of equations by adding (1) and (2) to eliminate `a`:

-265 + 253 = (a - 18b) + (a + 19b)
-12 = 2a + b

Now we divide by 2 to solve for a:

-6 = a + 0.5b   ... (3)

Next, we can subtract equation (1) from (2):

253 + 265 = a + 19b - (a - 18b)
518 = 37b

Solve for b:

b = 518 / 37
b = 14

Now that we have b, we plug this into equation (3) to solve for a:

-6 = a + 0.5(14)
-6 = a + 7

Subtract 7 from both sides to solve for a:

a = -6 - 7
a = -13

    To find a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which is equivalent to \( y = a + bx \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) so that the function best fits the given data points. This form of the function represents a linear equation with \( a \) as the y-intercept and \( b \) as the slope.

Given two points, we can compute the slope (\( b \)) using the formula:

\[ b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

We can use any two points to calculate this, so let's use the pairs (19, 253) and (-18, -265):

\[ b = \frac{253 - (-265)}{19 - (-18)} = \frac{253 + 265}{19 + 18} = \frac{518}{37} \]

\[ b \approx 14 \]

Now that we have the slope, let's find \( a \) by plugging one of the points into the equation \( y = a + bx \). We can use the point (19, 253) for that:

\[ 253 = a + 14 \cdot 19 \]

We can calculate the slope (b) by taking any two data points and using the formula for slope:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

    Given the data points, it seems like the desired function is a linear one of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx, since x^0 is simply 1 for any x ≠ 0.

Let's plug in the data points to the above equation to create a system of linear equations and solve for a and b.

Using point (0, -15):
-15 = a + b(0)
a = -15

Now we know that a = -15, so we can use another point to find b. Let's use the point (-5, -35):
-35 = -15 + b(-5)
-35 = -15 - 5b
-20 = -5b
b = 4

Now that we have both coefficients a and b, we can define the function:
y = -15 + 4x

Therefore, in the exact form requested, the function is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function that best fits the given inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations using the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. In this equation, x^0 is always 1, so the term involving a will actually just be a constant term a, and the term involving bx^1 is simply bx.

Given the data, we have these points:
(0, -15), (-5, -35), (-4, -31), (5, 5), (-12, -63)

Let's use the data points to set up a system of linear equations:

For input 0:
-15 = a*0^0 + b*0
-15 = a
a = -15 (because b*0 is 0)

Now we know the value of a, let's determine b using the other points:

For input -5:
-35 = -15*(-5)^0 + b*(-5)
-35 = -15*1 - 5b
-35 = -15 - 5b
-20 = -5b
b = 4

For input -4 (to verify the b value):
-31 = -15*(-4)^0 + 4*(-4)
-31 = -15*1 - 16
-31 = -15 - 16
-31 = -31

Since this b value also fits the second data point, let's use the formula we've derived:

y = -15x^0 + 4x^1
y = -15 + 4x

Now to verify with the last two points:

For input 5:
5 = -15 + 4*5
5 = -15 + 20
5 = 5

For input -12:
-63 = -15 + 4*(-12)
-63 = -15 - 48
-63 = -63

Both verifications are correct, so the function that best describes the data provided is:

    To find the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) in the function \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\), we can use two points to form two equations and solve for the coefficients.

The general form is:
\(y = a + bx\)

Let's use the input/output pairs (9, 133) and (19, 283) to create two equations:

1) \(133 = a + 9b\)
2) \(283 = a + 19b\)

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

\(283 - 133 = a + 19b - (a + 9b)\)
\(150 = 10b\)
\(b = 15\)

Now, we can plug this value of \(b\) into one of the equations to solve for \(a\). Using the first equation:

\(133 = a + 9 \cdot 15\)
\(133 = a + 135\)
\(a = -2\)

(16, 238)
(-14, -212)
(-16, -242)

We are asked to find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0.

We can solve for a and b using two points from the data set to create a system of linear equations. I will use the points (9, 133) and (19, 283) to form the system:

1) For point (9, 133):
133 = a + b(9)

2) For point (19, 283):
283 = a + b(19)

I will solve this system by using the substitution or elimination method. First, I'll arrange the equations so that the 'a' terms are on one side:

1) a = 133 - 9b
2) a = 283 - 19b

Now, we can set the right sides of each equation equal to each other since they are both equal to 'a':

133 - 9b = 283 - 19b

Now solve for 'b':

10b = 283 - 133
10b = 150
b = 15

When we have 'b', we can easily solve for 'a' by substituting the value back into either equation 1 or 2:

1) a = 133 - 9b
a = 133 - 9(15)
a = 133 - 135
a = -2

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can see that ax^0 is a constant term (since anything raised to the 0 power is 1), and bx^1 is a linear term (since x raised to the 1 power is x).

From the inputs and outputs provided, we observe that the function appears to be linear. To confirm the linearity and find the coefficients a and b, we can use two data points to solve a system of two equations.

Let's use the points (9, 133) and (-14, -212) to form the following equations:

1. For the input 9: 
133 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)
133 = a + 9b

2. For the input -14:
-212 = a(-14^0) + b(-14^1)
-212 = a - 14b

Now we have a system of two equations:
a + 9b = 133
a - 14b = -212

Let's solve this system for a and b.

By subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
(9b) - (-14b) = 133 - (-212)
23b = 345
b = 345 / 23
b = 15

Now that we have b, we can solve for a by plugging b back into one of the equations (I'll use the first equation for this purpose):
a + 9(15) = 133
a + 135 = 133
a = 133 - 135
a = -2

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) is:
y = ax^0 + bx^1

    To come up with a function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y), we notice that ax^0 is simply a constant term (since anything to the power of zero is 1), and bx^1 is just bx (since anything to the power of one is itself). So the function we are looking for is of the form y = a + bx.

Let's examine two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for a and b:

1) For x = 9, y = 133:
133 = a + 9b

2) For x = -16, y = -242:
-242 = a - 16b

Now we have a system of linear equations:

a + 9b = 133     (Equation 1)
a - 16b = -242   (Equation 2)

We can solve for a and b by subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:

( a + 9b ) - ( a - 16b ) = 133 - ( -242 )
a + 9b - a + 16b = 375
25b = 375
b = 375 / 25
b = 15

Now we can replace b in Equation 1 to solve for a:

a + 9(15) = 133
a + 135 = 133
a = 133 - 135
a = -2

So the function in the desired form y = ax^0 + bx^1 should be:

We can use two data points to solve for a and b. Let's use the first two data points (9, 133) and (19, 283):

1. For the input 9:
133 = a(9^0) + b(9^1)
133 = a + 9b

2. For the input 19:
283 = a(19^0) + b(19^1)
283 = a + 19b

We now have two equations with two unknowns:
1) 133 = a + 9b
2) 283 = a + 19b

We can solve for a and b using these equations by subtracting the first equation from the second:

(283 - 133) = (a + 19b) - (a + 9b)
150 = 10b
b = 150 / 10
b = 15

Now, we can substitute b back into one of the original equations to solve for a. Using the first equation:

133 = a + 135
a = 133 - 135

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), we must determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \). We can use any two points to solve for these constants. Let's use the points (2, 59) and (-16, -301).

Substituting the first point (2, 59) into the equation \( y = a + bx \):

\( 59 = a + 2b \) ... (1)

Substituting the second point (-16, -301) into the equation:

\( -301 = a - 16b \) ... (2)

Now we have a system of linear equations that we can solve to find \( a \) and \( b \).

Multiplying the first equation by 16 to prepare for elimination with equation (2), we get:

\( 16 \times 59 = 16a + 32b \) or \( 944 = 16a + 32b \) ... (3)

Adding equation (2) to equation (3), we get:

\( 944 - 301 = 16a + 32b + a - 16b \) or \( 643 = 17a + 16b \)

Now let's solve the system using equation (1) and this new equation. We arrange them as follows:

\( a + 2b = 59 \) ... (1)

\( 17a + 16b = 643 \) 

Now we will multiply equation (1) by 17:

\( 17a + 34b = 1003 \) ... (4)

Subtract equation (4) from the previous compound equation:

    To write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find values for ""a"" and ""b"" that make the equation consistent with the given input-output pairs.

Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we see that ax^0 is just a because any number raised to the power of zero is 1. So actually, our function is y = a + bx.

Now, let's analyze the given input-output pairs to determine ""a"" and ""b"".

We have the following points:

1. When x = 2, y = 59:
   a + 2b = 59

2. When x = -16, y = -301:
   a - 16b = -301

4. When x = 3, y = 79:

5. When x = -2, y = -21:
   a - 2b = -21

Let's use the first and the last equations to solve for ""a"" and ""b"".

From equation 1 (x=2, y=59):
a + 2b = 59

From equation 5 (x=-2, y=-21):
a - 2b = -21

Let's add these two equations together:
a + 2b + a - 2b = 59 - 21
2a = 38
a = 38 / 2

First, let's simplify the function:
\( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) is equal to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 \) is equal to 1 for all \( x \) (except for \( x = 0 \)) and \( x^1 \) is just \( x \).

1. For input 13: \( 55 = a + 13b \)
2. For input -20: \( -44 = a - 20b \)

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( a + 13b = 55 \)
2. \( a - 20b = -44 \)

Let's solve this system for \( a \) and \( b \):

From equation 1:
\( a = 55 - 13b \)

Substitute \( a \) from equation 1 into equation 2:

\( 55 - 13b - 20b = -44 \)
\( 55 - 33b = -44 \)
\( 33b = 55 + 44 \)
\( 33b = 99 \)
\( b = 99 / 33 \)
\( b = 3 \)

Now plug the value of \( b \) back into equation 1 to find \( a \):

\( a + 13 * 3 = 55 \)
\( a + 39 = 55 \)
\( a = 55 - 39 \)
\( a = 16 \)

Thus, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
\( y = 16 + 3x \)

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are essentially looking for a linear relationship of the form y = a + bx, where a and b are constants, and x is the input.

Given the pairs of input (x) and output (y) values:

(13, 55), (-20, -44), (15, 61), (-1, 13), and (-14, -26),

we can use two of these points to determine the coefficients a and b.

Let's suppose we use the first two points (13, 55) and (-20, -44) to find the values of a and b.

We can set up two equations based on the form y = a + bx:

For the first point (13, 55):

55 = a + 13b  (1)

For the second point (-20, -44):

-44 = a - 20b (2)

Now, we can solve this system of equations.

Multiplying equation (2) by -1 to make addition easier:

44 = -a + 20b (2')

Adding equation (1) to equation (2'):

55 + 44 = a + 13b - a + 20b
99 = 33b
b = 99 / 33
b = 3

Now we can substitute the value of b back into equation (1) to find a:

55 = a + 13(3)
55 = a + 39
a = 55 - 39
a = 16

So the function that captures the relationship between the input and the output values is:

y = 16 + 3x

Therefore, in the exact form requested, the function is:

Output: y = 16x^0 + 3x^1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which is equivalent to y = a + bx since x^0 = 1), we need to solve a system of equations using the provided input-output pairs. We can set up two equations using two different input-output pairs. Let's choose the pairs (13, 55) and (-20, -44):

For input 13:
55 = a * 1 + b * 13
55 = a + 13b ...(1)

For input -20:
-44 = a * 1 + b * (-20)
-44 = a - 20b ...(2)

Now, we need to solve this system of linear equations for a and b:

From equation (1):
a = 55 - 13b

Plug this into equation (2):
-44 = (55 - 13b) - 20b
-44 = 55 - 13b - 20b
-44 = 55 - 33b
-44 - 55 = -33b
-99 = -33b
b = -99 / -33
b = 3

Now that we have b, we can find a. Substitute b back into equation (1):
a = 55 - 13 * 3
a = 55 - 39
a = 16

The function that describes the data is, therefore:
y = 16 * x^0 + 3 * x^1
y = 16 + 3x

Thus, the explicit function is:

    To find the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can see that this is a linear function where \( ax^0 = a \) (because any number to the zeroth power, except for zero, is 1) and \( bx^1 = bx \) (because any number to the first power is itself). Hence the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

We can determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) by forming a system of linear equations using two of the given input-output pairs. Let's use the pairs (13, 55) and (-20, -44).

For the input 13:
\( 55 = a + 13b \) — Equation (1)

For the input -20:
\( -44 = a - 20b \) — Equation (2)

Now, let's solve this system of equations:

Multiply Equation (2) by 13 to eliminate \( a \) when we subtract the equations:
\( 13(-44) = 13a - 260b \)
\( -572 = 13a - 260b \) — Equation (3)

Multiply Equation (1) by 20:
\( 20(55) = 20a + 260b \)
\( 1100 = 20a + 260b \) — Equation (4)

Now, add Equation (3) and Equation (4) to eliminate \( b \):
\( -572 + 1100 = (13a - 260b) + (20a + 260b) \)
\( 528 = 33a \)
\( a = \frac{528}{33} \)
\( a = 16 \)

Substitute the value of \( a \) into Equation (1) to find \( b \):
\( 55 = 16 + 13b \)
\( 39 = 13b \)
\( b = \frac{39}{13} \)
\( b = 3 \)

    To determine the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first acknowledge that \( ax^0 \) is essentially \( a \) since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the coefficients we need to find.

Looking at the given inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of equations for two of the points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the points (13, 55) and (-20, -44):

1. For the input-output pair (13, 55), we get:
   \( 55 = a + 13b \)

2. For the input-output pair (-20, -44), we get:
   \( -44 = a - 20b \)

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
\begin{align*}
a + 13b &= 55 \\
a - 20b &= -44
\end{align*}
\]

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( a \):

\( (a + 13b) - (a - 20b) = 55 - (-44) \)

\( a + 13b - a + 20b = 55 + 44 \)

\( 33b = 99 \)

\( b = 99 / 33 \)

\( b = 3 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can solve for \( a \) using either of the two original equations. Let's use the first one:

\( a + 13b = 55 \)

\( a + 13(3) = 55 \)

\( a + 39 = 55 \)

\( a = 55 - 39 \)

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants a and b. The term ax^0 is simply a, since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1, and the term bx^1 is just bx, since any number to the power of 1 is itself.

Given the data points:

1. x = -11, y = 72
2. x = -3, y = 8
3. x = -2, y = 0
4. x = 18, y = -160
5. x = -7, y = 40

We are looking for the equation of the form:

y = a + bx

To determine a and b, we'll plug in the givens:

1. 72 = a - 11b
2. 8 = a - 3b
3. 0 = a - 2b
4. -160 = a + 18b
5. 40 = a - 7b

We now have a system of equations. Let's use equation 3 (0 = a - 2b) to express a in terms of b:

a = 2b

Substitute a = 2b into one of the other equations. Let's use equation 2 for this:

8 = 2b - 3b
8 = -b
b = -8

Now we have the value for b, we can find a using the equation a = 2b:

a = 2(-8)
a = -16

Therefore, the function is:

y = -16 - 8x

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the data, we only have two coefficients to solve for, a and b. The term ax^0 is the same as a because any number to the power of zero is 1. So the function we want is of the form y = a + bx.

Using the given data points, we have these equations:

1. For input -11, output 72: 72 = a + b(-11)
2. For input -3, output 8: 8 = a + b(-3)
3. For input -2, output 0: 0 = a + b(-2)
4. For input 18, output -160: -160 = a + b(18)
5. For input -7, output 40: 40 = a + b(-7)

We can choose two of these equations to solve for a and b. It's usually best to choose the simplest ones to minimize computational errors. Let's use equations (3) and (4):

From equation (3): 0 = a - 2b
From equation (4): -160 = a + 18b

Now we can solve these two equations as a system:

a - 2b = 0           =>           a = 2b
a + 18b = -160

Substitute the value of a from the first equation into the second:

2b + 18b = -160
20b = -160
b = -160 / 20
b = -8

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using a = 2b:

a = 2(-8)
a = -16

    To find a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the data, we recognize that ax^0 is just a, since x^0 is equal to 1 for any value of x other than 0. The function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given this, our task is to find a and b that will fit the data points provided as closely as possible. This is essentially fitting a linear relationship, so we'll need to calculate the slopes between each pair of points and see if we can find a consistent slope (b) and y-intercept (a).

Let's take two points and calculate the slope (b):

Using points (-11, 72) and (-2, 0), the slope b is calculated as:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (0 - 72) / (-2 - (-11)) = (-72) / (9) = -8.

Now let's see if this slope fits the other points:

Taking points (-3, 8) and (-2, 0), the slope is:
b = (0 - 8) / (-2 - (-3)) = (-8) / (1) = -8.

This matches the slope we calculated earlier (-8), which is promising.

We can now check whether this slope (-8) also fits the other provided data points. For point (-7, 40), if we use the slope b = -8, then:

40 = a + (-8)(-7)
40 = a + 56
a = 40 - 56
a = -16.

Let's see if this value of a (-16) and the slope b (-8) match the rest of the data points:

For the point (18, -160):
-160 = -16 + (-8)(18)
-160 = -16 - 144
-160 = -160 (This matches)

Since all picked points satisfy the linear equation with a = -16 and b = -8, we can write the function as:

y = -16 + (-8)x.

So finally, the function that captures the relationship is:

y = -16 + (-8)x.

Using the pair (-3, 8):
8 = a - 3b   ... [1]

We can create two equations using two of the input-output pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the pairs (-2, 0) and (18, -160):

Given that we have pairs of inputs and outputs, we can plug these values into our linear equation to get a system of equations that will allow us to solve for a and b. Here are two of such pairs:

1. For input 11, output -204:  -204 = 11b + a
2. For input -4, output 66:     66  = -4b + a

Now let us solve for a and b using these two equations:

From equation 1: a = -204 - 11b  (1)
From equation 2: a = 66 + 4b   (2)

Setting equation (1) equal to equation (2) to solve for b:

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we first need to rewrite this function to a more familiar linear form: \( y = a + bx \), since \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any \( x \) not equal to zero.

We need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that will satisfy the given input-output pairs.

Let's use the two provided pairs to set up two equations:

1. Using the input-output pair (11, -204):
\[ -204 = a + b(11) \]
\[ -204 = a + 11b \]

2. Using the input-output pair (-4, 66):
\[ 66 = a + b(-4) \]
\[ 66 = a - 4b \]

We will solve this linear system of equations to find \( a \) and \( b \).

First, let's multiply the second equation by 11 to help us eliminate \( a \):

\[ 11 \times 66 = 11a - 44b \]
\[ 726 = 11a - 44b \]

Now we have two new equations:

\[ -204 = a + 11b \ (1) \]
\[ 726 = 11a - 44b \ (2) \]

By adding equation (1) and equation (2), we can find the value of \( a \):

\[ -204 + 726 = a + 11b + 11a - 44b \]
\[ 522 = 12a - 33b \]

Dividing the entire equation by 12 gives us:

\[ 43.5 = a - 2.75b \]

Now we have a new equation (3):

\[ 43.5 = a - 2.75b \ (3) \]

We substitute \( a \) from equation (3) into equation (1):

\[ -204 = (43.5 + 2.75b) + 11b \]
\[ -204 = 43.5 + 13.75b \]

Moving 43.5 to the other side:

\[ -204 - 43.5 = 13.75b \]
\[ -247.5 = 13.75b \]

Dividing both sides by 13.75 to find \( b \):

\[ b = \frac{-247.5}{13.75} \]
\[ b = -18 \]

Now we can find \( a \) using the value of \( b \) and equation (3):

\[ 43.5 = a - 2.75(-18) \]
\[ 43.5 = a + 49.5 \]
\[ a = 43.5 - 49.5 \]
\[ a = -6 \]

Finally, the function that describes the data is:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we want to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \). This function is essentially a linear function of the form \( y = a + bx \), since \( x^0 \) equals 1 for any \( x \) and \( x^1 \) is just \( x \).

Given the pairs (input, output):

1. (11, -204)
2. (-4, 66)
3. (-17, 300)
4. (-15, 264)
5. (20, -366)

We can use any two pairs to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the first and the last pairs:

For pair (11, -204):
\( -204 = a \cdot 11^0 + b \cdot 11^1 \)
\( -204 = a + 11b \) ... (1)

For pair (20, -366):
\( -366 = a \cdot 20^0 + b \cdot 20^1 \)
\( -366 = a + 20b \) ... (2)

Now we have a system of equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

\[ \begin{cases}
a + 11b = -204 \\
a + 20b = -366 \\
\end{cases} \]

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:

\( (a + 20b) - (a + 11b) = -366 - (-204) \)
\( 20b - 11b = -366 + 204 \)
\( 9b = -162 \)
\( b = -162 / 9 \)
\( b = -18 \)

Now to find \( a \), we can substitute \( b \) into either equation (1) or (2). Let's use equation (1):

\( a + 11(-18) = -204 \)
\( a - 198 = -204 \)
\( a = -204 + 198 \)
\( a = -6 \)

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs can be written as:

    To determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) for the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can use the given input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations.

Given the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), this simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) except 0.

Now we can use any two distinct input-output pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's arbitrarily choose the first two pairs:

For input-output pair (11, -204):
\[ -204 = a + b(11) \]

For input-output pair (-4, 66):
\[ 66 = a + b(-4) \]

Now, we have the system of equations:
1. \( -204 = a + 11b \)
2. \( 66 = a - 4b \)

Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to solve for \( b \):
\[ -204 - 66 = a + 11b - (a - 4b) \]
\[ -270 = a + 11b - a + 4b \]
\[ -270 = 15b \]
\[ b = -270 / 15 \]
\[ b = -18 \]

Now that we have \( b \), we can plug it back into one of the original equations to solve for \( a \). Let's use equation (1):
\[ -204 = a + 11(-18) \]
\[ -204 = a - 198 \]
\[ a = -204 + 198 \]
\[ a = -6 \]

Thus, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the coefficients ""a"" and ""b"". The term ax^0 is equivalent to a because any number raised to the zero power is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We have a system of equations based on the provided inputs and outputs.

For the inputs and outputs given, we have:

1. a + 11b = -204
2. a - 4b = 66
3. a - 17b = 300
4. a - 15b = 264
5. a + 20b = -366

We can solve this system of equations using any two pairs of input-output to find the values of ""a"" and ""b"". However, we will use the pair (11, -204) and the pair (-4, 66) to build and solve the system of equations.

From equation 1: a + 11b = -204   ---(3)
From equation 2: a - 4b = 66     ---(4)

Next, we can subtract equation (4) from equation (3):

(a + 11b) - (a - 4b) = -204 - 66
a + 11b - a + 4b = -270
15b = -270

Now, we divide both sides by 15 to solve for ""b"":

b = -270 / 15
b = -18

Now that we have the value of ""b"", we can substitute it back into any of the equations to solve for ""a"". We can use equation (4):

a - 4(-18) = 66
a + 72 = 66
a = 66 - 72
a = -6

So, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find a linear function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we should find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) for the function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 \) is always 1.

Given this form and the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of linear equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). 

Let's use two pairs of input and output to set up two equations:

Using the input/output pair (-12, 9):

\( 9 = a + b(-12) \)

Using the input/output pair (20, -55):

\( -55 = a + b(20) \)

We now have a system of two equations:

1) \( 9 = a - 12b \)
2) \( -55 = a + 20b \)

We can solve this system using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiply the first equation by 20 and the second equation by 12:

1) \( 180 = 20a - 240b \)
2) \( -660 = 12a + 240b \)

Now add the two equations together to eliminate \( b \):

\( 180 - 660 = (20a + 12a) + (-240b + 240b) \)
\( -480 = 32a \)

Now solve for \( a \):

\( a = \frac{-480}{32} \)
\( a = -15 \)

Now we'll find \( b \) by substituting the value of \( a \) back into one of the original equations:

\( 9 = -15 - 12b \)
\( 12b = -15 - 9 \)
\( 12b = -24 \)
\( b = -2 \)

Now we have the coefficients \( a = -15 \) and \( b = -2 \), so the function is:

\( y = -15 + (-2)x \)
\( y = -15 - 2x \)

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where a is a constant term and b is the coefficient of the linear term x, we need to solve for a and b given the pairs of inputs and outputs.

Let's substitute the given input-output pairs into the function to get a system of equations:

For Input: -12, Output: 9
9 = a*(-12)^0 + b*(-12)
9 = a + b*(-12)

For Input: 20, Output: -55

For Input: 8, Output: -31

To solve for a and b, one way is to use two of the equations and to solve the system. However, since we're given five points, but only need to determine two parameters (a and b), we can try to find a pattern or use methods such as linear regression to find the best fit line for the data provided.

A quick method to proceed is to take any two equations and solve for a and b. Let's take the two following pairs:

9 = a + b*(-12)
-55 = a + b*20

We have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve it using the subtraction method:

First, align the equations:
a - 12b = 9
a + 20b = -55

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate a:
(20b + 55) - (-12b - 9) = 0
32b + 64 = 0

Now solve for b:
32b = -64
b = -64 / 32
b = -2

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using one of the initial equations:
9 = a + b*(-12)
9 = a - 2*(-12)
9 = a + 24

Subtract 24 from both sides:
a = 9 - 24
a = -15

Therefore, the function that best fits the given data points in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = -15x^0 - 2x^1
y = -15 - 2x 

It is important to note that without further information, it's assumed that these points are exactly on the line, which is not possible to guarantee with real-world data. This solution also assumes that there are no other terms in the equation and it is strictly linear. If the relationship is not accurately linear, this solution may not perfectly describe the data.

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we will interpret ax^0 as a constant term (since anything raised to the 0 power is 1), and bx^1 is simply bx. Thus, the function we're looking for can be simplified to:

y = a + bx

We have a system of equations based on the input-output pairs provided:

1. a + b(-12) = 9
2. a + b(20) = -55
3. a + b(-4) = -7
4. a + b(-10) = 5
5. a + b(8) = -31

We will take any two equations to solve for a and b. For the sake of simplicity, let's take equations 1 and 2:

From equation 1:
a - 12b = 9

From equation 2:
a + 20b = -55

We can solve these two equations using the method of elimination or substitution. We will use elimination:

Adding both equations to eliminate a:
(a - 12b) + (a + 20b) = 9 - 55
2a + 8b = -46
a + 4b = -23  (dividing both sides by 2)

Now let's subtract the first equation (a - 12b = 9) from this one to solve for b:
a + 4b - (a - 12b) = -23 - 9
a + 4b - a + 12b = -32
16b = -32
b = -32 / 16
b = -2

Now let's substitute the value of b into the first equation to find a:
a - 12(-2) = 9
a + 24 = 9
a = 9 - 24
a = -15

5) For input 8, output -31: \( -31 = a + 8b \)

Now we have a system of linear equations. We can solve this system for \( a \) and \( b \). The simplest way to find a solution is to use two equations and solve them as a system. For simplicity, let's use equations (1) and (2).

From equation (1):
\( a = 9 + 12b \)

Substitute \( a \) in equation (2):
\( -55 = (9 + 12b) + 20b \)
\( -55 = 9 + 32b \)
\( -64 = 32b \)

We can set up two equations using two of the input/output pairs to solve for a and b. Let's use the pairs (-12, 9) and (20, -55):

1) Using the pair (-12, 9):
9 = b*(-12) + a

2) Using the pair (20, -55):

Now we have two equations:

9 = -12b + a 
-55 = 20b + a

We can solve this system of linear equations using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's use elimination:

Multiply the first equation by 20 and the second equation by 12 to eliminate a:

20 * 9 = 20 * (-12b) + 20 * a
180 = -240b + 20a

12 * -55 = 12 * (20b) + 12 * a

Now we add the two equations:

180 - 660 = (-240b + 240b) + (20a + 12a)
-480 = 32a

Solving for a, we get:

a = -480 / 32

By using these two equations, we can solve for a and b. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:

We have pairs of inputs and outputs, and our job is to find the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that define the linear relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y):

Now, solving this system of equations is typically a matter of using linear algebra techniques. However, since we only need to find a pattern rather than exact values, we can look at the differences in inputs and corresponding differences in outputs to find \( b \). Once \( b \) is known, we can use any of the equations to solve for \( a \).

If we take the differences between two pairs of points (inputs and respective outputs), we can see:

\( (-11) - (-16) = 5 \) results in \( 52 - 82 = -30 \)
\( (-18) - (-16) = -2 \) results in \( 94 - 82 = 12 \)

From the first pair of differences, a change of 5 units in x results in a change of -30 units in y. That gives us a slope \( b \) of -30/5 = -6.

Let's verify this with the other pair of differences:

From the second pair of differences, a change of -2 units in x resulted in a change of 12 units in y. This also gives us a slope \( b \) of 12/(-2) = -6.

    We are given a set of input-output pairs, and we need to find the function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`. This simplifies to `y = a + bx` because any number to the power of 0 is 1.

Thus, we need to find `a` and `b` such that the function fits the data we have been given:

1. 82 = a - 16b
2. 52 = a - 11b
3. -98 = a + 14b
4. 94 = a - 18b
5. -32 = a + 3b

Let's solve these equations to find the values of `a` and `b`. We can use the method of pairs to solve for `a` and `b`. Since we have five equations, we only need two to find a pair of `a` and `b` that we can verify with the other equations. We'll use equations (1) and (5) for this.

From equation (1), we express `a` in terms of `b`: 

a = 82 + 16b 

We can plug this into equation (5):

-32 = (82 + 16b) + 3b
-32 = 82 + 19b
-114 = 19b
b = -114 / 19
b = -6

Now, we can find `a` by plugging `b` into the equation we derived from (1):

a = 82 + 16(-6)
a = 82 - 96
a = -14

    To find the function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Since \( x^0 \) always equals 1 (for any x except x = 0), the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Let's use two points to calculate \( a \) and \( b \). We will use the points (-16, 82) and (14, -98):

1. Plugging the first point (-16, 82) into \( y = a + bx \):

\( 82 = a - 16b \) (Equation 1)

2. Plugging the second point (14, -98) into \( y = a + bx \):

\( -98 = a + 14b \) (Equation 2)

Now, we have two equations with two variables. Let's solve this system of equations:

From Equation 1:
\( a = 82 + 16b \) (Equation 3)

Substitute Equation 3 into Equation 2:
\( -98 = (82 + 16b) + 14b \)
\( -98 = 82 + 16b + 14b \)
\( -98 = 82 + 30b \)
\( -98 - 82 = 30b \)
\( -180 = 30b \)
\( b = \frac{-180}{30} \)
\( b = -6 \)

Now, plug the value of \( b \) back into Equation 3 to find \( a \):
\( a = 82 + 16(-6) \)
\( a = 82 - 96 \)
\( a = -14 \)

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Let's use two different input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations.

Using the input-output pair (3, 9):
\( 9 = a + b(3) \)
\( 9 = a + 3b \) ... (1)

And using the input-output pair (2, 5):
\( 5 = a + b(2) \)
\( 5 = a + 2b \) ... (2)

Now we will solve the system of equations (1) and (2) for \( a \) and \( b \).

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

\( (9 - 5) = (a - a) + (3b - 2b) \)
\( 4 = b \)

Now that we know \( b = 4 \), we can use one of the equations to solve for \( a \).

Using equation (2):

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we essentially need to determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) that fit the given input-output pairs.

Notice that the term \(ax^0\) is equivalent to \(a\), because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. The term \(bx^1\) is essentially \(bx\), because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself. Thus, our function simplifies to \(y = a + bx\).

2. \((-1, -7)\)
3. \((3, 9)\)
4. \((-18, -75)\) (repeated)
5. \((2, 5)\)

We need to solve for \(a\) and \(b\) using at least two unique points (more points can be used for verification or a least squares fit if the points are not perfectly linear).

Let's use the points \((-1, -7)\) and \((3, 9)\) to set up two equations based on the function \(y = a + bx\):

For \((-1, -7)\):
\[-7 = a + b(-1)\]
\[-7 = a - b\] ...\[Equation (1)\]

For \((3, 9)\):
\[9 = a + b(3)\]
\[9 = a + 3b\] ...\[Equation (2)\]

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. First, we'll rearrange Equation (1) to isolate \(a\):

\[a = -7 + b\] ...\[Equation (3)\]

Now, substitute Equation (3) into Equation (2):

\[9 = (-7 + b) + 3b\]
\[9 = -7 + 4b\]
\[16 = 4b\]
\[b = 4\]

Now use \(b = 4\) in Equation (3) to find \(a\):

Therefore, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Given this form, we have two coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) to find. We will use two pairs of the given input-output examples to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Let's consider the input-output pairs \( (-1, -7) \) and \( (3, 9) \).

Plugging the first pair into the simplified function:

\( -7 = a + b(-1) \)
\( -7 = a - b \) ...(1)

Plugging the second pair into the simplified function:

\( 9 = a + b(3) \)
\( 9 = a + 3b \) ...(2)

Now we have a system of equations:
1) \( -7 = a - b \)
2) \( 9 = a + 3b \)

By adding the two equations together, we can solve for \( a \):

\( -7 + 9 = a - b + a + 3b \)
\( 2 = 2a + 2b \)
\( 1 = a + b \) ...(3)

We can use Equation (1) to express \( a \) in terms of \( b \):

\( a = -7 + b \) ...(4)

Substitute Equation (4) in Equation (3) to find \( b \):

\( 1 = (-7 + b) + b \)

1. For the input -1 and output -7:
\(-7 = a(-1)^0 + b(-1)\)
\(-7 = a - b\) ... (Equation 1)

2. For the input 3 and output 9:
\(9 = a(3)^0 + b(3)\)
\(9 = a + 3b\) ... (Equation 2)

We can now solve these equations simultaneously.

Add Equation 1 and Equation 2 to eliminate \(b\):

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b. Note that ax^0 is effectively a (because any number to the power of 0 is 1), so we are trying to fit a line y = a + bx.

Given the pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y), we have:

For x = -18, y = -75: -75 = a + b(-18)
For x = -1, y = -7: -7 = a + b(-1)
For x = 3, y = 9: 9 = a + b(3)
For x = 2, y = 5: 5 = a + b(2)

Given we have more equations than unknowns, this is an overdetermined system, and we will look for a least squares solution that minimizes the error across all provided points. However, note that the first and fourth points are repeated, and they must yield the same coefficients, so we'll use only the unique points for our calculation.

Setting up equations with the known data points:

-75 = a - 18b (from x = -18, y = -75)
-7 = a - b (from x = -1, y = -7)
9 = a + 3b (from x = 3, y = 9)
5 = a + 2b (from x = 2, y = 5)

We can start to find the best fit by a method such as elimination or least squares. By looking at the system of equations, we can quickly check if these points fall on a straight line by checking the differences in y over the differences in x (Δy/Δx):

From x = -1 to x = 3 (change in x is 4),
(9 - (-7)) / (3 - (-1)) = 16 / 4 = 4

From x = 2 to x = 3 (change in x is 1),
(9 - 5) / (3 - 2) = 4 / 1 = 4

The change in y with respect to x is consistent for both intervals, suggesting a linear relationship with a slope (b) of 4. Now we can use one of the equations to solve for a. Let's use the x = 3, y = 9 equation:

    To find a linear function that matches the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can identify the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) that make the function fit the given input-output pairs. The term \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any x except 0. Hence, the form simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Given the data, we can see that when x increases or decreases, the output changes by 10 times the input plus a constant amount. We can determine this pattern by examining the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

For the first pair (input 6, output 74), the output is ten times the input, plus 14:

\[ 6 \times 10 + 14 = 60 + 14 = 74 \]

For the second pair (input 19, output 191), the output is again ten times the input, plus 11:

\[ 19 \times 10 + 11 = 190 + 11 = 191 \]

We can attempt to validate this relationship with the inputs given:

For input -11, if b is 10:

\[ -11 \times 10 = -110 \]

We need to add a to get to the output of -79. So, a would be:

\[ -79 - (-110) = 31 \]

For input -5:

\[ -5 \times 10 + 31 = -50 + 31 = -19 \]

But this does not match the output of -25. So there's something wrong with my initial assumption. Let's try again with two points to determine the slope (b) and y-intercept (a):

Let's use points (6, 74) and (-10, -70) to calculate the slope (b):

\[ b = \frac{(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)} = \frac{(-70 - 74)}{(-10 - 6)} \]
\[ b = \frac{-144}{-16} \]

    The provided data pairs suggest a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. A linear function can be generally written in the form of \( y = ax + b \), which is equivalent to the template \( y = ax^1 + bx^0 \) we've been asked to use. Here, \( a \) represents the slope of the line and \( b \) represents the y-intercept.

Let's examine two of the provided data points to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \):

For Input 6 (x = 6), Output 74 (y = 74), the pair gives us the equation:

For Input 19 (x = 19), Output 191 (y = 191), the pair gives us the equation:

We can solve these two equations simultaneously for \(a\) and \(b\). Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) gives:

\[ 191 - 74 = 19a - 6a \]
\[ 117 = 13a \]
\[ a = 9 \]

Now that we have \( a \), we can solve for \( b \) using either of the original equations. Using equation (1):

    From the given input-output pairs, we can see that as the input (x) increases or decreases, the output (y) seems to change in a linear fashion. Based on this observation, let's try to find the constants a and b for the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx when recognizing that x^0 is 1 for any x.

We can use two of the input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations to solve for a and b.

Let's choose the following two pairs:
(1) When x = 6, y = 74
(2) When x = 19, y = 191

For pair (1), substitute x = 6 and y = 74 into the equation y = a + bx:

For pair (2), substitute x = 19 and y = 191 into the equation y = a + bx:

Let's solve this system of equations:

From equation (1):
74 = a + 6b  --(3)

From equation (2):
191 = a + 19b --(4)

Now subtract (3) from (4) to solve for b:
191 - 74 = (a + 19b) - (a + 6b)
117 = 13b
b = 117 / 13
b = 9

Now that we have the value of b, let's substitute it back into equation (3) and solve for a:

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we recognize that ax^0 is a constant because any number raised to the power of 0 equals 1. Therefore, ax^0 simplifies to 'a', and bx^1 simplifies to bx because any number raised to the power of 1 is itself. So we are trying to fit the equation:

y = a + bx

Let's use the given input and output pairs to find 'a' and 'b'.

For the input x = 6 and output y = 74:

74 = a + b(6)
74 = a + 6b ... [1]

For the input x = 19 and output y = 191:

191 = a + b(19)
191 = a + 19b ... [2]

We need at least two equations to solve for the two unknowns 'a' and 'b'. Let's use equations [1] and [2] to form a system of linear equations:

a + 6b = 74
a + 19b = 191

Let's solve for 'a' and 'b' by subtracting the first equation from the second:

(19b - 6b) = (191 - 74)
13b = 117
b = 117 / 13
b = 9

Now let's substitute b back into equation [1] and solve for a:

a + 6(9) = 74
a + 54 = 74
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

Now that we have the values for 'a' and 'b', the function is:

y = 20 + 9x

We can confirm this function with the other input-output pairs provided:

For x = -11:
y = 20 + 9(-11) = 20 - 99 = -79 (matches the output).

For x = -5:
y = 20 + 9(-5) = 20 - 45 = -25 (matches the output).

For x = -10:
y = 20 + 9(-10) = 20 - 90 = -70 (matches the output).

y = 20 + 9x

    To find the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that represents the data, we must determine the values of the constants \( a \) and \( b \).

Given that the term \( ax^0 \) is equivalent to \( a \) because any non-zero number raised to the 0th power is 1, and the term \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \), the function simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

Now we need to determine \( a \) and \( b \) using the provided input-output pairs. Let's substitute two of the input-output pairs into the equation to create a system of linear equations:

Using Input: 6 and Output: 8, 
\[ 8 = a + b(6) \]
\[ 8 = a + 6b \]
\[ (1) \]

Using Input: -5 and Output: -25, 
\[ -25 = a + b(-5) \]
\[ -25 = a - 5b \]
\[ (2) \]

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:
\[ (1) \rightarrow 8 = a + 6b \]
\[ (2) \rightarrow -25 = a - 5b \]

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
\[ (1) - (2) \rightarrow 8 - (-25) = (a + 6b) - (a - 5b) \]
\[ 33 = 11b \]
\[ b = 3 \]

Plug in the value of \( b \) back into either (1) or (2):
\[ 8 = a + 6(3) \]
\[ 8 = a + 18 \]
\[ a = 8 - 18 \]
\[ a = -10 \]

Now we have the values for \( a \) and \( b \): \( a = -10 \) and \( b = 3 \). Substituting these into our function gives us:

\[ y = -10 + 3x \]

So the function in the required form is:

\[ y = -10x^0 + 3x^1 \]

    To determine the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to consider that ax^0 is a constant term since any number to the power of zero is 1. Therefore, ax^0 simplifies to just a. The term bx^1 is a linear term, and since x^1 is just x, this simplifies to bx. So we are looking for a function of the form y = a + bx.

Given the data:
For input 6, output is 8.
For input -5, output is -25.
For input -3, output is -19.
For input -10, output is -40.
For input -14, output is -52.

To find the appropriate values for a and b, we can use any two of these data points to create a system of equations to solve for a and b. We'll use the points (6, 8) and (-5, -25):

Using point (6, 8):
8 = a + 6b     (1)

Using point (-5, -25):
-25 = a - 5b   (2)

Now we can solve this system of equations. Let's multiply equation (2) by 1 and add the resulting equation to (1):

(1)  8 = a + 6b
(2) -25 = a - 5b

Multiplying equation (2) by 1, we get:
-25 = a - 5b

Adding (1) and (2) together:
8 - 25 = a + 6b + a - 5b
-17 = 2a + b
-17 = 2a + b

Now let's isolate b:
b = -17 - 2a

To find a specific value for a, we can substitute b back into (1) or (2). We'll use equation (1):
8 = a + 6b
8 = a + 6(-17 - 2a)
8 = a - 102 - 12a
8 = -11a - 102
11a = -102 - 8
11a = -110
a = -110 / 11
a = -10

Now we'll substitute a = -10 into b = -17 - 2a:
b = -17 - 2(-10)
b = -17 + 20
b = 3

For input -5: \( -25 = a + b \cdot (-5) \)  
For input -3: \( -19 = a + b \cdot (-3) \)

For input -14: \( -52 = a + b \cdot (-14) \)

We can use any two points to determine \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the first two input-output pairs for calculation:

1) \( 8 = a + 6b \)  
2) \( -25 = a - 5b \)

Now, let's solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. I will use elimination:

Multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 6 to eliminate \( a \):  
\( 5 \cdot 8 = 5a + 30b \)  
\( 6 \cdot (-25) = 6a - 30b \)

\( 40 = 5a + 30b \)  
\( -150 = 6a - 30b \)

Adding the two equations together to eliminate \( b \):  
\( 40 - 150 = 5a + 6a \)  
\( -110 = 11a \)  
\( a = -110 / 11 \)  
\( a = -10 \)

    To determine the values of a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs. This function simplifies to y = a + bx, because x^0 is 1 for any x other than 0.

Let's plug in the given input-output pairs to form equations:

For Input: 6, Output: 8
8 = a + b(6)    ...(1)

For Input: -5, Output: -25
-25 = a + b(-5) ...(2)

-52 = a + b(-14) ...(5)

Let's use one of the equations to find a relationship between a and b. For simplicity, we'll use equation (1):

8 = a + 6b ...(1)

Now our goal is to express a in terms of b. We can rearrange equation (1) as:

a = 8 - 6b

With that, we could substitute this expression for a into the other equations to find b, but instead, let's look for a pattern in the inputs and outputs.

Noticing that the change in output seems to be proportional to the change in input, we can divide the change in output by the change in input to find b:

Using (Input: -5, Output: -25) and (Input: -3, Output: -19):
Change in output = -19 - (-25) = 6
Change in input = -3 - (-5) = 2
b = Change in output / Change in input = 6 / 2 = 3

Now substitute the value of b back into equation (1):

8 = a + 6(3)

a = 8 - 18
a = -10

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the data, we note that ax^0 is just a since x^0 is 1 for any non-zero value of x.

The given data points suggest a linear relationship between input (x) and output (y), so we need to find values of a and b such that y = a + bx for each of the input-output pairs.

Let's use two points to determine the function. We'll pick (6, 8) and (-5, -25) and set up a system of linear equations.

For the point (6, 8):
8 = a + 6b     (1)

For the point (-5, -25):
-25 = a - 5b   (2)

Now we solve this system of equations for a and b.

Let's multiply equation (2) by 1 to make the coefficients of b in the two equations add up to 0 when combined:

-25 = a - 5b   (2)

Now add equation (1) and equation (2):

8 + (-25) = (a + a) + (6b - 5b)
-17 = 2a + b

We want to solve for a and b. To do this, let's first solve one of the equations for one of the variables and then substitute that into the other equation.

First, let's solve equation (1) for a:

a = 8 - 6b

Now we can substitute this value for a into equation (2):

-25 = (8 - 6b) - 5b
-25 = 8 - 6b - 5b
-25 - 8 = -11b
-33 = -11b
b = -33 / -11
b = 3

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into the equation for a:

a = 8 - 6b
a = 8 - 6(3)
a = 8 - 18
a = -10

    To find a linear equation in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that relates the input values to the output values, we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \). When we see the term \( ax^0 \), this is equivalent to \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any \( x \) (except when \( x = 0 \), but the expression \( 0^0 \) is indeterminate and not used in this context). The term \( bx^1 \) is equivalent to \( bx \), which is the standard linear term. So, the equation simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

The key to finding \( a \) and \( b \) is to look at the given pairs of inputs and outputs.

Given the following pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y):
1. \( x = 9, y = 29 \)
2. \( x = 2, y = 8 \)
3. \( x = -1, y = -1 \)
4. \( x = -6, y = -16 \)
5. \( x = -6, y = -16 \) (repeated pair)

We can use two distinct pairs to set up two equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Using pairs 1 and 3:

For \( x = 9, y = 29 \): \( 29 = a + 9b \)

For \( x = -1, y = -1 \): \( -1 = a - b \)

We now have a system of equations:
1. \( 29 = a + 9b \)
2. \( -1 = a - b \)

Solving this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \) gives:

From 2: \( a = -1 + b \)

Substituting for \( a \) in 1: \( 29 = -1 + b + 9b \)
\( 30 = 10b \)
\( b = 3 \)

Now find \( a \) using the equation from 2: \( a = -1 + b \)

The second term, bx^1, simplifies to just 'bx' because anything raised to the power of 1 is itself. Thus, the function we're looking for will look like y = a + bx.

We can use two points to determine 'a' and 'b'. Let's use the points (x1, y1) = (9, 29) and (x2, y2) = (2, 8).

For the first point (9, 29):
29 = a + b(9)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1. 29 = a + 9b
2. 8 = a + 2b

3. For x=-1, y=-1:

For (2, 8):
8 = a + b * 2 (2)

Let's solve this system of equations. First, we'll multiply equation (2) by -1 to eliminate a when we add it to equation (1):

-8 = -a - b * 2

Using the first pair (x=9, y=29), we can write the first equation:

From the given data points, we can set up two equations with the unknowns a and b:

1. For the input -16 and the output 109, the equation would be:

2. For another input-output pair (I will choose the input 2 and output -17 for a simpler calculation), the equation would be:

Now we have a system of two equations:
1.    109 = a - 16b
2.    -17 = a + 2b

Let's solve this system of equations for a and b.

By multiplying the second equation by 8, we'll be able to cancel out a when we add the equations together:

1.   109 = a - 16b
2.(-8) -136 = 8a + 16b

Adding the two equations together to eliminate b:

    The function you've asked for is in the polynomial form where \( a \) is the y-intercept and \( b \) is the slope of the line described by the equation \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \) since \( x^0 \) is 1 for any x except for x = 0.

Given the data points, we can find \( a \) and \( b \) using two of the points, and then check if the other points satisfy the equation. Let's use the points (-3, 18) and (2, -17) to determine the coefficients.

The system of linear equations will be:

18 = a + b(-3) [1]
-17 = a + b(2) [2]

Let's solve this system step by step:

From equation [1]:
18 = a - 3b
a = 18 + 3b [3]

Now, plug [3] into equation [2]:
-17 = (18 + 3b) + 2b
-17 = 18 + 5b
5b = -35
b = -7

Now, we put the value of b back into [3]:
a = 18 + 3(-7)
a = 18 - 21
a = -3

So, the function based on the two points is:

y = -3 + (-7)x
or
y = -3 - 7x

Now check if this function works for the other points:
(-16, 109): 109 = -3 - 7(-16) = -3 + 112 = 109 ✓

    To find a linear equation in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), we need to find the constants \( a \) and \( b \). This can be seen as finding the y-intercept (\( a \)) and the slope (\( b \)) of the line that fits the data points given.

Since a linear relationship has the form \( y = a + bx \), we only need two points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). However, we have been given five points, so it is unlikely that all five points lie perfectly on a single straight line. Therefore, the best we can do is to find the line that minimally squares the distance to all points (the least squares method). However, this process typically requires more computational work than is feasible to present in this simple text format.

Instead, let's take two of the given points and calculate \( a \) and \( b \). Note that the resulting function will not perfectly capture all of the given data points unless they all truly lie on a single line.

Using the first two points: (-16, 109) and (-3, 18), we can set up two equations:

1. \( 109 = a + b(-16) \)
2. \( 18 = a + b(-3) \)

We then solve this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \):

From equation 2,
\( a = 18 + 3b \)

Substituting \( a \) from equation 2 into equation 1:

\( 109 = (18 + 3b) + b(-16) \)
\( 109 = 18 - 16b + 3b \)
\( 109 = 18 - 13b \)
\( 91 = -13b \)
\( b = -91 / 13 \)
\( b = -7 \)

Now substitute \( b \) back into the equation for \( a \):

\( a = 18 + 3(-7) \)
\( a = 18 - 21 \)
\( a = -3 \)

So our estimated linear function is:

\( y = -3 + (-7)x \)
\( y = -3 - 7x \)

    To come up with the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants a and b.

The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx, because x^0 is always 1 for any x that is not equal to 0.

Given the input-output pairs, we have:

1) For input -16, the output is 109:
a - 16b = 109    (i)

2) For input -3, the output is 18:
a - 3b = 18      (ii)

3) For input 2, the output is -17:
a + 2b = -17     (iii)

a + 12b = -87    (iv)

5) For input 5, the output is -38:
a + 5b = -38     (v)

We now have a system of linear equations. To solve for a and b, we can use any two equations to form a system of two equations with two variables.

Let's use equations (i) and (iii):

a - 16b = 109    (i)
a + 2b = -17     (iii)

Now, we can add equation (iii) to equation (i) to eliminate a:

(a - 16b) + (a + 2b) = 109 - 17
2a - 14b = 92
a - 7b = 46         (i')

Now let's subtract equation (iii) from equation (i) to isolate b:

(a - 16b) - (a + 2b) = 109 + 17
-16b - 2b = 126
-18b = 126
b = -7

Now we can substitute b back into equation (i'):

a - 7(-7) = 46
a + 49 = 46

Now we need to find the values of a and b that best fit the provided input-output pairs. This generally requires the use of at least two points to create a system of equations we can solve.

Let's use the points (-3, 18) and (2, -17) to establish two equations:

1) For input -3: 18 = a + b(-3)
2) For input 2: -17 = a + b(2)

Now let's solve these two equations simultaneously:

From equation 1), we get:
18 = a - 3b
a = 18 + 3b --(3)

From equation 2), we can substitute a from equation 3):
-17 = (18 + 3b) + 2b
-17 = 18 + 5b
5b = -17 - 18
5b = -35
b = -7

Now we can solve for a using the value of b:

a = 18 + 3(-7)
a = 18 - 21
a = -3

So, plugging in the values for a and b into the equation y = a + bx, we get:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best matches the given input-output pairs, we first need to recognize that ax^0 is just a constant (a) because any number to the power of zero is 1.

Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Now, let's use two input-output pairs to solve for a and b.

Let's choose the input-output pairs (-9, 162) and (17, -254).

For the first pair:
162 = a + b(-9)
162 = a - 9b (1)

For the second pair:
-254 = a + b(17)
-254 = a + 17b (2)

We now have a system of equations:

a - 9b = 162
a + 17b = -254

Solve the system for a and b. First, let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

a + 17b - (a - 9b) = -254 - 162
a + 17b - a + 9b = -416
26b = -416
b = -416 / 26
b = -16

Now, we can substitute b back into equation (1) to solve for a:

a - 9(-16) = 162
a + 144 = 162
a = 162 - 144
a = 18

Now we have the values for a and b, so the function that describes the data is:

y = 18 - 16x

Or, if we adhere strictly to the desired format:

Output: y = 18x^0 - 16x^1

Note: Since there were more than two given points, this particular pair was picked for convenience, but ideally, the chosen function should be checked against all points for validation or use a more sophisticated method such as least squares regression for a more accurate fit if the relationship between variables is not strictly linear.

    To write a function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are essentially looking for a line equation of the form y = b*x + a, where b is the slope of the line and a is the y-intercept (since x^0 is always 1).

Let's analyze the given data points:

1. For x = -9, y = 162, we get: 162 = b * (-9) + a
2. For x = 17, y = -254, we get: -254 = b * 17 + a

We can use these two equations to solve for a and b. Let's arrange them:

-9b + a = 162      ...(1)
17b + a = -254     ...(2)

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a, we get:

b = -416 / 26
b = -16

Now we can find a using one of the original equations with the value of b we've just calculated:

By multiplying the first equation by 17 and the second by 9 to eliminate a when we add the equations together:

If we can identify a consistent difference in y for a consistent difference in x (the slope b), and if the set of pairs is indeed following a perfect linear relationship, calculating this slope (b) should be straightforward. However, without further points or additional constraints, there could be multiple linear equations that fit these points within a certain error threshold.

Let's do a simple calculation to get an approximate value for the slope (b), by taking two input-output pairs and dividing the difference in output (Δy) by the difference in input (Δx):

Using pairs (18, 350) and (12, 230), the calculation would be:
Δy = 350 - 230 = 120
Δx = 18 - 12 = 6
slope (b) ≈ Δy / Δx ≈ 120 / 6 ≈ 20

This approximate slope suggests that the output increases by about 20 for each increase of 1 in the input. Now we can use one of the pairs to find the y-intercept (a):

Given two pairs of data, we can solve for a and b. Let's use the following two pairs as an example:

For x = 18, y = 350, which gives us:
\( 350 = a + 18b \)

For x = 12, y = 230, which gives us:
\( 230 = a + 12b \)

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:

1. \( 350 = a + 18b \)
2. \( 230 = a + 12b \)

We can solve this system by subtracting the second equation from the first:

\( (350 = a + 18b) - (230 = a + 12b) \)
\( 120 = 6b \)

Now we solve for b:

\( b = 120 / 6 \)
\( b = 20 \)

We can substitute b back into one of the equations to solve for a. Let's use the second equation:

\( 230 = a + 12(20) \)
\( 230 = a + 240 \)
\( a = 230 - 240 \)
\( a = -10 \)

Hence, our linear function is:
Output: \( y = -10 + 20x \)

    To determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that define the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to find a pattern that fits all of the given input-output pairs. The function given is essentially a linear equation in the form \( y = a + bx \), where \( a \) is the y-intercept and \( b \) is the slope of the line.

From the given input-output pairs:

1. When \( x = 18 \), \( y = 350 \)
2. When \( x = 12 \), \( y = 230 \)
3. When \( x = -13 \), \( y = -270 \)
4. When \( x = 4 \), \( y = 70 \)
5. When \( x = 16 \), \( y = 310 \)

Let's take two pairs to calculate the slope \( b \):

Using pairs (1) and (2):

\( (y2 - y1) = b(x2 - x1) \)

\( (350 - 230) = b(18 - 12) \)

\( 120 = 6b \)

\( b = 20 \)

Now we have our slope. To find \( a \), we will use the slope \( b \) with one of the points to solve for \( a \). Let's use point (2):

\( 230 = a + 20(12) \)

\( 230 = a + 240 \)

\( a = 230 - 240 \)

\( a = -10 \)

Therefore, the function that fits the data provided is:

\( y = -10 + 20x \)

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx, because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. We can find the values of a and b by using two points and solving the resulting system of linear equations. We'll use the (input, output) pairs (18, 350) and (12, 230).

For the point (18, 350):
350 = a + 18b

For the point (12, 230):
230 = a + 12b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1) 350 = a + 18b
2) 230 = a + 12b

Next, let's solve this system using subtraction to eliminate a:

Subtract the second equation from the first:

(350 - 230) = (a - a) + (18b - 12b)
120 = 6b

Now solve for b:
b = 120 / 6
b = 20

Now that we know b, we can substitute it back into one of the above equations to solve for a. Let's use equation 2):

230 = a + 12 * 20
230 = a + 240

Now solve for a:
a = 230 - 240
a = -10

Therefore, the function should be:
y = -10 + 20x

y = -410

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the given input-output pairs, let's first simplify the equation to the standard linear form since ax^0 is always equal to a (because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1):

y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = a + bx

Now, we are looking for the constants a and b that define our function. Given that we have multiple points, we can try to find a pattern or solve for a and b using two points and verifying if this satisfies the other points.

Let's pick two points, say (13, 177) and (14, 191). We can form the following system of equations:

For the first point (13, 177):
177 = a + 13b

For the second point (14, 191):
191 = a + 14b

Now let's solve this system for a and b by using the substitution or elimination method. One way is to solve the first equation for a:

a = 177 - 13b ...(1)

Plugging this into the second equation:

191 = (177 - 13b) + 14b
191 = 177 + b

Now solve for b:

b = 191 - 177
b = 14

Next, plug the value of b back into equation (1) to solve for a:

a = 177 - 13(14)
a = 177 - 182
a = -5

Our linear function is therefore described as:

y = -5 + 14x

To verify if this function works for all other points, we can plug them into the function:

For input x = -8:
y = -5 + 14(-8)
y = -5 - 112
y = -117

For input x = 3:
y = -5 + 14(3)
y = -5 + 42
y = 37

For input x = 7:
y = -5 + 14(7)
y = -5 + 98
y = 93

These satisfy the given points; therefore, the function is:

    To find the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we can look at the given pairs of data and try to establish the constants a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since x^0 is always 1 for any x not equal to 0, this part of the function represents a constant term. The bx^1 term is simply bx, as x^1 is x.

Let's look at the given data:

- When x = 13, y = 177
- When x = 14, y = 191

Since these two points are successive integers, we can deduce b by computing the difference in y-values, which corresponds to an increment of one in x:

191 - 177 = 14

Now that we have b as 14, we can find a by substituting the values of x and y from any of the given points into the equation:

y = ax^0 + 14x

Let's take the point (13, 177):

177 = a*1 + 14*13
177 = a + 182
a = 177 - 182
a = -5

    To determine the constants a and b for the linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we will use two of the provided data points to create a system of equations and then solve for a and b. 

Let's have a look at the data provided:
1. When x = 13, y = 177. So, 177 = a(13)^0 + b(13)
2. When x = 14, y = 191. So, 191 = a(14)^0 + b(14)

Since x^0 is always 1 (for any value of x that isn't 0), we can simplify these equations to:
1. 177 = a + 13b
2. 191 = a + 14b

Now let’s subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to find b:
191 - 177 = (a + 14b) - (a + 13b)
14 = b

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into one of the equations to solve for a. Let's substitute it into the first one:
177 = a + 13(14)
177 = a + 182

Solving for a:
a = 177 - 182
a = -5

    To find a function of the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\) that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) given in the data set, we will need to understand that \(ax^0\) is a constant term (since any number raised to the 0 power is 1) and \(bx^1\) is a linear term (since any number to the 1 power is itself).

Let our function be:
\[y = a + bx\]

Given the data points (x, y):
(13, 177), (14, 191), (-8, -117), (3, 37), (7, 93)

We can use two points to determine coefficients 'a' and 'b' by forming a system of linear equations. For simplicity, let's use the points (13, 177) and (14, 191).

From the first point (13, 177):
\[177 = a + 13b\] (Equation 1)

From the second point (14, 191):

    To find the function that best describes the data, we can assume it's a linear function since it's requested in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, which is equivalent to `y = a + bx` where `a` and `b` are constants we need to determine.

Firstly, `x^0` is always 1 for any value of `x` (except for x=0), so the term `ax^0` simplifies to `a`.

We need to determine `a` and `b`. To find these constants, we can use two data points to set up a system of linear equations. Let's take the inputs 13 and 14 and their corresponding outputs 177 and 191:

1. For the input 13: `177 = a + 13b`
2. For the input 14: `191 = a + 14b`

To solve for `a` and `b`, we'll subtract the first equation from the second one:

`(191 - 177) = (a + 14b) - (a + 13b)`
`14 = b`

Now that we have `b`, we can put it back into either equation to solve for `a`. We'll use the first equation:

`177 = a + 13(14)`
`177 = a + 182`
`a = 177 - 182`
`a = -5`
