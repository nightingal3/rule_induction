"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can recognize that ax^0 is equivalent to a since any number to the power of 0 is 1. So the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We need to find the values of a and b that will make this function work for the given inputs and outputs.

To do this, we can use two of the given points to create a system of equations and solve for a and b. Let's use the points (-10, -213) and (20, 387).

For the input -10:
a + b(-10) = -213

For the input 20:
a + b(20) = 387

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. a - 10b = -213
2. a + 20b = 387

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. I will use elimination in this case:

Multiply the first equation by 1 to keep it the same, and multiply the second equation by 1 so we can eliminate a when we add the two equations:

1. a - 10b = -213
2. a + 20b = 387

Adding the two equations to eliminate a gives us:
(1a + 1a) + (-10b + 20b) = (-213 + 387)
2a + 10b = 174

Divide both sides by 2 to isolate a:
a + 5b = 87

Now we'll use this equation and one of the original equations to find b. Let’s substitute a from equation 1 into this:

(a) + 5b = 87
(-213 + 10b) + 5b = 87
10b + 5b = 87 + 213
15b = 300
b = 300 / 15
b = 20

Now that we have the value of b, we can solve for a using one of the original equations:

a + 20(-10) = -213
a - 200 = -213
a = -213 + 200
a = -13

Our function is:
y = -13x^0 + 20x^1

Simplified, we get:
y = -13 + 20x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the requirement to express the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants a and b that allow the function to produce the given output when provided the corresponding input. The term ax^0 is a constant term, since x^0 equals 1 for any x that is not zero. Hence, this term represents a fixed value a in the equation. The term bx^1 is simply bx since x^1 is x. Therefore, the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given that this is a linear equation, we can use two points to determine the values of a and b. Let's take the inputs and outputs for two different x values:

For x = -10, y = -213:
-213 = a + b(-10)

For x = 20, y = 387:
387 = a + b(20)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1. -213 = a - 10b
2. 387 = a + 20b

We can solve this system of equations by using the elimination or substitution method.

Using the elimination method:

Multiply equation 1 by 2 to align the coefficients of a for elimination:
1. -426 = 2a - 20b
2. 387 = a + 20b

Now, add the two equations:
(-426) + 387 = (2a - 20b) + (a + 20b)

Which simplifies to:
-39 = 3a

Now, solve for a:
a = -39 / 3
a = -13

Now that we have a, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find b. Using the first equation:

-213 = (-13) - 10b
-200 = -10b
b = 20

Thus, the function that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is y = -13 + 20x, or in the exact form requested:

Output: y = -13x^0 + 20x^1

    ","To find the output for the input x = -6 using the function y = -13 + 20x, we substitute -6 for x:

y = -13 + 20(-6)

y = -133

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the data, we recognize that ax^0 is a constant, because x^0 is 1 for any x (except for x=0, but that does not concern us here as we are dealing with nonzero inputs). Thus, the form simplifies to y = a + bx. Now, we need to determine the constants a and b.

Given our pairs of inputs and outputs, we can set up a system of linear equations to solve for a and b.

1. a - 10b = -213 (for input -10)
2. a + 9b = 167 (for input 9)
3. a + 4b = 67 (for input 4)
4. a - 3b = -73 (for input -3)
5. a + 20b = 387 (for input 20)

To find a and b, we can use any two of these five equations because ideally, if all points are on the same linear function, any two equations will give us the same a and b. However, to minimize potential rounding or calculation errors, it's practical to use the equations involving the smallest inputs (i.e., -3 and 4) for simplicity.

So, I will use equations 3 and 4 to solve for a and b:

a + 4b = 67
a - 3b = -73

Now, let's subtract the second equation from the first one:

a + 4b - (a - 3b) = 67 - (-73)
a + 4b - a + 3b = 67 + 73
7b = 140
b = 140 / 7
b = 20

Now, plug b back into one of the original equations to find a. I'll use equation 4:

a - 3b = -73
a - 3(20) = -73
a - 60 = -73
a = -73 + 60
a = -13

Thus, the function that describes the data is:

y = -13x^0 + 20x^1
or simply
y = -13 + 20x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) that best fit the given inputs and outputs. The term \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) since any number to the power of 0 is 1, and \( bx^1 \) simplifies to \( bx \) since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself. So we simplify the function to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

We can substitute two pairs of inputs and outputs into this equation to create a system of equations and solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the input-output pairs (-10, -213) and (9, 167):

1. \( -213 = a + b(-10) \)
2. \( 167 = a + b(9) \)

Now solve this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \).

Multiply the first equation by 9 and the second equation by 10 to eliminate \( a \) when we subtract one equation from the other:

1. \( -213 \times 9 = 9a + b(-90) \)
2. \( 167 \times 10 = 10a + b(90) \)

Simplified, we get:

1. \( -1917 = 9a - 90b \)
2. \( 1670 = 10a + 90b \)

Now add the two equations:

\( -1917 + 1670 = 9a - 90b + 10a + 90b \)

Which simplifies to:

\( -247 = 19a \)

So,

\( a = -247 / 19 \)
\( a = -13 \)

Now we have the value for \( a \), we can substitute it back into one of our original equations to solve for \( b \):

For example, using the second equation:

\( 167 = -13 + 9b \)
\( 180 = 9b \)
\( b = 20 \)

Thus, the function that fits the given data is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The function you've requested is in the form of a linear equation, where y represents the output, and x represents the input. We are tasked with identifying the coefficients a and b for the equation:

y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Here, x^0 is equal to 1 for any x, and x^1 is just x. Hence the equation simplifies to:

y = a + bx.

We need to solve for the values of a and b that provide the best fit for the given input-output pairs. To do this, we can set up a system of equations using two of the provided data points, then solve for a and b.

Let's use the following two points: (-10, -213) and (20, 387). For these two points, the system of equations becomes:

-213 = a + b(-10),
387 = a + b(20).

We can set up two equations as follows:

1) -213 = a - 10b,
2)  387 = a + 20b.

Now let's solve these two equations for a and b. If we add equation 1) and 2) we get:

-213 + 387 = a - 10b + a + 20b
 174 = 2a + 10b
  87 = a + 5b.

Now let's subtract 1) from 2):

387 + 213 = a + 20b - (a - 10b)
600 = 30b
b = 20.

With b found, let's solve for a using 87 = a + 5b:

87 = a + 5(20)
87 = a + 100
a = -13.

Therefore, the function that best fits the given data points is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function that best describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we're basically looking for a linear equation of the form \( y = b_0 + b_1x \), where:

- \( b_0 \) is the y-intercept (when \( x = 0 \))
- \( b_1 \) is the slope of the line

From the given data, we know immediately that \( b_0 = -3 \) because that's the output when \( x = 0 \).

Now, we need to find \( b_1 \), which is a bit more challenging since we need at least two data points to calculate the slope and we need to make sure that the slope we compute is representative for all data points provided.

Given two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \), the slope \( b_1 \) can be calculated as:

\[ b_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Choosing two data points:

1. \( x_1 = -18 \), \( y_1 = 339 \)
2. \( x_2 = -16 \), \( y_2 = 301 \)

\[ b_1 = \frac{301 - 339}{-16 - (-18)} \]
\[ b_1 = \frac{-38}{2} \]
\[ b_1 = -19 \]

However, we should check another pair of data points to confirm that the slope is the same:

1. \( x_1 = -3 \), \( y_1 = 54 \)
2. \( x_2 = 0 \), \( y_2 = -3 \)

\[ b_1 = \frac{-3 - 54}{0 - (-3)} \]
\[ b_1 = \frac{-57}{3} \]
\[ b_1 = -19 \]

This confirms that for these two pairs of points, the slope \( b_1 \) is consistent at -19, suggesting it holds for the relationship described by the data.

Hence, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

\[ y = -3 + (-19)x \]
\[ y = -19x - 3 \]

Note that for simplicity, we combine \( b_0 \) and \( b_1 \) in a single equation and I've replaced \( ax^0 \) with \( -3 \) directly, because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any non-zero x, so \( a \cdot x^0 \) is simply \( a \).

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we need to determine the constants ""a"" and ""b"". The term ax^0 is simply ""a"" because any non-zero number to the power of 0 is 1. So the function simplifies to y = a + bx. We need to solve for ""a"" and ""b"" using the given input-output pairs.

Let's use the input-output pairs (x, y) to create equations:

1. For Input: -18, Output: 339
   339 = a + b(-18)

2. For Input: 0, Output: -3
   -3 = a + b(0)

    To formulate a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given set of input-output pairs, we first note that ax^0 is equivalent to a since x^0 = 1 for any x that is not zero. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

However, since there are multiple data points, we cannot generally fit them perfectly with a simple linear function unless they exactly lie on a straight line, which is unlikely given their arbitrary nature. Instead, we can aim to find the coefficients a and b for the linear function that would best fit the data in a least squares sense, which minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals (the differences between the actual outputs and the outputs predicted by our linear model).

To illustrate the process, we can take two data points (preferably those which will provide a clear linear system) and solve for a and b. Using the provided data points:

For Input: 0 (x = 0), Output: -3 (y = -3)
-3 = a(1) + b(0) ⇒ a = -3  (since anything times 0 is 0)

    To find the function in the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we recognize that when stated explicitly, the equation simplifies to `y = a + bx` because any number to the power of zero (x^0) is 1.

Given that information, we have pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y):

(-18, 339), (0, -3), (5, -98), (-3, 54), (-16, 301)

We can then form equations based on these pairs with our simplified function `y = a + bx`:

Let's simplify the function first:
\( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) can be simplified to \( y = a + bx \) because \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x that does not equal zero.

Now let's use two points from the given data to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

\( -51 = a + 9b \)
\( -31 = a + 5b \)

Subtract the second equation from the first:

Given the points (5, -31), (9, -51), (-11, 49), (-4, 14), and (-12, 54), we need to find values for a and b that will fit these points as closely as possible. Since we are not provided with any specific method (like least squares, for instance), we can attempt to find a and b that fit exactly, if possible.

To check if an exact fit is possible, we can attempt to solve for a and b using two of the points, then verify that solution against the other points.

Using points (5, -31) and (-11, 49):

-31 = a + 5b ---- (1)

For (-11, 49):

y = -6 + (-5)x
or
y = -6 - 5x

To confirm if this function works for the other points (-4, 14), (-12, 54), we plug them into the function:

For (-4, 14):
14 = -6 - 5(-4)
14 = -6 + 20
14 = 14 (This point fits the function)

For (-12, 54):
54 = -6 - 5(-12)
54 = -6 + 60
54 = 54 (This point also fits the function)

Since all the given points fit the function y = -6 - 5x, we can conclude this is the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs provided. Therefore:

Function: y = -6 - 5x

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which can be simplified as y = a + bx, we need to solve for the parameters ""a"" and ""b"".

Note that x^0 is just 1 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), so the function essentially just has a constant term ""a"" and a linear term ""b"" multiplied by x.

We can use two points to solve for ""a"" and ""b"":

Let's use the points (5, -31) and (9, -51):

1) For the input 5:
-31 = a + 5b

2) For the input 9:
-51 = a + 9b

Now, we have two equations with two unknowns. Let's solve for ""a"" and ""b"".

From equation (1):
-31 = a + 5b
a = -31 - 5b

Substituting the value of ""a"" from equation (1) into equation (2):

-51 = (-31 - 5b) + 9b
-51 = -31 + 4b
-20 = 4b
b = -20 / 4
b = -5

Now substitute the value of ""b"" into equation (1):

We have to solve the linear system created by substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation. Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to find a and b:

For input 5 (output -31):

-31 = a + 5b   ...(1)

For input 9 (output -51):
-51 = a(9)^0 + b(9)
-51 = a + 9b   ...(2)

We need to solve this system of equations to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \). By subtracting equation (1) from equation (2), we can eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( b \):

(-51) - (-31) = (a + 9b) - (a + 5b)
-51 + 31 = 9b - 5b
-20 = 4b
b = -5

We can substitute \( b \) into equation (1) to solve for \( a \):

This means we're looking for a linear function of the form:

Given the data points:

From the first point (5, -31):
-31 = a + 5b

From the second point (9, -51):
-51 = a + 9b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1. -31 = a + 5b

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate 'a':

Given the data points:

1. When \( x = 7 \), \( y = -98 \)
2. When \( x = 17 \), \( y = -218 \)
3. When \( x = 5 \), \( y = -74 \)
4. When \( x = 3 \), \( y = -50 \)
5. When \( x = -6 \), \( y = 58 \)

We can see that the changes in y relative to changes in x seem to follow a linear pattern. Now, let's try to determine the slope (b) of this linear function.

Taking two points to calculate the slope (let's use the first two):

\( b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) \)

Using points 2 and 1:

\( b = (-218 - (-98)) / (17 - 7) \)
\( b = (-218 + 98) / (17 - 7) \)
\( b = (-120) / (10) \)
\( b = -12 \)

So, our slope b is -12. Now let's find a by plugging in the values of one of the points into the equation \( y = a + bx \). Let's use the point (7, -98):

\( -98 = a + (-12)(7) \)
\( -98 = a - 84 \)

Let's set up a system of equations based on the inputs and the outputs provided. We can use two data points to solve for a and b.

For Input 7 and Output -98:
-98 = a + 7b  ---> Equation 1

For Input 17 and Output -218:

Now we can solve these equations using methods such as substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution by solving Equation 1 for a and then substituting it into Equation 2.

From Equation 1:
a = -98 - 7b  ---> Equation 3

Substitute Equation 3 into Equation 2:
-218 = (-98 - 7b) + 17b
-218 = -98 + 10b
-120 = 10b
b = -12

Now we substitute b back into Equation 3 to solve for a:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to find the coefficients a and b that will satisfy this linear equation.

The term ax^0 simplifies to a, because any number to the power of zero is 1.

So the equation simplifies to y = a + bx. 

Given the pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can set up a system of linear equations to solve for a and b. Let's use two of the given pairs to find a and b:

Using the first pair (7, -98):
-98 = a + b(7)

Using the second pair (17, -218):
-218 = a + b(17)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:
1) -98 = a + 7b
2) -218 = a + 17b

Let's solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. For simplicity, let's use elimination.

First, multiply equation 1) by -1 to make it easier to eliminate 'a':
98 = -a - 7b

Now add this new equation to equation 2):
-218 = a + 17b
+ 98 = -a - 7b

-120 = 10b

Solving for b:
b = -120 / 10
b = -12

a = -98 + 84
a = -14

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to interpret ax^0 + bx^1 as:

y = a + bx

Given that x^0 is always equal to 1 for any x ≠ 0, this simplifies to a constant term (a) plus a linear term (bx).

We can use any two distinct points to solve for a and b. Let's use the points (7, -98) and (-6, 58).

Using point (7, -98):

-98 = a + b(7)

Using point (-6, 58):

58 = a + b(-6)

Now we have a system of two equations to solve for a and b:

1) -98 = a + 7b
2)  58 = a - 6b

We can solve this system using various methods, such as substitution, elimination, or matrix methods. We'll use the elimination method:

Multiply the first equation by 6 and the second equation by 7 to eliminate a:

6(-98) = 6a + 42b
7(58)  = 7a - 42b

That gives:

-588 = 6a + 42b
406  = 7a - 42b

Now, add the two equations together:

-588 + 406 = 6a + 42b + 7a - 42b

-182 = 13a

a = -182 / 13
a = -14

Now that we have a, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find b. Using the first equation:

-98 = -14 + 7b

Subtract -14 from both sides to isolate b on one side of the equation:

-84 = 7b

Now divide both sides by 7:

b = -84 / 7

From the input 7: 

\( -98 = a + b \cdot 7 \) [Equation 1]

From the input 17:

We will solve these equations simultaneously. First, let's subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate \( a \):

\( -218 - (-98) = (a + b \cdot 17) - (a + b \cdot 7) \)

\( -218 + 98 = a - a + 17b - 7b \)

\( -120 = 10b \)

\( b = -120 / 10 \)

\( b = -12 \)

    To determine the coefficients `a` and `b` for a linear function of the form `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we can use two points to solve for `a` and `b`. The points (-11, -169) and (20, 265) can be used to set up the following system of linear equations:

Equation 1 (using input -11 and output -169):  
-169 = a(-11)^0 + b(-11)^1  
-169 = a - 11b

Equation 2 (using input 20 and output 265):  
265 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1  
265 = a + 20b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1) a - 11b = -169  
2) a + 20b = 265

Adding the two equations to eliminate `a`, we get:

(1) + (2)  
(a - 11b) + (a + 20b) = (-169) + 265  
2a + 9b = 96

Now, divide by 2:

a + 4.5b = 48

Using equation 2 to solve for `a`:

a = 265 - 20b

Replace `a` in the modified version of equation 1 with the expression obtained from equation 2:

(265 - 20b) + 4.5b = 48

Solve for `b`:

265 - 20b + 4.5b = 48  
265 - 15.5b = 48  
-15.5b = 48 - 265  
-15.5b = -217

b = -217 / -15.5  
b = 14

Now that we have `b`, we can solve for `a` using either equation, let's use equation 2 again:

a = 265 - 20b  
a = 265 - 20(14)  
a = 265 - 280  
a = -15

Now plug `a` and `b` into the function form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1  
y = (-15)x^0 + (14)x^1  
y = -15 + 14x

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can treat this as a linear equation where ax^0 is the constant term (since any number to the power of 0 is 1, this is just a) and bx^1 is simply bx since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself.

Given a linear equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can rewrite it as y = a + bx. We can solve for a and b using two data points from the provided dataset. Let's use the following two points to set up our system of equations:

Using inputs 9 and 13:
1. For x = 9, y = 160, we get 160 = a + 9b
2. For x = 13, y = 228, we get 228 = a + 13b

Now, let's solve for a and b:

From equation 1: a = 160 - 9b
Substitute the value of a from equation 1 into equation 2:
228 = (160 - 9b) + 13b
228 = 160 + 4b

b = 17

Now that we have b, we can solve for a:

a = 160 - 9(17)
a = 160 - 153
a = 7

To find the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \), we can use two of the given input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations. For example, using the input-output pairs (9, 160) and (13, 228), we get two equations:

1) For input 9: \( 160 = a + b \cdot 9 \)
2) For input 13: \( 228 = a + b \cdot 13 \)

This is a system of two linear equations in two unknowns. We can solve this system for \( a \) and \( b \) using methods such as substitution or elimination.

We need to solve this system for 'a' and 'b'. We can use any two equations to solve for 'a' and 'b', but for simplicity, let's use the first two.

From equation 1:

    To find a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the given inputs and outputs. Since \( ax^0 \) is just \( a \) (because anything to the power of 0 is 1), this simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Let's use two of the provided input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

Using the pairs (9, 160) and (-20, -333), we get:
1. For the input 9: \( a + b(9) = 160 \)
2. For the input -20: \( a + b(-20) = -333 \)

Let's call the first equation (1) and the second equation (2). Now, we can solve this system for \( a \) and \( b \).

Multiplying the second equation by 9 to eliminate \( a \), we get:
\( 9a - 180b = -2997 \) (equation 3 from multiplying equation 2 by 9)

Now, adding equation 1 and equation 3, we can eliminate \( a \):

\( a + 9a + 9b - 180b = 160 - 2997 \)
\( 10a - 171b = -2837 \)

Since we have just one equation with two unknowns and multiple sets of input-output pairs, we realize that this function probably won't be perfectly linear and may not perfectly fit all given pairs with a unique solution for \( a \) and \( b \). However, for the purposes of this exercise, we can still attempt to find the best fit line that goes through these points.

Looking at the pattern, the change for each unit increase in x seems to increase by 17. Let's check this with two adjacent pairs, (9, 160) and (13, 228):

228 - 160 = 68
13 - 9 = 4
68 / 4 = 17

Hence, \( b \) is likely 17. We will now use one of the points to solve for \( a \):

    Let's denote the inputs as x and the outputs as y, and follow the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 equals 1 for any x except for x=0.

To solve for a and b, we can use any pair of the equations above. However, because we want the solution that fits all given points, we should look for the pattern in the changes of y with respect to changes in x. 

Looking at these data points and considering their changes:

When x increases from -10 to -2 (an increase of 8), y increases from 161 to 17 (a decrease of 144).
When x increases from -2 to 7 (an increase of 9), y decreases from 17 to -145 (a decrease of 162).
When x increases from 7 to 9 (an increase of 2), y decreases from -145 to -181 (a decrease of 36).

We see a consistent pattern that for each unit increase in x, y decreases by 18. Thus, we can surmise that b = -18.

Now that b is known, let's use one of the points to find a. We can use the point (x = -2, y = 17):

Substitute this into the second: `-145 = (17 + 2b) + 7b`

Simplifying the second equation:
`-145 = 17 + 9b`
`-145 - 17 = 9b`
`-162 = 9b`
`b = -162 / 9`
`b = -18`

Let's use the points (-2, 17) and (7, -145) to solve for a and b:

Using the first point (-2, 17):

Using the second point (7, -145):
-145 = a + b(7) --> -145 = a + 7b (2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

(1) 17 = a - 2b
(2) -145 = a + 7b

Multiply (1) by 7 and (2) by 2:

7(17) = 7a - 14b --> 119 = 7a - 14b (3)
2(-145) = 2a + 14b --> -290 = 2a + 14b (4)

Now add (3) and (4):

-171 = 9a

Now we can solve for a:

a = -171 / 9
a = -19

Substitute the value of a into (1):

17 = -19 - 2b
2b = -19 - 17

-307 = 8 + 21b
-315 = 21b
b = -315 / 21
b = -15

With the value of 'b', we can now determine 'a' using equation (3):

a = 8 + (-15)
a = 8 - 15
a = -7

The resulting function is then:

y = -7 + (-15)x
or
y = -7 - 15x

If you wish to express it in the given exact form (Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1), the function is:

y = -7x^0 - 15x^1

    ","To calculate the output for the input -8 using the derived function y = -7 - 15x, we substitute x with -8:

y = 113

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the values of \( a \) and \( b \), we can use two of the given input-output pairs to create a system of linear equations, because the function has the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]
\[ y = a + bx \]

Let's use the given input-output pairs (20, -307) and (-1, 8):

For the input 20:
\[ -307 = a + 20b \]

For the input -1:
\[ 8 = a - b \]

Now we have the following system of equations:

\[ a + 20b = -307 \]
\[ a - b = 8 \]

Let's solve this system for \( a \) and \( b \). We will use the method of substitution or elimination. I will demonstrate the elimination method:

First, let's align the equations:

1. \( a + 20b = -307 \)
2. \( a - b = 8 \)

We can multiply the second equation by 20 to align the coefficients of \( b \):

\( 20(a - b) = 20 \times 8 \)
\( 20a - 20b = 160 \)

Now our system looks like this:

1. \( a + 20b = -307 \)
2. \( 20a - 20b = 160 \)

Add the two equations together:

\( (a + 20b) + (20a - 20b) = -307 + 160 \)
\( 21a = -147 \)

Divide by 21 to find \( a \):

\( a = \frac{-147}{21} \)
\( a = -7 \)

Now that we have \( a \), let's find \( b \) by plugging \( a \) into the second original equation:

\( a - b = 8 \)
\( -7 - b = 8 \)
\( -b = 8 + 7 \)
\( -b = 15 \)
\( b = -15 \)

So the values of \( a \) and \( b \) are:

\( a = -7 \)
\( b = -15 \)

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

\[ y = -7x^0 - 15x^1 \]
\[ y = -7 - 15x \]

    Given the inputs and outputs, we need to find the constants ""a"" and ""b"" for the function in the form:
\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]
which simplifies to:
\[ y = a + bx \]
because \(x^0 = 1\) for any x except for x=0.

Let's denote two pairs of inputs and their corresponding outputs as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). We can form a system of linear equations to solve for ""a"" and ""b"". Let's use the pairs (20, -307) and (-1, 8) as they have different x values.

Substituting the first pair into the equation gives us:
\[ -307 = a + 20b \]
\( (1) \)

Substituting the second pair into the equation gives us:
\[ 8 = a - b \]
\( (2) \)

Now we have a system of two equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
-307 &= a + 20b \quad (1) \\
8 &= a - b \quad \quad (2)
\end{align*}
\]

By adding equation (2) to equation (1), we can solve for ""a"". 

\[
\begin{align*}
-307 + 8 &= (a + 20b) + (a - b) \\
-299 &= 2a + 19b
\end{align*}
\]

Now let's isolate ""a"" in equation (2):
\[ a = 8 + b \]
\( (3) \)

Substitute (3) in the modified equation (1) + (2):
\[
\begin{align*}
-299 &= 2(8 + b) + 19b \\
-299 &= 16 + 2b + 19b \\
-299 &= 16 + 21b \\
-299 - 16 &= 21b \\
-315 &= 21b \\
b &= -15

\]

Now substitute ""b"" back into equation (3) to solve for ""a"":
\[
\begin{align*}
a &= 8 + b \\
a &= 8 - 15 \\
a &= -7

    To find a function in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we are looking for a linear relationship between x and y. Generally, this can be simplified to:

\(y = a + bx\)

Where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the function.

Based on the provided inputs and outputs, we can write out the function from two of the points and solve for a and b.

Let's use the first two unique pairs (x1, y1) = (20, -307) and (x2, y2) = (-1, 8) to form two equations:

For (20, -307):
-307 = a + b(20)

For (-1, 8):
8 = a + b(-1)

Let's solve these two equations simultaneously for a and b.

From the second equation, we can solve for a:
a = 8 + b

Substitute this value of a into the first equation:
-307 = (8 + b) + b(20)
-307 = 8 + 21b
-307 - 8 = 21b
-315 = 21b
b = -315 / 21
b = -15

Now, we can substitute b back into the equation for a:
a = 8 + b
a = 8 + (-15)
a = -7

    To determine the coefficients a and b for a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is equivalent to y = a + bx, we can use two points from the input-output pairs to form a system of linear equations.

Let's take two different input-output pairs to create the system:

Using Input: -1, Output: 8:
8 = a + b(-1) -> Equation 1

Using Input: 20, Output: -307:
-307 = a + b(20) -> Equation 2

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

8 = a - b    (Equation 1)
-307 = a + 20b (Equation 2)

Solving for a and b, we can multiply equation 1 by 20 to eliminate a:

160 = 20a - 20b (Equation 1 multiplied by 20)
-307 = a + 20b (Equation 2)

Adding the multiplied Equation 1 to Equation 2:

160 + (-307) = (20a + a) + (-20b + 20b)
-147 = 21a
a = -147 / 21
a = -7

Substituting a into Equation 1:
8 = -7 - b
b = -7 - 8
b = -15

The function representing the input-output relationship is then:

y = -7x^0 - 15x^1

To find the values of a and b, let's use the given input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations.

Using the points (x, y):

(13, -66): -66 = a + 13b
(-20, 132): 132 = a - 20b
(18, -96): -96 = a + 18b
(0, 12): 12 = a + 0b  <-- From this one, it's immediate that a = 12
(11, -54): -54 = a + 11b

Now that we have a = 12 from the fourth point, we can plug this value into the other equations to find b. Using the first point:

-66 = 12 + 13b
-66 - 12 = 13b
-78 = 13b

From the given data points:

1. When x = 13, y = -66:
-66 = a + 13b

2. When x = -20, y = 132:
132 = a - 20b

3. When x = 18, y = -96:

4. When x = 0, y = 12:

5. When x = 11, y = -54:

Since when x = 0, y = 12, we can directly conclude that a = 12. Now we will use the value of a to find b.

For instance, using the first data point:

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data, we need to determine the values of a and b. The term ax^0 is equivalent to a because x^0 is always 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Now, we use the given input-output pairs to find a and b. We know when x is 0, y is 12 (from the input-output pair (0, 12)), which directly tells us that a is 12 because b times 0 is 0.

Now, let's use another pair to find b. Choose an input that is not 0 to avoid the b term dropping out; for example, the pair (13, -66). When x is 13, y is -66:

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we can think of this as a linear function y = a + bx, because ax^0 is just a (since any number to the power of 0 is 1).

- (13, -66)
- (-20, 132)
- (18, -96)
- (0, 12)

We want to find values for a and b that make this equation true for all the given points. Since we have more points than unknowns, this might be an overdetermined system, and we may not be able to find an exact solution that fits all points perfectly. Instead, we can either use two of the points to construct a linear equation or use a method like least squares to find the best fit for the data overall.

One approach is to pick two points and use them to find the slope (b) and then solve for the intercept (a). For example, let's use the points (13, -66) and (0, 12):
1. Find the slope (b) between the two points:
   b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
   b = (12 - (-66)) / (0 - 13)
   b = 78 / -13
   b = -6

Now that we have b, we can use one of the points to find a. We'll use the point where x = 0 because it gives us the y-intercept, which is a. From the point (0, 12), we know:
2. Solve for a using the y-intercept:
   y = a + b*x
   12 = a + (-6)*0
   12 = a

So our function based on these two points would be:
y = 12 - 6x

However, this is based only on two of the given points and might not represent the entire data set perfectly. Therefore, to check its accuracy, we can plug in the rest of the x values and see if the corresponding y values match the outputs given above:

- If x = -20, y = 12 - 6*(-20) = 12 + 120 = 132 (which is correct)
- If x = 18, y = 12 - 6*18 = 12 - 108 = -96 (which is correct)
- If x = 11, y = 12 - 6*11 = 12 - 66 = -54 (which is correct)

Multiply equation 2) by 17 and equation 1) by 5 to make their 'b' coefficients equal but oppositely signed:

a = -228 / 12
a = -19

Now subsitute the value of 'a' back into one of the original equations to find 'b'. We'll use equation 2):

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since x^0 is always 1, we need to determine the constants a and b that fit the given input-output pairs.

We have the following pairs to consider:

1. For input -17, output is -325, which gives us the equation: -325 = a - 17b
2. For input -5, the output is -109, which gives us the equation: -109 = a - 5b
3. For input 16, the output is 269, which gives us the equation: 269 = a + 16b
4. For input -15 (twice, but it's the same input-output pair), the output is -289, which gives us the equation: -289 = a - 15b

To find a and b, we can use any two of the above equations to set up a system of linear equations and solve for a and b. Let's use equations 1 and 2 for this purpose:

-325 = a - 17b  (1)
-109 = a -  5b  (2)

Now, we can subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1) to eliminate a:

-325 - (-109) = (-17b) - (-5b)
-216 = -12b
b = 18

Now let's substitute b back into Equation (2) to solve for a:

-109 = a - 5b
-109 = a - 5(18)
-109 = a - 90
a = -19

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is equal to 1 for any x that isn't 0, let's find the constants a and b.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can set up the following equations:

For Input: -17, Output: -325
-325 = a + b(-17)

For Input: -5, Output: -109
-109 = a + b(-5)

We can use the above two equations to solve for a and b. 

Let's start by setting up system of linear equations based on these equations:

1) a - 17b = -325
2) a - 5b = -109

Now, subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate a and solve for b:

(a - 17b) - (a - 5b) = -325 - (-109)
a - a - 17b + 5b = -325 + 109
-12b = -216
b = 18

Now that we have b, we can plug it back into any of the two equations to solve for a. Let's use equation 2:

a - 5(18) = -109
a - 90 = -109
a = -109 + 90
a = -19

So our function is:
y = -19 + 18x

To verify this, we can plug in another given input and see if it gives us the correct output.

    Let's consider that the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is basically a linear function y = a + bx. We need to find the values of a and b that fit the data given.

From the data set provided, we can create a system of equations using two points to find the coefficients a and b.

For example, using the pairs (10, 142) and (15, 217), we have:

1) For input 10: 142 = a + 10b
2) For input 15: 217 = a + 15b

We can solve this system of linear equations for a and b. Subtracting the 1st equation from the 2nd equation, we get:

217 - 142 = (a + 15b) - (a + 10b)
75 = 5b
b = 15

Now knowing b, we can substitute it back into any of the equations to find a. Let's use the first equation:

142 = a + 10(15)
142 = a + 150
a = 142 - 150
a = -8

Now we have the values for a and b, and the function can be written as:

y = -8 + 15x

For input -10:
y = -8 + 15(-10) = -8 - 150 = -158 (matches the output)

For input -4:
y = -8 + 15(-4) = -8 - 60 = -68 (matches the output)

    The given data points are of the form (x, y) and we need to describe the relationship using a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Let's visualize what ax^0 + bx^1 means:

- ax^0 is a constant term, because any number x to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, ax^0 = a.
- bx^1 is simply bx, since any number x to the power of 1 is x itself.

So the function in simplified form is y = a + bx.

Now let's use the given data points to determine the coefficients a and b. We will use two data points to derive a system of equations and solve for a and b.

Let's choose the points (10, 142) and (-10, -158).

Substituting the first point into the equation y = a + bx gives us:
142 = a + b(10)

And substituting the second point into the equation gives us:
-158 = a + b(-10)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1) 142 = a + 10b
2) -158 = a - 10b

We can solve this system by adding the two equations together to eliminate b:
(142 = a + 10b)
+
(-158 = a - 10b)
-----------------
-16 = 2a

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
a = -16 / 2
a = -8

Now we can substitute the value of a into one of our equations to find b:
142 = -8 + 10b
150 = 10b
b = 150 / 10
b = 15

    The given relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) suggests a linear relationship that can be captured by a function of the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Here, ax^0 is a constant term (because x^0 = 1 for any x ≠ 0), and bx^1 is a term that is linear in x (it is just bx since x^1 = x). We need to find the values of a and b that best describe the given input-output pairs.

To determine the constants a and b, we can use two data points to set up a system of linear equations.

Let's take two input-output pairs, for example, (10, 142) and (-10, -158).

For input 10: 
142 = a*10^0 + b*10
142 = a + 10b

For input -10:
-158 = a*(-10)^0 + b*(-10)
-158 = a - 10b

Now we have the system of equations:
1) a + 10b = 142
2) a - 10b = -158

Adding the two equations helps us to eliminate b and solve for a:
(1) + (2): (a + 10b) + (a - 10b) = 142 + (-158)
2a = -16
a = -16 / 2
a = -8

Now, substituting a into one of the equations to solve for b, we'll use equation 1):
-8 + 10b = 142
10b = 142 + 8
10b = 150
b = 150 / 10
b = 15

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

1) \( a + b(10) = 142 \)
2) \( a + b(-10) = -158 \)

Solving for a and b:
From equation 1) we have:

\( a + 10b + a - 10b = 142 - 158 \)
\( 2a = -16 \)
\( a = -8 \)

Creating equations based on these pairs:
1) a + 10b = 142
2) a + 15b = 217
3) a - 10b = -158
4) a - 4b = -68
5) a + 13b = 187

We can solve the system using any two equations to find a and b. Let's use equations 1) and 3) for elimination method:

In this particular expression, ax^0 is a constant term, because any number to the power of zero is 1. Thus, ax^0 simplifies to a. The term bx^1 is a linear term, simplified to bx, as any number to the power of one is the number itself. So, we are looking to define the function in the form:

The data points (x1, y1) = (-1, -8) and (x2, y2) = (5, 76) can be used to solve for a and b. We create two equations based on the linear function:

For (x1, y1) = (-1, -8):
-8 = a + b(-1)

For (x2, y2) = (5, 76):
76 = a + b(5)

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) -8 = a - b
2) 76 = a + 5b

Let us solve this system using methods of linear algebra, by first adding the two equations to eliminate a:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where y is the output and x is the input, we know that x^0 is always 1 for any x ≠ 0. Therefore, the term involving ax^0 effectively represents a constant term a.

Let's denote the constant term as ""a"" and the coefficient of the x term as ""b"". Now, our task is to find the values of a and b that best fit the data provided.

To solve for a and b, we can use two data points to set up a system of linear equations. Let's use the first two data points (1, 2) and (-19, 122):

For the input of 1:
2 = a*1^0 + b*1 → 2 = a + b

For the input of -19:
122 = a*(-19)^0 + b*(-19) → 122 = a - 19b

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1) a + b = 2
2) a - 19b = 122

We can solve this system using standard algebraic methods, such as substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

To eliminate a, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation:

(1) - (2): (a + b) - (a - 19b) = 2 - 122
             a + b - a + 19b = -120
                       20b = -120
                         b = -120 / 20
                         b = -6

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it into either equation to find a. Let's substitute it into the first equation:

a + (-6) = 2
a - 6 = 2
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

So the values that capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs best are a = 8 and b = -6. The function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = 8x^0 - 6x^1
y = 8 - 6x

This is under the assumption that the data provided has a linear relationship. For a more accurate result, especially since it's clear from the diverse input-output pairs that the relationship might be non-linear or that there's another variable or factor influencing the outputs, more advanced techniques or additional data would be required. However, based on the instruction and the form provided, this is the function we can propose based on the given points.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best fits the provided input-output pairs, we can translate ax^0 + bx^1 into a more familiar form, which is y = c + bx, where c is the constant term (ax^0) and b is the coefficient of the linear x term (bx^1).

Considering that our data does not follow a perfect linear pattern (just by inspecting the drastic changes in output with respect to the inputs), we can attempt to find the best linear approximation using these points.

We are given the following pairs:

(1, 2)
(-19, 122)
(17, -94)
(15, -82)
(-6, 44)

To find the best fit line, we could use linear regression techniques; however, since we are asked to construct a function manually and cannot calculate an exact regression without a computational tool, we'll work on finding the coefficients c (the y-intercept) and b (the slope) that make the function a reasonable approximation.

We can roughly estimate the slope (b) by selecting two points and using the rise over run formula:

Choosing the points (1, 2) and (15, -82):

Slope (b) = (Output2 - Output1) / (Input2 - Input1)
           = (-82 - 2) / (15 - 1)
           = (-84) / (14)
           = -6

Now, we need to estimate the y-intercept (c). Using one of the points through which our line should pass, let's use the point (1, 2) as it has the smallest input:

2 = c + (-6)(1)
2 = c - 6
c = 8

So our estimated function is y = 8 - 6x.

Let's write this in the form requested:

y = 8x^0 - 6x^1

It must be noted that this function is not the exact fit but a rough linear approximation based on our selection of points for calculating the slope and intercept. Without employing a method to minimize the error across all points (like the least squares method), we can't achieve the most accurate representation of the data.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b. The term ax^0 is equivalent to a because any number raised to the zero power is one. Thus, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given that we have only two unknowns (a and b), we need at least two points to solve the system of equations. However, since we have more than two points, we are likely dealing with an overdetermined system, and we may need to find the least squares solution that best fits all the points.

Let's take two data points to set up a system of linear equations. For simplicity, we should take two inputs that will result in the simplest equations. Here, we will use the input-output pairs (1, 2) and (-6, 44):

1. For input 1, output 2: 2 = a + b(1)  ->  a + b = 2 ...(1)
2. For input -6, output 44: 44 = a + b(-6)  ->  a - 6b = 44 ...(2)

Now, let's solve this system of equations for a and b:

From equation (1), we can express a in terms of b:
a = 2 - b ...(3)

Substitute a from equation (3) into equation (2):
(2 - b) - 6b = 44
2 - 7b = 44
-7b = 44 - 2
-7b = 42
b = 42 / -7
b = -6

Now, we substitute b back into equation (3) to find a:
a = 2 - (-6)
a = 2 + 6
a = 8

Thus, our function in the form y = a + bx would be:
y = 8 - 6x

However, we have not used all the data points provided to check whether this function fits them all. Here's a quick check:

For input -19:
y = 8 - 6(-19) = 8 + 114 = 122 (matches the output)

For input 17:
y = 8 - 6(17) = 8 - 102 = -94 (matches the output)

For input 15:
y = 8 - 6(15) = 8 - 90 = -82 (matches the output)

    To determine the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we recognize that \( ax^0 \) simplifies to \( a \) since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. Thus, we have \( y = a + bx \).

Now we need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that fit the provided input-output pairs. These pairs give us a system of linear equations. Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to form such equations.

Using the input-output pairs (1, 2) and (-19, 122), we can form the following two equations:

1. For input 1 and output 2: 
\( 2 = a + b(1) \)

2. For input -19 and output 122:
\( 122 = a + b(-19) \)

Now, let's solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

From equation 1:
\( 2 = a + b \)
\( a = 2 - b \) (Equation 3)

Replace \( a \) in equation 2 using equation 3:

\( 122 = (2 - b) + b(-19) \)
\( 122 = 2 - b - 19b \)
\( 122 = 2 - 20b \)
\( 120 = -20b \)
\( b = -6 \)

Using \( b = -6 \) in equation 3:
\( a = 2 - b \)
\( a = 2 - (-6) \)
\( a = 8 \)

Therefore, the function that best describes the data is:

    To find a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we can see that ax^0 is simply a, since any number to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Let's use two points to calculate the coefficients a and b. It's easier to use the two points that have the smallest magnitude for x to reduce the calculation errors:

Using the input-output pairs (-6, -105) and (1, 14), we can set up two equations:

1) For input -6:
-105 = a - 6b

2) For input 1:
14 = a + b

Now we have a system of linear equations:
-105 = a - 6b  (Equation 1)
14 = a + b     (Equation 2)

To solve these simultaneously, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

-105 - 14 = a - a - 6b - b
-119 = -7b
b = 17

Now we'll use the value of b to find a by substituting it into Equation 2:

14 = a + 17
a = -3

Now we have coefficients a and b, so we can write the function as:
y = -3 + 17x

    Given the data points and the desired form of the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can see that ax^0 will be a constant term (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is simply bx since anything raised to the power of 1 is itself.

Let's use two data points to solve for a and b. Let's choose the points (-17, -292) and (1, 14) for no particular reason other than the simplicity of the numbers involved.

From the first point (-17, -292):
-292 = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1
-292 = a - 17b

From the second point (1, 14):
14 = a(1)^0 + b(1)^1
14 = a + b

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) -292 = a - 17b
2) 14 = a + b

Now let's solve for a and b using these two equations. We can subtract the second from the first to eliminate a:

-292 - 14 = a - 17b - (a + b)
-306 = a - 17b - a - b
-306 = -18b

Divide both sides by -18 to find b:
b = -306 / -18
b = 17

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into the second equation to find a:
14 = a + b
14 = a + 17
a = 14 - 17
a = -3

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that make the equation fit the data provided.

Since \( x^0 \) is always 1, the equation effectively becomes:

\( y = a + bx \)

Let's use two sets of input-output pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

Using \( x = -17 \) and \( y = -292 \):

\( -292 = a + b(-17) \)
\( -292 = a - 17b \)  (1)

Using \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 14 \):

\( 14 = a + b(1) \)
\( 14 = a + b \) (2)

Now, we can solve the system of equations (1) and (2) to get the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) gives us:

\( -292 - 14 = a - 17b - (a + b) \)
\( -306 = -18b \)

Solving for \( b \):

\( b = \frac{-306}{-18} \)
\( b = 17 \)

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we need to discern a pattern that allows us to connect the two in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1. Given the equation's form, it is clear that ax^0 is a constant term (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 is a linear term (since x raised to the power of 1 is x).

Looking at the data, let's try to determine a and b:

For the input x = -17, output y = -292:
y = a(-17)^0 + b(-17)^1 = a + (-17b) = -292
a - 17b = -292 (Equation 1)

Similarly, let's use another pair of input-output:

For input x = -6, output y = -105:
y = a(-6)^0 + b(-6)^1 = a + (-6b) = -105
a - 6b = -105 (Equation 2)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of a and b.

Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

(Equation 1) a - 17b = -292
(Equation 2) -(a - 6b = -105)
------------------------
-11b = -187

Solving for b:
b = -187 / -11
b = 17

Now that we have the value of b, plug it into one of the equations to get a:
a - 6b = -105
a - 6(17) = -105
a - 102 = -105
a = -105 + 102

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given input-output pairs, we first need to note that ax^0 is simply a constant term because any number to the power of zero is 1. So our equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have the pairs (-17, -292), (-6, -105), (-16, -275), (-18, -309), and (1, 14), which give us a system of equations when we substitute them into our function:

1) a - 17b = -292
2) a - 6b = -105
3) a - 16b = -275
4) a - 18b = -309
5) a + b = 14

To solve this system, we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to find the value of b, then use that to solve for a using any of the equations. Subtracting (2) from (1), we get:

(-17b) - (-6b) = -292 - (-105)
-17b + 6b = -292 + 105

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Firstly, ax^0 will always be a because anything raised to the power of 0 is 1. Hence, the equation can be simplified to:

y = a + bx

We have two parameters a and b to determine, and we can use two data points to create a system of equations. Let's choose the points (14, -290) and (-7, 130) for this purpose. Substituting these into the equation gives us:

For input 14, output -290:
-290 = a + b(14)  [1]

For input -7, output 130:
130 = a + b(-7)  [2]

Now we can solve this system of equations. Let's multiply equation [2] by 2 to easily eliminate variable a by adding it to equation [1]:

260 = 2a - 14b  [multiply equation [2] by 2]
-290 = a + 14b  [equation 1 as is]

Adding both equations together:

-30 = 3a

Now, solve for a:

a = -30 / 3
a = -10

Now that we have a, we can substitute it back into either [1] or [2] to find b. Let's use equation [1]:

-290 = -10 + 14b

Add 10 to both sides:

-280 = 14b

    To write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is essentially a linear function y = b * x + a, as x^0 is always 1, we need to calculate the slope (b) and the y-intercept (a).

First, let's determine the slope (b) by using two data points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):

Choose (x1, y1) = (-7, 130) and (x2, y2) = (14, -290):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-290 - 130) / (14 - (-7))

y1 = b * x1 + a

    To find the function that describes the data where the function is of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can setup a linear equation system where (a) is the y-intercept and (b) is the slope of the line.

Given the function form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify this to y = a + bx since x^0 = 1 for any x that is not 0.

Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. For input x = -7, output y = 130:
130 = a + b(-7)

2. For input x = 14, output y = -290:

4. For input x = 16, output y = -330:

However, we only need two distinct points to determine the line. Let's use the first and second points to create our set of linear equations:

1. 130 = a - 7b
2. -290 = a + 14b

Solving this system of equations for a and b:

From equation 1:
a = 130 + 7b

Substitute a into equation 2:
-290 = (130 + 7b) + 14b
-290 = 130 + 21b
-420 = 21b
b = -420 / 21
b = -20

    ","To find the output for the input x = 10 using the function y = -10 - 20x, we substitute x with 10:

y = -10 - 20(10)
y = -10 - 200
y = -210

Therefore, the output is:

    Given the points (-7, 130), (14, -290), (-12, 230), and (16, -330), we want to find constants a and b such that the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) can be described by the function y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Since ax^0 is the same as a (because any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 is 1), the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

To determine the value of a and b, we can set up two equations using two of the provided points and solve the resulting system of equations. Let's use the points (16, -330) and (-12, 230) to set up our equations.

For the point (16, -330):
-330 = a + b(16)

For the point (-12, 230):
230 = a + b(-12)

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) -330 = a + 16b
2) 230 = a - 12b

We can solve this system for a and b by using the method of elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

Multiply equation 2) by 1 and equation 1) by 1 to align the coefficients for a:

2) 230 = a - 12b
1) -330 = a + 16b
---------------

We can then subtract equation 2) from equation 1) to eliminate a:

-330 - 230 = (a + 16b) - (a - 12b)
-560 = 28b

Solve for b:

b = -560 / 28
b = -20

Now, replace b in one of our original equations to solve for a. Let's use equation 2):

230 = a - 12(-20)
230 = a + 240

Solve for a:

a = 230 - 240
a = -10

With a and b determined, we can write the function:

y = -10 + (-20)x
Or simplified:
y = -10 - 20x

This function should capture the pattern in the given data points.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to determine the constants \( a \) and \( b \).

Since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any \( x \) (except when \( x = 0 \)), we can simplify this form to:

\( y = a + bx \)

Now we must find \( a \) and \( b \) using the pairs of inputs and outputs provided.

Let's set up two equations using two of the input-output pairs:

1) Using the input -7 and output 130:
   \( 130 = a + b(-7) \)
   \( 130 = a - 7b \)

2) Using the input 14 and output -290:
   \( -290 = a + b(14) \)
   \( -290 = a + 14b \)

Now we have a system of two equations:
\( a - 7b = 130 \)
\( a + 14b = -290 \)

Solving this system of equations we get:

\( a + 14b = -290 \)
\( a - 7b = 130 \)

Multiplying the second equation by 2 gives us:
\( 2a - 14b = 260 \)

Adding this result to the first equation:
\( (a + 14b) + (2a - 14b) = -290 + 260 \)
\( 3a = -30 \)
\( a = -30 / 3 \)
\( a = -10 \)

Now let's substitute \( a = -10 \) into one of the original equations to solve for \( b \):

\( -10 - 7b = 130 \)
\( -7b = 130 + 10 \)
\( -7b = 140 \)
\( b = 140 / (-7) \)
\( b = -20 \)

So we now have arrived at our function:

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can interpret this as needing to find a linear function of the form y = b*x + a (because x^0 is 1 for any x, thus a is the constant term and b is the coefficient of the first degree term).

Given the provided pairs of (input, output), we can set up a series of equations based on the linear function:

1. For input -14, output -97:
-97 = b*(-14) + a

2. For input 7, output 50:
50 = b*7 + a

3. For input 2, output 15:
15 = b*2 + a

Since we have multiple data points, we need to find the values of a and b that satisfy all these equations. However, we need only look at two of these equations, as duplicate points with the same input-output relationship do not provide any new information.

We can solve equations 2 and 3 to find the values of a and b:

From equation 2:
50 = 7b + a ....(i)

From equation 3:
15 = 2b + a ....(ii)

Now, subtract equation (ii) from (i) to eliminate a:

50 - 15 = 7b - 2b
35 = 5b
35/5 = b
b = 7

Now substitute the value of b back into equation (ii) to find a:

15 = 2(7) + a
15 = 14 + a
a = 15 - 14
a = 1

    To determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need first to understand the structure of the equation. The term ax^0 is just a since anything raised to the zero power is 1. The term bx^1 is just bx since anything raised to the power of one is the number itself. So the equation simplifies to y = a + bx.

We are given several input-output pairs to work with, and since the function is linear (and the x-values are not all the same), we can use any two pairs to solve for a and b. Let's use the first and the third pair:

For the input x = -14, the output y is -97:
-97 = a + b(-14)   =>  -97 = a - 14b  [1]

For the input x = 7, the output y is 50:
50 = a + b(7)    =>   50 = a + 7b  [2]

Now, we solve this system of linear equations for a and b.

Multiplying equation [2] by 2 gives:
100 = 2a + 14b  [3]

Next, we add equation [1] to equation [3] (to eliminate b and solve for a):
-97 + 100 = (a - 14b) + (2a + 14b)
3 = 3a
a = 3 / 3
a = 1

Now that we have a, we can plug it back into either [1] or [2] to find b. We'll use [2]:

    To find the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) in the function of the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we can use two data points to create a system of linear equations. However, since \(x^0\) is always 1, we can think of \(a\) as the constant term and \(b\) as the coefficient for \(x\). That means our function can be expressed as \(y = a + bx\).

Let's use the data points (2, 15) and (7, 50) since they give us two distinct inputs for \(x\).

For the input-output pair (2, 15), the equation is:
\(15 = a + 2b\)

And for the input-output pair (7, 50), the equation is:
\(50 = a + 7b\)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:

    To find the function in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we need to determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) such that the equation fits the given input-output pairs.

First, we need to recognize that \(x^0\) is always equal to \(1\) for any \(x\) (except for \(x = 0\), but since we don't have zero in our inputs, we can safely ignore that case). Hence, the equation essentially becomes \(y = a + bx\).

We can use two pairs of input-output values to form a system of linear equations to solve for \(a\) and \(b\).

Using the input-output pairs (2, 15) and (7, 50):

1) For input 2: \(15 = a + 2b\)
2) For input 7: \(50 = a + 7b\)

Now we solve for \(a\) and \(b\). We can do this by subtracting the first equation from the second:

\(50 - 15 = a + 7b - (a + 2b)\)

\(35 = 5b\)

\(b = 35 / 5\)

\(b = 7\)

Substitute \(b = 7\) into the first equation:

\(15 = a + 2(7)\)

\(15 = a + 14\)

\(a = 15 - 14\)

\(a = 1\)

22 = a - 3(-7)
22 = a + 21
a = 22 - 21

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we'll assume the function takes the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

This simplifies to y = a + bx, since x^0 is always 1 for any x except for x=0 (but it does not affect our calculations as we have no such inputs).

We have the following pairs of (x, y):
(-9, 64)
(-3, 22)
(9, -62)
(-5, 36)
(-16, 113)

Using two pairs from the given data set, we can form two linear equations to solve for a and b. Let's use the first two points (-9, 64) and (-3, 22):

For x = -9, y = 64:
64 = a + b(-9) 
64 = a - 9b  .....(1)

For x = -3, y = 22:
22 = a + b(-3)
22 = a - 3b  .....(2)

Now we'll solve the system of equations (1) and (2) for a and b:

Subtract (2) from (1):
64 - 22 = (a - a) - 9b + 3b
42 = -6b
b = -7

Now plug b into equation (2):
22 = a - 3(-7)
22 = a + 21
a = 1

Therefore, our function that relates x to y is:
y = 1 - 7x

    To create a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs given, we need to determine the values of 'a' and 'b' that fit the data.

Let's consider the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 which simplifies to y = a + bx since anything (including x) raised to the power of 0 is 1.

We can use two pairs of input and output values to create a system of linear equations and solve for 'a' and 'b'. Let's take the inputs -9 and 9 with their corresponding outputs to set up our equations:

1. Using Input: -9, Output: 64
64 = a + b(-9)

2. Using Input: 9, Output: -62
-62 = a + b(9)

Now, we have two equations:
1. a - 9b = 64
2. a + 9b = -62

Let's add both equations to eliminate 'b':
( a - 9b ) + ( a + 9b ) = 64 - 62
2a = 2
a = 2 / 2
a = 1

Now that we have 'a', let's substitute it back into one of the equations to solve for 'b'. We'll use equation 1:

1 + (-9b) = 64
-9b = 64 - 1
-9b = 63
b = 63 / (-9)
b = -7

So, the function that fits the provided data points is:
y = 1 + (-7)x
or simply:
y = 1 - 7x

Please note that this function will perfectly describe the relationship if it holds exactly for all listed input-output pairs. However, if it doesn't, then it's a best-fit linear approximation considering the exact form specified by x^0 and x^1 terms. Without further points or the data consisting of some form of systematic error, this linear fit is the best representation given the constraints and data points provided.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we'll look at the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

First, let's note that x^0 is always 1, so ax^0 is just a. The function simplifies to y = a + bx.

We have several pairs of inputs (x) and outputs (y), so we can set up a system of equations to solve for a and b.

Using the pairs given:

1. For the input of x = -9, the output y = 64:
   64 = a + b(-9)

2. For the input of x = -3, the output y = 22:
   22 = a + b(-3)

3. For the input of x = 9, the output y = -62:
   -62 = a + b(9)

4. For the input of x = -5, the output y = 36:
   36 = a + b(-5)

5. For the input of x = -16, the output y = 113:
   113 = a + b(-16)

Now, let's solve this system of equations for a and b. We can do it manually or use methods like substitution, elimination, or even matrix operations. However, since we only need two equations to solve for two unknowns, let's use the first two equations to solve for a and b:

1. 64 = a - 9b
2. 22 = a - 3b

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:

(64 - 22) = a - 9b - (a - 3b)
42 = -6b
b = -7

Now, we can substitute b back into either equation to get a:

64 = a - 9(-7)
64 = a + 63
a = 64 - 63
a = 1

Putting it all together, our function is:

y = a + bx

    To find a linear function that fits the provided data points, we need to determine the coefficients a and b in the equation of the form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Which simplifies to:

y = a + bx

where x represents the input and y represents the output.

Given the data points:

(-9, 64)
(-3, 22)
(9, -62)
(-5, 36)
(-16, 113)

We can set up a system of equations using two of these points to determine the values of a and b. However, since a linear function is being sought, the ideal approach would be to use a method that minimizes the error across all points, like the least squares method. However, solving for exact values of a and b that will fit all points perfectly with a linear model may not be possible here, given the nature of the data.

Nonetheless, for a rough estimate, let's take two of the points and set up two equations:

Using the points (-9, 64) and (9, -62):

1) For x = -9, y = 64, we have:
   64 = a + b(-9)
   
2) For x = 9, y = -62, we have:
   -62 = a + b(9)

Solving these two equations simultaneously will give us an approximation for a and b:

From equation 1) 
   64 = a - 9b 
   a = 64 + 9b  ---(3)

Substitute a from equation 3) into equation 2):

   -62 = (64 + 9b) + 9b
   -62 = 64 + 18b
   18b = -62 - 64
   18b = -126
   b = -126 / 18
   b = -7

Now, use the value of b to find a using equation 3):

   a = 64 + 9(-7)
   a = 64 - 63
   a = 1

The approximate linear relationship (which will not fit all points perfectly) would be:

y = 1 - 7x

Again, while this function fits two of the data points exactly, it will not precisely fit the others because the actual data does not appear to align perfectly with a linear relationship. Advanced techniques such as least squares regression would be needed for the best possible linear fit to all points, but the obtained model may still not be a good fit if the true underlying relationship is not linear. For a pattern recognition task that demands a higher degree of accuracy or a non-linear function, advanced statistical and machine learning methods would typically be employed.

Let's use two input-output pairs to calculate the values of a and b. We will use the following pairs:

1. For input -20, output is 265:
   265 = a + b(-20)

2. For input 6, the output is -99:
   -99 = a + b(6)

Now we solve this system of equations:

From the first equation:
265 = a - 20b  =>  a = 265 + 20b  (equation 3)

Plugging 'a' from equation 3 into the second equation:
-99 = (265 + 20b) + 6b
-99 = 265 + 26b
-99 - 265 = 26b
-364 = 26b
b = -364 / 26
b = -14

Given the points:

(-20, 265), (-15, 195), (-5, 55), (-10, 125), (6, -99)

We can form a system of linear equations based on these points. Let's use two of the points to form two equations and solve for 'a' and 'b'.

Using points (x1, y1) = (-20, 265) and (x2, y2) = (6, -99), we get:

1) 265 = a - 20b
2) -99 = a + 6b

Let's solve this system of equations. Multiplying the second equation by 20 and adding it to the first equation to eliminate 'a':

-99 * 20 = 20a + 120b
265 = a - 20b

-1980 + 265 = 20a + 120b + a - 20b
-1715 = 21a + 100b

Now to isolate 'a', we can multiply the second equation by 21 and subtract it from the equation above:

-99 * 21 = 21a + 126b
-1715 = 21a + 100b

-2079 - (-1715) = 126b - 100b
-2079 + 1715 = 26b

y = a + bx

We have two constants to solve for: the y-intercept (a) and the slope of the line (b). We can use any two points to solve for these constants.

Let's use the points (-20, 265) and (-5, 55).

First, we'll use the point (-20, 265) to start:

265 = a + b(-20)

Now, using the point (-5, 55):

55 = a + b(-5)

We have a system of two equations:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 can be simplified to y = a + bx, since x^0 equals 1 for any x that's not zero. We have to find the constants a and b that satisfy the relationship between the given inputs and outputs.

To find a and b, we can use two sets of input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations and then solve them. Let's use the first unique two:

1. Using input -10 (output -54): 
-54 = a + b(-10)

2. Using input 4 (output 2):
2 = a + b(4)

From (1), we get:
a - 10b = -54  ---(3)

From (2), we get:
a + 4b = 2      ---(4)

To solve this system, we can subtract equation (4) from equation (3):

(a - 10b) - (a + 4b) = -54 - 2
a - 10b - a - 4b = -56
-14b = -56
b = 4

Now we can substitute b back into equation (4) to find a:

a + 4(4) = 2
a + 16 = 2
a = 2 - 16
a = -14

Now that we have a and b, the function can be written as:

y = -14 + 4x

Let's confirm with one more point to make sure this function works for all given points. Using input -20 (Output: -94):

y = -14 + 4(-20)
y = -14 - 80
y = -94

This confirms our function y = -14 + 4x is correct for the provided data points.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we need to solve for coefficients a and b. The term a represents the constant term since x^0 = 1 for all x, and b represents the linear coefficient.

Given the data points:
(-10, -54)
(4, 2)
(-20, -94)
(4, 2)
(-4, -30)

Since we have more than two data points for a single linear equation (which is typically determined by two points), we need to check if they all lie on the same line or calculate a best fit line through them.

However, we can observe that inputs of 4 correspond to the same output of 2, which gives us one equation. Let's use the two different points (-10, -54) and (4, 2) to solve for a and b.

From the first point (-10, -54):
-54 = a(1) - 10b ... (Equation 1)

From the second point (4, 2):
2 = a(1) + 4b ... (Equation 2)

Now we can solve this system of linear equations for a and b.

Multiplying Equation 2 by 2.5 yields:
5 = 2.5a + 10b ... (Equation 3)

Adding Equation 1 and Equation 3 together to eliminate b, we get:
-49 = 3.5a
a = -49 / 3.5
a = -14

Now we can substitute a back into Equation 2 to find b:
2 = -14(1) + 4b
4b = 16
b = 4

So, the function that describes the data is:
y = -14x^0 + 4x^1

Or simplifying, since x^0 is 1:
y = -14 + 4x

    To find the function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given input-output pairs, we need to determine the constants a and b. The function is essentially a linear function in the form y = b * x + a because x^0 is 1 for any x except for x = 0 (note that the given inputs are all nonzero, so we don't need to consider the case of x = 0).

Let's use two of the given data points to solve for a and b.

Using Input: -10, Output: -54,
-54 = a + (-10)b
-54 = a - 10b  ... (1)

And using Input: 4, Output: 2,
2 = a + 4b ... (2)

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

(1) -54 = a - 10b
(2) 2 = a + 4b

We can solve this system of equations by using the method of substitution or elimination. I'll use elimination in this case.

First, we can multiply equation (2) by 2.5 to get terms of b that can cancel out with equation (1):

2.5(2 = a + 4b)
5 = 2.5a + 10b ... (3)

Now we add (1) and (3) together:

(-54) + 5 = (a - 10b) + (2.5a + 10b)
-49 = 3.5a

To find a, we divide both sides by 3.5:

a = -49 / 3.5
a = -14

Now that we have a, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find b. Using equation (2):

2 = -14 + 4b
16 = 4b
b = 4

So the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

y = -14 * x^0 + 4 * x^1

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we will need to solve for the coefficients a and b.

The term ax^0 is effectively a constant (a) because any number to the power of zero is 1. The second term bx^1 is just bx, as any number to the power of 1 is the number itself.

So, we are looking for a function of the form: y = a + bx.

Let's use two points to determine the coefficients a and b. We pick (-11, -20) and (-2, -2).

Substituting the first point into the equation leads to:
-20 = a - 11b (1)

Substituting the second point into the equation leads to:
-2 = a - 2b (2)

Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables, which we can solve using various methods such as substitution or elimination. We will use the elimination method here.

Multiply equation (2) by 5.5 (to make the coefficient of b the same as in equation (1)):
-11 = 5.5a - 11b (3)

Subtract equation (1) from equation (3):
-11 - (-20) = (5.5a - a) - (11b - 11b)
9 = 4.5a

Now solve for a:
a = 9 / 4.5
a = 2

Substitute the value of a into equation (2):
-2 = 2 - 2b
-2b = -2 - 2
-2b = -4

Now solve for b:
b = -4 / -2
b = 2

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we have to determine the values of a and b that best fit the given input-output pairs.

Firstly note that ax^0 is the same as a*1, since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. So ax^0 simply represents a constant term, which is often denoted as c in linear equations. Thus, the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx, which is the equation of a straight line.

We are given several points (-11, -20), (-8, -14), (-2, -2), (-7, -12), (-17, -32). From these pairs, we can create a system of equations to solve for a and b. However, since we're interested in the best fit and we have more than two points, we can't solve this system exactly (because it's likely overdetermined or contradictory). Therefore, instead, we would typically use a method such as least squares to find a best fit line.

But in this case, let's inspect the given points to see if there's an obvious pattern that could suggest the values of a and b:

Looking at the first two points (-11, -20) and (-8, -14), we can start by finding the slope (b) of the line between them:
b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

b = (-14 - (-20)) / (-8 - (-11))
b = (6) / (3)
b = 2

Now, let's see if this slope works for the other points:
Check with (-2, -2):
Expected output with slope 2: -2 = 2*(-2) + a
a = -2 - (-4)
a = 2

Check with (-7, -12) using a = 2 and b = 2:
Expected output: -12 = 2*(-7) + 2
-12 = -14 + 2
-12 = -12 (This fits)

Check with (-17, -32) using a = 2 and b = 2:
Expected output: -32 = 2*(-17) + 2
-32 = -34 + 2
-32 = -32 (This fits)

Since slope b = 2 and constant a = 2 work for all the provided points, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = 2x^0 + 2x^1

y = 2 + 2x

    To find a linear function that has the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to recognize that it actually simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

This is because \( x^0 = 1 \) (for all x except x=0) and \( x^1 = x \). Now, we are looking for the values of the constants \( a \) and \( b \) that best describe the data.

Given two data points, \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \), we can find the slope, \( b \), of the line by:

\[ b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

We can choose any two points to calculate \( b \). Let's use the points (-11, -20) and (-2, -2):

\[ b = \frac{-2 - (-20)}{-2 - (-11)} \]
\[ b = \frac{18}{9} \]
\[ b = 2 \]

Now we have \( b = 2 \), and we know our function looks like this so far: \( y = a + 2x \)

To solve for \( a \), we can plug the values of x and y from any of the given points into the equation. Let's use the point (-11, -20) again:

\[ -20 = a + 2(-11) \]
\[ -20 = a - 22 \]
\[ a = -20 + 22 \]
\[ a = 2 \]

Thus, our function is:

    Given the inputs and outputs, it appears that for every one unit change in the input (x), the output (y) changes consistently based on the differences between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's determine the values of 'a' and 'b' that fit the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Firstly, ax^0 = a, as anything raised to the power of 0 equals 1.

Next, we need to find the value for 'b'. To do this, we can use two points to determine the slope of the line, which will be 'b' since the expression is linear.

Let's use the first two points (-11, -20) and (-8, -14) to calculate the slope (b):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-14 - (-20)) / (-8 - (-11))

Let's do it algebraically using the first two data points, \((-11, -20)\) and \((-8, -14)\). Plugging them in gives us:

For \((-11, -20)\): \( -20 = a + b(-11) \)

Given the symmetric input-output pairs for input -17 and 17, we can infer that the constant term a is likely to be -4, as both outputs are 4 units away from a multiple of 17 (17 * 18 = 306, so 302 is 4 less and -310 is 4 more).

We can then calculate the value of b by using the input-output pair (10, 176). The value 176 is the output when the input x is 10. Applying the prior assumption for a = -4 gives us the equation:

    To define a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we are essentially describing a straight line where ax^0 represents the y-intercept (a constant term) and bx^1 represents the slope times the input x.

Given that the relationship seems to be linear (the output increases as the input increases), we will use two input-output pairs to calculate the slope (b) and y-intercept (a) of the line.

Let's take two pairs of points for our calculations for simplicity. We can take (10, 176) and (12, 212). To find the slope (b), we use the formula:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Plugging the values in:

b = (212 - 176) / (12 - 10)
b = (36) / (2)
b = 18

Now that we have the slope, we need to find the y-intercept (a). We can use one of the points and the slope to solve for a:

302 - 176 = a + 17b - (a + 10b)
126 = 7b

Now solve for 'b':

(302) + (-310) = (a + 17b) + (a - 17b)
-8 = 2a

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us the value of a:
a = -4

Now, we plug the value of a back into one of the original equations to solve for b. We'll use equation 1):

302 = -4 + 17b
306 = 17b

Dividing both sides by 17 gives us the value of b:
b = 306 / 17
b = 18

Therefore, the function that describes the data is:

y = -4 + 18x

In the requested form (Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1), the function is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To describe the relationship between the inputs and outputs using a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can treat it as a linear equation:

y = a + bx

This is because x^0 is always 1 for any x except for x = 0 (which is not in our dataset), so we can rename 'a' as the constant term, and 'b' as the coefficient for the x term.

To determine the coefficients 'a' and 'b', we can plug in the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve the resulting system of equations. However, since multiple inputs have the same output, if our data is not erroneous, it suggests a periodic function or an error. Let's take two distinct pairs to attempt to solve for 'a' and 'b':

Using the pair Input: -16, Output: 297,
297 = a + b(-16)

Using the pair Input: 18, Output: -315,
-315 = a + b(18)

We now have a system of two equations:

1) 297 = a - 16b
2) -315 = a + 18b

By adding both equations (1) and (2), we can solve for 'a':

(297) + (-315) = (a - 16b) + (a + 18b)
-18 = 2a + 2b   (Note: since there was a mistake here, as adding 'a' to 'a' gives us 2a, not 2a + 2b; it should be just 2a. Thus, we need to re-calculate correctly.)

Now, to find 'b', we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

(297) - (-315) = (a - 16b) - (a + 18b)
612 = -34b

b = -612 / 34
b = -18

Now using the value of 'b' to find 'a' using equation (1):

297 = a - 16(-18)
297 = a + 288

a = 297 - 288
a = 9

Therefore, the linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given points is:

y = 9 - 18x

However, as the pairs (-16, 297) and (5, -81) do not fit this line, it indicates that either there is an error in the dataset, or that a different type of function (potentially non-linear or periodic) might be required to capture the true relationship between input and output.

Let's substitute these points into our equation.

For the input 18:
-315 = a + b(18)

For the input -16:
297 = a + b(-16)

Now, let's solve these two equations for 'a' and 'b'.

-315 = a + 18b ...(1)
297 = a - 16b  ...(2)

We can solve this system of equations by adding them:

-315 + 297 = a + 18b + a - 16b
-18 = 2a + 2b
-9 = a + b ...(3)

We can also subtract (2) from (1) to get:

-315 - 297 = a + 18b - (a - 16b)
-612 = 34b
b = -612 / 34
b = -18

Since we have multiple inputs and outputs, let's pick two pairs from the data provided to find the coefficients a and b:

We can use the pairs (-16, 297) and (18, -315). With these two points, we can set up the following system of equations:

For the input -16 and output 297:
297 = a - 16b ---(1)

-315 = a + 18b ---(2)

Now, let's solve this system of equations for a and b:

From equation (1):
a = 297 + 16b ---(3)

Now substituting a from equation (3) into equation (2):
-315 = (297 + 16b) + 18b
-315 = 297 + 34b
-315 - 297 = 34b
-612 = 34b
b = -612 / 34
b = -18

Now substitute the value of b back into equation (3) to solve for a:

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) and write it in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can use the given input-output pairs to derive the values of the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \).

Since \( ax^0 \) is essentially \( a \) (because any number to the power of 0 is 1), the equation simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Let's now consider two distinct input-output pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

Using the input-output pair (18, -315):

\( -315 = a + 18b \)     (1)

And using the input-output pair (-16, 297):

\( 297 = a - 16b \)     (2)

We now have two equations with two variables. Let's solve this system of equations:

From equation (2):

\( a = 297 + 16b \)     (3)

Substitute \( a \) from equation (3) into equation (1):

\( -315 = (297 + 16b) + 18b \)

Combine like terms:

\( -315 = 297 + 34b \)

Subtract 297 from both sides:

\( -612 = 34b \)

Divide both sides by 34:

\( b = -18 \)

Now that we have the value for \( b \), we can find \( a \) by substituting \( b \) into equation (3):

    To determine the function capturing the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we need to find constants 'a' and 'b' such that the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 fits the given data points. The term ax^0 is just 'a', because any number to the power of zero is one.

Lets first calculate the slope 'b' using two data points. We can pick (x1, y1) = (-18, -265) and (x2, y2) = (19, 253) for this calculation.

The formula for the slope (b) is:

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Plugging in our values, we get:

b = (253 - (-265)) / (19 - (-18))
b = (253 + 265) / (19 + 18)
b = 518 / 37
b = 14

Now, we need to determine the values of a and b that give us the best linear fit for the given data. Since the data points are in a straight line, we can pick any two points to determine the coefficients a and b.

Let's use the two points (x1, y1) = (-18, -265) and (x2, y2) = (19, 253) to create two equations:

1) y1 = a + b*x1 => -265 = a + b*(-18)
2) y2 = a + b*x2 => 253 = a + b*19

Let's solve this system of linear equations.

From 1):

253 = -265 + 18b + 19b

Given the data provided, we can set up a system of equations to solve for the values of a and b. Choosing two input-output pairs from the data, for example, (-18, -265) and (19, 253), we can form the following linear equations:

For input -18:
-265 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)
-265 = a - 18b  ...(1)

For input 19:
253 = a(19)^0 + b(19)

Now, we can solve these two linear equations for a and b. Adding equations (1) and (2) to eliminate a, we get:

-265 + 253 = a - 18b + a + 19b
-12 = 2a + b

Since the b terms are eliminated, we solve for a:

a = (-12 - b)/2  ...(3)

Now if we calculate the value of a using another set of input-output pairs, say (-15, -223) and (6, 71), and form the linear equations:

-223 = a - 15b ...(4)
71 = a + 6b ...(5)

If we add these two equations and solve for a similarly, we'll find that the solution for a must be consistent if a and b are the same for the entire set of data.

Adding equations (4) and (5) to eliminate a:

-223 + 71 = a - 15b + a + 6b
-152 = 2a - 9b

Solving for a:

a = (-152 + 9b)/2  ...(6)

For a consistent solution a from both equations (3) and (6), we must get the same value. This implies that the same b value should satisfy both equations. Since we have a linear relationship, two points are enough to determine the line and thus the values of a and b. Let's solve the system given from equations (1) and (2):

1. When Input (x) is 0, Output (y) is -15, this gives us the equation: -15 = a(0^0) + b(0^1). This simplifies to:
-15 = a.

Now we know that a = -15.

2. Let's use the next point to find b:
When Input (x) is -5, Output (y) is -35, this gives us the equation: -35 = -15(-5^0) + b(-5^1). Simplifying this we get:
-35 = -15 - 5b.

Now, to find b, we can add 15 to both sides:
-35 + 15 = -5b,
-20 = -5b.

Dividing both sides by -5 gives us:
b = 4.

Now we have a and b:
a = -15,
b = 4.

So, the function that describes the data is:
y = -15x^0 + 4x^1.

Simplified, this function is:
y = -15 + 4x.

    To find a function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that fits the given data points, we need to determine the values of a and b that result in a line (since this is the equation of a line) that closely fits the inputs and outputs we have.

The general form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is 1 for any value of x except for x = 0 (where the definition is more complex but conventionally taken as 1).

We have several data points:

1. When x = 0, y = -15. Substituting these values into the equation y = a + bx gives us -15 = a + b(0), which simplifies to a = -15.

2. When x = -5, y = -35. Substituting these into the equation y = a + bx gives us -35 = a + b(-5). We know a = -15, so it becomes -35 = -15 - 5b, and thus, -20 = -5b, so b = 4.

    To find a linear function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), we need to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) that make the function fit the given input-output pairs as closely as possible.

Given the data points:

1. \( (0, -15) \)
2. \( (-5, -35) \)
3. \( (-4, -31) \)
4. \( (5, 5) \)
5. \( (-12, -63) \)

We observe that when \( x = 0 \), \( y = -15 \), which implies that \( a = -15 \) because the term involving \( b \) will be multiplied by 0 and thus will not contribute to the output.

Let's try to determine the slope \( b \) by using two points, \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \), and then calculating:

\[ b = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Using the points \( (-5, -35) \) and \( (5, 5) \):

\[ b = \frac{5 - (-35)}{5 - (-5)} = \frac{40}{10} = 4 \]

Thus, \( a = -15 \) and \( b = 4 \), and our function is:

\[ y = -15 + 4x \]

This function fits exactly with the data points provided because each \( (x, y) \) pair satisfies the equation:

For \( x = 0 \): \( y = -15 + 4(0) = -15 \) (matches the given output)
For \( x = -5 \): \( y = -15 + 4(-5) = -15 - 20 = -35 \) (matches the given output)
For \( x = -4 \): \( y = -15 + 4(-4) = -15 - 16 = -31 \) (matches the given output)
For \( x = 5 \): \( y = -15 + 4(5) = -15 + 20 = 5 \) (matches the given output)
For \( x = -12 \): \( y = -15 + 4(-12) = -15 - 48 = -63 \) (matches the given output)

    To write a function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we know that \( x^0 \) is always 1 for any x not equal to 0, thus the term \( ax^0 \) becomes a constant value a. The term \( bx^1 \) is just bx, because anything raised to the power of 1 is itself.

Given this form, we have:

\( y = a + bx \)

We need to solve for the constants a and b. We can use two of the given data points to do this. Let's use (9, 133) and (-14, -212):

1. When input x = 9, output y = 133:

\( 133 = a + b(9) \)

2. When input x = -14, output y = -212:

\( -212 = a + b(-14) \)

We can now solve this system of linear equations for a and b. Let's rearrange the equations to isolate a:

1. \( a = 133 - 9b \)

2. \( a = -212 + 14b \)

Setting both expressions for a equal to each other gives us:

\( 133 - 9b = -212 + 14b \)

Combining like terms, we have:

\( 345 = 23b \)

Dividing by 23, we have:

\( b = 15 \)

Now, we can substitute b back into one of the equations to solve for a. Let's use \( a = 133 - 9b \):

1. \( 133 = a + 9b \) ... equation (1)

Using the input-output pair (-14, -212):
2. \( -212 = a - 14b \) ... equation (2)

Now we will solve this system of equations for \( a \) and \( b \):

Equation (1) can be rewritten as: \( a = 133 - 9b \) ... equation (3)

Substitute equation (3) into equation (2):
\( -212 = (133 - 9b) - 14b \)
\( -212 = 133 - 9b - 14b \)
\( -212 = 133 - 23b \)
\( -212 - 133 = -23b \)

We can use two data points to form a system of equations that will allow us to solve for a and b. It's easier to choose the input-output pairs that involve positive numbers, so let's take the pairs (9, 133) and (19, 283).

From these two points, we get the following equations:

1) For the input 9:
133 = a + 9b

2) For the input 19:
283 = a + 19b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Using Equation (1) we get:
a = 133 - 9b

Plugging this expression for a into Equation (2):
283 = (133 - 9b) + 19b
283 = 133 + 10b

To determine the constants a and b, we can use two of the given points to set up a system of linear equations. Let's use the points (9, 133) and (-14, -212).

Plugging in the point (9, 133):
y = a * 9^0 + b * 9
133 = a * 1 + b * 9

Plugging in the point (-14, -212):
y = a * (-14)^0 + b * (-14)
-212 = a * 1 + b * (-14)
-212 = a - 14b ...................(2)

Now we have a system of equations (1) and (2):
133 = a + 9b
-212 = a - 14b

We can solve for a and b using these equations. Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a.

133 + 212 = 23b

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we need to understand that ax^0 is a constant because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Using any two of these equations, we can solve for 'a' and 'b'. For simplicity, let's use equations 1 and 4:

From equation 1: a + 9b = 133  (i)
From equation 4: a - 14b = -212 (ii)

Now subtract equation (ii) from (i):

( a + 9b) - (a - 14b) = 133 - (-212)
a + 9b - a + 14b = 345

    To derive the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can notice that \( x^0 \) is always 1, so this term represents a constant (the y-intercept of the line). The term \( bx^1 \) is a standard linear term with b representing the slope of the line.

Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we essentially have the coordinates (x, y) as follows:
(2, 59), (-16, -301), (-5, -81), (3, 79), (-2, -21).

We need to find the constants a (y-intercept) and b (slope) that satisfy these points. Because the problem only provides us with finite points, and we are looking to fit the data into a linear form, we can't guarantee a perfect solution if the data isn't perfectly linear. However, assuming the possibility of noise or error, we aim to find the best fit.

We can use two points to solve for a and b using the linear equation:
\( y = a + bx \).

Picking two points to create a system of equations:

Using points (2, 59) and (-16, -301)
For (2, 59):
\( 59 = a + 2b \) (1)

For (-16, -301):
\( -301 = a - 16b \) (2)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns.

We can solve this system by multiplying equation (1) by 8 to eliminate variable a:
\( 472 = 8a + 16b \) (3)

Then, add equation (3) to equation (2):
\( -301 = a - 16b \)
\( 472 = 8a + 16b \)
-------------------
\( 171 = 9a \)

Solving for a:
\( a = 171 / 9 \)
\( a = 19 \)

Now we plug a back into equation (1) to solve for b:
\( 59 = a + 2b \)
\( 59 = 19 + 2b \)

1. \( 59 = a \cdot 2^0 + b \cdot 2 \)
2. \( -21 = a \cdot (-2)^0 + b \cdot (-2) \)

From 1, since 2^0 is 1, we get:
\( 59 = a + 2b \) ...(Equation 1)

From 2, since (-2)^0 is also 1, we get:
\( -21 = a - 2b \) ...(Equation 2)

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find a and b.

Add Equation 1 and Equation 2:

Now we have a system of linear equations:

Let's solve this system for a and b. Subtract the second equation from the first:

\[ a + 2b - a + 16b = 59 + 301 \]

Therefore, our function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

The value of \( b \) can be derived from looking at the other given points, specifically considering \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 2 \) where the change in \( x \) is 1:

Input: 2
Output: 59

Input: 3
Output: 79

The change in output for an increase of 1 in input is:

\( 79 - 59 = b \times (3 - 2) \)
\( b = 79 - 59 \)
\( b = 20 \)

So our \( b \) value is 20.

Now we need to determine the value of \( a \). The constant \( a \) can be derived from any of the provided points. Let's use the point (2, 59) since we now know \( b \):

Output: 59
Input: 2

\( y = a + bx \)
\( 59 = a + 20 \cdot 2 \)
\( 59 = a + 40 \)
\( a = 59 - 40 \)
\( a = 19 \)

Therefore, the function that relates the given inputs to outputs is:

\( y = 19 + 20x \)

    Given a dataset with inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can try to find the coefficients a and b in the linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx, since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1.

We will use two data points from the provided data to calculate the coefficients a and b.

Let's take (x1, y1) = (2, 59) and (x2, y2) = (-16, -301) as our two points.

Using the equation y = a + bx, we can set up a system of linear equations with these two points:

For (2, 59):
59 = a + 2b    (1)

For (-16, -301):
-301 = a - 16b  (2)

Now, let's solve this system for a and b.

Multiply equation (1) by 8 to eliminate a:

472 = 8a + 16b   (3)

Now add equation (3) to equation (2):

-301 + 472 = (8a + a) + (16b - 16b)
171 = 9a
a = 171 / 9
a = 19

Now we can use the value of a to solve for b. Let's use equation (1):

59 = 19 + 2b
40 = 2b
b = 20

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To find a function of the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \) that describes the given input-output relationship, we need to determine the values of the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \).

Given that \( ax^0 \) is effectively \( a \) because \( x^0 \) is 1 for any \( x \) other than 0, and \( bx^1 \) is just \( bx \), we can rewrite the function in its simplest form as:
\[ y = a + bx \]

Using the two of the provided input-output pairs, we can create a system of equations to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let’s pick (13, 55) and (-20, -44):

For input 13 and output 55:
\[ 55 = a + b(13) \]
\[ a + 13b = 55 \]

For input -20 and output -44:
\[ -44 = a + b(-20) \]
\[ a - 20b = -44 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1) \( a + 13b = 55 \)
2) \( a - 20b = -44 \)

Let’s solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we'll use elimination:

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate \( a \):
\[ (a + 13b) - (a - 20b) = 55 - (-44) \]
\[ a + 13b - a + 20b = 55 + 44 \]
\[ 33b = 99 \]
\[ b = 99 / 33 \]
\[ b = 3 \]

Now solve for \( a \) using the value of \( b \) in either equation 1 or 2. We'll use equation 1:
\[ a + 13b = 55 \]
\[ a + 13(3) = 55 \]
\[ a + 39 = 55 \]
\[ a = 55 - 39 \]
\[ a = 16 \]

    To find a function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\) that describes the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we first recognize that \(ax^0\) is simply \(a\), since \(x^0 = 1\) for any value of \(x\) that is not zero. Thus, the function simplifies to \(y = a + bx\).

We need to determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) that allow this function to produce the outputs associated with the given inputs.

Given the data points:
- (13, 55)
- (-20, -44)
- (15, 61)
- (-1, 13)
- (-14, -26)

We can set up two equations using two of the data points to solve for \(a\) and \(b\).

Let's use the points (13, 55) and (-20, -44) to set up a system of equations:

For the input 13 and output 55:  
\(55 = a + 13b\)

For the input -20 and output -44:  
\(-44 = a - 20b\)

Now we have a system of two linear equations:
1. \(a + 13b = 55\)
2. \(a - 20b = -44\)

To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply equation (1) by 20 and equation (2) by 13 to eliminate \(a\):
1. \(20a + 260b = 1100\)
2. \(13a - 260b = -572\)

Add equation (1) and equation (2):
\(33a = 528\)

Divide both sides by 33 to solve for \(a\):
\(a = 528 / 33\)
\(a = 16\)

Now that we have \(a\), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for \(b\). Use equation (1):

\(55 = 16 + 13b\)  
\(39 = 13b\)  
\(b = 39 / 13\)

    To find a function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we need to identify the constants a and b since ax^0 = a (because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 = bx (because any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself). This simplifies our function to y = a + bx.

We can use any two pairs of inputs and outputs from the provided data to set up a system of equations and solve for a and b. For this example, we'll pick (x = 13, y = 55) and (x = -20, y = -44).

Now we have two equations:
1) 55 = a + 13b
2) -44 = a - 20b

Let's solve the system of equations for a and b:

From equation 1:
55 = a + 13b
a = 55 - 13b

Now substitute a into equation 2:
-44 = (55 - 13b) - 20b
-44 = 55 - 13b - 20b
-44 = 55 - 33b
-44 - 55 = -33b
-99 = -33b

Dividing both sides by -33 gives us b:
b = 3

Now that we have b, we can substitute back into the equation for a:
a = 55 - 13b
a = 55 - 13(3)
a = 55 - 39
a = 16

So our function y = a + bx is:

Given the pairs:
1. (13, 55)
2. (-20, -44)
3. (15, 61)
4. (-1, 13)
5. (-14, -26)

We can use two of the points to solve for a and b. Let's use points (13, 55) and (-20, -44).

So, from these points, we get two equations:
1. 55 = a + 13b (Using point 1)
2. -44 = a - 20b (Using point 2)

Let's solve for a and b using these two equations:

From equation 1, we get:
a = 55 - 13b

Substituting this value of a into equation 2, we get:
-44 = (55 - 13b) - 20b
-44 = 55 - 13b - 20b
-44 = 55 - 33b
-99 = -33b
b = 3

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that describes the relationship between the given inputs (x) and outputs (y), we need to determine the values of 'a' and 'b'.

Given this form is essentially the equation of a straight line y = b0 + b1*x where b0 is the y-intercept (a) and b1 is the slope (b).

Let's take two pairs of input-output points to calculate the slope (b):

Using the points (13, 55) and (-20, -44):

b = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = (-44 - 55) / (-20 - 13)
b = (-99) / (-33)
b = 3

Now we know that b = 3. To find a (the y-intercept), we can use the point (13, 55) and plug in the values:

    To find a linear function that describes the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y), we need to find the coefficients a and b for the equation:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

Since ax^0 is always a (because anything to the power of 0 is 1), the equation simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We have multiple inputs and outputs, so let's take a pair of inputs and solve for a and b. We can use the input-output pairs (-11, 72) and (18, -160) to set up two equations:

1) 72 = a + b(-11)
2) -160 = a + b(18)

Solving these two equations simultaneously will give us the values for a and b:

From equation 1:
72 = a - 11b
=> a = 72 + 11b  (Equation 3)

Now, plug the value of a from equation 3 into equation 2:
-160 = (72 + 11b) + 18b
-160 = 72 + 29b
-160 - 72 = 29b
-232 = 29b
b = -232 / 29
b = -8

Now we can find a by substituting b back into equation 3:
a = 72 + 11(-8)
a = 72 - 88
a = -16

y = -16 + (-8)x

    The function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, essentially describes a linear relationship between input (x) and output (y), which can be rewritten in more familiar terms as:

y = a + bx

Let's use the provided input-output pairs to determine the values of coefficients 'a' and 'b'.

For the input -11 and output 72:

72 = a - 11b

For the input -3 and output 8:

8 = a - 3b

For the input -2 and output 0:

0 = a - 2b

For the input 18 and output -160:

-160 = a + 18b

For the input -7 and output 40:

40 = a - 7b

To find the coefficients 'a' and 'b', we typically would need to solve this system of equations. However, since this is a system of five equations with only two unknowns, and it's derived from empirical data, it might not have an exact solution (overdetermined system). In such cases, we use methods like least squares to find an approximate solution that minimizes the error over all points.

But to continue with this exercise and to find an exact solution for 'a' and 'b', let's assume that we can disregard some points or that there was some measurement error that can be corrected by focusing on two of the given points to find an exact linear relationship.

If we consider the points (-2, 0) and (-3, 8), we can form the following two equations:

0 = a - 2b
8 = a - 3b

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:

-8 = 1b

b = -8

Now, we substitute b back into one of the equations to find 'a':

0 = a - 2(-8)
0 = a + 16
a = -16

Thus, if these two points are to be used to define a linear relationship, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is:

y = -16 + (-8)x

or

y = -16 - 8x

To find the values for a and b, we can use the given input-output pairs as a system of linear equations. Let's use two points to solve for the coefficients a and b.

We'll choose the following two input-output pairs to construct our system of equations:

1. For the input x = -11, the output y = 72:

y = a + bx
72 = a + b(-11)

2. For the input x = 18, the output y = -160:

y = a + bx
-160 = a + b(18)

Now, let's set up the system of equations:

72 = a - 11b
-160 = a + 18b

Next, we'll solve the system for a and b. We can use various methods, such as substitution or elimination. Here, the elimination method can be applied quickly:

Starting with the above equations, let's add them together to eliminate a:

72 + (-160) = a - 11b + a + 18b
-88 = 2a + 7b

Now we have:

-88/2 = a + 7b/2
-44 = a + (7/2)b

We still need another equation to solve for a and b uniquely. Let's subtract the second equation from the first one:

72 - (-160) = a - 11b - (a + 18b)
232 = -29b

Divide both sides by -29:

232 / -29 = b
b = -8

Now that we have b, we can solve for a using either equation. Let's use the first one:

72 = a - 11(-8)

a = 72 - 88
a = -16

We will need to solve for a and b using the given input-output pairs. Let's use two of the pairs to set up a system of linear equations.

Let's use the input-output pairs (-11, 72) and (18, -160). This gives us two equations:

1. \( 72 = a + b(-11) \)
2. \( -160 = a + b(18) \)

Now, let's solve this system of equations for a and b:

From the first equation, we can express a in terms of b:
\( a = 72 + 11b \) (Equation 3)

Now let's substitute \( a \) from Equation 3 into the second equation:
\( -160 = (72 + 11b) + 18b \)
\( -160 = 72 + 11b + 18b \)
\( -160 = 72 + 29b \)
\( -160 - 72 = 29b \)
\( -232 = 29b \)
\( b = -232 / 29 \)
\( b = -8 \)

Now that we have the value for b, let's solve for a using Equation 3:

y = a + bx

We have pairs of x (input) and y (output) values. We can use two of these pairs to set up a system of linear equations to solve for a and b. Let's use the pairs (-11, 72) and (-3, 8):

1) Using input -11 and output 72:
72 = a + b(-11)

2) Using input -3 and output 8:
8 = a + b(-3)

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) 72 = a - 11b
2) 8 = a - 3b

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Multiply the second equation by 3 to align the coefficients of b:

3(8) = 3(a) - 3(3b)
24 = 3a - 9b

Now let's subtract the second equation from the first:

72 - 24 = (a - 3a) - (11b - 9b)
48 = -2a - 2b

Simplifying:

48 = -2a - 2b
24 = -a - b       (dividing both sides by 2)

Let's add this new equation to equation (2):

24 = -a - b
8 = a - 3b
----------------
32 = -4b

Divide both sides by -4 to solve for b:

b = -8

Now we can use either equation 1 or 2 to solve for a. Let's use equation 2:

-204 = a + b(11)        (1)

From the second pair (-4, 66):
66 = a + b(-4)          (2)

Now we have a system of linear equations. We can solve for a and b using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.

First, let's multiply equation (2) by 11 to eliminate a:
66*11 = 11a + b(-4)*11
726 = 11a - 44b         (3)

Now, add equation (1) to equation (3) to eliminate a:
-204 + 726 = a + 11a + 11b - 44b
522 = 12a - 33b

Now we can solve for a by expressing it in terms of b:
a = (522 + 33b)/12

To find the exact values of a and b, we need to solve the system of equations (1) and (2) simultaneously. Let's substitute the expression for a from equation (3) into equation (1):

-204 = (522 + 33b)/12 + 11b
-204 = 43.5 + (33/12)b + 11b
-204 - 43.5 = (33/12)b + 11b
-247.5 = (33/12 + 132/12)b
-247.5 = (165/12)b

Now solving for b:
b = (-247.5) / (165/12)
b = (-247.5 * 12) / 165
b = -2970 / 165
b = -18

With the value of b, we can solve for a using equation (1) or (2). Let's use equation (1):

-204 = a + 11(-18)
-204 = a - 198
a = -204 + 198
a = -6

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -6x^0 - 18x^1
or simply
y = -6 - 18x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Let's find the constants `a` and `b` for the given form:

y = ax^0 + bx^1

This simplifies to:

y = a + bx   (since x^0 is always 1)

We have 5 data pairs to work with, let's substitute a pair to create a set of equations:

For Input 11, Output -204:
-204 = a + b * 11

For Input -4, Output 66:
66 = a + b * (-4)

We now have two equations with two variables:

-204 = a + 11b   ...(1)
66 = a - 4b      ...(2)

We can solve for `a` and `b` by using these two equations. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiply equation (2) by 11:

726 = 11a - 44b   ...(3)

Now, add equation (1) to equation (3):

-204 = a + 11b
726 = 11a - 44b
-----------
522 = 12a - 33b

Next, let's multiply equation (1) by 3:

-612 = 3a + 33b   ...(4)

And add equation (4) to the multiplied result of equation (2): 

522 = 12a - 33b
-612 = 3a + 33b
----------------
-90 = 15a

Now we can solve for a:

a = -90 / 15
a = -6

Now, substitute 'a' back into either equation (1) or (2) (I'll use equation (2)):

66 = -6 - 4b

Solve for 'b':

4b = -6 - 66
4b = -72
b = -72 / 4
b = -18

So, the function is:

y = -6 + (-18)x

Or, in the exact requested form:

    ","To find the output for the input -3 using the function y = -6 - 18x, we substitute x with -3:

y = 48

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the given data points, we need to solve for the coefficients a and b. The form y = ax^0 + bx^1 simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 = 1 for any non-zero x.

Here are the given data points:

1. (x1, y1) = (11, -204)
2. (x2, y2) = (-4, 66)
3. (x3, y3) = (-17, 300)
4. (x4, y4) = (-15, 264)
5. (x5, y5) = (20, -366)

We need to find the values of a and b such that the equations a + b * xi = yi are true for i=1 to 5.

This forms a system of linear equations:
a + b*11 = -204
a + b*(-4) = 66
a + b*(-17) = 300
a + b*(-15) = 264
a + b*20 = -366

We only need two points to find a linear function, but since we have more than two, we'll need to find a solution that provides the best fit for all data points. Usually, this would involve linear regression, but for the sake of finding an exact fit to the function, let's use two points to set up two equations to solve for a and b:

Using points (11, -204) and (-4, 66), we have:
a + 11b = -204 (equation 1)
a - 4b = 66 (equation 2)

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1 gives:
15b = -270
b = -270 / 15
b = -18

Then we use the value of b to find a using either of the original equations; let's use equation 2.
a - 4(-18) = 66
a + 72 = 66
a = 66 - 72
a = -6

Therefore, the function that we derive from these two points is:
y = -6 + (-18)x

Please note that this function is a simplistic linear model and may not fit all points perfectly because we only used two points to determine it. Normally, one would use a method like least-squares regression for the best fit to all points, which could result in a different model that minimizes the error for all the given data points. However, since the request was to produce a function in the exact form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 using the data provided, the simplified model is y = -6 - 18x.

    To find a function that best describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we can identify that `ax^0` is effectively `a` (because any number to the power of zero is 1), and `bx^1` is simply `bx`. So the function simplifies to:

y = a + bx

We have a system of equations based on the given input-output pairs:

For input 11, output -204:
-204 = a + b(11)

For input -4, output 66:
66 = a + b(-4)

For input -17, output 300:
300 = a + b(-17)

For input -15, output 264:
264 = a + b(-15)

For input 20, output -366:
-366 = a + b(20)

To solve for `a` and `b`, we can use two of these equations to create a system of linear equations and solve for the variables. Let’s use the first two for simplicity:

1) -204 = a + 11b
2) 66 = a - 4b

Now we will solve the system of equations for `a` and `b`:

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

-204 - 66 = a + 11b - (a - 4b)
-270 = 15b
b = -270 / 15
b = -18

Now substitute `b` back into equation 2 to solve for `a`:

66 = a - 4(-18)
66 = a + 72
a = 66 - 72
a = -6

So the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -6 + (-18)x

Therefore, the output is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to understand that ax^0 is simply a (since any number to the zero power is 1), and bx^1 is just bx (because any number to the first power is itself). So, the function we're looking for simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given multiple inputs (x) and outputs (y), we can create a system of equations and solve for the coefficients a and b. Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve the system.

Using the given data points:

For Input: -4, Output: 66, plug into y = a + bx to get
66 = a - 4b  ...(1)

For Input: 20, Output: -366, plug into y = a + bx to get
-366 = a + 20b ...(2)

Now we will solve this system of linear equations.

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

-366 - 66 = a + 20b - (a - 4b)
-432 = 24b
b = -432 / 24
b = -18

Now plug the value of b into either equation (1) or (2). We'll use equation (1):

66 = a - 4(-18)
66 = a + 72
a = 66 - 72
a = -6

    To devise a function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the given input-output relationship, we can recognize that this is a linear function (because of the x^1 term) with an intercept (x^0, which is always 1, represents the constant term in a linear equation).

Thus, the function can be written as:

y = a + bx

Where:
- a is the y-intercept of the function.
- b is the slope of the line.

We need to find the best values for 'a' and 'b' that fit the provided data points. With two parameters to determine and five data points, we can attempt to solve this problem using a simple linear regression approach or by selecting two of the data points and solving the resulting system of equations.

Let's choose two data points to solve for 'a' and 'b'. We can use the first and the second data points to set up our system of equations:

1. 9 = a - 12b
2. -55 = a + 20b

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously. Multiply the first equation by 20 and the second by 12 to eliminate 'a':

1. 20 * 9 = 20a - 240b => 180 = 20a - 240b
2. 12 * -55 = 12a + 240b => -660 = 12a + 240b

Add the two equations together:

180 - 660 = 20a - 240b + 12a + 240b
-480 = 32a

Solve for 'a':

a = -480 / 32
a = -15

Now, substitute 'a' back into one of the original equations to solve for 'b'. Let's use the first equation:

9 = -15 - 12b

Add 15 to both sides:

24 = -12b

Solve for 'b':

b = -2

Now we have found 'a' and 'b'. Thus, the function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    To determine the parameters a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can use two of the given input-output pairs to form a system of equations, since x^0 is 1 for any x. Let us use the input-output pairs (-12, 9) and (20, -55):

For the input -12 and output 9:
9 = a(1) + b(-12)
9 = a - 12b  (1)

For the input 20 and output -55:
-55 = a(1) + b(20)
-55 = a + 20b  (2)

Now we have a system of two equations:
(1) 9 = a - 12b
(2) -55 = a + 20b

We can solve this system by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate a:

(-55) - 9 = (a + 20b) - (a - 12b)
-64 = 32b
b = -64 / 32
b = -2

To determine the coefficient \( b \), which is the slope of the line, we can take two points and use the slope formula:

Now, I'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a:

This function is essentially a linear function of the form \(y = a + bx\), where \(a\) is the y-intercept and \(b\) is the slope of the line.

We can use two points to determine the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\). Let's use the first two points, \((-12, 9)\) and \((20, -55)\), for this purpose. We’ll set up a system of equations.

Using the first point (-12, 9):

    To find a function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1 that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs provided, we can interpret ax^0 as a constant term (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1) and bx^1 as simply bx (since any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself). Thus, the function we are looking for is actually of the form y = a + bx.

Now, we need to determine the constants a and b that fit the data points provided. We can start this process by setting up two equations using two of the given points and then solve for a and b.

Let's use the following two points for this process: (-16, 82) and (14, -98).

From the point (-16, 82), we have:
82 = a + b(-16) ... (equation 1)

From the point (14, -98), we have:

Let's solve the system of equations. We can start by using the method of elimination or substitution. Here, elimination can be straightforward. We can add equation (1) to equation (2) to eliminate a:

82 + (-98) = (a - 16b) + (a + 14b)
-16 = 2a - 2b

Divide by 2:
-8 = a - b

Now let's rearrange equation (1) to isolate a:

a = 82 + 16b ... (equation 3)

Substitute equation 3 into our new equation:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find a function of the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\) that describes the data, we can simplify the expression knowing that \(x^0 = 1\) for any non-zero \(x\), hence the function can be rewritten to \(y = a + bx\).

To determine the constants \(a\) and \(b\), we can use any pair of input and output values to solve the system of linear equations. Let's take the pairs \((-16, 82)\) and \((14, -98)\) to set up a system:

1. \(82 = a - 16b\)
2. \(-98 = a + 14b\)

Now let's solve this system of equations for \(a\) and \(b\).

From Equation (1):
\(a = 82 + 16b\)

Now plug \(a\) into Equation (2):
\(-98 = (82 + 16b) + 14b\)
\(-98 = 82 + 16b + 14b\)
\(-98 = 82 + 30b\)
\(-98 - 82 = 30b\)
\(-180 = 30b\)
\(b = -180 / 30\)
\(b = -6\)

Now solve for \(a\) using the value of \(b\):
\(a = 82 + 16(-6)\)
\(a = 82 - 96\)
\(a = -14\)

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between input \(x\) and output \(y\) is:

\(y = -14 + (-6)x\)
\(y = -14 - 6x\)

    Given the inputs and outputs, we want to find a linear relationship of the form:

\[ y = ax^0 + bx^1 \]

which simplifies to:

\[ y = a + bx \]

since \( x^0 = 1 \) for any x that isn't zero.

We are given a set of points that we can use to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \). The points are:
(-16, 82), (-11, 52), (14, -98), (-18, 94), and (3, -32).

To find \( a \) and \( b \), two points are generally enough. Let's use the first two points:

1. For point (-16, 82):
\[ 82 = a - 16b \]

2. For point (-11, 52):
\[ 52 = a - 11b \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
a - 16b & = 82 \\
a - 11b & = 52
\end{align*}
\]

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

\[
\begin(-16b - (-11b) &= 82 - 52 \\
-5b &= 30 \\
b &= -6
\end)

Now we substitute \( b = -6 \) into one of the original equations to solve for \( a \):

\[ a - 16(-6) = 82 \]
\[ a + 96 = 82 \]

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 that best describes the relationship between the given inputs and outputs, we can recognize this as a linear relationship since ax^0 is a constant (because any number to the power of 0 is 1), and bx^1 is simply bx, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the line.

We can set up the two equations using two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for a and b:

For input -16 and output 82:
82 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)
82 = a + b(-16)
82 = a - 16b    ... (1)

For input 3 and output -32:
-32 = a(3)^0 + b(3)
-32 = a + b(3)
-32 = a + 3b    ... (2)

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

1) 82 = a - 16b
2) -32 = a + 3b

We can solve these two equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

Add the two equations:
(82) + (-32) = (a - 16b) + (a + 3b)
50 = 2a - 13b

Divide by 2:
25 = a - 6.5b    ... (3)

Now we have two equations, one with only a and b (3), and the other one with a and b that we can use to solve for b (2):

-32 = a + 3b
25 = a - 6.5b

Solve for a from equation (3):
a = 25 + 6.5b

Substitute a in equation (2):
-32 = (25 + 6.5b) + 3b
-32 = 25 + 9.5b
-32 - 25 = 9.5b
-57 = 9.5b
b = -57 / 9.5
b = -6

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into equation (3) to solve for a:
25 = a - 6.5(-6)
25 = a + 39
a = 25 - 39
a = -14

    First, we will translate the provided function template y = ax^0 + bx^1 into a more familiar linear equation form which is y = a + bx. The term ax^0 is equivalent to a since anything raised to the power of 0 is 1.

Now we have a set of input (x) and output (y) pairs: (-16, 82), (-11, 52), (14, -98), (-18, 94), (3, -32). To find the values of a and b that best fit these pairs, we can use two of these points to derive a system of linear equations and solve for a and b.

Using (-16, 82) and (14, -98), let's set up two equations in the form of y = a + bx:

For x = -16, y = 82:
82 = a + b(-16) => 82 = a - 16b —— (1)

For x = 14, y = -98:
-98 = a + b(14) => -98 = a + 14b —— (2)

Now, to solve for a and b, we can use linear algebraic methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations. Let's use the elimination method to subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:

82 - (-98) = (a - 16b) - (a + 14b)
180 = -30b
b = -6

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into either equation to solve for a. Let's use equation (1):

82 = a - 16(-6)
82 = a + 96
a = 82 - 96
a = -14

Now we have values for a and b:

a = -14

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can interpret it as y = a + bx, since x^0 is just 1.

We have several points to work with:

1. When x = -18, y = -75.
2. When x = -1, y = -7.
3. When x = 3, y = 9.
4. When x = 2, y = 5.

We need to find the constants a and b such that these equations hold true for the given points. We can set up two equations using two of the given points and solve for a and b.

Let's take the points (x = -1, y = -7) and (x = 2, y = 5) to set up our two equations:

For x = -1, y = -7: -7 = a + b(-1) --> Equation (1)
For x = 2, y = 5: 5 = a + b(2) --> Equation (2)

Now we will solve these two equations simultaneously.

Equation (1) becomes:
-7 = a - b (1)

Equation (2) becomes:
5 = a + 2b (2)

Add Equation (1) and Equation (2) to eliminate b:
-7 + 5 = a - b + a + 2b
-2 = 2a + b
b = -2 - 2a (3)

Now we can use this value of b in one of the original equations to solve for a. Let's substitute equation (3) into the equation (2):

5 = a + 2(-2 - 2a)
5 = a - 4 - 4a
5 + 4 = -3a
9 = -3a
a = -3

To describe this in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 (which is equivalent to y = a + bx since x^0 = 1), we need to find the constants a and b that fit the data points best.

Let's take two points to solve for a and b:
Using the points (-1, -7) and (3, 9), we have two equations:

For (-1, -7):
-7 = a(1) + b(-1)  =>  -7 = a - b   (1)

For (3, 9):
9 = a(1) + b(3)  =>  9 = a + 3b   (2)

Now, we can solve this system of linear equations.

Let's add equations (1) and (2) together:

(-7 = a - b) + (9 = a + 3b)
-7 + 9 = a - b + a + 3b
2 = 2a + 2b
Divide both sides by 2:
1 = a + b   (3)

Now, let's substitute equation (3) back into equation (1):

-7 = a - b  
-7 = (1 - b) - b
-7 = 1 - 2b

b = 4

    To determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \) in the function \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we need to understand that \( x^0 \) is always 1, and \( x^1\) is simply \( x \). With this in mind, the function simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Let's use two data points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

Using the input-output pair \( (x, y) = (-1, -7) \):
\[ -7 = a + b(-1) \]
\[ -7 = a - b \] ... [1]

And using the input-output pair \( (x, y) = (3, 9) \):

\[ 9 = a + 3b \] ... [2]

Now, we have a system of two equations which we can solve simultaneously. By adding equations [1] and [2], we can eliminate \( a \) and solve for \( b \):

\[ (-7) + 9 = (a - b) + (a + 3b) \]
\[ 2 = 2a + 2b \]
\[ 1 = a + b \] ... [3]

Now, we use equation [1] to substitute for \( a \) in terms of \( b \):

\[ -7 = a - b \]
\[ -7 + b = a \] ... [4]

Substitute [4] into [3]:

\[ 1 = (-7 + b) + b \]
\[ 1 = -7 + 2b \]
\[ 8 = 2b \]
\[ b = 4 \]

For example, we can choose the input-output pairs (x = -1, y = -7) and (x = 2, y = 5) to set up the following equations:

1. When x = -1, y = -7:

-7 = a - b

3. When x = -11, y = -79
4. When x = -5, y = -25
5. When x = -10, y = -70

By observation:

- Increasing x by 1 increases the output by 10, suggesting that b might be 10.
- However, when x is negative, the output seems to be 1 less than -7 times x (e.g., for x = -5, y = 35 – 1 = 34).
- For positive x, the output is 10x + 1.

We can test this hypothesis with the following equations:

Positive x:
x = 6 → y = 10(6) + 1 = 60 + 1 = 61 (but we know the output should be 74; thus the hypothesis does not hold for positive x)

Negative x:
x = -5 → y = -7(-5) - 1 = 35 - 1 = 34 (but the output should be -25)

It seems our initial hypothesis does not perfectly fit the data. Upon closer inspection, though, we can notice a pattern that actually fits both positive and negative x:

y = 10x + 4

Let’s now check the formula against all provided data points:

For x = 6:
y = 10(6) + 4 = 60 + 4 = 64 (this does not fit the output of 74)

For x = 19:
y = 10(19) + 4 = 190 + 4 = 194 (this does not fit the output of 191)

So the initial general observation does not hold.

Let's attempt this differently. We look for a pattern that perfectly fits the provided data, by considering the output when x = 0, which must be the constant term (a):

From the pairs given and the expected function form y = a + bx, we can already disregard our initial attempt and try a systematic approach to solve for a and b using two input-output pairs. Let's use (6, 74) and (-11, -79):

For x = 6,       y = 74:        74 = a + b(6)
For x = -11,   y = -79:     -79 = a + b(-11)

This system of equations can be solved to find the values of a and b:

For the first equation:
74 = a + 6b

For the second equation:
-79 = a - 11b

Now we'll solve the system of two equations with two unknowns:

Multiplying the second equation by 1 to prepare for elimination:
-79 = a - 11b

Adding the first and second equations together to eliminate a:
74 - 79 = (a + 6b) + (a - 11b)
-5 = 2a - 5b

Now we can divide the whole equation by 2 to isolate a:
-5 / 2 = a - (5b / 2)
a = (5b / 2) - (5 / 2)

Now we have an expression for a in terms of b. To find the exact values, let's take the expression for a and plug it into one of the original equations:

74 = ((5b / 2) - (5 / 2)) + 6b
74 = (5b / 2) - (5 / 2) + (12b / 2)
74 = (17b / 2) - (5 / 2)

Now, isolate b:
74 + (5 / 2) = (17b / 2)
(148 / 2) + (5 / 2) = (17b / 2)
153 / 2 = (17b / 2)

Multiply both sides by 2/17 to solve for b:
b = 153 / 17
b = 9

Now we can substitute this value for b back into the equation for a:

a = (5 * 9) / 2 - (5 / 2)
a = (45 / 2) - (5 / 2)
a = 40 / 2
a = 20

Thus, our function should be y = 20 + 9x, which can be tested against all provided data points, and can be rewritten in the demanded format as:

y = 20x^0 + 9x^1

Testing the function with all given inputs:

For x = 6:     y = 20 + 9(6) = 20 + 54 = 74 (matches output)
For x = 19:   y = 20 + 9(19) = 20 + 171 = 191 (matches output)
For x = -11: y = 20 + 9(-11) = 20 - 99 = -79 (matches output)
For x = -5:   y = 20 + 9(-5) = 20 - 45 = -25 (matches output)
For x = -10: y = 20 + 9(-10) = 20 - 90 = -70 (matches output)

The function y = 20x^0 + 9x^1 correctly describes the relationship between the given inputs and outputs.

    To develop a function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which is essentially y = a + bx since x^0 equals 1, we need to find a and b that fit the input-output pairs provided.

Let's take 2 input-output pairs to form a system of equations and solve for a and b.

Using the input-output pairs (6, 74) and (19, 191), we have:

1. When x = 6, y = 74, so 74 = a + 6b
2. When x = 19, y = 191, so 191 = a + 19b

Let's solve this system of linear equations for a and b.

From equation (1): a = 74 - 6b (3)

Substitute equation (3) into equation (2):

191 = (74 - 6b) + 19b
191 = 74 + 13b
117 = 13b
b = 117 / 13
b = 9

Now that we have b, use equation (3) to find a:

a = 74 - 6b
a = 74 - 6(9)
a = 74 - 54
a = 20

Therefore, our function should be:
y = 20 + 9x

To validate, let’s test it with the other given pairs:

For x = -11, y should be:
y = 20 + 9(-11) = 20 - 99 = -79 (matches the output)

For x = -5, y should be:
y = 20 + 9(-5) = 20 - 45 = -25 (matches the output)

For x = -10, y should be:

Therefore, the function capturing the relationship is:

    To find the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to determine the constants a and b. Note that ax^0 is equivalent to a because x^0 is 1 for any x ≠ 0. Therefore, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

Given the input-output pairs, we can create a system of equations to solve for a and b:

1. For input 6: a + b(6) = 8
2. For input -5: a + b(-5) = -25
3. For input -3: a + b(-3) = -19
4. For input -10: a + b(-10) = -40
5. For input -14: a + b(-14) = -52

Using the second equation, we can solve for a:

a - 5b = -25

Now let's use another equation, such as the first one, to find b:

a + 6b = 8

We can now solve these two equations simultaneously. First, let's arrange the equation for a to solve it in terms of b:

a = -25 + 5b

Now substitute this expression for a into the first equation:

-25 + 5b + 6b = 8

Combining like terms:

11b = 33

Now solve for b:

b = 33 / 11
b = 3

Then, substitute b back into the equation for a:

a = -25 + 5(3)
a = -25 + 15
a = -10

Thus, the constants are a = -10 and b = 3, so the function is:

    The desired function to model the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) is in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx since any number raised to the power of zero is 1.

To find the values of a and b, we can use two points from the given data:

Let's use the points (6, 8) and (-5, -25).

By substituting these into the function y = a + bx, we get two equations:

For the point (6, 8):
8 = a + 6b   -> (1)

For the point (-5, -25):
-25 = a - 5b -> (2)

We can solve this system of equations to find a and b.

Let's multiply equation (2) by -1 to make it easier to eliminate variable 'a':

25 = -a + 5b  -> (2') [multiply by -1]

Now add equation (1) and equation (2'):

8 = a + 6b
25 = -a + 5b
-------------
33 = 11b

Divide both sides by 11 to get 'b':

b = 3

Now that we have 'b', we substitute it back into equation (1) to solve for 'a':

8 = a + 6(3)
8 = a + 18
a = 8 - 18
a = -10

    To find the function that fits these inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of `a` and `b` in the equation \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \).

First, note that \( x^0 = 1 \) for any value of \( x \) (except for \( x = 0 \), which is not in our dataset). Therefore, the equation simplifies to \( y = a + bx \).

Now let's find `a` and `b` by plugging in the given input-output pairs. We can take any two points to solve for `a` and `b`. Let's take the points (6, 8) and (-5, -25).

For the input 6:
\( 8 = a + b(6) \)
\( 8 = a + 6b \) -> (1)

For the input -5:
\( -25 = a + b(-5) \)
\( -25 = a - 5b \) -> (2)

We now have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for `a` and `b` using simultaneous equations.

Let's multiply equation (2) by 6:
\( -150 = 6a - 30b \) -> (3)

Now, let's multiply equation (1) by 5:
\( 40 = 5a + 30b \) -> (4)

Adding equations (3) and (4) gives us:
\( -150 + 40 = (6a + 5a) + (-30b + 30b) \)
\( -110 = 11a \)
\( a = -10 \)

Now substitute `a = -10` back into equation (1):
\( 8 = -10 + 6b \)
\( 18 = 6b \)
\( b = 3 \)

    To find the function in the form of \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), we can start by understanding that \(x^0\) is always 1 for any x that isn't zero and \(bx^1\) is simply \(bx\). Thus, the function can be simplified to \(y = a + bx\).

Now we can use the given input-output pairs to determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\).

Using the input-output pair (6, 8):
\(8 = a + 6b\) ...(1)

Using the input-output pair (-5, -25):
\(-25 = a - 5b\) ...(2)

Now we will solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).

By solving equation (1) for \(a\), we get:
\(a = 8 - 6b\) ...(3)

Substitute the value of \(a\) from equation (3) into equation (2), we get:
\(-25 = (8 - 6b) - 5b\)
\(-25 = 8 - 6b - 5b\)
\(-25 - 8 = -11b\)
\(-33 = -11b\)
\(b = 3\) ...(4)

Now substitute the value of \(b\) into equation (3) to find \(a\):
\(a = 8 - 6*3\)
\(a = 8 - 18\)
\(a = -10\) ...(5)

8 = a + 6b --- (1)

For point (-5, -25):
-25 = a + b(-5)
-25 = a - 5b --- (2)

Now we solve this system of equations. We can do this by multiplying equation (2) by 6 and equation (1) by 5 to eliminate `a`:

6(-25) = 6(a - 5b)
5(8) = 5(a + 6b)

Given the data points (9, 29), (2, 8), and (-1, -1), we can try to determine the constants a and b. Since we have more than two points, we might use them to check the consistency of the function we determine using two points.

For the input 9 and output 29:
29 = a + b(9);

For the input 2 and output 8:
8 = a + b(2).

We can solve this system of equations for a and b. Let's solve for a from the second equation:

8 = a + 2b;
a = 8 - 2b.

29 = (8 - 2b) + 9b;

Let's take the first two pairs (9, 29) and (2, 8) as an example.

For the input-output pair (9, 29), we have:

    Given the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we realize that this is a linear equation in the form y = c + bx, where a corresponds to the constant term c (since x^0 is always 1) and b is the coefficient for x.

We have several input-output pairs, and we will use two of them to calculate the coefficients a and b.

If we take the input-output pairs (2, -17) and (5, -38), we can set up two equations as follows:

1. Given the input 2:
-17 = a(2)^0 + b(2)
-17 = a + 2b  ... (Equation 1)

2. Given the input 5:
-38 = a(5)^0 + b(5)
-38 = a + 5b ... (Equation 2)

We can solve for a and b by using these two equations.

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2 gives us:

-38 - (-17) = a + 5b - (a + 2b)
-38 + 17 = 3b
-21 = 3b
b = -7

Now using b = -7 in Equation 1:

-17 = a + 2(-7)
-17 = a - 14
a = -17 + 14
a = -3

Therefore, the function capturing the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be written explicitly in the given form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1
y = -3x^0 - 7x^1
y = -3(1) - 7x
y = -3 - 7x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to solve for the constants a and b. The given form is actually a linear equation, where ax^0 simplifies to a because any number to the power of zero is 1.

Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

y = a + bx

To find the values of a and b, we need to use at least two points to create a system of equations. We'll use the points (-16, 109) and (2, -17):

1. For the input -16, output 109:
109 = a + b(-16)

2. For the input 2, output -17:
-17 = a + b(2)

We now have the following system of equations:

109 = a - 16b
-17 = a + 2b

Solve for a and b using the elimination method or substitution. First, let's solve for a from the second equation:

a = -17 - 2b

Now, substitute this value for a in the first equation:

109 = (-17 - 2b) - 16b
109 = -17 - 2b - 16b
109 = -17 - 18b
109 + 17 = -18b
126 = -18b
b = -7

Now, substitute b = -7 into the second equation to find a:

-17 = a + 2(-7)
-17 = a - 14
a = -17 + 14
a = -3

So the function is:

y = -3 + (-7)x
y = -3 - 7x

Therefore, the function is:

y = -3x^0 - 7x^1

Please note this function was derived by taking two points for simplicity. To ensure higher precision, more points should be considered and a best fit approach such as least squares should be utilized if the relationship is truly linear.

    To find the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 that relates the inputs to the outputs, we recognize that this is a linear function of the form:

y = a + bx

Where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the line. Given that we have multiple input-output pairs, we can use two of them to determine the values of a and b.

Let's use the input-output pairs (-3, 18) and (2, -17). Substituting these into the equation, we get two equations:

1. 18 = a + b(-3)
2. -17 = a + b(2)

We can solve this system of equations for a and b. Starting with the two equations:

1. 18 = a - 3b
2. -17 = a + 2b

Now, let's solve for a from the second equation:

a = -17 - 2b

Substituting this into the first equation:

18 = (-17 - 2b) - 3b
18 = -17 - 2b - 3b
18 + 17 = -5b
35 = -5b
b = -7

Now substitute b back into the equation for a:

a = -17 - 2(-7)
a = -17 + 14
a = -3

So the function we have derived is:

y = -3 + (-7)x

    To solve for a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, we have to substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve for these constants. The general form simplifies to y = a + bx, since any number to the power of 0 is 1.

Let's use two of the input-output pairs to set up a system of linear equations. We can use the first two input-output pairs for this:

When the input is -16 (x = -16), the output is 109 (y = 109):
1) 109 = a + b(-16)

When the input is -3 (x = -3), the output is 18 (y = 18):
2) 18 = a + b(-3)

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1) a - 16b = 109
2) a - 3b = 18

If we subtract equation 2 from equation 1, we get:

(a - 16b) - (a - 3b) = 109 - 18
-16b + 3b = 91
-13b = 91

Dividing both sides by -13 gives us:

b = -7

Now we use the value of b to find a using either equation 1 or 2. Let's use equation 2:

18 = a - 3(-7)
18 = a + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides to solve for a, we get:

a = 18 - 21
a = -3

Given the form y = a + bx, we want to find values of a and b that fit the data provided.

Let's take two points to solve for a and b:
Using the points (2, -17) and (-3, 18):

For the input 2, output -17:
-17 = a + 2b ...(1)

For the input -3, output 18:
18 = a - 3b ...(2)

Now, we will solve these two equations simultaneously to find a and b. Multiply equation (2) by 2 to help eliminate a when added to equation (1):

2*(18) = 2a - 6b
36 = 2a - 6b ...(3)

Now add equation (1) to equation (3):

-17 = a + 2b
36 = 2a - 6b
-------------
19 = 3a - 4b ...(4)

Let's multiply equation (2) by 3, so we can eliminate b when added to equation (4):

3*(18) = 3a - 9b

Adding equation (4) to equation (5) gives us:

19 = 3a - 4b
54 = 3a - 9b

73 = 6a - 13b ...(6)

Now multiply equation (1) by 13 and equation (6) by 2 to eliminate b:

-17 * 13 = 13a + 26b 
-221 = 13a + 26b ...(7)

73 * 2 = 12a - 26b 
146 = 12a - 26b ...(8)

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, we need at least two points to solve the system of linear equations.

We can start by using two of the given input-output pairs to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's use the pairs (-9, 162) and (17, -254).

For the first pair:

\( 162 = a + b(-9) \)

For the second pair:

\( -254 = a + b(17) \)

This gives us a system of two equations:

1. \( a - 9b = 162 \)
2. \( a + 17b = -254 \)

Now we will solve this system using the method of elimination or substitution. We can start by solving the first equation for \( a \):

\( a = 162 + 9b \)

Now we will substitute \( a \) in the second equation:

\( 162 + 9b + 17b = -254 \)
\( 162 + 26b = -254 \)
\( 26b = -254 - 162 \)
\( 26b = -416 \)

Now divide both sides by 26 to find \( b \):

\( b = -416 / 26 \)
\( b = -16 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can find \( a \) using the first equation:

\( a = 162 + 9(-16) \)

    ","To find the output for the input \( x = -4 \) using the function \( y = -10 + 20x \), we substitute \( x \) with -4:

\[ y = -10 + 20(-4) \]
\[ y = -10 - 80 \]
\[ y = -90 \]

Therefore, the output is:

    To find a linear function in the form \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), which simplifies to \( y = a + bx \), we can use two points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Let's choose the first two points from the data provided:

For the input 18, the output is 350. Therefore:
\( 350 = a + 18b \) (1)

For the input 12, the output is 230, so:
\( 230 = a + 12b \) (2)

Now, let's solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using these two equations.

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
\( 350 - 230 = (a + 18b) - (a + 12b) \)
\( 120 = 18b - 12b \)
\( 120 = 6b \)
Divide both sides by 6:
\( b = 120 / 6 \)
\( b = 20 \)

Now use \( b = 20 \) in equation (2) to find \( a \):
\( 230 = a + 12b \)
\( 230 = a + 12(20) \)
\( 230 = a + 240 \)
Subtract 240 from both sides:
\( a = 230 - 240 \)
\( a = -10 \)

Therefore, the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to find the values of a and b. The term ax^0 is equivalent to a, since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Hence, the equation can be simplified to y = a + bx.

We can use two data points to calculate a and b. Let's take the first two provided:

1) For the input 18, the output is 350:
350 = a + 18b

2) For the input 12, the output is 230:
230 = a + 12b

Now we can solve this system of linear equations. Let's subtract the second equation from the first one to solve for b:

350 - 230 = (a + 18b) - (a + 12b)
120 = 6b
b = 20

Now, we'll find a by putting the value of b back into any of the two original equations. Let's take the second one:

230 = a + 12b
230 = a + 12(20)
230 = a + 240
a = 230 - 240
a = -10

The function that seems to capture the relationship between inputs and outputs is therefore:

y = -10 + 20x

Let's check this function with the other provided data points to see if it fits:

For x = -13:
y = -10 + 20(-13) = -10 - 260 = -270 (which matches the output)

For x = 4:
y = -10 + 20(4) = -10 + 80 = 70 (which matches the output)

For x = 16:
y = -10 + 20(16) = -10 + 320 = 310 (which matches the output)

So, the function is consistent with all the given data points:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To determine the coefficients `a` and `b` for the function in the form of `y = ax^0 + bx^1`, we can use two points from the given data to create a system of linear equations. The term `ax^0` equals `a` because anything raised to the zero power is 1.

Let's use the first two data points (18, 350) and (12, 230) to solve for `a` and `b`. 

From the first data point (18, 350), we have:

350 = a(18)^0 + b(18)^1
350 = a + 18b           (1)

From the second data point (12, 230), we have:

230 = a(12)^0 + b(12)^1
230 = a + 12b           (2)

Now, let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

350 - 230 = (a + 18b) - (a + 12b)
120 = 6b
b = 20

Now that we have `b`, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find `a`. Let's use equation (2):

230 = a + 12(20)
230 = a + 240
a = 230 - 240
a = -10

So the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -10 + 20x

    To find the function in the form of \( y = ax^0 + bx^1 \), we can recognize that \( ax^0 \) is essentially the constant term (since any non-zero number to the power of 0 is 1), and \( bx^1 \) is the linear term (since any number to the power of 1 is the number itself). 

The function thus simplifies to \( y = a + bx \). 

Here's how we can compute the constants \( a \) and \( b \) based on the given inputs and outputs.

Let's use two data points to form a system of linear equations. We'll use the following two points: (13, 177) and (14, 191). From these points, we can form:

1. \( a + 13b = 177 \)
2. \( a + 14b = 191 \)

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

\( (a + 14b) - (a + 13b) = 191 - 177 \)

\( b = 14 \)

Now that we have \( b \), we can solve for \( a \) using either of the original equations. Using the first equation:

\( a + 13b = 177 \)
\( a + 13(14) = 177 \)
\( a + 182 = 177 \)
\( a = 177 - 182 \)
\( a = -5 \)

\( y = -5 + 14x \)

    To capture the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y), we have the outputs as the dependent variable and the inputs as the independent variable. We are looking for a linear relationship, given by the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, which simplifies to y = a + bx because x^0 is 1 and x^1 is x.

We can solve for a and b using two points from the dataset. Let's use the first two:

1. For input 13, output 177:
177 = a + 13b

2. For input 14, output 191:
191 = a + 14b

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, which can be solved as follows:

(1) 177 = a + 13b
(2) 191 = a + 14b

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate 'a':
191 - 177 = (a + 14b) - (a + 13b)
14 = b

Now we know b = 14. We can plug this value back into either equation (1) or (2) to find 'a'. Let's use equation (1):

177 = a + 13(14)

    To find the function in the form \(y = ax^0 + bx^1\), which simplifies to \(y = a + bx\) because \(x^0\) is always 1 and \(x^1\) is just \(x\), we need to determine the constants \(a\) and \(b\).

Let's take two pairs of inputs and outputs to form two equations in order to solve for \(a\) and \(b\):

Using the input-output pairs (13, 177) and (14, 191):

1. \(177 = a + 13b\)
2. \(191 = a + 14b\)

We can solve this system of equations by subtracting the first equation from the second:

\(191 - 177 = (a + 14b) - (a + 13b)\)

\(14 = b\)

Now that we have \(b\), we can use one of the equations to find \(a\). Let's use the first equation:

\(177 = a + 182\)

\(a = 177 - 182\)

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs (x) and the outputs (y) in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, we need to identify the values of a and b. Since ax^0 is always equal to a (because any number to the power of 0 is 1), we can simplify this to y = a + bx.

Given the pairs (x, y) from the inputs and outputs:
(13, 177)
(14, 191)

For the first point (13, 177):
177 = a + 13b

For the second point (14, 191):
191 = a + 14b

Now, we'll set up a system of equations and solve for a and b:
177 = a + 13b -- (1)
191 = a + 14b -- (2)

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
191 - 177 = (a + 14b) - (a + 13b)
14 = b

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find a:

177 = a + 182
a = 177 - 182
a = -5

So, our function y in terms of x will be:

When x = 14, y = 191:

We can solve this system of equations to find a and b.

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

14 = b

Now we know that b = 14. 

Substitute b into Equation 1:
