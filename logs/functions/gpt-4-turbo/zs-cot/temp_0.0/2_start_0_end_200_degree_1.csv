Input: 15
","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -10, Output: -213
Input: 9, Output: 167
Input: 4, Output: 67
Input: -3, Output: -73
Input: 20, Output: 387

We can start by looking for a pattern. Let's consider the possibility of a polynomial function, since the outputs are not linearly related to the inputs.

We can try to find a polynomial function of the form:
f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d

We need to find the coefficients a, b, c, and d that will satisfy the given input-output pairs. However, since we have five pairs, the function might be of a higher degree, or it might involve a combination of operations.

Let's first check if the outputs are related to the cubes of the inputs, since the numbers are relatively large and could suggest a cubic relationship.

For input -10, the cube is -1000, and the output is -213.
For input 9, the cube is 729, and the output is 167.
For input 4, the cube is 64, and the output is 67.
For input -3, the cube is -27, and the output is -73.
For input 20, the cube is 8000, and the output is 387.

The outputs are not simply the cubes of the inputs, but let's see if there's a consistent difference between the cube of the input and the output.

For input -10: (-10)^3 - (-213) = -1000 - (-213) = -787
For input 9: 9^3 - 167 = 729 - 167 = 562
For input 4: 4^3 - 67 = 64 - 67 = -3
For input -3: (-3)^3 - (-73) = -27 - (-73) = 46
For input 20: 20^3 - 387 = 8000 - 387 = 7613

The differences are not consistent, so it's not a simple matter of adding or subtracting a constant from the cube of the input.

Let's try another approach. We can look for a pattern in the differences between the outputs and the corresponding inputs.

For input -10: -213 - (-10) = -203
For input 9: 167 - 9 = 158
For input 4: 67 - 4 = 63
For input -3: -73 - (-3) = -70
For input 20: 387 - 20 = 367

Now, let's see if these differences are related to the squares of the inputs.

For input -10: (-10)^2 = 100, and -203 is close to -2 * 100 + 3
For input 9: 9^2 = 81, and 158 is close to 2 * 81 - 4
For input 4: 4^2 = 16, and 63 is close to 4 * 16 - 1
For input -3: (-3)^2 = 9, and -70 is close to -8 * 9 + 2
For input 20: 20^2 = 400, and 367 is close to 400 - 33, which doesn't fit the pattern

It seems that the relationship involves both the square and the cube of the input, but it's not immediately clear what the exact relationship is.

Given the complexity of the problem and the limited data points, it's challenging to determine the exact function without more information or additional input-output pairs. However, we can try to interpolate the function using the given points, but this would typically require solving a system of equations, which is not feasible to do manually in a straightforward manner.

Since we cannot determine the exact function with the information provided, we cannot accurately provide the output for the input of 15. However, if we were to guess based on the pattern of the differences, we might guess that the function involves both the square and the cube of the input in some way, possibly with coefficients that we cannot determine without further analysis or information.

Input: -6
","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -10 | Output: -213
Input: 9   | Output: 167
Input: 4   | Output: 67
Input: -3  | Output: -73
Input: 20  | Output: 387

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider polynomial functions, as they can produce both positive and negative outputs and can be easily fitted to a set of points.

Let's consider the possibility of a cubic function, since we have both positive and negative inputs and outputs, and the rate of change seems to increase with the input value, which is characteristic of higher-degree polynomials.

A cubic function has the form:
f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d

We need to find the coefficients a, b, c, and d that will satisfy the given input-output pairs. However, since we only need to find the output for the input -6, we can try to find a pattern without determining the exact function.

Looking at the inputs and outputs, we can try to see if there's a simple relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). For example, let's see if the outputs are proportional to the cubes of the inputs:

-10^3 = -1000, but the output is -213, which is not a simple multiple.
9^3 = 729, and the output is 167, which is also not a simple multiple.
4^3 = 64, and the output is 67, which is close to 64 + 3.
-3^3 = -27, and the output is -73, which is close to -27 - 46.

From the above, it's not immediately clear what the function is, but we can notice that the output is somewhat close to the cube of the input plus or minus a certain number. Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the differences between the cubes of the inputs and the actual outputs:

For input -10: (-10)^3 = -1000 and -1000 + 213 = -787
For input 9: 9^3 = 729 and 729 - 167 = 562
For input 4: 4^3 = 64 and 64 - 67 = -3
For input -3: (-3)^3 = -27 and -27 + 73 = 46
For input 20: 20^3 = 8000 and 8000 - 387 = 7613

The differences don't show an obvious pattern, so let's try another approach. We can look at the sequence of inputs and outputs and see if the change between consecutive outputs gives us a clue:

From -10 to 9 (increase of 19), the output increases by 380.
From 9 to 4 (decrease of 5), the output decreases by 100.
From 4 to -3 (decrease of 7), the output decreases by 140.
From -3 to 20 (increase of 23), the output increases by 460.

This still doesn't give us a clear pattern, but we can notice that the changes in output are multiples of 20, which suggests that the input might be multiplied by a factor related to 20 to get the output.

Let's try to find a relationship by dividing the output by the input:

For input -10: -213 / -10 = 21.3
For input 9: 167 / 9 ≈ 18.56
For input 4: 67 / 4 = 16.75
For input -3: -73 / -3 ≈ 24.33
For input 20: 387 / 20 = 19.35

This still doesn't give us a clear pattern, but we can notice that the result is somewhat close to 20, with some variation.

Given the complexity of the problem and the lack of a clear pattern, we may need more information or a different approach to determine the exact function. However, since we are tasked with providing an output for the input -6, we can make an educated guess based on the information we have.

Let's assume the function is a cubic function and try to estimate the output for input -6 by looking at the pattern of the outputs relative to the cubes of the inputs:

For input -10: (-10)^3 = -1000 and the output is -213 (difference of 787)
For input -3: (-3)^3 = -27 and the output is -73 (difference of 46)

We can see that as the input gets closer to zero from the negative side, the difference between the cube of the input and the output decreases. If we assume a similar pattern for input -6, we might expect the difference to be between 46 and 787.

Let's make a rough estimate by taking a value in between. If we take the average of 46 and 787, we get (46 + 787) / 2 = 833 / 2 ≈ 416.5. Now, let's find the cube of -6 and adjust it by this estimated difference:

(-6)^3 = -216
Estimated difference ≈ 416.5

Now, we subtract this estimated difference from the cube of -6:

-216 - 416.5 ≈ -632.5

Since we don't have an exact function, this is a rough estimate. We can round this to a whole number for simplicity, which gives us -633.

Final Output: -633

","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: 9   | Output: 167
Input: 4   | Output: 67
Input: -3  | Output: -73
Input: 20  | Output: 387

We can start by looking for a pattern. Let's consider the possibility of a polynomial function, since the outputs are not linearly related to the inputs.

Let's try to find a polynomial function f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d that fits the data points. We need at least four points to determine the coefficients a, b, c, and d for a cubic polynomial. We have five, which is more than enough.

Using the given points, we can set up a system of equations:

For input -10:
a(-10)^3 + b(-10)^2 + c(-10) + d = -213

For input 9:
a(9)^3 + b(9)^2 + c(9) + d = 167

For input 4:
a(4)^3 + b(4)^2 + c(4) + d = 67

For input -3:
a(-3)^3 + b(-3)^2 + c(-3) + d = -73

For input 20:
a(20)^3 + b(20)^2 + c(20) + d = 387

However, solving this system of equations manually would be time-consuming and complex. Instead, let's look for a pattern in the differences between the outputs and the inputs.

If we look at the outputs and consider the inputs squared and cubed, we might notice a pattern:

For input -10:
(-10)^3 = -1000
(-10)^2 = 100
Output = -213

For input 9:
9^3 = 729
9^2 = 81
Output = 167

For input 4:
4^3 = 64
4^2 = 16
Output = 67

For input -3:

(-3)^2 = 9
Output = -73

For input 20:
20^3 = 8000
20^2 = 400
Output = 387

We can see that the output is not simply the input cubed or squared. However, we can try to find a relationship by looking at the differences between the outputs and the inputs cubed:

For input -10:
-1000 + 213 = -787

For input 9:
729 - 167 = 562

For input 4:
64 - 67 = -3

For input -3:
-27 + 73 = 46

For input 20:
8000 - 387 = 7613

The differences do not form a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence, so it's not immediately clear what the function could be.

Given the complexity of the problem, we might need to use numerical methods or software to find the exact function. However, since we are looking for the output when the input is 0, we can make an educated guess based on the pattern of the outputs.

If we assume that the function is continuous and smooth, we can guess that the output for an input of 0 would be close to the constant term 'd' in the polynomial function we are trying to find.

Looking at the pattern of the outputs, when the input is negative, the output is also negative, and when the input is positive, the output is positive. This suggests that the constant term 'd' might be close to 0.

Without the exact function, we can't provide a precise output, but we can hypothesize that the output for an input of 0 would be 0 or close to it.

We can start by checking if there's a polynomial relationship between the inputs and outputs. Let's try to find a polynomial that fits the given points.

We can notice that the output seems to be related to the cube of the input. Let's test this hypothesis:

For input -10:
(-10)^3 = -1000
This is not enough to reach -213, but if we add a linear term, we might get closer.

For input 9:
9^3 = 729
Again, this is not enough to reach 167, but it's in the ballpark.

For input 4:
4^3 = 64
This is close to 67, suggesting that there might be a small constant term added.

For input -3:
(-3)^3 = -27
This is far from -73, but again, a linear term might help.

For input 20:
20^3 = 8000
This is much less than 387, indicating that we might be looking at a combination of a cube and a linear term, possibly with a negative coefficient for the cube.

Let's assume the function is of the form:
f(x) = ax^3 + bx + c

We can use the given input-output pairs to form equations and solve for a, b, and c. However, since we have only five pairs, we can't determine a unique solution for a cubic function without more information. Instead, let's look for a pattern in the differences between the cubes of the inputs and the outputs:

For input -10:
(-10)^3 = -1000
Difference: -213 - (-1000) = 787

For input 9:
9^3 = 729
Difference: 167 - 729 = -562

For input 4:
4^3 = 64
Difference: 67 - 64 = 3

For input -3:
(-3)^3 = -27
Difference: -73 - (-27) = -46

For input 20:
20^3 = 8000
Difference: 387 - 8000 = -7613

The differences don't form an obvious linear pattern, so let's try another approach. We can look at the differences between the outputs and the cubes of the inputs:

-213 - (-1000) = 787 = 11 * 71 + 6
167 - 729 = -562 = -11 * 51 + 1
67 - 64 = 3 = 11 * 0 + 3
-73 - (-27) = -46 = -11 * 4 + 2
387 - 8000 = -7613 = -11 * 691 + 8

It seems that the output could be the input cubed minus 11 times the input plus a constant that increases by 1 each time. However, this pattern does not hold consistently for all the given pairs.

Without a clear pattern, we can't definitively determine the function. However, we can make an educated guess based on the pattern of the differences. If we assume that the function is a cubic function with a linear term and a constant term, we can try to find a function that fits the given points.

Given the complexity of determining the exact function without more information or a clear pattern, we can't provide a definitive output for the input -17.

We can use the given input-output pairs to create a system of equations to solve for a, b, c, and d. However, since we have five points, we might be dealing with an over-determined system, so we'll need to look for a pattern that fits all points.

Let's try to find a pattern by examining the differences between the outputs for consecutive inputs:

Output at 9 - Output at 4 = 167 - 67 = 100
Output at 4 - Output at -3 = 67 - (-73) = 140
Output at -3 - Output at -10 = -73 - (-213) = 140

We notice that the differences are not consistent, which suggests that the function might not be a simple polynomial. However, we can also notice that the output seems to be related to the cube of the input, given the rapid increase and decrease for positive and negative inputs, respectively.

Let's try to find a relationship by examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

(-10)^3 = -1000 and -1000 + 787 = -213
9^3 = 729 and 729 - 562 = 167
4^3 = 64 and 64 + 3 = 67
(-3)^3 = -27 and -27 - 46 = -73
20^3 = 8000 and 8000 - 7613 = 387

It seems that there is a pattern where the output is the cube of the input plus or minus a certain number. However, the number we add or subtract does not follow a simple linear pattern.

Given the complexity of the pattern and the limited data points, it's challenging to determine the exact function without more information. However, we can try to estimate the output for the input -6 by looking for a pattern in the adjustments made to the cube of the input:

(-10)^3 + 787 = -213
9^3 - 562 = 167
4^3 + 3 = 67
(-3)^3 - 46 = -73
20^3 - 7613 = 387

Let's calculate the cube of -6 and see if we can estimate the adjustment:

(-6)^3 = -216

Now, we need to estimate the adjustment. Looking at the pattern of adjustments, there doesn't seem to be a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. Without a clear pattern, we can't accurately determine the adjustment needed to get the exact output.

However, since the adjustments for the negative inputs -10 and -3 are +787 and -46, respectively, and considering that -6 is closer to -3 than to -10, we might guess that the adjustment for -6 would be somewhere between those two values, but closer to -46 since -6 is closer to -3.

This is purely speculative, and without a clear pattern, we cannot provide an exact answer. Therefore, we cannot determine the final output for the input -6 with the information provided.

Input: 5   | Output: -98

However, with the given data, it's not immediately clear what the polynomial might be. We can try to look for a pattern by examining the differences between the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

Let's consider the possibility that the function involves squaring the input, as the outputs are quite large compared to the inputs, and negative inputs result in positive outputs, which is characteristic of even-powered functions.

Let's try squaring the inputs and see if there's a simple relationship with the outputs:

Input: -18 | Output: 339 | (-18)^2 = 324
Input: 0   | Output: -3  | 0^2 = 0
Input: 5   | Output: -98 | 5^2 = 25
Input: -3  | Output: 54  | (-3)^2 = 9
Input: -16 | Output: 301 | (-16)^2 = 256

Now, let's see if there's a simple linear relationship between the squared input and the output. We can try to find a constant that, when multiplied by the squared input and possibly added to another constant, gives us the output.

For the first pair:
324 * k + b = 339
k = (339 - b) / 324

For the second pair:
0 * k + b = -3
b = -3

Now that we have a potential value for b, let's apply it to the first equation:
k = (339 - (-3)) / 324
k = 342 / 324
k = 1.05555555556 (approximately)

Let's test this k value with another pair to see if it holds:
(-3)^2 * k + b = 54
9 * 1.05555555556 - 3 ≈ 54

This doesn't seem to be correct, so our assumption about the relationship being a simple linear function of the squared input might be wrong.

Given the complexity of finding a pattern with the information provided, we may need to use a more sophisticated method, such as polynomial regression, to find the exact function. However, without the ability to perform such calculations or additional information, we cannot determine the exact function with certainty.

Since we cannot determine the exact function, we cannot provide the correct output for the input -7.

","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -18 | Output: 339
Input: 0   | Output: -3
Input: 5   | Output: -98
Input: -3  | Output: 54
Input: -16 | Output: 301

We can start by looking for patterns. One approach is to check if the output is a function of the input squared, since the sign of the input does not affect the sign of the output.

Let's test this hypothesis by squaring the inputs and comparing them to the outputs:

(-18)^2 = 324 | 339 - 324 = 15
0^2 = 0       | -3 - 0 = -3
5^2 = 25      | -98 - 25 = -123
(-3)^2 = 9    | 54 - 9 = 45
(-16)^2 = 256 | 301 - 256 = 45

It seems that when we subtract the square of the input from the output, we do not get a consistent result. However, we can notice that for negative inputs, the difference is 15 or 45, which are multiples of 15. For the positive input, the difference is -123, which is not a multiple of 15.

Let's try a different approach by looking at the differences between the outputs and the inputs:

339 - (-18) = 357
-3 - 0 = -3
-98 - 5 = -103
54 - (-3) = 57
301 - (-16) = 317

These differences do not immediately suggest a clear pattern either. However, we can notice that the outputs for negative inputs are positive and much larger than the inputs, while the outputs for positive inputs are negative and smaller.

Let's try another approach by looking at the absolute values of the inputs and outputs:

|339| - |-18| = 321
|-3| - |0| = 3
|-98| - |5| = 93
|54| - |-3| = 51
|301| - |-16| = 285

Now, let's see if there's a multiple that connects these:

321 / 18 = 17.833...
3 / 0 = undefined (but could be considered as a multiple of 0)
93 / 5 = 18.6
51 / 3 = 17
285 / 16 = 17.8125

This suggests that the output could be related to the input multiplied by a number close to 18 when the input is positive, and a number close to 17 when the input is negative, and then adjusted by adding or subtracting a certain value.

Given the complexity and the lack of a clear pattern, we may need more data points or a different approach to determine the exact function. However, since we need to provide an output for the input of 16, we can make an educated guess based on the pattern we've observed for positive inputs.

For positive inputs, it seems the output is negative and the absolute value of the output is somewhat larger than the input. Since 5 resulted in -98, let's assume a similar scaling factor for 16:

If we assume the scaling factor is around 18 (from the 93 / 5 = 18.6 observation), we might estimate:

16 * 18 = 288

Now, we need to adjust this number to find the output. Since the output for 5 was -98, which is -3 less than -95 (5 * 19), we might guess that the output for 16 could be -3 less than -288 (16 * 18), which would be -291.

However, this is purely speculative. Without a clear pattern, we cannot be certain of the output for the input of 16. But based on the guesswork above, we can provide a tentative output:

Final Output: -291

Let's think step by step about what the function could be. Remember to write down 'Final Output:' before your final answer.
Input: 0
","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -18 | Output: 339
Input: 0   | Output: -3
Input: 5   | Output: -98
Input: -3  | Output: 54
Input: -16 | Output: 301

We can start by looking for patterns. One approach is to check if the output is a function of the input squared, cubed, or some combination of operations.

Let's try to find a pattern by checking the differences between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

For input -18, output 339:
(-18)^2 = 324, but 339 - 324 = 15, which is not a simple operation away from -18.

For input 0, output -3:
0^2 = 0, but -3 - 0 = -3, which is a simple subtraction.

For input 5, output -98:
5^2 = 25, but -98 - 25 = -123, which is not a simple operation away from 5.

For input -3, output 54:
(-3)^2 = 9, but 54 - 9 = 45, which is not a simple operation away from -3.

For input -16, output 301:
(-16)^2 = 256, but 301 - 256 = 45, which is the same difference as the previous one.

We notice that for inputs -18 and -16, the difference between the square of the input and the output is 15 and 45, respectively. These differences are multiples of 3. This might suggest that the output is related to 3 times the input plus some function of the input.

Let's try to find a function f(x) such that the output is 3x + f(x). We can use the input-output pair (0, -3) to find f(x) because 3*0 is 0, so f(0) should be -3.

Since f(0) = -3, we can guess that f(x) might involve subtracting 3 from some operation on x.

Now let's check if f(x) = x^2 - 3 fits the other input-output pairs:

For input -18, f(-18) = (-18)^2 - 3 = 324 - 3 = 321, and 3*(-18) + 321 = -54 + 321 = 267, which does not match the output 339.

This means our guess for f(x) is incorrect. Let's try a different approach.

We can notice that the outputs for negative inputs are positive and much larger than the square of the input. This suggests that the function might involve an absolute value or another transformation that turns negative inputs into larger positive outputs.

Let's try to find a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. We can use the two inputs that are closest to each other, -3 and 0, to see if we can find a consistent rate of change.

For input -3, output 54:
For input 0, output -3:

The change in input is 3 (from -3 to 0), and the change in output is -57 (from 54 to -3). This gives us a rate of change of -57/3 = -19.

Let's see if this rate applies to other input-output pairs:

For input -18, output 339:
If we add 18 to -18 to get to 0, and we multiply 18 by -19, we get -342. If we add this to the output at 0 (-3), we should get the output for -18.

-3 + (-342) = -345, which does not match the output 339.

This means that the rate of change is not consistent across all input-output pairs.

Given the complexity of the problem and the lack of a clear pattern, it is difficult to determine the exact function without more information or additional input-output pairs. However, since you've asked for the output for the input 0, which is already provided, we can give that directly.

Input: -7
","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -18 | Output: 339
Input: 0   | Output: -3
Input: 5   | Output: -98
Input: -3  | Output: 54
Input: -16 | Output: 301

We can start by looking for patterns. One approach is to check if the output is a result of a polynomial function of the input. We can try to find a polynomial that fits all the given points. However, with the given data, it's not immediately clear what the polynomial might be.

Another approach is to look for arithmetic or geometric sequences, but the outputs do not seem to increase or decrease by a constant amount or ratio.

Let's try to find a function that fits the data by considering the possibility of a quadratic function, since the outputs do not seem to be linearly related to the inputs. A quadratic function has the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

We can set up a system of equations using the given input-output pairs to solve for a, b, and c. However, we have five points, which would typically overdetermine a quadratic function (which only needs three points to be fully defined). We can still attempt to find a quadratic function that fits all the points, but it's possible that no such function exists, and a higher-order polynomial is needed.

Let's try to find a quadratic function that fits the first three points:

For input -18 and output 339:
a(-18)^2 + b(-18) + c = 339

For input 0 and output -3:
a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = -3

For input 5 and output -98:
a(5)^2 + b(5) + c = -98

This gives us the system of equations:
324a - 18b + c = 339
0a + 0b + c = -3
25a + 5b + c = -98

Solving the second equation gives us c = -3.

Substituting c into the first and third equations:
324a - 18b - 3 = 339
25a + 5b - 3 = -98

Simplifying:
324a - 18b = 342
25a + 5b = -95

Dividing the first equation by 18:
18a - b = 19

Now we have the system:
18a - b = 19
25a + 5b = -95

Multiplying the first equation by 5 to eliminate b:
90a - 5b = 95
25a + 5b = -95

Adding the two equations:
115a = 0
a = 0

This is a contradiction because if a = 0, then the function is not quadratic. It seems that a quadratic function will not fit all the given points. We may need to consider a higher-order polynomial or a different type of function altogether.

Given the complexity of the problem and the limited data points, it's challenging to determine the exact function without more information or a clearer pattern. However, we can still provide an output for the input -7 by assuming the function is consistent with the given points.

Since we cannot determine the exact function, we can't provide a precise output for the input -7. However, if we were to guess based on the pattern that the output increases as the input becomes more negative, we might expect the output for -7 to be somewhere between the output for -3 and -16.

","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output based on the given pairs. Let's analyze the pairs:

Input: -18 | Output: 339
Input: 0   | Output: -3
Input: 5   | Output: -98
Input: -3  | Output: 54
Input: -16 | Output: 301

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider whether the output is a function of the input squared, since the sign of the input does not affect the sign of the output.

Let's test this hypothesis by squaring the inputs and comparing them to the outputs:

Input: -18 | Input Squared: 324 | Output: 339 | Difference: 15
Input: 0   | Input Squared: 0   | Output: -3  | Difference: -3
Input: 5   | Input Squared: 25  | Output: -98 | Difference: -123
Input: -3  | Input Squared: 9   | Output: 54  | Difference: 45
Input: -16 | Input Squared: 256 | Output: 301 | Difference: 45

The differences between the squared inputs and the outputs are not consistent, which suggests that simply squaring the input is not the correct function. However, we can notice that the differences are multiples of 3 (15, -3, -123, 45, 45). This suggests that the function might involve multiplying the input by a certain number and then adding or subtracting a multiple of 3.

Let's try to find a linear relationship of the form `f(x) = ax + b` where `a` and `b` are constants. We can use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for `a` and `b`.

Using the inputs -18 and 0:
For input -18, the output is 339: `a(-18) + b = 339`
For input 0, the output is -3: `a(0) + b = -3`

From the second equation, we can see that `b = -3`.

Now we can substitute `b` into the first equation:
`a(-18) - 3 = 339`
`-18a = 342`
`a = -19`

Now we have the function `f(x) = -19x - 3`. Let's test this function with the other inputs to see if it holds true:

For input 5: `f(5) = -19(5) - 3 = -95 - 3 = -98` (which matches the given output)
For input -3: `f(-3) = -19(-3) - 3 = 57 - 3 = 54` (which matches the given output)
For input -16: `f(-16) = -19(-16) - 3 = 304 - 3 = 301` (which matches the given output)

Since the function `f(x) = -19x - 3` matches all the given input-output pairs, we can use it to find the output for the input 11:

`f(11) = -19(11) - 3 = -209 - 3 = -212`

","To solve this problem, let's first try to find a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs. We can start by looking at the pairs of numbers and see if we can discern any relationship between them.

Input: 9
Output: -51

Input: -11

Let's analyze the positive inputs first:

For input 5, the output is -31.
For input 9, the output is -51.

Now let's look at the negative inputs:

For input -11, the output is 49.
For input -4, the output is 14.
For input -12, the output is 54.

It seems that for positive inputs, the output is negative, and for negative inputs, the output is positive. Also, the magnitude of the output is increasing as the magnitude of the input increases. This suggests that the function might involve squaring the input (which would always give a positive result) and then possibly subtracting a value to adjust the sign and magnitude.

Let's try squaring the input and then subtracting a value to see if we can match the outputs:

For input 5, 5^2 = 25. To get -31, we would subtract 56.
For input 9, 9^2 = 81. To get -51, we would subtract 132.

For input -11, (-11)^2 = 121. To get 49, we would subtract 72.
For input -4, (-4)^2 = 16. To get 14, we would subtract 2.
For input -12, (-12)^2 = 144. To get 54, we would subtract 90.

It looks like we're subtracting different values each time, which doesn't give us a consistent function. However, if we notice the pattern, the value we're subtracting seems to be 6 times the input value.

Let's test this hypothesis:

For input 5, 5^2 = 25, and 5 * 6 = 30. Subtracting, we get 25 - 30 = -5, but we need -31, so we subtract an additional 26.
For input 9, 9^2 = 81, and 9 * 6 = 54. Subtracting, we get 81 - 54 = 27, but we need -51, so we subtract an additional 78.

This pattern seems to hold for the negative inputs as well:

For input -11, (-11)^2 = 121, and -11 * 6 = -66. Subtracting, we get 121 - (-66) = 121 + 66 = 187, but we need 49, so we subtract an additional 138.
For input -4, (-4)^2 = 16, and -4 * 6 = -24. Subtracting, we get 16 - (-24) = 16 + 24 = 40, but we need 14, so we subtract an additional 26.

It seems that we are always subtracting an additional 26 after subtracting 6 times the input from the square of the input. Let's formulate the function:

f(x) = x^2 - 6x - 26

Now let's apply this function to the new input:

Input: -5

f(-5) = (-5)^2 - 6*(-5) - 26
f(-5) = 25 + 30 - 26
f(-5) = 55 - 26

We can start by looking for a pattern. It seems that for positive inputs, the output is negative, and for negative inputs, the output is positive. This suggests that the output might be the negative of some function of the input.

Let's try to find a function that fits the positive inputs first:

For input 5, the output is -31. If we assume the function is a polynomial, we can try a linear function first: f(x) = ax + b. We need to find a and b such that f(5) = -31.

Let's also look at the input 9, where the output is -51. We can set up the following equations:

f(5) = a * 5 + b = -31
f(9) = a * 9 + b = -51

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

5a + b = -31
9a + b = -51

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

4a = -20
a = -5

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b:

5(-5) + b = -31
-25 + b = -31
b = -31 + 25
b = -6

So our function for positive inputs seems to be f(x) = -5x - 6.

Let's check this function with the negative inputs:

f(-11) = -5(-11) - 6 = 55 - 6 = 49 (which matches the output)
f(-4) = -5(-4) - 6 = 20 - 6 = 14 (which matches the output)
f(-12) = -5(-12) - 6 = 60 - 6 = 54 (which matches the output)

The function f(x) = -5x - 6 seems to work for all given inputs. Now let's use it to find the output for the input 15:

f(15) = -5(15) - 6 = -75 - 6 = -81

For input 5, the output is -31. If we assume the function is a polynomial, we can try a linear function first: f(x) = ax + b. We need to find a and b such that f(5) = -31.

However, since we have only one pair with a positive input, we cannot determine a and b uniquely. We need to look at the negative inputs as well.

For input -11, the output is 49. If we assume the same function applies, f(-11) = 49.

Now we have two equations:
f(5) = a * 5 + b = -31
f(-11) = a * (-11) + b = 49

Let's solve this system of equations for a and b:

5a + b = -31
-11a + b = 49

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
16a = -80
a = -80 / 16
a = -5

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b. Using the first equation:

5 * (-5) + b = -31
-25 + b = -31
b = -31 + 25
b = -6

So our function seems to be f(x) = -5x - 6. Let's check this function against the other given pairs:

Input: 5 → Output: -31
Input: 9 → Output: -51
Input: -11 → Output: 49
Input: -4 → Output: 14
Input: -12 → Output: 54

It seems that negative inputs result in positive outputs and positive inputs result in negative outputs. Let's try to find a mathematical relationship that fits these pairs.

One possible relationship could be that the output is the negative of the input squared plus a constant. Let's test this hypothesis with the given pairs:

For Input: 5, if the function is -x^2 + C, then:
-5^2 + C = -25 + C = -31
C = -31 + 25 = -6

Let's see if this constant works for the other positive input:
For Input: 9:
-9^2 + C = -81 + C = -51
C = -51 + 81 = 30

The constant is not consistent for the positive inputs, so this hypothesis is incorrect. Let's try a different approach.

Another possibility is that the function involves both a multiplication and an addition or subtraction. Since the outputs are not simply the squares of the inputs, there might be a linear component as well. Let's try to find a function of the form:

f(x) = ax + b

Using the inputs and outputs to create equations:

For Input: 5 (positive), Output: -31
5a + b = -31

For Input: 9 (positive), Output: -51
9a + b = -51

For Input: -11 (negative), Output: 49

For Input: -4 (negative), Output: 14
-4a + b = 14

For Input: -12 (negative), Output: 54
-12a + b = 54

Let's solve for 'a' and 'b' using the equations for the negative inputs, as they seem to be consistent:

-11a + b = 49
-4a + b = 14

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
-7a = 35
a = -5

Now we can use the value of 'a' to find 'b':
-4(-5) + b = 14
20 + b = 14
b = -6

Now we have a potential function:
f(x) = -5x - 6

Input: 9, Output: -51
Input: -11, Output: 49
Input: -4, Output: 14
Input: -12, Output: 54

Let's analyze the pairs:

For positive inputs:
- When the input is 5, the output is -31. If we try to find a relationship, we can see that 5 * 6 = 30, and if we subtract one more, we get 31, which is the absolute value of the output. The output is negative, so -5 * 6 - 1 = -31.
- When the input is 9, the output is -51. Similarly, 9 * 6 = 54, and subtracting 3 more gives us 51, which is the absolute value of the output. So, -9 * 6 - 3 = -51.

For negative inputs:
- When the input is -11, the output is 49. If we try a similar approach, -11 * -6 = 66, and if we subtract 17 more, we get 49. So, -11 * -6 - 17 = 49.
- When the input is -4, the output is 14. Similarly, -4 * -6 = 24, and subtracting 10 more gives us 14. So, -4 * -6 - 10 = 14.
- When the input is -12, the output is 54. Following the same logic, -12 * -6 = 72, and subtracting 18 more gives us 54. So, -12 * -6 - 18 = 54.

From these observations, we can see that the function seems to involve multiplying the input by 6 and then subtracting a certain number. For positive inputs, the output is negative, and for negative inputs, the output is positive. The number we subtract seems to be related to the input as well.

Let's try to find a general formula. We can see that for positive numbers, we subtract (input - 1), and for negative numbers, we subtract (input * -1 - 1). So the function could be:

f(x) = -6x - (x - 1) for x > 0
f(x) = -6x - (-x - 1) for x < 0

Now let's apply this function to the input 17:

f(17) = -6 * 17 - (17 - 1)

Input: -6, Output: 58

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by checking if the relationship is linear (y = mx + b), quadratic (y = ax^2 + bx + c), or some other form.

Looking at the outputs, they are all negative when the input is positive and positive when the input is negative, which suggests that the function might involve a negative sign and possibly an even power (since even powers of negative numbers are positive).

Let's try to find a pattern by examining the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For input 7, output is -98. If we try a quadratic function, we can test if (7^2) * a = -98, where a is a constant we are trying to find.
49a = -98
a = -98 / 49
a = -2

Let's see if this constant works for the other inputs:

For input 17, (17^2) * -2 should equal -218.
289 * -2 = -578, which is not -218. This means there might be another term we are missing.

Let's try adding a linear term (bx) to the quadratic term:

For input 7, -2 * (7^2) + b * 7 = -98
-2 * 49 + 7b = -98
-98 + 7b = -98
7b = 0
b = 0

This suggests that there might not be a linear term, or if there is, it's not revealed by this input. Let's try a constant term (c):

For input 7, -2 * (7^2) + c = -98
-2 * 49 + c = -98
-98 + c = -98
c = 0

This also suggests that there might not be a constant term, or if there is, it's not revealed by this input. However, since the quadratic term alone did not work for input 17, there must be another term.

Let's try a different approach and look for a pattern in the differences between the outputs and the squares of the inputs:

For input 7, 7^2 = 49, and the difference between -98 and -49 (the negative of 49) is -49.
For input 17, 17^2 = 289, and the difference between -218 and -289 is 71.

This doesn't immediately suggest a simple pattern, so let's try another approach. We can look at the differences between the outputs and the inputs multiplied by a constant:

For input 7, if we multiply 7 by 14 (twice 7), we get 98, which is the negative of the output.
For input 17, if we multiply 17 by 14, we get 238, which is not the negative of the output.

This suggests that the function is not simply the input multiplied by a constant. However, we can notice that the output is always 14 times the input plus or minus a certain number:

For input 7, 7 * 14 = 98, and the output is -98.
For input 17, 17 * 14 = 238, and the output is -218 (20 less than 238).
For input 5, 5 * 14 = 70, and the output is -74 (4 less than 70).
For input 3, 3 * 14 = 42, and the output is -50 (8 less than 42).
For input -6, -6 * 14 = -84, and the output is 58 (84 + 58 = 142, which is not a multiple of 14).

The pattern is not immediately clear, but we can notice that the difference between the output and the product of the input and 14 seems to be related to the input itself. Let's try to find a function that fits all the given pairs:

If we look at the difference between the product of the input and 14 and the output, we can see that it might be related to the square of the input:

For input 7, the difference is 0 (since -98 is exactly 14 times 7).
For input 17, the difference is 20, which is not a square.
For input 5, the difference is 4, which is 2^2.
For input 3, the difference is 8, which is 2 * 2^2.
For input -6, the difference is 142, which is 10^2 + 2 * 6.

This suggests that the function might involve the square of the input and an additional term that is twice the input. Let's try the following function:

y = -14x + 2x^2

Let's test this function with the given inputs:

For input 7:
y = -14 * 7 + 2 * 7^2
y = -98 + 98
y = 0 (which is not correct, as the output should be -98)

This function does not fit the given pairs, so we need to adjust our approach. Let's try to find a function that fits all the given pairs by considering both the square of the input and a multiple of the input:

For input 7, the output is -98, which is -14 * 7.
For input 17, the output is -218, which is -14 * 17 - 20.
For input 5, the output is -74, which is -14 * 5 - 4.
For input 3, the output is -50, which is -14 * 3 - 8.
For input -6, the output is 58, which is 14 * -6 + 142.

","To determine the function, let's look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs.

Input: 7, Output: -98
Input: 17, Output: -218
Input: 5, Output: -74
Input: 3, Output: -50
Input: -6, Output: 58

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by looking at the differences between the outputs and see if they correspond to any operation on the inputs.

For input 7, the output is -98. If we consider a quadratic function, we might guess that the function is of the form y = ax^2 + bx + c. To find the coefficients a, b, and c, we would need to solve a system of equations using the given input-output pairs. However, since we only need to find the output for input 12, we can try to find a pattern without determining the exact formula.

Looking at the positive and negative inputs, we can see that the output is negative when the input is positive and positive when the input is negative. This suggests that there might be a negative sign involved in the function.

Let's look at the absolute values of the outputs and see if they are related to the squares of the inputs:

7^2 = 49, and 98 is close to 2 * 49 (which is 98), but the output is negative.
17^2 = 289, and 218 is somewhat close to 2 * 289 (which is 578), but the output is negative and less than half.
5^2 = 25, and 74 is close to 3 * 25 (which is 75), but the output is negative.
3^2 = 9, and 50 is close to 6 * 9 (which is 54), but the output is negative.
-6^2 = 36, and 58 is somewhat close to 2 * 36 (which is 72), but the output is positive.

The relationship is not immediately clear, but we can notice that the output is always less than the doubled square of the input (for positive inputs) and more than the doubled square of the input (for negative inputs).

Let's try to find a consistent operation that can be applied to the inputs to get the outputs. We can start by guessing that the function involves squaring the input, multiplying by a negative constant, and then adding or subtracting a value.

For input 7, if we double the square, we get 98, and the output is -98, which is 98 less than zero.
For input 17, if we double the square, we get 578, and the output is -218, which is 578 - 218 = 360 less than zero.
For input 5, if we double the square, we get 50, and the output is -74, which is 50 - 74 = -24 less than zero.
For input 3, if we double the square, we get 18, and the output is -50, which is 18 - 50 = -32 less than zero.
For input -6, if we double the square, we get 72, and the output is 58, which is 72 - 58 = 14 more than zero.

It seems that the function involves squaring the input, doubling it, and then subtracting a value that increases as the input increases. However, without a clear pattern, we cannot determine the exact function.

Since we cannot determine the exact function from the given information, we cannot provide the output for input 12 with certainty. We would need more information or a clearer pattern to solve this problem accurately.",-158,False,"[-12, -14]"

","To solve the problem, let's first try to find a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs. We can start by looking at the input-output pairs provided:

Input: 7, Output: -98
Input: 17, Output: -218
Input: 5, Output: -74
Input: 3, Output: -50
Input: -6, Output: 58

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by checking if the relationship is linear, quadratic, or some other form.

Looking at the outputs, they are all negative when the input is positive, and the one negative input has a positive output. This suggests that the function might involve a negative sign and possibly an absolute value or a condition that changes the sign based on the input.

Let's look at the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For input 7, output is -98, which is 7 * -14.
For input 17, output is -218, which is 17 * -14 + 20.
For input 5, output is -74, which is 5 * -14 + 6.
For input 3, output is -50, which is 3 * -14 + 2.
For input -6, output is 58, which is -6 * -14 + 16.

It seems that the output is related to the input multiplied by -14, plus an additional number that changes. However, the additional number does not have a clear pattern. Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the differences between the input multiplied by -14 and the actual output:

For input 7, 7 * -14 = -98, which matches the output exactly.
For input 17, 17 * -14 = -238, and the output is -218, so the difference is 20.
For input 5, 5 * -14 = -70, and the output is -74, so the difference is -4.
For input 3, 3 * -14 = -42, and the output is -50, so the difference is -8.
For input -6, -6 * -14 = 84, and the output is 58, so the difference is -26.

The differences do not form a clear pattern, but we can notice that the output is always less than the input multiplied by -14, except for the negative input.

Given the lack of a clear pattern in the differences, we might need to consider a more complex function or a piecewise function that behaves differently for positive and negative inputs.

Since we cannot determine the exact function with the information provided, we can make an educated guess for the input 11 based on the assumption that the function involves multiplying the input by -14 and then adjusting by a certain amount.

For input 11, let's first calculate 11 * -14:
11 * -14 = -154

Now, we need to guess the adjustment. If we assume the adjustment is similar to the one for input 7 (which had no adjustment), our best guess for the output when the input is 11 would be -154.

","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output based on the given pairs. Let's analyze the pairs:

Input: 7, Output: -98
Input: 17, Output: -218
Input: 5, Output: -74
Input: 3, Output: -50
Input: -6, Output: 58

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider that the output might be a function of the square of the input, since the output changes significantly with the input. Let's test this hypothesis by squaring the inputs and comparing them to the outputs:

Input: 7, 7^2 = 49, Output: -98
Input: 17, 17^2 = 289, Output: -218
Input: 5, 5^2 = 25, Output: -74
Input: 3, 3^2 = 9, Output: -50
Input: -6, (-6)^2 = 36, Output: 58

Now, let's see if there's a consistent operation we can apply to the squared input to get the output:

For input 7: 49 * x = -98 -> x = -98 / 49 -> x = -2
For input 17: 289 * x = -218 -> x = -218 / 289 -> x = -0.75467 (approximately, which doesn't match the pattern)
For input 5: 25 * x = -74 -> x = -74 / 25 -> x = -2.96 (approximately, which doesn't match the pattern)
For input 3: 9 * x = -50 -> x = -50 / 9 -> x = -5.55555 (approximately, which doesn't match the pattern)
For input -6: 36 * x = 58 -> x = 58 / 36 -> x = 1.61111 (approximately, which doesn't match the pattern)

The multiplication hypothesis doesn't seem to work consistently. Let's try a different approach, perhaps a linear function of the form f(x) = ax + b.

We can set up a system of equations using two of the input-output pairs to solve for a and b:

Let's use the pairs (7, -98) and (3, -50):
For input 7: a * 7 + b = -98
For input 3: a * 3 + b = -50

Now we have two equations:
7a + b = -98
3a + b = -50

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate b:
(7a + b) - (3a + b) = -98 - (-50)
4a = -48
a = -48 / 4
a = -12

Now we can solve for b using one of the equations, let's use 3a + b = -50:
3 * (-12) + b = -50
-36 + b = -50
b = -50 + 36
b = -14

So our function seems to be f(x) = -12x - 14. Let's verify this with the other pairs:

For input 17: -12 * 17 - 14 = -204 - 14 = -218 (matches)
For input 5: -12 * 5 - 14 = -60 - 14 = -74 (matches)
For input -6: -12 * (-6) - 14 = 72 - 14 = 58 (matches)

Now that we have our function, let's apply it to the new input:

Input: -15
f(x) = -12x - 14
f(-15) = -12 * (-15) - 14
f(-15) = 180 - 14
f(-15) = 166

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship, a quadratic relationship, or some other polynomial relationship.

Looking at the positive inputs first, it seems that as the input increases, the output becomes more negative, which suggests that the output is inversely proportional to the input. However, the output is negative for positive inputs and positive for a negative input, which suggests there might be a negative sign involved in the function.

Let's try to find a function of the form y = a * x + b, where a and b are constants.

For input 7:
a * 7 + b = -98

For input 17:
a * 17 + b = -218

Now let's find the difference between these two equations to eliminate b and solve for a:

(a * 17 + b) - (a * 7 + b) = -218 - (-98)
10a = -120
a = -12

Now that we have a, we can substitute it back into one of the equations to find b. Using the first equation:

-12 * 7 + b = -98
-84 + b = -98
b = -98 + 84
b = -14

So the function seems to be y = -12x - 14.

Let's verify this with the other given inputs:

For input 5:
-12 * 5 - 14 = -60 - 14 = -74 (matches the given output)

For input 3:
-12 * 3 - 14 = -36 - 14 = -50 (matches the given output)

For input -6:
-12 * (-6) - 14 = 72 - 14 = 58 (matches the given output)

The function y = -12x - 14 seems to work for all the given input-output pairs. Now let's use this function to find the output for the input -17:

y = -12 * (-17) - 14
y = 204 - 14
y = 190

Input: 18
","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -13 | Output: -197
Input: -11 | Output: -169
Input: 20   | Output: 265
Input: -10 | Output: -155
Input: 7    | Output: 83

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to check if the outputs are related to the squares of the inputs since the outputs are significantly larger than the inputs, which suggests a quadratic relationship.

Let's test this hypothesis by squaring the inputs and comparing them to the outputs:

(-13)^2 = 169, but the output is -197, which is 169 - 196 = -27 off.
(-11)^2 = 121, but the output is -169, which is 121 - 290 = -169 off.
(20)^2 = 400, but the output is 265, which is 400 - 135 off.
(-10)^2 = 100, but the output is -155, which is 100 - 255 = -155 off.
(7)^2 = 49, but the output is 83, which is 49 + 34 off.

The differences don't seem to follow a simple linear pattern, but we can notice that the difference is always a multiple of the input. Let's try to find a formula that involves the input (x) squared and a multiple of the input.

We can try to find a pattern by looking at the multiples of the inputs:

For -13: -197 + (13^2) = -197 + 169 = -28, which is 13 * 2 + 2.
For -11: -169 + (11^2) = -169 + 121 = -48, which is 11 * 4 + 4.
For 20: 265 - (20^2) = 265 - 400 = -135, which is 20 * -6 - 5.
For -10: -155 + (10^2) = -155 + 100 = -55, which is 10 * 5 + 5.
For 7: 83 - (7^2) = 83 - 49 = 34, which is 7 * 4 + 6.

It seems that the output is the input squared plus (or minus) a multiple of the input plus (or minus) a constant. However, the pattern for the constant is not immediately clear.

Let's try to find a consistent operation that applies to all inputs. We can notice that the multiples of the inputs are close to the input itself, possibly indicating that the formula involves the input squared plus or minus the input times a constant.

Let's try to find a formula of the form:
Output = Input^2 + (Input * k) + c

We can use two input-output pairs to solve for k and c. Let's use the pairs (-13, -197) and (-11, -169):

-197 = (-13)^2 - 13k + c
-169 = (-11)^2 - 11k + c

Solving for k and c, we get:
-197 = 169 - 13k + c
-169 = 121 - 11k + c

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
-28 = 48 - 2k
2k = 48 + 28
2k = 76
k = 38

Now we can substitute k back into one of the equations to find c:
-197 = 169 - 13*38 + c
-197 = 169 - 494 + c
c = -197 - 169 + 494
c = 128

So the formula seems to be:
Output = Input^2 - 38*Input + 128

Let's test this formula with the input 18:
Output = 18^2 - 38*18 + 128
Output = 324 - 684 + 128
Output = -360 + 128
Output = -232

Therefore, the final output for the input 18 is -232.

Input: -16
","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -13 | Output: -197
Input: -11 | Output: -169
Input: 20   | Output: 265
Input: -10 | Output: -155
Input: 7    | Output: 83

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider that the output might be a polynomial function of the input. Let's check if the outputs are related to the squares of the inputs, since the outputs are much larger than the inputs and change signs with negative inputs.

For input -13:
(-13)^2 = 169, but the output is -197, which is 169 + 28 = 197, but negative.

For input -11:
(-11)^2 = 121, and the output is -169, which is 121 + 48 = 169, but negative.

For input 20:
20^2 = 400, and the output is 265, which is 400 - 135 = 265.

For input -10:
(-10)^2 = 100, and the output is -155, which is 100 + 55 = 155, but negative.

For input 7:
7^2 = 49, and the output is 83, which is 49 + 34 = 83.

It seems that the output is related to the square of the input plus or minus a certain number. However, the number we add or subtract doesn't seem to be constant. Let's look for a pattern in the number we add or subtract:

For input -13, we added 28 to the square.
For input -11, we added 48 to the square.
For input 20, we subtracted 135 from the square.
For input -10, we added 55 to the square.
For input 7, we added 34 to the square.

The numbers we're adding or subtracting (28, 48, 135, 55, 34) don't show an obvious pattern. However, if we look at the relationship between the input and the number we're adding or subtracting, we might notice that it's related to the input itself:

For input -13, 13 * 2 + 2 = 28.
For input -11, 11 * 2 + 2 = 24 (but we need 48, so it seems we're doubling the result).
For input 20, 20 * 2 + 2 = 42 (but we need 135, so this doesn't fit).
For input -10, 10 * 2 + 2 = 22 (but we need 55, which is 22 * 2.5).
For input 7, 7 * 2 + 2 = 16 (but we need 34, which is 16 * 2 + 2).

The relationship between the input and the number we're adding or subtracting is not consistent across all examples. However, we can try to find a function that fits all the given points. One possible function that fits all the points is:

f(x) = x^2 + 12x + 5

Let's test this function with the given inputs:

For input -13:
f(-13) = (-13)^2 + 12*(-13) + 5 = 169 - 156 + 5 = 18, which is not correct.

Since the proposed function does not fit the given points, we need to reconsider our approach. Let's try a different method by looking at the differences between the squares of the inputs and the outputs:

For input -13, the difference is 169 - (-197) = 366, which is 13 * 2 + 2 * 13.
For input -11, the difference is 121 - (-169) = 290, which is 11 * 2 + 2 * 11.
For input 20, the difference is 400 - 265 = 135, which is 20 * 2 + 2 * 20.
For input -10, the difference is 100 - (-155) = 255, which is 10 * 2 + 2 * 10.
For input 7, the difference is 49 - 83 = -34, which is 7 * 2 + 2 * 7.

Now we can see a pattern: the difference between the square of the input and the output is (input * 2 + 2 * input). Simplifying this, we get:

Difference = input * (2 + 2) = input * 4

So the function seems to be:

f(x) = x^2 - 4x

Let's test this function with the given inputs:

For input -13:
f(-13) = (-13)^2 - 4*(-13) = 169 + 52 = 221, which is not correct.

We are still not finding the correct function. Let's try a different approach by looking at the differences between consecutive outputs and inputs:

Difference in output between -13 and -11 is -197 - (-169) = -28.
Difference in input is -13 - (-11) = -2.

Difference in output between -11 and 20 is -169 - 265 = -434.
Difference in input is -11 - 20 = -31.

Difference in output between 20 and -10 is 265 - (-155) = 420.
Difference in input is 20 - (-10) = 30.

Difference in output between -10 and 7 is -155 - 83 = -238.
Difference in input is -10 - 7 = -17.

The differences in outputs are not consistent with the differences in inputs. However, if we look at the absolute values of the differences in inputs and multiply them by 14, we get close to the differences in outputs:

|-2| * 14 = 28, which is close to the difference in output between -13 and -11.
|-31| * 14 = 434, which is the difference in output between -11 and 20.
|30| * 14 = 420, which is the difference in output between 20 and -10.
|-17| * 14 = 238, which is the difference in output between -10 and 7.

This suggests that the function might involve multiplying the input by 14 and then adding or subtracting a constant. Let's try the function:

f(x) = 14x + c

We need to find the constant c. Let's use one of the given input-output pairs to solve for c. We'll use the input -11 and output -169:

-169 = 14(-11) + c
-169 = -154 + c
c = -169 + 154
c = -15

So the function seems to be:

f(x) = 14x - 15

Let's test this function with the given inputs:

For input -13:
f(-13) = 14(-13) - 15 = -182 - 15 = -197, which is correct.

For input -11:
f(-11) = 14(-11) - 15 = -154 - 15 = -169, which is correct.

For input 20:
f(20) = 14(20) - 15 = 280 - 15 = 265, which is correct.

For input -10:
f(-10) = 14(-10) - 15 = -140 - 15 = -155, which is correct.

For input 7:
f(7) = 14(7) - 15 = 98 - 15 = 83, which is correct.

Now that we have a function that fits all the given points, we can use it to find the output for the input -16:

f(-16) = 14(-16) - 15 = -224 - 15 = -239

Input: 4
","To solve the problem, let's first try to find a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the input-output pairs:

-13 -> -197
-11 -> -169
20 -> 265
-10 -> -155
7 -> 83

We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. However, the change in outputs does not seem to be constant for a unit change in input, which suggests that the relationship might be quadratic or involve some other non-linear transformation.

Let's try to find a quadratic relationship by assuming the function is of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

Using the given pairs, we can set up a system of equations:

For input -13:
a(-13)^2 + b(-13) + c = -197
169a - 13b + c = -197

For input -11:
a(-11)^2 + b(-11) + c = -169
121a - 11b + c = -169

For input 20:
a(20)^2 + b(20) + c = 265
400a + 20b + c = 265

For input -10:
a(-10)^2 + b(-10) + c = -155
100a - 10b + c = -155

For input 7:
a(7)^2 + b(7) + c = 83
49a + 7b + c = 83

We have five equations with three unknowns, which is an overdetermined system. However, we can use any three of these equations to solve for a, b, and c. Let's use the equations for inputs -13, -11, and 20:

169a - 13b + c = -197
121a - 11b + c = -169
400a + 20b + c = 265

Solving this system of equations (which can be done using various methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations), we would find the values of a, b, and c that satisfy the equations.

However, we can also notice a pattern that might simplify the process. The outputs seem to be related to the squares of the inputs, but with some adjustments. Let's look at the square of each input and compare it to the output:

(-13)^2 = 169, and -197 is 169 - 13*2 - 1 = 169 - 26 - 1
(-11)^2 = 121, and -169 is 121 - 11*2 - 1 = 121 - 22 - 1
(20)^2 = 400, and 265 is 400 - 20*2 + 1 = 400 - 40 + 1
(-10)^2 = 100, and -155 is 100 - 10*2 - 1 = 100 - 20 - 1
(7)^2 = 49, and 83 is 49 + 7*2 + 1 = 49 + 14 + 1

It seems that the function could be f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 for positive x and f(x) = x^2 - 2x - 1 for negative x.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the new input:

Input: 4
f(4) = 4^2 - 2*4 + 1
f(4) = 16 - 8 + 1
f(4) = 9

Let's think step by step about what the function could be. Remember to write down 'Final Output:' before your final answer.
Input: 4
","To solve the problem, let's first try to find a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the input-output pairs:

-13 → -197
-11 → -169
20 → 265
-10 → -155
7 → 83

We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. However, the change in outputs does not seem to be consistent with the change in inputs, which suggests that the relationship might be quadratic or involve some other non-linear transformation.

Let's try to find a quadratic function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c that fits the data. We can use three pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for a, b, and c.

Using the pairs (-13, -197), (-11, -169), and (20, 265):

For -13: a(-13)^2 + b(-13) + c = -197
For -11: a(-11)^2 + b(-11) + c = -169
For 20: a(20)^2 + b(20) + c = 265

Solving these equations simultaneously would give us the values of a, b, and c. However, to save time, we can notice a pattern in the inputs and outputs. If we look at the difference between consecutive squares of the inputs and the corresponding outputs, we might find a relationship:

(-13)^2 = 169 and -197 + 169 = -28
(-11)^2 = 121 and -169 + 121 = -48
(20)^2 = 400 and 265 - 400 = -135
(-10)^2 = 100 and -155 + 100 = -55
(7)^2 = 49 and 83 - 49 = 34

It seems that the output is not a simple multiple of the square of the input. However, we can notice that the difference between the output and the input squared is decreasing by a constant amount as the input increases. This suggests that the function might be of the form:

f(x) = x^2 - kx + m

Where k is the constant difference and m is a constant that adjusts the output. To find k, we can look at the differences between the outputs and the input squares:

-28 to -48 is a difference of 20
-48 to -55 is a difference of 7
-55 to -135 is a difference of -80 (but this is for an input difference of 30, so per unit it would be -80/30 = -8/3)
34 to -135 is a difference of 169 (but this is for an input difference of -27, so per unit it would be 169/27)

The differences are not consistent, which suggests that the function might involve a higher degree or a different pattern. However, we can try to find a pattern by looking at the differences in the outputs for consecutive inputs:

-169 - (-197) = 28
-155 - (-169) = 14
83 - (-155) = 238

These differences do not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. However, we can notice that the difference between the outputs for inputs -13 and -11 is 28, and for -11 and -10 is 14, which is half of 28. This suggests that the difference might be related to the input in a linear way.

Let's try to find a function that fits the pattern we've observed. We can start by assuming that the function has the form:

f(x) = x^2 - kx + m

We can use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for k and m. Let's use the pairs (-13, -197) and (-11, -169):

For -13: (-13)^2 - k(-13) + m = -197
For -11: (-11)^2 - k(-11) + m = -169

Solving these equations simultaneously would give us the values of k and m. However, to save time, we can notice that the difference between the outputs for inputs -13 and -11 is 28, which is twice the difference between the inputs. This suggests that k might be 2.

Let's test this hypothesis with the input 7:

f(7) = 7^2 - 2(7) + m
49 - 14 + m = 83
35 + m = 83
m = 83 - 35
m = 48

Now we have a potential function:

f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 48

Let's test this function with another pair to see if it fits:

For -10: (-10)^2 - 2(-10) + 48 = 100 + 20 + 48 = 168, which is not equal to -155. This means our function is not correct.

Since the function we hypothesized does not fit all the data points, we need to reconsider our approach. It's possible that the function involves a combination of operations or a different pattern that we have not yet identified.

Given the complexity of the pattern and the limited data points, it's challenging to determine the exact function without additional information or a more systematic method of analysis. However, we can try to find a function that fits all the given points using a system of equations or by plotting the points and looking for a curve that fits.

Without additional tools or information, we cannot accurately determine the function based solely on the given input-output pairs. Therefore, we cannot provide the correct output for the input of 4 using the information currently available.",41,False,"[14, -15]"

","To solve this problem, let's first try to determine the relationship between the inputs and outputs given. We can start by looking for a pattern.

For the input -13, the output is -197.
For the input -11, the output is -169.
For the input 20, the output is 265.
For the input -10, the output is -155.
For the input 7, the output is 83.

Let's see if we can find a pattern by examining the differences between the inputs and outputs.

For -13: |(-13)^2| = 169, and -197 is 28 less than 169.
For -11: |(-11)^2| = 121, and -169 is 48 less than 121.
For 20: |20^2| = 400, and 265 is 135 less than 400.
For -10: |(-10)^2| = 100, and -155 is 55 less than 100.
For 7: |7^2| = 49, and 83 is 34 more than 49.

The differences don't seem to follow a simple arithmetic pattern. However, if we look at the outputs, we can see that they might be related to the cube of the input minus the input itself. Let's test this hypothesis:

For -13: (-13)^3 - (-13) = -2197 + 13 = -2184, which is not equal to -197.
For -11: (-11)^3 - (-11) = -1331 + 11 = -1320, which is not equal to -169.
For 20: 20^3 - 20 = 8000 - 20 = 7980, which is not equal to 265.
For -10: (-10)^3 - (-10) = -1000 + 10 = -990, which is not equal to -155.
For 7: 7^3 - 7 = 343 - 7 = 336, which is not equal to 83.

This hypothesis is also incorrect. Let's try another approach. We can notice that the outputs are all odd numbers, which suggests that the function might involve squaring the input (which would always yield an even result for even inputs) and then adding or subtracting an odd number.

Let's try the function f(x) = x^2 + x - 1, which would give us an odd output for any integer input:

For -13: (-13)^2 + (-13) - 1 = 169 - 13 - 1 = 155, which is not equal to -197.
For -11: (-11)^2 + (-11) - 1 = 121 - 11 - 1 = 109, which is not equal to -169.
For 20: 20^2 + 20 - 1 = 400 + 20 - 1 = 419, which is not equal to 265.
For -10: (-10)^2 + (-10) - 1 = 100 - 10 - 1 = 89, which is not equal to -155.
For 7: 7^2 + 7 - 1 = 49 + 7 - 1 = 55, which is not equal to 83.

This function also does not match the given outputs. Let's try a different approach and look for a polynomial that might fit the data. Given that the outputs are not simply the square of the input, nor the cube minus the input, we might be dealing with a quadratic function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

We can use the given input-output pairs to set up a system of equations and solve for a, b, and c. However, since we have five input-output pairs, we would be overdetermined if we tried to fit a quadratic function. Instead, let's look for a pattern that involves both the square and the cube of the input.

After examining the inputs and outputs more closely, we can see that the output seems to be the input squared plus the input itself, with a sign change for negative inputs:

For -13: (-13)^2 + (-13) = 169 - 13 = 156, and the output is -197, which is 41 less than -156.

It seems that the function involves squaring the input, adding the input, and then adding or subtracting a number that changes with the input. However, the pattern for this additional number is not immediately clear.

Given the complexity of the pattern and the lack of a clear function, we may need to use a more sophisticated method to determine the exact function, such as regression analysis or another form of curve fitting with the given data points.

Input: -13
","To determine the function, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. Input: 9, Output: 160
2. Input: 13, Output: 228
3. Input: -4, Output: -61
4. Input: 15, Output: 262
5. Input: -20, Output: -333

We can start by looking for a pattern or a relationship between the inputs and outputs. One approach is to check if the output is a linear function of the input, which means it could be represented by an equation of the form:

Output = a * Input + b

To find the values of 'a' and 'b', we can use two input-output pairs to set up a system of equations. Let's use the pairs (9, 160) and (13, 228):

1. 160 = a * 9 + b
2. 228 = a * 13 + b

Now, let's solve for 'a' and 'b'. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate 'b':

228 - 160 = a * (13 - 9)
68 = 4a
a = 17

Now that we have 'a', we can substitute it back into one of the equations to find 'b'. Let's use the first equation:

160 = 17 * 9 + b
160 = 153 + b
b = 160 - 153
b = 7

So, the function seems to be:

Output = 17 * Input + 7

Let's verify this with another pair to make sure it's consistent:

Input: -4, Output: -61
-61 = 17 * (-4) + 7
-61 = -68 + 7
-61 = -61 (This matches, so our function seems correct.)

","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: 9  | Output: 160
Input: 13 | Output: 228
Input: -4 | Output: -61
Input: 15 | Output: 262
Input: -20| Output: -333

We can start by looking for a pattern or a mathematical relationship that can be applied to all the given pairs. One way to approach this is to look at the differences between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

For the positive inputs:
- When the input increases by 4 (from 9 to 13), the output increases by 68 (from 160 to 228).
- When the input increases by 2 (from 13 to 15), the output increases by 34 (from 228 to 262).

For the negative inputs:
- When the input decreases by 16 (from -4 to -20), the output decreases by 272 (from -61 to -333).

From these observations, we can see that the change in output is 17 times the change in input. This suggests a possible linear relationship of the form:

Output = 17 * Input + Constant

To find the constant, we can use one of the input-output pairs. Let's use the first pair (Input: 9, Output: 160):

160 = 17 * 9 + Constant
160 = 153 + Constant
Constant = 160 - 153
Constant = 7

So the relationship could be:

Output = 17 * Input + 7

Let's test this with the other given pairs:

For Input: 13,
Output = 17 * 13 + 7 = 221 + 7 = 228 (which matches the given output)

For Input: -4,
Output = 17 * (-4) + 7 = -68 + 7 = -61 (which matches the given output)

For Input: 15,

For Input: -20,
Output = 17 * (-20) + 7 = -340 + 7 = -333 (which matches the given output)

Now, let's apply this relationship to the new input:

Input: 13 → Output: 228
Input: -4 → Output: -61
Input: 15 → Output: 262

We can start by looking for a pattern or a relationship between the inputs and outputs. One approach is to check if the outputs are a result of a polynomial function of the inputs. We can try to find a linear relationship first, as it's the simplest form.

Let's assume the function is linear and in the form of f(x) = ax + b. We can use two input-output pairs to solve for a and b.

Using the input-output pairs (9, 160) and (13, 228):

For input 9:
160 = a * 9 + b

For input 13:
228 = a * 13 + b

Now we have two equations:
1) 160 = 9a + b
2) 228 = 13a + b

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
228 - 160 = 13a - 9a
68 = 4a
a = 68 / 4
a = 17

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b. Using the first equation:
160 = 9 * 17 + b
160 = 153 + b
b = 160 - 153
b = 7

So our linear function seems to be f(x) = 17x + 7. Let's check this against another input-output pair to see if it holds true.

For input -4 (expecting output -61):
f(-4) = 17 * (-4) + 7
f(-4) = -68 + 7
f(-4) = -61

This matches the given output for input -4. Let's check one more pair to be sure.

For input -20 (expecting output -333):
f(-20) = 17 * (-20) + 7
f(-20) = -340 + 7
f(-20) = -333

This also matches the given output for input -20. It seems we have found the correct function.

Input: 13, Output: 228
Input: -4, Output: -61
Input: 15, Output: 262
Input: -20, Output: -333

We can start by looking for a pattern or a relationship between the inputs and outputs. One approach is to check if the outputs are a result of a polynomial function of the inputs. We can try to find a polynomial that fits all the given points.

Let's denote the input as \( x \) and the output as \( f(x) \). We can try to find a polynomial of the form \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) that fits the data.

Using the given pairs, we can set up a system of equations:

For input 9: \( a(9)^2 + b(9) + c = 160 \)
For input 13: \( a(13)^2 + b(13) + c = 228 \)
For input -4: \( a(-4)^2 + b(-4) + c = -61 \)
For input 15: \( a(15)^2 + b(15) + c = 262 \)
For input -20: \( a(-20)^2 + b(-20) + c = -333 \)

Solving this system of equations is complex and would typically require more computational power than a human could easily manage without assistance. However, we can look for a simpler pattern by examining the differences between the outputs and the corresponding inputs.

Let's calculate the differences between the outputs and the square of the inputs:

For input 9: \( 160 - 9^2 = 160 - 81 = 79 \)
For input 13: \( 228 - 13^2 = 228 - 169 = 59 \)
For input -4: \( -61 - (-4)^2 = -61 - 16 = -77 \)
For input 15: \( 262 - 15^2 = 262 - 225 = 37 \)
For input -20: \( -333 - (-20)^2 = -333 - 400 = -733 \)

The differences do not form a simple arithmetic progression, so it's not a simple linear term being added to \( x^2 \). However, if we look at the inputs and corresponding differences, we might notice that the differences are close to being 18 less than 4 times the input:

For input 9: \( 4 \times 9 = 36 \), and \( 79 - 36 = 43 \), which is not 18.
For input 13: \( 4 \times 13 = 52 \), and \( 59 - 52 = 7 \), which is not 18.
For input -4: \( 4 \times -4 = -16 \), and \( -77 - (-16) = -61 \), which is not 18.
For input 15: \( 4 \times 15 = 60 \), and \( 37 - 60 = -23 \), which is not 18.
For input -20: \( 4 \times -20 = -80 \), and \( -733 - (-80) = -653 \), which is not 18.

The pattern is not immediately clear, and without additional information or computational tools, we cannot definitively determine the function. However, we can make an educated guess based on the pattern of the differences.

If we assume the function is quadratic and of the form \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \), we can guess that \( a \) is likely 1 since the output is close to the square of the input. The term \( bx \) could be related to the 4 times the input we observed, and \( c \) could be a constant that adjusts the output to fit the data.

Given the complexity of the problem and the lack of a clear pattern, we cannot provide a precise function without further analysis or computational assistance. Therefore, we cannot accurately predict the output for the input of 1.

For input 9: 9a + b = 160
For input 13: 13a + b = 228

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

(13a + b) - (9a + b) = 228 - 160
4a = 68
a = 68 / 4
a = 17

Now we can substitute the value of a back into one of the equations to find b. Using the first equation:

9a + b = 160
9(17) + b = 160
153 + b = 160
b = 160 - 153
b = 7

So the function seems to be f(x) = 17x + 7.

Let's verify this with another input-output pair, for example, the pair (-4, -61):

f(-4) = 17(-4) + 7
f(-4) = -68 + 7

It seems that negative inputs result in positive outputs and positive inputs result in negative outputs. This suggests that the function involves multiplying the input by a negative number. Also, the absolute value of the output increases as the absolute value of the input increases, which suggests that the function might be quadratic.

Let's try to find a quadratic function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c that fits the data.

For input -2 and output 17:
a(-2)^2 + b(-2) + c = 17
4a - 2b + c = 17

For input -10 and output 161:
a(-10)^2 + b(-10) + c = 161

For input -20 and output 341:
a(-20)^2 + b(-20) + c = 341
400a - 20b + c = 341

We have three equations with three unknowns. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a, b, and c.

Let's subtract the first equation from the second and the second from the third to eliminate c and find a relationship between a and b:

(100a - 10b + c) - (4a - 2b + c) = 161 - 17
96a - 8b = 144
12a - b = 18  (dividing by 8)

(400a - 20b + c) - (100a - 10b + c) = 341 - 161
300a - 10b = 180
30a - b = 18  (dividing by 10)

Now we have two equations:
12a - b = 18
30a - b = 18

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
18a = 0
a = 0

This is unexpected because a quadratic function would have a nonzero ""a"" term. However, since we found a = 0, the function is not quadratic but linear. Let's substitute a = 0 back into one of the equations to find b:

12(0) - b = 18
-b = 18
b = -18

Now we need to find c. We can use the first equation for this:
4(0) - 2(-18) + c = 17
c = 17 - 36
c = -19

So the function seems to be f(x) = -18x - 19.

Input: 7 | Output: -145
Input: -10 | Output: 161
Input: 9 | Output: -181
Input: -20 | Output: 341

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider whether the function is linear or quadratic, or if there's another operation at play. Since the outputs for both positive and negative inputs are negative and positive respectively, and the magnitude of the outputs increases more than linearly as the inputs move away from zero, it suggests that the function might involve squaring the input and possibly adding or subtracting a constant.

Let's try to find a function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c and see if we can determine the values of a, b, and c using the given pairs.

For input -2:
a(-2)^2 + b(-2) + c = 17
4a - 2b + c = 17

For input 7:
a(7)^2 + b(7) + c = -145

For input 9:

81a + 9b + c = -181

For input -20:
a(-20)^2 + b(-20) + c = 341
400a - 20b + c = 341

We have a system of equations. We can use any two equations to solve for a and b, and then use one of the equations to solve for c. However, since we are looking for a pattern, let's try to find a simpler relationship by examining the changes in output as the input changes.

Notice that when the input changes from -2 to 7 (an increase of 9), the output changes from 17 to -145 (a decrease of 162). Similarly, when the input changes from -10 to 9 (an increase of 19), the output changes from 161 to -181 (a decrease of 342). This suggests that the change in output is related to the square of the change in input.

Let's assume the function is of the form f(x) = ax^2 + k, where k is a constant, since the linear term does not seem to fit the pattern of changes we've observed.

For input -2:
a(-2)^2 + k = 17
4a + k = 17

For input -10:
a(-10)^2 + k = 161
100a + k = 161

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
96a = 144
a = 144 / 96
a = 1.5

Now we can find k using the equation for input -2:
4(1.5) + k = 17
6 + k = 17
k = 17 - 6
k = 11

So the function seems to be f(x) = 1.5x^2 + 11.

Let's test this function with the input 12:
f(12) = 1.5(12)^2 + 11

Input: 9

We can start by looking at the relationship between the inputs and outputs. It seems that negative inputs result in positive outputs and positive inputs result in negative outputs. This suggests that there might be a negative sign involved when the input is positive.

Let's try to find a function that fits the input-output pairs. We can start by assuming a quadratic function, since the outputs seem to be increasing at an increasing rate as the inputs move away from zero.

Let's assume the function is of the form:
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c

We can use the given input-output pairs to create equations and solve for a, b, and c.

For input -2 and output 17:
a(-2)^2 + b(-2) + c = 17
4a - 2b + c = 17  (1)

For input -10 and output 161:
a(-10)^2 + b(-10) + c = 161
100a - 10b + c = 161  (2)

For input -20 and output 341:
a(-20)^2 + b(-20) + c = 341
400a - 20b + c = 341  (3)

We can use these three equations to solve for a, b, and c. However, we can also notice a pattern that might simplify the process. The outputs are odd numbers, which suggests that c might be an odd number as well. Also, the change in output when the input changes seems to be related to the square of the input.

Let's look at the difference in outputs for consecutive squares of inputs:

For inputs -2 and -10 (difference of 8 units):
161 - 17 = 144
144 is 12^2, which is the square of the difference between -2 and -10 (8 units).

For inputs -10 and -20 (difference of 10 units):
341 - 161 = 180
180 is 9^2 + 9^2, which is twice the square of the difference between -10 and -20 (10 units).

This suggests that the function might be of the form:
f(x) = -x^2 + (some constant)

To find the constant, we can use one of the input-output pairs. Let's use the first one:

For input -2 and output 17:
f(-2) = -(-2)^2 + c = 17
-4 + c = 17
c = 21

So the function seems to be:
f(x) = -x^2 + 21

Let's verify this with another input-output pair:

For input 7 and output -145:
f(7) = -(7)^2 + 21 = -49 + 21 = -28
This does not match the given output of -145, so our function is not correct.

We need to reconsider our approach. Let's look at the differences in outputs again, but this time let's consider the absolute values of the inputs:

For inputs -2 and 7 (absolute difference of 9 units):
-145 - 17 = -162
162 is 9^2 * 2, which is twice the square of the absolute difference between -2 and 7.

For inputs -10 and 9 (absolute difference of 19 units):
-181 - 161 = -342
342 is 19^2 * 2, which is twice the square of the absolute difference between -10 and 9.

This suggests that the function might be of the form:
f(x) = -2x^2 + (some constant)

Let's use the input-output pair for input -2 and output 17 to find the constant:

For input -2:
f(-2) = -2(-2)^2 + c = 17
-2(4) + c = 17
-8 + c = 17
c = 25

So the function seems to be:
f(x) = -2x^2 + 25

Let's verify this with another input-output pair:

For input 7:
f(7) = -2(7)^2 + 25 = -2(49) + 25 = -98 + 25 = -73
This does not match the given output of -145, so our function is still not correct.

We need to find a different approach. Let's look at the pattern again, focusing on the sign change and the magnitude of the outputs:

For input -2 (which is 2 units away from 0):
Output is 17, which is 2^2 + 2^3 + 1.

For input 7 (which is 7 units away from 0):

Input: 12
","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -2 | Output: 17
Input: 7 | Output: -145
Input: -10 | Output: 161
Input: 9 | Output: -181
Input: -20 | Output: 341

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider whether the output is a function of the input squared, since the sign of the output changes with the sign of the input, which suggests that the function involves an odd power or a multiplication by the input itself.

Let's try to find a function f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d that fits the data. We can use the given pairs to set up a system of equations:

For input -2: -8a + 4b - 2c + d = 17
For input 7: 343a + 49b + 7c + d = -145
For input -10: -1000a + 100b - 10c + d = 161
For input 9: 729a + 81b + 9c + d = -181
For input -20: -8000a + 400b - 20c + d = 341

However, this system of equations seems too complex to solve without additional tools, and it's not guaranteed that the function is a cubic one. Let's look for a simpler pattern.

Notice that when the input is negative, the output is positive, and when the input is positive, the output is negative. This suggests that the function involves multiplication by the input, which would preserve the sign.

Also, the magnitude of the output increases as the magnitude of the input increases, which suggests that the function might involve squaring the input.

Let's try a simpler function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

For input -2: 4a - 2b + c = 17
For input 7: 49a + 7b + c = -145
For input -10: 100a - 10b + c = 161
For input 9: 81a + 9b + c = -181
For input -20: 400a - 20b + c = 341

This system is still complex, but we can look for a pattern in the changes between the outputs when the inputs change.

Let's consider the differences between consecutive outputs:

Output for 7 (-145) - Output for -2 (17) = -162
Output for -10 (161) - Output for 7 (-145) = 306
Output for 9 (-181) - Output for -10 (161) = -342
Output for -20 (341) - Output for 9 (-181) = 522

Now let's look at the differences between the inputs:

7 - (-2) = 9
-10 - 7 = -17
9 - (-10) = 19
-20 - 9 = -29

We can see that the change in output is roughly 18 times the change in input. This suggests that the function might involve 18 times the input. Since the output changes sign with the input, we can guess that the function might be of the form f(x) = -18x + c.

Let's test this with one of the input-output pairs:

For input -2: -18(-2) + c = 17
36 + c = 17
c = 17 - 36
c = -19

So the function could be f(x) = -18x - 19. Let's test this with another input-output pair to see if it holds:

For input 7: -18(7) - 19 = -126 - 19 = -145

This matches the given output for input 7. It seems we have found a pattern that works for the given pairs. Let's apply this function to the new input:

Input: 12
f(x) = -18x - 19
f(12) = -18(12) - 19
f(12) = -216 - 19

Input: -14
","To determine the function that transforms the input to the output, let's look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs.

Input: -2
Output: 17

Input: 7
Output: -145

Input: -10
Output: 161

Input: 9
Output: -181

Input: -20
Output: 341

We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship, but the change in outputs doesn't seem to be consistent with the change in inputs, so it's likely not linear. Let's consider if the function could be quadratic or involve higher powers.

One thing that stands out is that negative inputs give positive outputs and positive inputs give negative outputs. This suggests that there might be a negative sign involved for positive inputs and vice versa.

Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the absolute values of the outputs and see if they relate to the squares of the inputs:

|-2|^2 = 4
|17| = 17

|7|^2 = 49
|-145| = 145

|-10|^2 = 100
|161| = 161

|9|^2 = 81
|-181| = 181

|-20|^2 = 400
|341| = 341

Now, let's see if there's a relationship between the squares of the inputs and the absolute values of the outputs:

17 - 4 = 13
145 - 49 = 96
161 - 100 = 61
181 - 81 = 100
341 - 400 = -59

The differences don't form a clear pattern, but we can notice that the outputs are all 1 more than a multiple of 4 (since 16, 144, 160, 180, and 340 are all multiples of 4). This suggests that the function might involve 4 times the square of the input plus or minus 1, depending on the sign of the input.

Let's try this hypothesis:

For negative inputs: Output = 4 * (Input)^2 + 1
For positive inputs: Output = -4 * (Input)^2 - 1

Let's test this with the input of -14:

Output = 4 * (-14)^2 + 1
Output = 4 * 196 + 1
Output = 784 + 1
Output = 785

So, if our hypothesis is correct, the output for an input of -14 should be 785. Now, let's write down the final output as requested:

","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: 20 | Output: -307
Input: -1 | Output: 8
Input: 20 | Output: -307 (repeated, confirms the relationship is consistent)
Input: 12 | Output: -187
Input: 18 | Output: -277

We can see that the output is always negative when the input is positive, and the output is positive when the input is negative. This suggests that there might be a negative coefficient involved in the relationship.

Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the differences between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

For input 20, output is -307:
20 -> -307 (difference of -327)

For input -1, output is 8:
-1 -> 8 (difference of 9)

For input 12, output is -187:
12 -> -187 (difference of -199)

For input 18, output is -277:
18 -> -277 (difference of -295)

Looking at the differences, we can see that they are all odd numbers and they seem to be related to the input by a specific relationship. If we look closely, we can see that the difference is always 17 more than the input multiplied by -1.

For example:
20 * -1 = -20, and -20 - 17 = -37, which is the difference between 20 and -307.
-1 * -1 = 1, and 1 - 17 = -16, which is the difference between -1 and 8 when you consider that the output is the input minus the difference.

Let's apply this pattern to the new input of -8:

-8 * -1 = 8
8 - 17 = -9

So, if the input is -8, the output should be the input minus the difference, which is -8 - (-9) = -8 + 9 = 1.

We can see that the output decreases as the input increases, which suggests that the function might involve a negative coefficient. Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the differences between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

For input 20, the output is -307.
For input -1, the output is 8. The difference in input is 21 (20 - (-1)), and the difference in output is -315 (-307 - 8).

For input 12, the output is -187.
Comparing this with the input 20, the difference in input is 8 (20 - 12), and the difference in output is 120 (-307 - (-187)).

For input 18, the output is -277.
Comparing this with the input 20, the difference in input is 2 (20 - 18), and the difference in output is 30 (-307 - (-277)).

Let's see if we can find a consistent relationship between the differences in input and output. We can divide the output difference by the input difference to see if there's a constant factor:

For the difference between inputs 20 and -1:
Output difference: -315
Input difference: 21
-315 / 21 = -15

For the difference between inputs 20 and 12:
Output difference: 120
Input difference: 8
120 / 8 = 15

For the difference between inputs 20 and 18:
Output difference: 30
Input difference: 2
30 / 2 = 15

It seems that for every increase of 1 in the input, the output decreases by 15. This suggests a linear relationship of the form:

Output = -15 * Input + b

We need to find the value of b (the y-intercept). We can use one of the input-output pairs to do this. Let's use the input -1 and its output 8:

8 = -15 * (-1) + b
8 = 15 + b
b = 8 - 15
b = -7

So the function seems to be:

Output = -15 * Input - 7

Let's test this with the input -11:

Output = -15 * (-11) - 7

Input: 20, Output: -307 (repeated, confirms the function is consistent)
Input: 12, Output: -187
Input: 18, Output: -277

We can see that the output decreases as the input increases, which suggests that the function might involve subtraction or multiplication by a negative number. Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the differences between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

For input 20, output is -307.
For input 12, which is 8 less than 20, the output is -187, which is 120 more than -307.
For input 18, which is 2 less than 20, the output is -277, which is 30 more than -307.

It seems that for each decrease by 1 in the input, the output increases by a certain amount. Let's try to find the exact amount:

From 20 to 19 (a decrease of 1), the output would increase by 30/2 = 15 (since from 20 to 18, a decrease of 2, the output increases by 30).
From 20 to 12 (a decrease of 8), the output increases by 120, which is 120/8 = 15 per unit decrease.

This pattern suggests that for each unit decrease in input, the output increases by 15. Now let's try to find the function:

Let's assume the function is linear and has the form f(x) = ax + b.
For input 20, f(20) = a*20 + b = -307.
For input -1, f(-1) = a*(-1) + b = 8.

Now we have two equations:
20a + b = -307
-a + b = 8

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
21a = -315
a = -315 / 21
a = -15

Now we can substitute the value of a back into one of the equations to find b:
-(-15) + b = 8
15 + b = 8
b = 8 - 15
b = -7

So the function seems to be f(x) = -15x - 7.

Let's test this function with the input 3:

","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. Input: 20, Output: -307
2. Input: -1, Output: 8
3. Input: 20, Output: -307 (repeated, confirms the function is consistent)
4. Input: 12, Output: -187
5. Input: 18, Output: -277

We can see that the output is always negative when the input is positive, and the output is positive when the input is negative. This suggests that there might be a negative coefficient involved in the function.

Let's look at the differences between the inputs and outputs:

- For input 20, the output is -307. The difference is 20 - (-307) = 327.
- For input -1, the output is 8. The difference is -1 - 8 = -9.
- For input 12, the output is -187. The difference is 12 - (-187) = 199.
- For input 18, the output is -277. The difference is 18 - (-277) = 295.

It seems that the difference between the input and output is always an odd number. Moreover, if we look at the differences (327, 199, 295) for the positive inputs (20, 12, 18), they seem to be decreasing as the input decreases. This suggests that the function might be quadratic or involve some sort of squared term.

Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the squares of the inputs:

- 20^2 = 400
- 12^2 = 144
- 18^2 = 324

Now, let's see if there's a relationship between these squares and the outputs:

- 400 - 307 = 93
- 144 - 187 = -43
- 324 - 277 = 47

The differences here don't show an obvious pattern, but we can notice that the output is less than the square of the input for positive inputs. This suggests that the function might be of the form:

Output = -Input^2 + (some linear term) + (constant)

To determine the exact function, we would need more information or a systematic way to analyze the given pairs. However, since we are looking for a pattern, let's try to find a function that fits the given pairs.

We can start by assuming a quadratic function of the form:

Output = a * Input^2 + b * Input + c

We would need to solve for a, b, and c using the given pairs, but with the information provided, we can't determine a unique solution without more data points or additional constraints.

However, since we are asked to provide an output for the input -10 based on the pattern we've observed, we can make an educated guess. Given that the output increases when the input decreases (and is negative), we can assume that the output for input -10 would be higher than the output for input -1, which is 8.

Without the exact function, we can't provide a precise output, but we can say that the output for input -10 would likely be greater than 8.

","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: 20, Output: -307
Input: -1, Output: 8
Input: 20, Output: -307 (repeated, so it confirms the relationship is consistent)
Input: 12, Output: -187
Input: 18, Output: -277

We can see that the output decreases as the input increases, which suggests that the function might involve subtraction or multiplication by a negative number. Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the differences between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

For input 20, output is -307. If we subtract the input from the output, we get:
-307 - 20 = -327

For input -1, output is 8. If we subtract the input from the output, we get:
8 - (-1) = 9

For input 12, output is -187. If we subtract the input from the output, we get:
-187 - 12 = -199

For input 18, output is -277. If we subtract the input from the output, we get:
-277 - 18 = -295

Now, let's look at the differences we've calculated:
-327, 9, -199, -295

These numbers don't immediately suggest a simple arithmetic progression or geometric progression. However, we can notice that the numbers 327, 199, and 295 are all one less than a multiple of 100 (328, 200, and 296, respectively). The number 9 is also one less than 10, which is a power of 10.

This might suggest that the function involves squaring the input and then subtracting the input and an additional 1. Let's test this hypothesis with the given inputs:

For input 20:
(20^2) - 20 - 1 = 400 - 20 - 1 = 379 - 1 = 378
But we need -307, so we need to subtract an additional 685 to get from 378 to -307.

For input -1:
((-1)^2) - (-1) - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1
But we need 8, so we need to add 7 to get from 1 to 8.

For input 12:
(12^2) - 12 - 1 = 144 - 12 - 1 = 132 - 1 = 131
But we need -187, so we need to subtract an additional 318 to get from 131 to -187.

For input 18:
(18^2) - 18 - 1 = 324 - 18 - 1 = 306 - 1 = 305
But we need -277, so we need to subtract an additional 582 to get from 305 to -277.

The hypothesis of squaring the input, then subtracting the input and an additional 1, does not hold true for all cases, as we need to subtract different additional amounts for each input.

Let's try another approach. We can notice that the output is always 1 less than a multiple of 9 away from the square of the input:

For input 20:
(20^2) - 1 = 400 - 1 = 399, which is 9 * 44 + 3, and we need -307, so we subtract 9 * 79 (711) to get -307.

For input -1:
((-1)^2) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0, which is 9 * 0, and we need 8, so we add 9 to get 8.

For input 12:
(12^2) - 1 = 144 - 1 = 143, which is 9 * 15 + 8, and we need -187, so we subtract 9 * 37 (333) to get -187.

For input 18:
(18^2) - 1 = 324 - 1 = 323, which is 9 * 35 + 8, and we need -277, so we subtract 9 * 67 (603) to get -277.

This pattern suggests that the function might be:
f(x) = x^2 - 9y - 1, where y is an integer that makes the function output correct for each input.

Now, let's try to find the value of y for the input 14:
(14^2) - 1 = 196 - 1 = 195, which is 9 * 21 + 6

We need to find the correct y such that when we subtract 9y from 195, we get the correct output. Since we don't have the output for input 14, we can't determine the exact value of y without more information. However, we can say that the output will be 195 minus a multiple of 9.

Without the exact function or additional information, we cannot provide the final output for input 14. However, based on the pattern we've observed, we can say that the output will be in the form of 195 - 9y, where y is an integer that we need to determine.

Input: 13, Output: -66
Input: -20, Output: 132
Input: 18, Output: -96
Input: 0, Output: 12
Input: 11, Output: -54

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider the relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can try to find a linear relationship first, as it's the simplest form, which is generally y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to find the slope (m):

Using inputs 13 and -20:
For input 13, output is -66.
For input -20, output is 132.

The change in output (Δy) is 132 - (-66) = 198.
The change in input (Δx) is -20 - 13 = -33.
The slope (m) is Δy / Δx = 198 / -33 = -6.

Now let's find the y-intercept (b) using the slope we found and one of the input-output pairs. We can use the pair (0, 12) since it gives us the y-intercept directly when x is 0.

Input: 0, Output: 12 gives us b = 12.

So the tentative linear function is y = -6x + 12.

Let's verify this function with the other input-output pairs:

For input 13, the output should be -6(13) + 12 = -78 + 12 = -66, which matches.
For input 18, the output should be -6(18) + 12 = -108 + 12 = -96, which matches.
For input 11, the output should be -6(11) + 12 = -66 + 12 = -54, which matches.

Since the function y = -6x + 12 matches all the given input-output pairs, we can use it to find the output for the new input:

Input: 13 → Output: -66
Input: -20 → Output: 132
Input: 18 → Output: -96
Input: 0 → Output: 12
Input: 11 → Output: -54

We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. A linear function can be represented as f(x) = ax + b, where a and b are constants.

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to find the constants a and b:

Using Input: 0 → Output: 12, we get:
f(0) = a*0 + b = 12
b = 12

Now we know that the function has the form:
f(x) = ax + 12

Let's use another pair to find the value of a. We can use Input: 13 → Output: -66:
f(13) = a*13 + 12 = -66
13a = -66 - 12
13a = -78
a = -78 / 13
a = -6

Now we have the function:

Let's verify this function with another input-output pair to make sure it's correct:

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by looking for a linear relationship, which is of the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

Looking at the input-output pairs, when the input increases, the output seems to decrease, which suggests a negative slope. Let's try to find the slope (m) by taking two points and using the formula for slope:

m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Using the points (13, -66) and (11, -54):
m = (-54 - (-66)) / (11 - 13)
m = (12) / (-2)
m = -6

Now that we have the slope, let's find the y-intercept (b). We can use the point (0, 12) for this, since the input of 0 should give us the y-intercept directly.

b = 12

So, the function seems to be y = -6x + 12.

Let's test this function with one of the other given points to see if it holds true. We'll use the point (18, -96):

y = -6 * 18 + 12
y = -108 + 12
y = -96

This matches the given output for the input of 18, so our function seems to be correct.

Input: -1
","To solve the problem, let's first try to find a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs. We can start by looking at the input-output pairs provided:

Input: 13 -> Output: -66
Input: -20 -> Output: 132
Input: 18 -> Output: -96
Input: 0 -> Output: 12
Input: 11 -> Output: -54

Let's analyze the changes between the inputs and outputs:

For an increase from 11 to 13 (which is 2), the output decreases from -54 to -66 (which is -12).
For an increase from 13 to 18 (which is 5), the output decreases from -66 to -96 (which is -30).
For a decrease from 0 to -20 (which is -20), the output increases from 12 to 132 (which is 120).

It seems that the output is changing at a rate that is a multiple of the input change. Let's try to find a consistent multiplier.

If we assume the function is linear, we can express it as:
Output = a * Input + b

We can use two input-output pairs to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Let's use the pairs (13, -66) and (0, 12):

For Input = 13, Output = -66:
-66 = a * 13 + b

For Input = 0, Output = 12:
12 = a * 0 + b
From the second equation, we can see that b = 12.

Now we can substitute b back into the first equation:
-66 = a * 13 + 12
-66 - 12 = a * 13
-78 = a * 13
a = -78 / 13
a = -6

So the function seems to be:
Output = -6 * Input + 12

Let's verify this with another input-output pair, for example, Input = 18:
Output = -6 * 18 + 12
Output = -108 + 12
Output = -96

This matches the given output for Input = 18, so our function seems to be correct.

Let's use the pairs (13, -66) and (-20, 132):

For the first pair:
f(13) = a * 13 + b = -66

For the second pair:
f(-20) = a * (-20) + b = 132

Now we have a system of two equations:
13a + b = -66
-20a + b = 132

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
33a = -198
a = -198 / 33
a = -6

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b. Using the first equation:
13 * (-6) + b = -66
-78 + b = -66
b = -66 + 78
b = 12

So the function seems to be f(x) = -6x + 12.

Let's verify this with the other given pairs:

f(18) = -6 * 18 + 12 = -108 + 12 = -96 (matches the given output)
f(0) = -6 * 0 + 12 = 12 (matches the given output)
f(11) = -6 * 11 + 12 = -66 + 12 = -54 (matches the given output)

Input: -5  | Output: -109
Input: 16  | Output: 269
Input: -15 | Output: -289
Input: -15 | Output: -289

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider polynomial functions, as they are often used in these types of problems. We can try to fit a quadratic function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c to the data points.

Let's use two pairs to set up a system of equations and see if we can find a pattern:

For input -17 and output -325:
(-17)^2 * a + (-17) * b + c = -325
289a - 17b + c = -325

For input 16 and output 269:
(16)^2 * a + (16) * b + c = 269
256a + 16b + c = 269

We can notice that the coefficient 'a' seems to be positive in both cases, and the output is negative for negative inputs and positive for positive inputs. This suggests that 'a' is positive and that there is no absolute value involved.

Let's try to find 'a' by assuming that 'b' and 'c' are zero for a moment and see if the outputs are proportional to the squares of the inputs:

(-17)^2 = 289
-325 / 289 = -1.1246 approximately

(-5)^2 = 25
-109 / 25 = -4.36

(16)^2 = 256
269 / 256 = 1.0508 approximately

(-15)^2 = 225
-289 / 225 = -1.2844 approximately

The ratios are not constant, which means 'a' is not the only term in the function. However, we can see that the output is close to the input squared times a negative number for negative inputs and a positive number for positive inputs.

Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the differences between the squares of the inputs and the outputs:

For input -17:
289 - (-325) = 614

For input -5:
25 - (-109) = 134

For input 16:
256 - 269 = -13

For input -15:
225 - (-289) = 514

The differences don't show an obvious linear pattern, but we can notice that the difference for the positive input is much smaller than for the negative inputs. This suggests that there might be a linear term that has a different coefficient for positive and negative inputs.

Given the complexity of the pattern and the limited data, it's challenging to determine the exact function without more information or additional data points. However, we can try to make an educated guess based on the pattern of the differences.

Since the problem requires a step-by-step approach, let's summarize our findings:

1. The function is not a simple quadratic function.
2. The output is related to the square of the input but is not a direct multiple.
3. The difference between the square of the input and the output is not constant, suggesting additional terms in the function.

Without a clear pattern, we cannot definitively solve for the function. However, if we were to guess based on the pattern that the output is somewhat less than the square of the input for positive numbers and somewhat more for negative numbers, we could try a function like:

f(x) = x^2 - x - 12

Let's test this function with the input 11:

f(11) = 11^2 - 11 - 12
f(11) = 121 - 11 - 12
f(11) = 98

This is just a guess and is not based on a definitive pattern from the given data. Since we cannot determine the exact function with the given information, we cannot provide a final output for the input 11. However, if we had to guess based on the pattern, we would say:

We can start by looking for a pattern. One common approach is to check if the output is a polynomial function of the input. Let's try to find a polynomial that fits the data points.

We can start by assuming a quadratic function since we have a change in sign and a non-linear growth:

f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c

Let's use the given points to form equations:

For Input: -17, Output: -325
(-17)^2 * a + (-17) * b + c = -325
289a - 17b + c = -325

For Input: -5, Output: -109
(-5)^2 * a + (-5) * b + c = -109
25a - 5b + c = -109

For Input: 16, Output: 269
(16)^2 * a + (16) * b + c = 269
256a + 16b + c = 269

Now we have three equations with three unknowns. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a, b, and c. However, since we are looking for a pattern, we can also look for a simpler relationship.

Notice that the output is negative when the input is negative and positive when the input is positive. This suggests that the leading coefficient a is positive. Also, the magnitude of the output is much larger than the input, suggesting that the input is being squared or raised to a higher power.

Let's try to find a pattern by examining the differences between the outputs and the squares of the inputs:

(-17)^2 = 289, and 289 - 325 = 36
(-5)^2 = 25, and 25 - 109 = 84
(16)^2 = 256, and 256 - 269 = -13

The differences don't form an obvious linear pattern, so let's try cubing the inputs:

(-17)^3 = -4913, and -4913 + 325 = -4588
(-5)^3 = -125, and -125 + 109 = -16
(16)^3 = 4096, and 4096 - 269 = 3827

These differences also don't form a simple pattern. However, if we look at the relationship between the input squared and the output, we can see a potential linear relationship:

(-17)^2 = 289, and -325 = -289 - 36
(-5)^2 = 25, and -109 = -25 - 84
(16)^2 = 256, and 269 = 256 + 13

It seems that the output is the input squared with an added or subtracted value that changes with the input. Let's try to find a linear relationship for the added/subtracted value:

For Input: -17, the difference is -36
For Input: -5, the difference is -84
For Input: 16, the difference is 13

If we assume the added/subtracted value is a linear function of the input, we can express it as:

difference = k * input + m

Using the points (-17, -36) and (-5, -84), we can find the slope k:

k = (difference2 - difference1) / (input2 - input1)
k = (-84 - (-36)) / (-5 - (-17))
k = (-84 + 36) / (12)
k = -48 / 12
k = -4

Now we can find m using one of the points:

-36 = -4 * (-17) + m
-36 = 68 + m
m = -36 - 68
m = -104

So the difference seems to be -4 * input - 104. Let's check this with the positive input:

For Input: 16, the difference should be -4 * 16 - 104 = -64 - 104 = -168, but the actual difference is 13. This suggests that the relationship might be different for positive inputs.

Since the pattern is not immediately clear, we need to look for a more complex relationship or use a different approach to solve the system of equations. However, given the complexity of the problem and the limited data points, finding the exact function without additional information or computational tools is challenging.

For the purpose of this exercise, we can't determine the exact function with the information provided. However, if we were to guess the output for the input -16 based on the pattern that the output is the input squared with an added/subtracted value, we could try:

(-16)^2 = 256

And if we assume the added/subtracted value follows the same pattern as the negative inputs we've seen:

difference = -4 * (-16) - 104
difference = 64 - 104
difference = -40

So the output might be:

256 - 40 = 216

But this is purely speculative without a clear pattern or additional data points.

","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -17 | Output: -325
Input: -5  | Output: -109
Input: 16  | Output: 269
Input: -15 | Output: -289
Input: -15 | Output: -289 (repeated, so it doesn't provide new information)

We can notice that the output is always an odd number, which suggests that the function might involve squaring the input (which would always yield an even result for even inputs and odd result for odd inputs) and then either adding or subtracting a number to make it odd if it's not already.

Let's try to find a pattern by squaring the inputs and comparing them to the outputs:

(-17)^2 = 289, and the output is -325, which is 289 - (2*17 + 1) = 289 - 35 = 254 less than the square of the input.
(-5)^2 = 25, and the output is -109, which is 25 - (2*5 + 1) = 25 - 11 = 14 less than the square of the input.
(16)^2 = 256, and the output is 269, which is 256 + (2*16 + 1) = 256 + 33 = 289 more than the square of the input.
(-15)^2 = 225, and the output is -289, which is 225 - (2*15 + 1) = 225 - 31 = 194 less than the square of the input.

From this, we can see that the function seems to be:

f(x) = x^2 + (2x + 1) if x is positive
f(x) = x^2 - (2x + 1) if x is negative

Now let's apply this function to the new input:

Input: 14

f(14) = 14^2 + (2*14 + 1)
f(14) = 196 + (28 + 1)
f(14) = 196 + 29
f(14) = 225

So the output for the input 14 is 225.

","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -17 | Output: -325
Input: -5  | Output: -109
Input: 16  | Output: 269
Input: -15 | Output: -289
Input: -15 | Output: -289

We can notice that the output seems to be related to the input in a non-linear way. A common approach to finding the relationship is to look for a pattern or a formula that fits all the given pairs.

One way to approach this is to consider that the relationship might be quadratic, since the output changes more dramatically than a linear relationship would suggest. A quadratic function has the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For input -17, the output is -325. If we square -17, we get 289, and we need to find a and b such that -17^2 * a + (-17) * b + c = -325.

For input -5, the output is -109. If we square -5, we get 25, and we need to find a and b such that -5^2 * a + (-5) * b + c = -109.

For input 16, the output is 269. If we square 16, we get 256, and we need to find a and b such that 16^2 * a + 16 * b + c = 269.

For input -15, the output is -289. If we square -15, we get 225, and we need to find a and b such that -15^2 * a + (-15) * b + c = -289.

Since we have multiple input-output pairs, we can use them to solve for a, b, and c. However, we can also look for a pattern by examining the inputs and outputs more closely.

If we look at the input 16 and its output 269, we can try to find a relationship by trial and error. If we assume that the function is of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, we can try to find a pattern by plugging in the values:

For input 16, output 269:
(16^2 * a) + (16 * b) + c = 269
(256 * a) + (16 * b) + c = 269

For input -5, output -109:
(-5^2 * a) + (-5 * b) + c = -109
(25 * a) - (5 * b) + c = -109

By comparing these two equations, we can try to find a pattern or relationship between a, b, and c that satisfies both equations. However, without additional information or a third equation, we cannot definitively solve for a, b, and c.

Given that we do not have a clear pattern or formula, we can try to deduce the function by looking at the differences between the outputs and the squares of the inputs:

For input -17, output -325:
(-17)^2 = 289, and 289 - 325 = -36

For input -5, output -109:
(-5)^2 = 25, and 25 - 109 = -84

For input 16, output 269:
16^2 = 256, and 256 - 269 = -13

For input -15, output -289:
(-15)^2 = 225, and 225 - 289 = -64

We can see that the differences are not consistent, which suggests that the relationship is not simply the square of the input subtracted by a constant number.

However, if we look at the differences between the outputs and the squares of the inputs multiplied by a constant, we might find a pattern:

For input -17, output -325:
(-17)^2 * 1 = 289, and 289 * 1 - 325 = -36

For input -5, output -109:
(-5)^2 * 1 = 25, and 25 * 1 - 109 = -84

For input 16, output 269:
16^2 * 1 = 256, and 256 * 1 - 269 = -13

For input -15, output -289:
(-15)^2 * 1 = 225, and 225 * 1 - 289 = -64

We can see that the differences are not consistent, which suggests that the relationship is not simply the square of the input multiplied by a constant and then subtracted by another constant.

Without a clear pattern, we can try to look for other relationships or use a system of equations to solve for a, b, and c. However, with the information provided, we cannot definitively determine the function.

Input: -5  | Output: -109
Input: 16  | Output: 269
Input: -15 | Output: -289
Input: -15 | Output: -289 (repeated pair)

We can start by looking for a pattern or a mathematical relationship that can be applied to all the given pairs. One approach is to look for a polynomial function that fits the data, since the outputs seem to be related to the inputs in a non-linear way.

Let's try to find a function f(x) such that f(input) = output.

Given the symmetry in the change of sign between the inputs and outputs, we might suspect that the function involves squaring the input (since squaring a negative number results in a positive number, but the outputs are also negative, suggesting an additional operation).

Let's consider a quadratic function of the form:
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c

We can use the given pairs to create a system of equations to solve for a, b, and c. However, since we have only three unique input-output pairs, we can't determine a unique quadratic function without more information. But we can try to find a pattern by calculating the differences between the outputs and the square of the inputs:

For input -17:
(-17)^2 = 289
Output - (-17)^2 = -325 - 289 = -614

For input -5:
(-5)^2 = 25
Output - (-5)^2 = -109 - 25 = -134

For input 16:
16^2 = 256
Output - 16^2 = 269 - 256 = 13

For input -15 (we can use this pair since it's the same as the repeated one):
(-15)^2 = 225
Output - (-15)^2 = -289 - 225 = -514

Now, let's look for a pattern in these differences:
-614 = -17 * 36
-134 = -5 * 26 + 4 (since -5 * 26 = -130)
13 = 16 * 1 - 3 (since 16 * 1 = 16)
-514 = -15 * 34 + 1 (since -15 * 34 = -510)

It seems that the multiplier of the input is decreasing by 2 as we go from -17 to -5 to 16, and then increasing by 2 as we go from -5 to -15. This suggests a linear relationship between the input and the multiplier of the input in the difference.

Let's assume the function has the form:
f(x) = x^2 + kx - m

Where k is a linear function of x, and m is a constant that adjusts the output. We can try to find k and m using the pattern we've observed.

For input -12, let's predict the output using the pattern we've observed:
(-12)^2 = 144

If we follow the pattern of decreasing by 2 for the multiplier of the input in the difference, we would expect the multiplier for -12 to be between the multipliers for -17 and -5, which are 36 and 26, respectively. If we decrease by 2 from 36, we get 34, and if we decrease by 2 again, we get 32.

So, let's try a multiplier of 32 for -12:
-12 * 32 = -384

Now, we need to find the constant m that adjusts the output. We can use the output for -17 to find m:
-325 = (-17)^2 - 17 * 36 - m
-325 = 289 - 612 - m
-325 = -323 - m
m = 2

Now, let's apply this to the input -12:
f(-12) = (-12)^2 + (-12) * 32 - 2
f(-12) = 144 - 384 - 2
f(-12) = -240 - 2
f(-12) = -242

So, the predicted output for the input -12 is -242.

Input: -4, Output: -68

We can start by looking for a pattern. Let's try to find a function f(x) such that f(input) = output.

For the positive inputs:
- When the input is 10, the output is 142. If we assume a linear relationship, we might guess that the function is of the form f(x) = ax + b. Let's see if this holds for the other positive inputs.
- For input 15, the output is 217. If the relationship were linear with the same coefficients, we would expect that f(15) - f(10) = a(15 - 10).
- That means 217 - 142 = a * 5, which simplifies to 75 = a * 5, so a = 15.
- If a = 15, then we can find b by plugging in one of the input-output pairs. Let's use the input 10: 142 = 15 * 10 + b, which simplifies to 142 = 150 + b, so b = -8.

Now let's check if this function works for the negative inputs:
- For input -10, the output is -158. Using the function f(x) = 15x - 8, we get f(-10) = 15 * (-10) - 8 = -150 - 8 = -158, which matches the given output.
- For input -4, the output is -68. Using the function f(x) = 15x - 8, we get f(-4) = 15 * (-4) - 8 = -60 - 8 = -68, which also matches the given output.

It seems that the function f(x) = 15x - 8 works for all the given input-output pairs. Let's use this function to find the output for the input 18:

f(18) = 15 * 18 - 8

- For input 15, the output is 217. If the function is linear, we can create the following equation: 15a + b = 217.
- For input 13, the output is 187. This gives us another equation: 13a + b = 187.

Let's solve these two equations to find a and b:
15a + b = 217
13a + b = 187

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
2a = 30
a = 15

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b:
13a + b = 187
13(15) + b = 187
195 + b = 187
b = 187 - 195
b = -8

So our function for positive inputs seems to be f(x) = 15x - 8.

Let's check this with the input of 10:
f(10) = 15(10) - 8 = 150 - 8 = 142, which matches the output given.

- For input 13, the output is 187. Again, using the same function form, we would have 187 = a*13 + b.

Now let's look at the negative inputs:
- For input -10, the output is -158.
- For input -4, the output is -68.

The function seems to be consistent for both positive and negative inputs, suggesting that it is indeed linear. To find the exact function, we can set up a system of equations using the positive inputs and solve for a and b.

Let's use the inputs 10 and 15 to set up two equations:
1) 142 = a*10 + b
2) 217 = a*15 + b

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
217 - 142 = a*15 - a*10
75 = a*5
a = 75 / 5
a = 15

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b:
142 = 15*10 + b
142 = 150 + b
b = 142 - 150
b = -8

So our function seems to be f(x) = 15x - 8.

For positive inputs:
- When the input is 10, the output is 142. If we multiply 10 by 14, we get 140, which is close to 142. So, we might guess that the function involves multiplying the input by 14 and then adding or subtracting a number.
- When the input is 15, the output is 217. If we multiply 15 by 14, we get 210, which is 7 less than 217. This suggests that we might be adding 7 after multiplying by 14.
- When the input is 13, the output is 187. If we multiply 13 by 14, we get 182, which is 5 less than 187. This again suggests that we might be adding a number after multiplying by 14.

For negative inputs:
- When the input is -10, the output is -158. If we multiply -10 by 14, we get -140, which is 18 less than -158. This suggests that we might be subtracting 18 after multiplying by 14.
- When the input is -4, the output is -68. If we multiply -4 by 14, we get -56, which is 12 less than -68. This suggests that we might be subtracting 12 after multiplying by 14.

It seems that for positive numbers, we are adding a number after multiplying by 14, and for negative numbers, we are subtracting a number after multiplying by 14. However, the number we add or subtract is not consistent across all examples.

Let's try to find a consistent operation for both positive and negative inputs. We can notice that the difference between the output and the input multiplied by 14 is always a multiple of the input itself. For example:

- For input 10, (142 - 10 * 14) = 2 * 10
- For input 15, (217 - 15 * 14) = 1 * 15
- For input -10, (-158 - (-10) * 14) = -2 * -10
- For input -4, (-68 - (-4) * 14) = -2 * -4

It seems that the function could be f(x) = 14x + 2x for positive x and f(x) = 14x - 2x for negative x, which simplifies to f(x) = 16x for positive x and f(x) = 12x for negative x.

For positive inputs:
- When the input is 10, the output is 142. If we assume a linear relationship, we can try f(x) = ax + b. We need another point to solve for a and b.
- When the input is 15, the output is 217. Now we have two equations:
  1. 10a + b = 142
  2. 15a + b = 217

Solving these two equations, we get:
- Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us 5a = 75, so a = 15.
- Plugging a = 15 into the first equation gives us 10 * 15 + b = 142, so b = 142 - 150 = -8.

So for positive inputs, the function seems to be f(x) = 15x - 8.

For negative inputs:

","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -1 | Output: -8
Input: 5  | Output: 76
Input: 3  | Output: 48
Input: 8  | Output: 118
Input: 13 | Output: 188

We can start by looking for a pattern or a mathematical relationship that can be applied to all the given pairs. One approach is to look at the differences between the outputs and see if there is a consistent operation that can be applied to the inputs to achieve those outputs.

Let's calculate the differences between the outputs and their respective inputs:

For Input: -1, Output: -8, the difference is -8 - (-1) = -7
For Input: 5, Output: 76, the difference is 76 - 5 = 71
For Input: 3, Output: 48, the difference is 48 - 3 = 45
For Input: 8, Output: 118, the difference is 118 - 8 = 110
For Input: 13, Output: 188, the difference is 188 - 13 = 175

The differences don't immediately suggest a simple arithmetic progression or a common factor. However, if we look at the differences in terms of the inputs, we might notice a pattern:

-7 is 8 times -1 plus 1
71 is 8 times 5 plus 11
45 is 8 times 3 plus 21
110 is 8 times 8 plus 14
175 is 8 times 13 plus 19

It seems that the output could be 8 times the input plus an increasing odd number sequence (1, 11, 21, 14, 19). However, the sequence of odd numbers is not consistent, which suggests that there might be a mistake in the pattern we are observing.

Let's try a different approach. We can look for a polynomial function that fits the data points. Since we have five data points, we can try a polynomial of degree 4 or less.

Let's assume the function is a polynomial of the form:
f(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e

We can use the given input-output pairs to create a system of equations and solve for the coefficients a, b, c, d, and e. However, this process is complex and may not be necessary if we notice a simpler pattern.

Upon closer inspection, we can see that the output seems to be related to the cube of the input plus a multiple of the input itself. Let's test this hypothesis:

For Input: -1, (-1)^3 + 7(-1) = -1 - 7 = -8
For Input: 5, 5^3 + 7(5) = 125 + 35 = 160 (which does not match the given output of 76)
For Input: 3, 3^3 + 7(3) = 27 + 21 = 48

The hypothesis does not hold for the input of 5, so we need to refine our approach.

Let's try a different polynomial relationship, considering the input to the power of 3 (cubed) and then adding or subtracting a linear term of the input:

For Input: -1, (-1)^3 - 7(-1) = -1 + 7 = 6 (which does not match the given output of -8)
For Input: 5, 5^3 - 7(5) = 125 - 35 = 90 (which does not match the given output of 76)
For Input: 3, 3^3 - 7(3) = 27 - 21 = 6 (which does not match the given output of 48)

This approach also does not yield the correct outputs.

Given the complexity of the problem and the lack of a clear pattern, we may need to use a more sophisticated method, such as regression analysis or another form of curve fitting, to determine the exact function that relates the inputs to the outputs.

However, without additional tools or information, we cannot definitively determine the function based on the given data points. Therefore, we cannot provide the correct output for the input of 8 using the information currently available.

","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -1 | Output: -8
Input: 5 | Output: 76
Input: 3 | Output: 48
Input: 8 | Output: 118
Input: 13 | Output: 188

We can start by looking for a pattern or a mathematical relationship that can be applied to all the given pairs. One approach is to look at the differences between the outputs and see if there is a consistent change as the inputs increase.

Let's calculate the differences between consecutive outputs:

76 - (-8) = 84 (for input difference of 5 - (-1) = 6)
48 - 76 = -28 (for input difference of 3 - 5 = -2)
118 - 48 = 70 (for input difference of 8 - 3 = 5)
188 - 118 = 70 (for input difference of 13 - 8 = 5)

The differences between outputs do not form a consistent pattern, but we can notice that the output increases by 70 when the input increases by 5 (from 3 to 8 and from 8 to 13). This suggests a linear relationship.

Let's try to find a linear equation of the form y = mx + b that fits the data.

Using the input-output pair (5, 76) and (8, 118), we can set up two equations:

76 = 5m + b
118 = 8m + b

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

118 - 76 = 8m - 5m
42 = 3m
m = 14

Now we can use the value of m to find b using one of the equations:

76 = 5(14) + b
76 = 70 + b
b = 6

So the equation relating input (x) to output (y) seems to be:

y = 14x + 6

Let's verify this equation with the other given input-output pairs:

For input -1:
y = 14(-1) + 6 = -14 + 6 = -8 (matches the given output)

For input 3:
y = 14(3) + 6 = 42 + 6 = 48 (matches the given output)

For input 13:
y = 14(13) + 6 = 182 + 6 = 188 (matches the given output)

The equation seems to fit all the given pairs, so we can use it to find the output for the input -13:

y = 14(-13) + 6 = -182 + 6 = -176

","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -1 | Output: -8
Input: 5 | Output: 76
Input: 3 | Output: 48
Input: 8 | Output: 118
Input: 13 | Output: 188

We can start by looking for a pattern or a mathematical relationship that can be applied to all the given pairs. One approach is to look at the differences between the outputs and see if there is a consistent change as the inputs increase.

Let's calculate the differences between consecutive outputs:

Output for 5 - Output for -1 = 76 - (-8) = 84
Output for 3 - Output for 5 = 48 - 76 = -28
Output for 8 - Output for 3 = 118 - 48 = 70
Output for 13 - Output for 8 = 188 - 118 = 70

The differences are not consistent, which suggests that the relationship is not linear. However, we can notice that the output increases by a larger amount as the input increases, which might suggest a polynomial relationship.

Let's try to find a polynomial function that fits the data. We can start by assuming a quadratic function of the form:

f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c

We can use three input-output pairs to solve for a, b, and c. Let's use the pairs (-1, -8), (3, 48), and (5, 76).

For input -1:
a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c = -8
a - b + c = -8 ... (1)

For input 3:
a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 48
9a + 3b + c = 48 ... (2)

For input 5:
a(5)^2 + b(5) + c = 76
25a + 5b + c = 76 ... (3)

Now we have a system of three equations. We can solve this system to find the values of a, b, and c.

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) gives us:
8a + 4b = 56 ... (4)

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (3) gives us:
24a + 6b = 84 ... (5)

Now we can solve equations (4) and (5) for a and b.

Dividing equation (4) by 4 gives us:
2a + b = 14 ... (6)

Dividing equation (5) by 6 gives us:
4a + b = 14 ... (7)

Subtracting equation (6) from equation (7) gives us:
2a = 0
a = 0

Since a = 0, we can see that the relationship is not quadratic. This means we need to consider a higher degree polynomial or a different type of function.

Let's try a cubic function of the form:

f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d

We would need four equations to solve for four variables, but since we have five data points, we can use them to check our function once we find it.

However, given the complexity of solving cubic equations manually and the fact that we are looking for a pattern, let's look for a simpler relationship. We can notice that the output seems to be a multiple of the input plus a constant. Let's try to find a relationship of the form:

f(x) = k * x + m

We can use two input-output pairs to solve for k and m. Let's use the pairs (5, 76) and (3, 48).

For input 5:
k * 5 + m = 76 ... (8)

For input 3:
k * 3 + m = 48 ... (9)

Subtracting equation (9) from equation (8) gives us:
2k = 28
k = 14

Now we can substitute k back into equation (8) or (9) to find m. Using equation (8):

14 * 5 + m = 76
70 + m = 76
m = 76 - 70
m = 6

Now we have the function:
f(x) = 14x + 6

Let's check this function with the other input-output pairs:

For input -1:
f(-1) = 14(-1) + 6 = -14 + 6 = -8 (matches the given output)

For input 8:
f(8) = 14(8) + 6 = 112 + 6 = 118 (matches the given output)

For input 13:
f(13) = 14(13) + 6 = 182 + 6 = 188 (matches the given output)

The function seems to fit all the given data points. Now we can use it to find the output for the input -5:

We can start by looking for a pattern or a mathematical relationship that can be applied to all the given pairs. One approach is to look at the differences between the outputs and see if there is a consistent operation that can be applied to the inputs to achieve those outputs.

Let's look at the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For Input: -1, the difference is -1 - (-8) = 7
For Input: 5, the difference is 5 - 76 = -71
For Input: 3, the difference is 3 - 48 = -45
For Input: 8, the difference is 8 - 118 = -110
For Input: 13, the difference is 13 - 188 = -175

The differences don't immediately suggest a simple arithmetic operation. However, we can try to look for a pattern in the way the output changes as the input changes.

Let's consider the possibility of a polynomial relationship. Since we have five data points, we can consider a polynomial of degree 4 or less. We can try to find a polynomial function f(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e that fits the data points.

However, without going through a complex polynomial fitting process, we can look for a simpler relationship. We can notice that the output seems to be increasing at a rate that is more than linear but less than quadratic as the input increases. This suggests that the input might be multiplied by a certain factor and then either added or subtracted by a constant or another function of the input.

By examining the outputs more closely, we can see that they are all multiples of the input plus or minus a certain value. For example, when the input is 5, the output is 76, which is 5 times something plus or minus a number. We can try to find a multiplier and an additive or subtractive factor that fits all the data points.

Let's try to find a pattern by dividing the output by the input:

For Input: -1, -8 / -1 = 8
For Input: 5, 76 / 5 = 15.2
For Input: 3, 48 / 3 = 16
For Input: 8, 118 / 8 = 14.75
For Input: 13, 188 / 13 ≈ 14.46

The results are not consistent, which suggests that the relationship is not simply a matter of multiplying the input by a constant factor.

Given the complexity of determining the exact function without further information or a clear pattern, we can try to interpolate the function using the given points. However, without a clear pattern or additional tools, we cannot accurately determine the function or the output for the input of -6.

Since we cannot determine the exact function based on the given data points, we cannot provide the final output for the input of -6 with certainty. However, if we were to guess based on the pattern that the output increases as the input increases, we might assume that the output for -6 would be less than the output for -1, which is -8. But this would be purely speculative without a clear mathematical relationship.

Input: -1 | Output: -8
Input: 5 | Output: 76
Input: 3 | Output: 48
Input: 8 | Output: 118
Input: 13 | Output: 188

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by looking at the differences between the outputs and see if there's a consistent pattern that relates to the inputs.

From -1 to 5 (an increase of 6), the output increases from -8 to 76 (an increase of 84).
From 5 to 3 (a decrease of 2), the output decreases from 76 to 48 (a decrease of 28).
From 3 to 8 (an increase of 5), the output increases from 48 to 118 (an increase of 70).
From 8 to 13 (an increase of 5), the output increases from 118 to 188 (an increase of 70).

It seems that the change in output is related to the change in input by a multiple of 14 (since 84/6 = 14, and 28/2 = 14). This suggests that the function might be of the form y = 14x + b, where b is a constant.

Let's test this with the first input-output pair:
-1: 14(-1) + b = -8
-14 + b = -8
b = -8 + 14
b = 6

Now let's test this with another pair to see if it holds true:
5: 14(5) + 6 = 76
70 + 6 = 76

It seems to work. Let's apply this function to the new input:

2. Input: -19, Output: 122
3. Input: 17, Output: -94
4. Input: 15, Output: -82
5. Input: -6, Output: 44

Looking at the pairs, it seems that the output is not directly proportional to the input. Let's try to find a pattern by considering the possibility of a linear function first, which is of the form:

Output = a * Input + b

We can use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Let's use the first and the second pair:

For Input: 1, Output: 2
2 = a * 1 + b
2 = a + b (Equation 1)

For Input: -19, Output: 122
122 = a * (-19) + b
122 = -19a + b (Equation 2)

Now, let's solve these two equations simultaneously to find 'a' and 'b'.

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:
122 - 2 = -19a - a
120 = -20a
a = -6

Now, let's find 'b' using Equation 1:
2 = -6 * 1 + b
2 = -6 + b
b = 8

So, the linear function could be:
Output = -6 * Input + 8

Let's check this function with the other input-output pairs to see if it holds:

For Input: 17, Output should be -94 according to the third pair:
Output = -6 * 17 + 8
Output = -102 + 8
Output = -94 (This matches the given output for Input: 17)

For Input: -6, Output should be 44 according to the fifth pair:

","To solve the problem, let's first look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs. We can start by examining the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: 1, Output: 2
Input: -19, Output: 122
Input: 17, Output: -94
Input: 15, Output: -82
Input: -6, Output: 44

Let's try to find a function f(x) that could transform each input x to its corresponding output.

Looking at the positive inputs (1, 17, 15) and their outputs (2, -94, -82), it seems that the output is negative for positive inputs greater than 1, and positive for the input 1. This suggests that there might be a negative coefficient involved when the input is greater than 1.

For the negative inputs (-19, -6) and their outputs (122, 44), the output is positive and significantly larger than the input value. This suggests that the function might involve squaring the input or some other operation that results in a larger positive number when the input is negative.

Let's try to find a linear relationship first. We can look at the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For input 1, output 2: 2 - 1 = 1
For input -19, output 122: 122 - (-19) = 141
For input 17, output -94: -94 - 17 = -111
For input 15, output -82: -82 - 15 = -97
For input -6, output 44: 44 - (-6) = 50

The differences don't seem to follow a simple linear pattern. Let's consider a quadratic relationship, since the outputs for negative inputs suggest that the input might be squared.

We can try to find a function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. However, without more information or additional input-output pairs, it's difficult to determine the exact coefficients a, b, and c.

Given the complexity and the limited data, we can't determine the exact function with certainty. However, we can still calculate the output for the given input of -6 using the pattern we've observed.

3. Input: 17, Output: -94
4. Input: 15, Output: -82
5. Input: -6, Output: 44

Looking at the pairs, it seems that negative inputs result in positive outputs and positive inputs result in negative outputs. This suggests that there might be a multiplication or division by a negative number involved.

Let's try to find a pattern by calculating the difference between the input and output:

1. Output - Input = 2 - 1 = 1
2. Output - Input = 122 - (-19) = 122 + 19 = 141
3. Output - Input = -94 - 17 = -111
4. Output - Input = -82 - 15 = -97
5. Output - Input = 44 - (-6) = 44 + 6 = 50

The differences don't seem to follow a simple arithmetic progression. Let's try multiplying the input by a certain factor and then adding or subtracting a constant to see if we can find a pattern:

For the first pair, if we assume the function is f(x) = ax + b, then:
f(1) = a * 1 + b = 2
We need more information to solve for a and b, so let's look at the second pair:
f(-19) = a * (-19) + b = 122

Now we have two equations:
1. a + b = 2
2. -19a + b = 122

Let's solve this system of equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
-19a + b - (a + b) = 122 - 2
-20a = 120
a = -6

Now we can substitute a back into the first equation to find b:
-6 + b = 2
b = 8

So our function seems to be f(x) = -6x + 8. Let's verify this with the other pairs:

f(17) = -6 * 17 + 8 = -102 + 8 = -94 (matches the given output)
f(15) = -6 * 15 + 8 = -90 + 8 = -82 (matches the given output)

Looking at the pairs, it seems that negative inputs result in positive outputs and positive inputs result in negative outputs. This suggests that there might be a multiplication by -1 involved. Let's also look at the absolute differences between the inputs and outputs:

1. |1 - 2| = 1
2. |-19 - 122| = 141
3. |17 - (-94)| = 111
4. |15 - (-82)| = 97
5. |-6 - 44| = 50

The differences don't immediately suggest a simple arithmetic progression or a geometric progression. Let's try to find a pattern by considering the input multiplied by a certain factor and then adding or subtracting a number to get the output.

For input 1, if we multiply by -7 and subtract 5, we get the output:
1 * -7 - 5 = -7 - 5 = -12 (which is not 2, so this doesn't work)

Let's try another approach by looking at the inputs and outputs more closely. We can notice that the output seems to be a multiple of the input plus or minus a certain number. Let's try to find a linear relationship of the form:

Output = a * Input + b

We can use two pairs of inputs and outputs to form a system of equations and solve for a and b. Let's use the first and the last given pairs:

For Input: 1, Output: 2
2 = a * 1 + b
2 = a + b

For Input: -6, Output: 44
44 = a * (-6) + b
44 = -6a + b

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) a + b = 2
2) -6a + b = 44

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
-6a + b - (a + b) = 44 - 2
-6a + b - a - b = 42
-7a = 42
a = -6

Now we can substitute a back into the first equation to find b:
-6 + b = 2
b = 2 + 6
b = 8

So our formula seems to be:
Output = -6 * Input + 8

Let's test this formula with the given input of -16:
Output = -6 * (-16) + 8
Output = 96 + 8
Output = 104

Therefore, the final output for the input -16 is:

Input: 20
","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output based on the given pairs. Let's analyze the pairs:

1. Input: 1, Output: 2
2. Input: -19, Output: 122
3. Input: 17, Output: -94
4. Input: 15, Output: -82
5. Input: -6, Output: 44

Looking at the pairs, it seems that the output is not directly proportional to the input. Let's try to find a pattern by considering the differences between the inputs and outputs:

1. 2 - 1 = 1
2. 122 - (-19) = 141
3. -94 - 17 = -111
4. -82 - 15 = -97
5. 44 - (-6) = 50

The differences do not form an arithmetic sequence or any other immediately recognizable pattern. Let's try another approach by looking at the absolute differences and whether the input is positive or negative:

1. |2 - 1| = 1
2. |122 - (-19)| = 141
3. |-94 - 17| = 111
4. |-82 - 15| = 97
5. |44 - (-6)| = 50

The absolute differences are all multiples of 11, which might be a clue. Let's see if the input being positive or negative has an effect:

For positive inputs:
1. 1 -> 2 (1 * 1 + 1)
3. 17 -> -94 (17 * -6 - 4)
4. 15 -> -82 (15 * -6 - 2)

For negative inputs:
2. -19 -> 122 (-19 * -6 - 8)
5. -6 -> 44 (-6 * -6 - 8)

It seems that for positive inputs, the output is 6 times the negative of the input minus a small number (1, 2, or 4), and for negative inputs, the output is 6 times the negative of the input minus 8.

Let's test this hypothesis with the input of 20:

If the input is positive, the output might be 20 * -6 minus a small number. Since we don't have a consistent small number to subtract, let's look at the pattern for positive numbers:

1 -> 2 (1 * 1 + 1)
15 -> -82 (15 * -6 - 2)
17 -> -94 (17 * -6 - 4)

It seems that the number we subtract might be related to the input number itself. If we look at the input of 15 and 17, the number we subtract is 2 and 4, respectively, which are 1 less than the next odd number. If we apply this pattern, the next odd number after 20 is 21, and 1 less than that is 20.

So, for the input of 20, the output might be 20 * -6 - 20, which is -120 - 20 = -140.

Input: -16
","To solve the problem, let's first look for a pattern in the input-output pairs provided:

Input: -17 | Output: -292
Input: -6  | Output: -105
Input: -16 | Output: -275
Input: -18 | Output: -309
Input: 1   | Output: 14

We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. To do this, we can calculate the differences between the outputs and see if they correspond to the differences in the inputs.

Let's calculate the differences between consecutive inputs and their corresponding outputs:

For inputs -17 and -16, the output increases from -292 to -275, which is a difference of 17.
For inputs -16 and -18, the output decreases from -275 to -309, which is a difference of -34.
For inputs -6 and 1, the output increases from -105 to 14, which is a difference of 119.

The differences in outputs are not consistent with the differences in inputs, so it's not a simple linear relationship. However, we can notice that the inputs are all negative except for the last one, and the outputs are also negative except for the last one. This suggests that there might be a different function for negative inputs and positive inputs.

Let's try to find a pattern by considering the absolute values of the inputs and outputs:

For input -17 (absolute value 17), the output is -292. If we divide -292 by 17, we get approximately -17.18.
For input -6 (absolute value 6), the output is -105. If we divide -105 by 6, we get -17.5.
For input -16 (absolute value 16), the output is -275. If we divide -275 by 16, we get approximately -17.19.
For input -18 (absolute value 18), the output is -309. If we divide -309 by 18, we get approximately -17.17.

It seems that when we divide the output by the absolute value of the input, we get a number that is close to -17. This suggests that the function might involve multiplying the input by -17 and then adding or subtracting a certain number.

Let's try to find this number by using one of the input-output pairs:

For input -17, if we multiply it by -17, we get 289. The output is -292, which is 3 less than 289. So, it seems we might be subtracting 3 from the product of the input and -17.

Let's test this hypothesis with the input -16:

-16 * -17 = 272
272 - 3 = 269

However, the expected output for -16 is -275, not 269. This means our hypothesis is not correct. Let's try a different approach.

We can notice that the output is always 3 less than a multiple of 17. Let's see if we can find a pattern by adding 3 to each output and then dividing by 17:

For input -17, output is -292:
(-292 + 3) / 17 = -289 / 17 = -17

For input -6, output is -105:
(-105 + 3) / 17 = -102 / 17 = -6

For input -16, output is -275:
(-275 + 3) / 17 = -272 / 17 = -16

For input -18, output is -309:
(-309 + 3) / 17 = -306 / 17 = -18

For input 1, output is 14:
(14 + 3) / 17 = 17 / 17 = 1

Now we can see a clear pattern: the output is the input multiplied by -17 and then subtracted by 3.

Let's apply this to the input -16:

-16 * -17 = 272
272 - 3 = 269

But this is not the expected output for -16, which is -275. It seems we made an error in our previous calculation. Let's correct this:

For input -16, output is -275:
(-275 + 3) / 17 = -272 / 17 = -16

This confirms our pattern. Now, let's provide the final output for the input -16 using the pattern we've discovered:

Input: -5
","To solve the problem, let's first try to find a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs. We can start by looking at the differences between the inputs and outputs.

For the input -17, the output is -292. If we try to find a relationship between -17 and -292, we can consider that a function might involve multiplication, addition, or powers.

Let's try a simple linear function first, where the output is a multiple of the input plus some constant: f(x) = ax + b.

Using the given input-output pairs, we can set up equations to solve for a and b:

For input -17, output -292:
-17a + b = -292

For input -6, output -105:
-6a + b = -105

We can solve these two equations to find the values of a and b. However, since we have more than two input-output pairs, we should check if a linear function is consistent with all of them. If not, we may need to consider a more complex function, such as a quadratic function or a function involving powers.

Let's check if the outputs follow a linear pattern with the inputs:

(-17, -292) and (-16, -275) have a difference of 1 in input and 17 in output.
(-16, -275) and (-6, -105) have a difference of 10 in input and 170 in output.

The difference in output is 17 times the difference in input, which suggests a linear relationship where a = 17.

Let's use the pair (-17, -292) to find b:
-17(17) + b = -292
-289 + b = -292
b = -292 + 289
b = -3

So our function seems to be f(x) = 17x - 3.

Let's verify this with another pair, for example, (1, 14):
17(1) - 3 = 14
17 - 3 = 14
14 = 14

The function f(x) = 17x - 3 is consistent with this pair as well.

Now, let's apply this function to the input -5:
f(-5) = 17(-5) - 3
f(-5) = -85 - 3
f(-5) = -88

Input: -3
","To solve the problem, let's first try to find a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs. We can start by looking at the differences between the inputs and outputs.

For the input -17, the output is -292. If we try to find a relationship between -17 and -292, we can consider that a function might involve squaring the input since the output is much larger than the input. Let's try squaring the input and see what we get:

(-17)^2 = 289

Now, let's compare this with the output -292. We can see that 289 is close to 292, but we need to account for the negative sign and the small difference. If we subtract 3 from 289, we get 286, which is not the output we're looking for. However, if we subtract 17 (the input) from 289, we get:

289 - 17 = 272

This is still not -292, but we're getting closer. Let's try adding a constant to the squared input and then subtracting the input itself:

(-17)^2 + k - 17

We need to find the value of k that will give us -292. Let's try to solve for k using the given output:

289 + k - 17 = -292
k - 17 = -292 - 289
k - 17 = -581
k = -581 + 17
k = -564

Now let's test this with another input-output pair to see if the pattern holds:

For the input -6, the output is -105. Using the same function:

(-6)^2 + k - 6
36 + k - 6 = -105
k - 6 = -105 - 36
k - 6 = -141
k = -141 + 6
k = -135

The value of k is different from what we found earlier, which means our function is not consistent across different inputs. Let's try a different approach.

We can notice that the output is always negative and the input is subtracted from the squared input. Let's try a function of the form:

f(x) = x^2 - Cx

where C is a constant that we need to determine. Let's use the input-output pair (-17, -292) to find C:

(-17)^2 - C(-17) = -292
289 + 17C = -292
17C = -292 - 289
17C = -581
C = -581 / 17
C = -34

Now let's test this with another input-output pair to see if the pattern holds:

For the input -6, the output is -105:

(-6)^2 - (-34)(-6) = -105
36 - 204 = -105
-168 = -105

This is not correct, so our function is still not consistent. Let's try adding a constant term to the function:

f(x) = x^2 - Cx + D

Using the input-output pair (-17, -292) to find D:

(-17)^2 - (-34)(-17) + D = -292
289 - 578 + D = -292
D = -292 - 289 + 578
D = -581 + 578
D = -3

Now let's test this with all the given input-output pairs:

For the input -6, the output is -105:

(-6)^2 - (-34)(-6) + (-3) = -105
36 - 204 - 3 = -105
-168 - 3 = -105
-171 = -105 (This is incorrect)

It seems that our function is still not consistent. We need to find a pattern that works for all given input-output pairs. Let's look at the differences between the squared input and the output:

For the input -17, the output is -292:

(-17)^2 = 289
Difference: 289 - (-292) = 581

For the input -6, the output is -105:

(-6)^2 = 36
Difference: 36 - (-105) = 141

For the input -16, the output is -275:

(-16)^2 = 256
Difference: 256 - (-275) = 531

For the input -18, the output is -309:

(-18)^2 = 324
Difference: 324 - (-309) = 633

For the input 1, the output is 14:

1^2 = 1
Difference: 1 - 14 = -13

We can see that the difference is not constant, but it seems to be related to the input multiplied by a certain number. Let's try to find a relationship between the input and the difference:

For the input -17, the difference is 581, which is 17 * 34 + 3.
For the input -6, the difference is 141, which is 6 * 23 + 3.
For the input -16, the difference is 531, which is 16 * 33 + 3.
For the input -18, the difference is 633, which is 18 * 35 + 3.
For the input 1, the difference is -13, which is 1 * (-17) + 3.

It seems that the multiplier increases by 1 for each decrease in the input by 1, starting from 34 for the input -17. Let's try to find the multiplier for the input -3:

Starting from -17 with a multiplier of 34, we count up to -3:
-17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3
  34,  33,  32,  31,  30,  29,  28,  27,  26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20

So, the multiplier for the input -3 is 20. Now let's calculate the output using the pattern we've found:

f(x) = x^2 - (20 * x) + 3

For the input -3:

f(-3) = (-3)^2 - (20 * -3) + 3
f(-3) = 9 + 60 + 3
f(-3) = 72

Therefore, the final output for the input -3 is 72.

Input: 11
","To solve this problem, let's first look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs. We can try to determine the function that transforms the input to the output.

Given pairs:
-17 → -292
-6 → -105
-16 → -275
-18 → -309
1 → 14

Let's try to find a relationship between the inputs and outputs. We can start by looking at the differences between consecutive inputs and outputs:

(-17 to -16) → (-292 to -275) = +17
(-16 to -6) → (-275 to -105) = +170 (over 10 steps, so +17 per step)
(-6 to 1) → (-105 to 14) = +119 (over 7 steps, so +17 per step)

It seems that for each step from one input to the next, the output increases by 17. This suggests a linear relationship. Let's try to find the function in the form of f(x) = ax + b.

We can use two pairs to form a system of equations and solve for a and b:

For input -17 and output -292:
-17a + b = -292

For input 1 and output 14:
a + b = 14

Now we can solve this system of equations. Let's multiply the second equation by 17 and add it to the first equation to eliminate b:

-17a + b = -292
17a + 17b = 238

Adding these equations, we get:
18b = -54
b = -54 / 18
b = -3

Now we can substitute b back into the second equation to find a:

a - 3 = 14
a = 14 + 3
a = 17

So the function seems to be f(x) = 17x - 3.

Let's test this function with the input 11:

f(11) = 17 * 11 - 3

Input: 14  | Output: -290
Input: -12 | Output: 230
Input: 16  | Output: -330
Input: 16  | Output: -330

We can notice that for negative inputs, the output is positive, and for positive inputs, the output is negative. This suggests that the output is being multiplied by -1 depending on the sign of the input.

Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the absolute values of the inputs and outputs:

|-7| = 7  | 130
|14| = 14 | 290
|-12| = 12 | 230
|16| = 16 | 330

Now, let's see if we can find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y) by examining the differences:

For input -7, the output is 130. If we multiply 7 by a number and add or subtract a constant, we might get 130. Let's assume the function is y = a * |x| + b.

Using the first pair (-7, 130):
130 = a * 7 + b

Using the second pair (14, -290):
-290 = a * 14 + b

Now we have two equations:
1) 130 = 7a + b
2) -290 = 14a + b

Let's solve this system of equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
-290 - 130 = 14a - 7a
-420 = 7a
a = -60

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b. Using the first equation:
130 = 7 * (-60) + b
130 = -420 + b
b = 130 + 420
b = 550

So the function seems to be y = -60 * |x| + 550, with the output being negative if the input is positive and positive if the input is negative.

Let's test this with the input 10:
y = -60 * |10| + 550
y = -600 + 550
y = -50

Since the input 10 is positive, the output should be negative, which matches our function.

We can notice that negative inputs result in positive outputs and positive inputs result in negative outputs. This suggests that the output might be a function that includes multiplication by -1. Also, the absolute value of the output seems to be increasing as the absolute value of the input increases.

Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the differences between the inputs and outputs:

- For an input of -7, the output is 130. If we multiply -7 by -20, we get 140, which is 10 more than 130.
- For an input of 14, the output is -290. If we multiply 14 by -20, we get -280, which is 10 less than -290.
- For an input of -12, the output is 230. If we multiply -12 by -20, we get 240, which is 10 more than 230.
- For an input of 16, the output is -330. If we multiply 16 by -20, we get -320, which is 10 less than -330.

From this pattern, it seems that the function could be:

Let's try to find a pattern by arranging the inputs and outputs in ascending order of input:

Input: -12 | Output: 230
Input: -7  | Output: 130
Input: 10  | Output: ?
Input: 14  | Output: -290
Input: 16  | Output: -330

Now, let's look at the differences between the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

For input -7 to 14 (difference of 21), the output changes from 130 to -290 (a difference of -420).
For input 14 to 16 (difference of 2), the output changes from -290 to -330 (a difference of -40).

It seems that for each unit increase in input, the output decreases by 20 (since -420/21 = -20 and -40/2 = -20).

Let's try to apply this pattern to find the output for the input of 10. We need to find a reference point that we can use to calculate the output for 10. The closest input we have in the list is 14 with an output of -290.

Since 10 is 4 units less than 14, and the output decreases by 20 for each unit increase in input, the output should increase by 20 for each unit decrease in input (because of the negative relationship).

So, for an input decrease from 14 to 10 (4 units), the output should increase by 4 * 20 = 80.

Starting from -290 (output for 14) and increasing by 80 gives us -290 + 80 = -210.

Therefore, the output for an input of 10 should be -210.

Input: 6
","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -7, Output: 130
Input: 14, Output: -290
Input: -12, Output: 230
Input: 16, Output: -330

We can notice that negative inputs result in positive outputs and positive inputs result in negative outputs. This suggests that the output might be a function that includes multiplication by -1. Also, the magnitude of the output seems to be increasing as the magnitude of the input increases.

Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the absolute values of the outputs and comparing them to the inputs:

For input -7, the absolute value of the output is 130.
For input 14, the absolute value of the output is 290.
For input -12, the absolute value of the output is 230.
For input 16, the absolute value of the output is 330.

It seems that the absolute value of the output is a multiple of the input. Let's try to find the multiplier:

130 / 7 = 18.57142857
290 / 14 = 20.71428571
230 / 12 = 19.16666667
330 / 16 = 20.625

The multipliers are not consistent, but they are all around 20. Let's see if adding or subtracting a constant to the input before multiplying could give us a consistent multiplier:

If we assume the function is of the form f(x) = -1 * (x + c) * m, where c is a constant to be added to the input and m is the multiplier, we can try to find c and m that fit all the given pairs.

Let's try to find c and m using two pairs of inputs and outputs:

Using input -7 and output 130:
130 = -1 * (-7 + c) * m
-130 = (-7 + c) * m
m = -130 / (-7 + c)

Using input 14 and output -290:
-290 = -1 * (14 + c) * m
290 = (14 + c) * m
m = 290 / (14 + c)

Now we have two equations for m:
-130 / (-7 + c) = 290 / (14 + c)

Let's solve for c:
-130 * (14 + c) = 290 * (-7 + c)
-1820 - 130c = -2030 + 290c
420c = 210
c = 0.5

Now we can find m using c = 0.5:
m = -130 / (-7 + 0.5)
m = -130 / -6.5
m = 20

So the function seems to be f(x) = -1 * (x + 0.5) * 20.

Let's test this function with the input 6:
f(6) = -1 * (6 + 0.5) * 20
f(6) = -1 * 6.5 * 20
f(6) = -1 * 130
f(6) = -130

Input: 14  | Output: -290
Input: -12 | Output: 230
Input: 16  | Output: -330
Input: 16  | Output: -330

We can notice that for negative inputs, the output is positive, and for positive inputs, the output is negative. This suggests that the function involves multiplying the input by a negative number. Also, the magnitude of the output seems to be increasing by a constant rate as the input increases.

Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the differences between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

For an increase of 21 in input (from -7 to 14), the output decreases by 420 (from 130 to -290).
For an increase of 5 in input (from -7 to -12), the output increases by 100 (from 130 to 230).
For an increase of 28 in input (from -12 to 16), the output decreases by 560 (from 230 to -330).

From these differences, we can infer that the output changes by 20 times the change in input. This suggests a function of the form:

Output = -20 * Input + Constant

To find the constant, we can use one of the input-output pairs. Let's use the first pair:

130 = -20 * (-7) + Constant
130 = 140 + Constant
Constant = 130 - 140
Constant = -10

So the function seems to be:

Output = -20 * Input - 10

Now let's apply this function to the new input:

Input: -8
Output = -20 * (-8) - 10
Output = 160 - 10

We can try to find a pattern or a mathematical relationship between the inputs and outputs. Let's look at the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For input -14:
Output (-97) - Input (-14) = -97 - (-14) = -97 + 14 = -83

For input 7:
Output (50) - Input (7) = 50 - 7 = 43

For input 2:
Output (15) - Input (2) = 15 - 2 = 13

The differences don't show a clear linear pattern. Let's try another approach, such as looking for a polynomial or a multiplicative relationship.

If we consider a linear function of the form f(x) = ax + b, we can use two input-output pairs to solve for a and b.

Using input-output pairs (7, 50) and (2, 15):

For input 7:
a * 7 + b = 50

For input 2:
a * 2 + b = 15

Now we have a system of two equations:

7a + b = 50
2a + b = 15

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:

5a = 35
a = 7

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b:

2 * 7 + b = 15
14 + b = 15
b = 1

So the function seems to be f(x) = 7x + 1. Let's check this with the input -14:

f(-14) = 7 * (-14) + 1 = -98 + 1 = -97

The function f(x) = 7x + 1 matches all the given input-output pairs. Now we can use this function to find the output for the input 9:

Input: -14
Output: -97

Input: 7
Output: 50

Input: 2
Output: 15

We can start by looking for a pattern. Let's try to find a function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants, and see if it fits the given data.

For the input -14 and output -97, we have:
f(-14) = a(-14)^2 + b(-14) + c = 196a - 14b + c = -97

For the input 7 and output 50, we have:
f(7) = a(7)^2 + b(7) + c = 49a + 7b + c = 50

For the input 2 and output 15, we have:
f(2) = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 4a + 2b + c = 15

Now we have a system of three equations:
1) 196a - 14b + c = -97
2) 49a + 7b + c = 50
3) 4a + 2b + c = 15

We can solve this system to find the values of a, b, and c. Subtracting the third equation from the second gives us:
49a + 7b + c - (4a + 2b + c) = 50 - 15
45a + 5b = 35
9a + b = 7  (dividing by 5)

Subtracting the third equation from the first gives us:
196a - 14b + c - (4a + 2b + c) = -97 - 15
192a - 16b = -112
12a - b = -7  (dividing by 16)

Now we have a simpler system:
4) 9a + b = 7
5) 12a - b = -7

Adding equations 4 and 5 gives us:
9a + b + 12a - b = 7 - 7
21a = 0
a = 0

Now that we know a = 0, we can substitute it back into equation 4 or 5 to find b:
9(0) + b = 7
b = 7

Now we can find c by substituting a and b into one of the original equations:
4(0) + 2(7) + c = 15
c = 15 - 14
c = 1

So the function seems to be f(x) = 7x + 1.

Let's verify this with the given input-output pairs:
f(-14) = 7(-14) + 1 = -98 + 1 = -97 (matches)
f(7) = 7(7) + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50 (matches)
f(2) = 7(2) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15 (matches)

Input: -14
Output: -97

Input: 2

We can start by looking for a pattern. Let's try to find a function f(x) such that f(input) = output.

For the input -14, the output is -97. If we assume the function is linear, it would have the form f(x) = ax + b. We can set up two equations using the two distinct input-output pairs to solve for a and b:

1) f(-14) = a(-14) + b = -97
2) f(7) = a(7) + b = 50

Let's solve this system of equations:

From equation 1:
-14a + b = -97 ... (1)

From equation 2:
7a + b = 50 ... (2)

We can multiply equation 2 by 2 to make the coefficient of a the same as in equation 1:

14a + 2b = 100 ... (3)

Now, we subtract equation 1 from equation 3:

14a + 2b - (-14a + b) = 100 - (-97)
14a + 2b + 14a - b = 100 + 97
28a + b = 197

Now we have a new system of equations:

-14a + b = -97 ... (1)
28a + b = 197 ... (4)

We can subtract equation 1 from equation 4:

28a + b - (-14a + b) = 197 - (-97)
28a + b + 14a - b = 197 + 97
42a = 294

Now we can solve for a:

a = 294 / 42
a = 7

Now that we have a, we can substitute it back into equation 1 or 2 to find b. Let's use equation 1:

-14(7) + b = -97
-98 + b = -97
b = -97 + 98
b = 1

So the function seems to be f(x) = 7x + 1.

Let's verify this with the third input-output pair:

f(2) = 7(2) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15

This matches the given output for input 2.

We can start by looking for a pattern. One way to approach this is to consider that the function could be a polynomial function, such as ax^2 + bx + c, or it could involve other operations like multiplication and addition.

Let's try to find a linear relationship first, assuming the function is of the form f(x) = ax + b.

For the input -14 and output -97, if the function is linear, it would look like:
-97 = a(-14) + b

For the input 7 and output 50, the function would be:
50 = a(7) + b

For the input 2 and output 15, the function would be:
15 = a(2) + b

Now we have a system of equations:
-97 = -14a + b
50 = 7a + b
15 = 2a + b

We can solve this system for a and b. Let's subtract the third equation from the second one to find a:
50 - 15 = 7a - 2a
35 = 5a
a = 7

Now we can find b by plugging the value of a into one of the equations:
15 = 2(7) + b
15 = 14 + b
b = 1

So the function seems to be f(x) = 7x + 1.

Let's verify this with the first input-output pair:

2. Input: 1, Output: -14
3. Input: -14, Output: 31
4. Input: -5, Output: 4
5. Input: -8, Output: 13

We can start by looking for a pattern. Let's consider the possibility of a linear function first, which has the form f(x) = ax + b.

However, a quick look at the pairs suggests that the relationship is not linear, as the difference between outputs is not consistent with the difference between inputs. Let's try to find a polynomial function that fits the data.

We can notice that the output seems to be the negative of the input squared, plus a constant. Let's test this hypothesis with the first pair:

Input: 5
Output: -26
Hypothesis: Output = -(Input)^2 + Constant
Calculation: -(5)^2 + Constant = -25 + Constant
To get -26, the Constant would need to be 1.

Let's test this with the second pair:

Input: 1
Output: -14
Calculation: -(1)^2 + Constant = -1 + Constant
To get -14, the Constant would need to be 13.

The constant is not consistent, so our hypothesis is incorrect. However, we can notice that the constant seems to be related to the input. Let's modify our hypothesis to include the input in the constant:

Hypothesis: Output = -(Input)^2 + (Input * C)

Let's test this with the first pair again:

Input: 5
Output: -26
Calculation: -(5)^2 + (5 * C) = -25 + (5 * C)
To get -26, 5 * C would need to be 1, so C = 1/5.

This doesn't seem to work with the second pair:

Input: 1
Output: -14
Calculation: -(1)^2 + (1 * C) = -1 + C
To get -14, C would need to be -13.

The hypothesis is still incorrect. Let's try a different approach. We can notice that the output is always the negative of the input squared plus a multiple of the input. Let's try to find a pattern in the multiples:

For Input: 5, Output: -26, the multiple of 5 is -1 (since -25 - 1 = -26).
For Input: 1, Output: -14, the multiple of 1 is -13 (since -1 - 13 = -14).

It seems that the multiple is the negative of the input minus another constant. Let's call this new constant D.

Hypothesis: Output = -(Input)^2 - (Input * (Input + D))

Let's test this with the first pair:

Input: 5
Output: -26
Calculation: -(5)^2 - (5 * (5 + D)) = -25 - (5 * (5 + D))
To get -26, - (5 * (5 + D)) would need to be -1, so (5 * (5 + D)) = 1, which means 25 + 5D = 1, so D = (1 - 25) / 5, D = -24 / 5, which is not an integer and doesn't seem to fit the pattern.

This approach is also incorrect. Let's try a different pattern. We can notice that the output is always the negative of the input squared plus a multiple of the input plus an additional constant. Let's call this constant E.

Hypothesis: Output = -(Input)^2 + (Input * F) + E

Let's test this with the first pair:

Input: 5
Output: -26
Calculation: -(5)^2 + (5 * F) + E = -25 + (5 * F) + E
To get -26, (5 * F) + E would need to be -1.

Let's test this with the second pair:

Input: 1
Output: -14
Calculation: -(1)^2 + (1 * F) + E = -1 + F + E
To get -14, F + E would need to be -13.

We have two equations now:
1. 5F + E = -1
2. F + E = -13

Let's solve this system of equations. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
5F + E - (F + E) = -1 - (-13)
4F = 12
F = 3

Now we can find E by plugging F into the second equation:
3 + E = -13
E = -16

Now we have a potential function:
Output = -(Input)^2 + 3 * Input - 16

Let's test this with the third pair:

Input: -14
Output: 31
Calculation: -(-14)^2 + 3 * (-14) - 16 = -196 - 42 - 16 = -254, which is not equal to 31.

This means our function is still incorrect. We need to find a different pattern. Given the complexity of the problem and the non-linearity of the function, it might be a non-trivial polynomial or another type of function entirely.

Since the pattern is not immediately clear, we can use the given pairs to try and derive the function. Let's use the pairs to create a system of equations:

Let's assume the function is a polynomial of degree n: f(x) = a_n*x^n + a_(n-1)*x^(n-1) + ... + a_1*x + a_0.

Using the given pairs, we can set up the following equations:

For Input: 5, Output: -26:
a_n*5^n + a_(n-1)*5^(n-1) + ... + a_1*5 + a_0 = -26

For Input: 1, Output: -14:
a_n*1^n + a_(n-1)*1^(n-1) + ... + a_1*1 + a_0 = -14

For Input: -14, Output: 31:
a_n*(-14)^n + a_(n-1)*(-14)^(n-1) + ... + a_1*(-14) + a_0 = 31

For Input: -5, Output: 4:
a_n*(-5)^n + a_(n-1)*(-5)^(n-1) + ... + a_1*(-5) + a_0 = 4

For Input: -8, Output: 13:
a_n*(-8)^n + a_(n-1)*(-8)^(n-1) + ... + a_1*(-8) + a_0 = 13

We have five equations and potentially five unknowns (if we assume the polynomial is of degree 4). We can solve this system of equations to find the coefficients a_n, a_(n-1), ..., a_1, a_0.

However, without additional tools or computational power, solving this system manually is impractical. We would typically use numerical methods or software like MATLAB or Python with libraries like NumPy to solve this system.

Given the complexity of the problem and the lack of a clear pattern, we cannot provide a definitive function or output for the new input of -8 without additional computational tools.

For input -5, the output is 4, which is -5 * -1 - 1.
For input -8, the output is 13, which is -8 * -2 + 3.

The pattern is not immediately clear, so let's try another approach. We can look for a polynomial function that fits the data points. However, given the limited data and the fact that the outputs do not follow a clear incremental pattern, finding a polynomial function might be complex.

Another approach is to look for a piecewise function or a function that behaves differently based on the input range. For example, the function might have one formula for positive inputs and another for negative inputs.

Let's try to find a relationship by considering the absolute values of the inputs and outputs:

For input 5 (positive), the output is -26, which is -5^2 - 1.
For input 1 (positive), the output is -14, which is -1^2 - 13.
For input -14 (negative), the output is 31, which is 2 * 14 + 3.
For input -5 (negative), the output is 4, which is 2 * 5 - 6.
For input -8 (negative), the output is 13, which is 2 * 8 - 3.

From this, we can see that for negative inputs, the output seems to be related to doubling the absolute value of the input and then adding or subtracting a number. For positive inputs, the output seems to be related to the square of the input, negated, and then subtracting a number.

However, without a clear and consistent pattern, it's challenging to determine the exact function. Given the complexity and the lack of a clear pattern, we may need more data points or additional information to accurately determine the function.

Since we cannot determine the exact function with the given information, we cannot provide a definitive output for the input of 14. Therefore, we cannot provide a ""Final Output"" for this input.",-53,False,"[-3, -11]"

Input: 8
","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: 5, Output: -26
Input: 1, Output: -14
Input: -14, Output: 31
Input: -5, Output: 4
Input: -8, Output: 13

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider whether the output is a linear function of the input, which would mean the output changes by a constant amount for a constant change in input. However, the changes in output here do not suggest a simple linear relationship.

Another approach is to look for a polynomial relationship. Since we have five points, we could try to fit a fourth-degree polynomial to the data, but that might be overly complex for this problem.

Instead, let's look for a simpler pattern. We can notice that the output seems to be negative when the input is positive, and positive when the input is negative. This suggests that there might be a negative sign involved in the relationship.

Let's try to find a function that fits the first pair (5, -26). If we assume the function is of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, we can try to find the values of a, b, and c that fit all the given pairs.

For input 5, the output is -26:
a(5)^2 + b(5) + c = -26
25a + 5b + c = -26

For input 1, the output is -14:
a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = -14
a + b + c = -14

For input -14, the output is 31:
a(-14)^2 + b(-14) + c = 31
196a - 14b + c = 31

For input -5, the output is 4:
a(-5)^2 + b(-5) + c = 4
25a - 5b + c = 4

For input -8, the output is 13:
a(-8)^2 + b(-8) + c = 13
64a - 8b + c = 13

We now have a system of equations. However, solving this system is complex and may not be necessary if we notice a pattern. Let's look at the inputs and outputs again, focusing on the relationship between the numbers:

For positive inputs (1 and 5), the output is negative and seems to be one less than a multiple of 5 (since -14 = -15 + 1 and -26 = -25 - 1).
For negative inputs (-14, -5, and -8), the output is positive and seems to be one more than a multiple of 7 (since 31 = 28 + 3, 4 = 7 - 3, and 13 = 14 - 1).

This suggests a possible piecewise function where the output is determined by whether the input is positive or negative. Let's try to find a function that fits this pattern:

For positive x, the output might be -5x - 1.
For negative x, the output might be 7x + 1.

Let's test this hypothesis with the given pairs:

For input 5 (positive), the output would be -5(5) - 1 = -25 - 1 = -26, which matches.
For input 1 (positive), the output would be -5(1) - 1 = -5 - 1 = -14, which matches.
For input -14 (negative), the output would be 7(-14) + 1 = -98 + 1 = -97, which does not match.
For input -5 (negative), the output would be 7(-5) + 1 = -35 + 1 = -34, which does not match.
For input -8 (negative), the output would be 7(-8) + 1 = -56 + 1 = -55, which does not match.

The hypothesis does not hold for the negative inputs. Let's try another approach. We can notice that the output seems to be the input squared, negated, and then either added or subtracted by a certain number. Let's test this with the input 5:

5 squared is 25, negated is -25, and subtracting 1 gives us -26.

Let's apply this to the other inputs:

1 squared is 1, negated is -1, and subtracting 13 gives us -14.
-14 squared is 196, negated is -196, and adding 227 gives us 31.
-5 squared is 25, negated is -25, and adding 29 gives us 4.
-8 squared is 64, negated is -64, and adding 77 gives us 13.

It seems that for positive inputs, we subtract 1, and for negative inputs, we add a number that results in a positive output that is 1 more than a multiple of 7. However, the added number is not consistent across the negative inputs.

Given the complexity of the pattern and the lack of a clear function, we may need to use a different strategy to find the output for the input 8. Since we cannot determine the exact function from the given pairs, we can look for a pattern that fits all the given data points.

One possible pattern that fits all the given data points is:

For positive x, the output is -5x - 1.
For negative x, the output is 7x + 1.

However, this pattern does not hold for all negative inputs, as shown in our previous attempt. Without a consistent pattern or additional information, we cannot accurately determine the output for the input 8.

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot provide a definitive output for the input 8. If there is a specific function or additional data points that we are missing, please provide them to help us solve the problem.",-35,False,"[-3, -11]"

Input: -12
","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: 5 | Output: -26
Input: 1 | Output: -14
Input: -14 | Output: 31
Input: -5 | Output: 4
Input: -8 | Output: 13

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider that the function could be a polynomial, and we can try to determine its degree and coefficients. However, given the small number of points and the fact that they don't suggest a simple polynomial relationship, we might want to look for a different kind of function.

Another approach is to look at the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For an input of 5, the output is -26, which is -31 away from the input.
For an input of 1, the output is -14, which is -15 away from the input.
For an input of -14, the output is 31, which is 45 away from the input.
For an input of -5, the output is 4, which is 9 away from the input.
For an input of -8, the output is 13, which is 21 away from the input.

We can notice that the differences are odd numbers: 31, 15, 45, 9, 21. These are all multiples of 3, except for 15, which is a multiple of 5. This might suggest that the function involves multiplying the input by an odd number and then adding or subtracting a constant.

Let's try to find a pattern in the differences:

31 = 5 * 6 + 1
15 = 5 * 3
45 = 5 * 9
9 = 5 * 2 - 1
21 = 5 * 4 + 1

It seems that the multiplier for the input is increasing by 3 each time, starting from 2 for the input of -5. However, this pattern does not hold for the input of 1, which would imply a multiplier of 0 if we were to follow the sequence.

Since the pattern is not immediately clear, let's try a different approach. We can look at the relationship between the input and output values and see if there's a consistent operation that transforms the input into the output.

If we multiply the input by -5 and then subtract 1, we get the following:

Input: 5 | Output: 5 * -5 - 1 = -25 - 1 = -26
Input: 1 | Output: 1 * -5 - 1 = -5 - 1 = -14 (This doesn't match, so this rule might not be correct)
Input: -14 | Output: -14 * -5 - 1 = 70 - 1 = 69 (This doesn't match either)
Input: -5 | Output: -5 * -5 - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24 (This doesn't match)
Input: -8 | Output: -8 * -5 - 1 = 40 - 1 = 39 (This doesn't match)

This rule does not work for all the given pairs, so we need to reconsider our approach.

Given the complexity of the problem and the lack of a clear pattern, we may need more information or a different method to determine the function. However, without additional data or a hint towards the nature of the function, we cannot accurately predict the output for an input of -12.

Input: 1 | Output: -14
Input: -14 | Output: 31
Input: -5 | Output: 4
Input: -8 | Output: 13

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider the possibility of a linear function, which can be represented as f(x) = ax + b. However, a quick glance at the numbers suggests that the relationship might not be linear, as the output does not consistently increase or decrease with the input.

Another approach is to look for a polynomial relationship. Given the small range of inputs and outputs, we might consider a quadratic function, which can be represented as f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

Let's try to find a quadratic function that fits the given pairs. We need three pairs to solve for a, b, and c in the quadratic equation. Let's use the first three pairs:

For input 5, output -26:
(1) a(5)^2 + b(5) + c = -26

For input 1, output -14:
(2) a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = -14

For input -14, output 31:
(3) a(-14)^2 + b(-14) + c = 31

Let's solve these equations:

From (1):
25a + 5b + c = -26

From (2):
a + b + c = -14

From (3):
196a - 14b + c = 31

Now we have a system of three equations. We can solve this system to find the values of a, b, and c.

Subtracting (2) from (1) gives us:
24a + 4b = -12
6a + b = -3  (dividing by 4)

Subtracting (2) from (3) gives us:
195a - 15b = 45
13a - b = 3  (dividing by 15)

Now we have a simpler system:
(4) 6a + b = -3
(5) 13a - b = 3

Adding (4) and (5) gives us:
19a = 0
a = 0

Using a = 0 in (4) gives us:
b = -3

Using a = 0 and b = -3 in (2) gives us:
c = -11

So the function seems to be f(x) = -3x - 11.

","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -9 | Output: 64
Input: -3 | Output: 22
Input: 9  | Output: -62
Input: -5 | Output: 36
Input: -16 | Output: 113

We can start by looking for a pattern. It seems that negative inputs result in positive outputs, and the one positive input results in a negative output. This suggests that there might be a piecewise function that behaves differently for positive and negative inputs.

Let's try to find a function for the negative inputs first. We can look for a polynomial function that fits the data points. We can start by assuming a quadratic function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

Using the input-output pairs for negative inputs:

For input -9, output 64:
a(-9)^2 + b(-9) + c = 64
81a - 9b + c = 64

For input -3, output 22:
a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c = 22
9a - 3b + c = 22

For input -5, output 36:
a(-5)^2 + b(-5) + c = 36
25a - 5b + c = 36

For input -16, output 113:
a(-16)^2 + b(-16) + c = 113
256a - 16b + c = 113

We have four equations with three unknowns (a, b, c). We can use any three of these equations to solve for a, b, and c. However, since we have an extra equation, we can check for consistency or use it to verify our solution.

Let's use the first three equations to solve for a, b, and c:

From the first and second equations, we can find a and b:
81a - 9b + c = 64
9a - 3b + c = 22

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
72a - 6b = 42
12a - b = 7
b = 12a - 7

Now, let's substitute b into the second equation:
9a - 3(12a - 7) + c = 22
9a - 36a + 21 + c = 22
-27a + c = 1
c = 1 + 27a

Now we have expressions for b and c in terms of a. We can substitute these into the third equation to find a:

25a - 5(12a - 7) + (1 + 27a) = 36
25a - 60a + 35 + 27a + 1 = 36
-8a + 36 = 36
-8a = 0
a = 0

This suggests that a quadratic term might not be present, as a = 0. Let's substitute a = 0 back into the equations for b and c:

b = 12(0) - 7 = -7
c = 1 + 27(0) = 1

So, the function for negative inputs seems to be f(x) = -7x + 1.

Let's verify this with the fourth equation:
256(0) - 16(-7) + 1 = 113
0 + 112 + 1 = 113
113 = 113

The function f(x) = -7x + 1 works for all negative inputs.

Now, let's consider the positive input:
Input: 9 | Output: -62

If we apply the same function to the positive input:
f(9) = -7(9) + 1 = -63 + 1 = -62

This matches the given output for the positive input.

Therefore, the function f(x) = -7x + 1 seems to work for both negative and positive inputs.

Now, let's find the output for the given input of 8 using the determined function:

","To determine the function that transforms the input to the output, let's look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs.

Input: -9 | Output: 64
Input: -3 | Output: 22
Input: 9 | Output: -62
Input: -5 | Output: 36
Input: -16 | Output: 113

Let's first check if there's a simple arithmetic relationship, such as addition or multiplication, that applies to all pairs.

For the first pair, if we consider the input -9, to get to 64, we might think of squaring the number and adding a constant. (-9)^2 = 81, and 81 - 17 = 64.

Let's see if this applies to the second pair:
(-3)^2 = 9, and 9 + 13 = 22.

This doesn't seem to follow the same pattern of subtracting 17 as we thought with the first pair.

Let's try another approach. We can look for a pattern in the changes between the inputs and outputs.

From -9 to -3 (a change of 6), the output changes from 64 to 22 (a change of -42).
From -3 to 9 (a change of 12), the output changes from 22 to -62 (a change of -84).
From -9 to -5 (a change of 4), the output changes from 64 to 36 (a change of -28).
From -16 to -9 (a change of 7), the output changes from 113 to 64 (a change of -49).

These changes don't seem to follow a simple arithmetic pattern either. However, we can notice that the output is always negative when the input is positive and positive when the input is negative. This suggests that there might be a piecewise function at play, where the function behaves differently for positive and negative inputs.

Let's try to find a relationship by considering the absolute values of the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

For negative inputs:
|-9| = 9 and 64 = 9^2 - 17
|-3| = 3 and 22 = 3^2 + 13
|-5| = 5 and 36 = 5^2 + 11
|-16| = 16 and 113 = 16^2 - 15

For the positive input:
|9| = 9 and -62 = -(9^2 + 44)

It seems that for negative inputs, the output is close to the square of the input plus or minus a small number. For the positive input, the output is the negative of the square of the input plus a larger number.

Given the inconsistency in the adjustments to the squares, it's difficult to determine a precise function without more information or a clearer pattern. However, we can make a guess for the input of 15 based on the pattern for positive inputs.

If we follow the pattern from the positive input we have (9), we might guess that the function involves squaring the input, then subtracting a certain value. For input 9, the output was -62, which is -9^2 - 44. If we apply a similar operation to 15:

15^2 = 225

If we subtract a similar number as we did with 9 (which was 44), we might guess:

225 - 44 = 181

However, this is purely speculative, as we don't have a consistent rule to apply. Without more information or a clearer pattern, we cannot determine the exact output for the input of 15. But based on the pattern we have, a speculative guess would be:

Input: -9 | Output: 64
Input: -3 | Output: 22
Input: 9  | Output: -62
Input: -5 | Output: 36
Input: -16 | Output: 113

We can start by looking for a pattern. It seems that negative inputs result in positive outputs and the positive input results in a negative output. This suggests that there might be a different rule for positive and negative inputs or that the input is being multiplied by a negative number.

Let's try to find a function f(x) that fits the input-output pairs. We can start by assuming the function is a polynomial of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

For the input -9 and output 64, the equation would be:
a(-9)^2 + b(-9) + c = 64
81a - 9b + c = 64

For the input -3 and output 22, the equation would be:
a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c = 22
9a - 3b + c = 22

For the input 9 and output -62, the equation would be:
a(9)^2 + b(9) + c = -62
81a + 9b + c = -62

For the input -5 and output 36, the equation would be:
a(-5)^2 + b(-5) + c = 36
25a - 5b + c = 36

For the input -16 and output 113, the equation would be:
a(-16)^2 + b(-16) + c = 113
256a - 16b + c = 113

We have a system of equations, but before we solve it, let's look for a pattern in the coefficients of a, b, and c. It seems that the coefficient of a is always the square of the input, the coefficient of b is always the negative input (for negative inputs), and c is a constant.

Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the differences between the outputs when the inputs increase:

From -16 to -9 (difference of 7), the output increases from 113 to 64 (difference of -49).
From -9 to -5 (difference of 4), the output decreases from 64 to 36 (difference of -28).
From -5 to -3 (difference of 2), the output decreases from 36 to 22 (difference of -14).
From -3 to 9 (difference of 12), the output decreases from 22 to -62 (difference of -84).

The differences in the outputs are multiples of 7 (-49, -28, -14, -84), which suggests that the function might involve 7 times the input. Since the outputs for negative inputs are positive and the output for the positive input is negative, it seems that the function involves subtracting 7 times the input from something.

Let's try the function f(x) = x^2 - 7x. We'll test it with the given inputs:

For input -9: (-9)^2 - 7(-9) = 81 + 63 = 144 (which is not the correct output, so we need to adjust our function).

We need to find the correct function that fits all the given pairs. Since the function we tried didn't work, let's look for a different pattern. We can notice that the output seems to be related to the square of the input plus an additional term. Let's try adding a constant to the function:

f(x) = x^2 - 7x + c

We can use one of the input-output pairs to solve for c. Let's use the pair (-3, 22):

(-3)^2 - 7(-3) + c = 22
9 + 21 + c = 22
c = 22 - 30
c = -8

Now let's try the function f(x) = x^2 - 7x - 8 with another pair to see if it fits:

For input -9: (-9)^2 - 7(-9) - 8 = 81 + 63 - 8 = 136 (which is not the correct output, so our function is still incorrect).

Since the function f(x) = x^2 - 7x - 8 does not fit all the given pairs, we need to adjust our approach. It's possible that the function involves an absolute value or a piecewise definition, given the change in sign for positive and negative inputs.

Given the complexity of the problem and the fact that we have not yet found a consistent pattern or rule that applies to all the given pairs, we may need more information or a different approach to determine the correct function.

Input: -5 | Output: 36

We can start by looking for a pattern. It seems that for negative inputs, the output is positive, and for the positive input, the output is negative. This suggests that the function involves multiplying the input by -1 if the input is positive.

Let's try to find a function that fits the input-output pairs for negative inputs:

For input -9, the output is 64. If we square -9, we get 81, and if we subtract 17, we get 64.
For input -3, the output is 22. If we square -3, we get 9, and if we subtract 17, we get -8, which is not 22. So, the function is not simply squaring the input and subtracting a constant.

Let's try another approach. We can look for a linear relationship by checking the differences between the outputs and the corresponding inputs:

For input -9, the difference is 64 - (-9) = 73.
For input -3, the difference is 22 - (-3) = 25.
For input -5, the difference is 36 - (-5) = 41.
For input -16, the difference is 113 - (-16) = 129.

The differences don't form an arithmetic sequence, so the relationship is not simply linear. However, we can notice that the differences are all odd numbers, which suggests that the output might be related to an odd function of the input.

Let's try to find a polynomial function that fits the data. We can start by assuming a quadratic function since the outputs are not linearly related to the inputs. A quadratic function has the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

Using the input-output pairs for negative inputs, we can set up equations to solve for a, b, and c:

For input -9: a(-9)^2 + b(-9) + c = 64
For input -3: a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c = 22
For input -5: a(-5)^2 + b(-5) + c = 36
For input -16: a(-16)^2 + b(-16) + c = 113

Solving these equations simultaneously is complex, but we can look for patterns to guess the values of a, b, and c. Let's try to find the simplest function that fits the data.

We can notice that the output is always 17 more than the square of the input for negative inputs:

(-9)^2 + 17 = 81 + 17 = 98 (which does not match the output of 64)
(-3)^2 + 17 = 9 + 17 = 26 (which does not match the output of 22)
(-5)^2 + 17 = 25 + 17 = 42 (which does not match the output of 36)
(-16)^2 + 17 = 256 + 17 = 273 (which does not match the output of 113)

This approach does not seem to work either. Let's try subtracting 17 from the square of the input:

(-9)^2 - 17 = 81 - 17 = 64 (which matches the output)
(-3)^2 - 17 = 9 - 17 = -8 (which does not match the output of 22)
(-5)^2 - 17 = 25 - 17 = 8 (which does not match the output of 36)
(-16)^2 - 17 = 256 - 17 = 239 (which does not match the output of 113)

This approach also does not work for all inputs. However, we can notice that the outputs for negative inputs are all one less than a multiple of 9:

64 = 9*7 + 1
22 = 9*2 + 4
36 = 9*4 + 0
113 = 9*12 + 5

This suggests that the output might be related to the input in a way that involves multiples of 9 plus an offset. Let's try to find a pattern in the offsets:

For input -9, the offset is 1.
For input -3, the offset is 4.
For input -5, the offset is 0.
For input -16, the offset is 5.

The offsets do not form a simple pattern, but we can notice that they are related to the input by the following function:

Offset = (Input + 9) / 2

Let's check if this function works for the given inputs:

For input -9: (-9 + 9) / 2 = 0 / 2 = 0 (which does not match the offset of 1)
For input -3: (-3 + 9) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3 (which does not match the offset of 4)
For input -5: (-5 + 9) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 (which does not match the offset of 0)
For input -16: (-16 + 9) / 2 = -7 / 2 = -3.5 (which does not match the offset of 5)

This function also does not work for all inputs. It seems that we need to find a different approach to determine the relationship between the input and the output.

Given the complexity of the problem and the lack of a clear pattern, we may need to use a more systematic approach, such as setting up a system of equations based on the given input-output pairs and solving for the coefficients of a polynomial function. However, without additional information or constraints, there could be multiple functions that fit the given data points.

Since the problem does not provide enough information to determine a unique function, and the patterns are not immediately clear, we cannot confidently provide the output for the input -17.

","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -9 | Output: 64
Input: -3 | Output: 22
Input: 9 | Output: -62
Input: -5 | Output: 36
Input: -16 | Output: 113

We can start by looking for a pattern. It seems that negative inputs result in positive outputs, and the one positive input results in a negative output. This suggests that there might be a negative sign involved when the input is positive.

Let's try to find a function f(x) that could transform the input to the output. We can start by assuming the function is a polynomial of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

For the input -9 and output 64, the equation would be:
a(-9)^2 + b(-9) + c = 64
81a - 9b + c = 64

For the input -3 and output 22, the equation would be:
a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c = 22
9a - 3b + c = 22

For the input 9 and output -62, the equation would be:
a(9)^2 + b(9) + c = -62
81a + 9b + c = -62

For the input -5 and output 36, the equation would be:
a(-5)^2 + b(-5) + c = 36
25a - 5b + c = 36

For the input -16 and output 113, the equation would be:
a(-16)^2 + b(-16) + c = 113
256a - 16b + c = 113

We have a system of equations, but before we solve it, let's look for a simpler pattern. Notice that the outputs are all one more than a multiple of 9 when the input is negative. This suggests that the function might involve 9 times the input plus or minus a constant.

For negative inputs:
Output = 9(-Input) + 1

Let's test this with the given inputs:
For -9: 9(9) + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82 (which is not correct, so our assumption is wrong)
For -3: 9(3) + 1 = 27 + 1 = 28 (which is also not correct)

Since our assumption is incorrect, let's try another approach. We can notice that the output seems to be the input squared plus or minus a certain number. Let's try to find a pattern based on the input squared:

For -9: (-9)^2 = 81, and 64 is 17 less than 81.
For -3: (-3)^2 = 9, and 22 is 13 more than 9.
For 9: (9)^2 = 81, and -62 is 143 less than 81.
For -5: (-5)^2 = 25, and 36 is 11 more than 25.
For -16: (-16)^2 = 256, and 113 is 143 less than 256.

It seems that when the input is negative, the output is the input squared minus a certain number, and when the input is positive, the output is the input squared minus a different number. However, the pattern is not immediately clear.

Given the complexity of the pattern and the lack of a clear function, we may need to use a different approach or more information to determine the exact function. Since we cannot determine the function with the given information, we cannot provide the output for the input of 14.

","To determine the function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs, let's look for a pattern in the input-output pairs provided:

Input: -20 | Output: 265
Input: -15 | Output: 195
Input: -10 | Output: 125
Input: -5  | Output: 55
Input: 6   | Output: -99

Let's first consider the negative inputs and their outputs. It seems that as the input increases by 5, the output increases by 70:

-20 → 265
-15 → 265 - 70 = 195
-10 → 195 - 70 = 125
-5 → 125 - 70 = 55

This suggests a linear relationship for negative inputs. The difference between the input values is 5, and the difference between the output values is 70. We can try to find the slope (m) of this linear function:

m = Δoutput / Δinput = 70 / 5 = 14

Now, let's try to find the y-intercept (b) of this linear function. We can use the input-output pair (-20, 265):

265 = 14 * (-20) + b
265 = -280 + b
b = 265 + 280
b = 545

So, for negative inputs, the function appears to be:
f(x) = 14x + 545

Now let's consider the positive input:
Input: 6 | Output: -99

This does not fit the pattern we found for negative inputs. Since we only have one positive input-output pair, we cannot determine a pattern for positive inputs with the same certainty. However, we can check if the function we derived for negative inputs applies to the positive input by plugging in x = 6:

f(6) = 14 * 6 + 545
f(6) = 84 + 545
f(6) = 629

This does not match the given output of -99 for an input of 6. Therefore, the function for positive inputs must be different. Without additional positive input-output pairs, we cannot determine the exact function for positive inputs.

Given that we do not have a clear function for positive inputs, we cannot accurately predict the output for an input of 11. However, if we assume that the pattern for negative inputs somehow applies to positive inputs, we can use the function we derived to calculate an output for 11:

f(11) = 14 * 11 + 545
f(11) = 154 + 545
f(11) = 699

But this is purely speculative and likely incorrect, as the function for positive inputs is not confirmed. Therefore, without further information or additional positive input-output pairs, we cannot provide a reliable output for an input of 11.

Input: -5  | Output: 55
Input: -10 | Output: 125
Input: 6   | Output: -99

We can start by looking for a pattern. It seems that for negative inputs, the output is positive, and for a positive input, the output is negative. This suggests that there might be a multiplication by -1 involved. Let's also look at the absolute values of the inputs and outputs to see if there's a simple mathematical operation that connects them.

For the negative inputs, let's consider the absolute values and see if we can find a pattern:

Input: 20 | Output: 265
Input: 15 | Output: 195
Input: 5  | Output: 55
Input: 10 | Output: 125

Now, let's try to find a relationship between these numbers. We can start by dividing the output by the input to see if there's a consistent multiplier:

265 / 20 = 13.25
195 / 15 = 13
55 / 5 = 11
125 / 10 = 12.5

The multipliers are not consistent, but they are close to being in the range of 11 to 13.25. This suggests that there might be a linear relationship with a slope and an intercept. Let's try to find a linear equation of the form:

Output = m * Input + b

Where m is the slope and b is the intercept. We can use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for m and b. Let's use the pairs (-20, 265) and (-10, 125):

For Input = -20:
265 = m * (-20) + b

For Input = -10:
125 = m * (-10) + b

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

-20m + b = 265
-10m + b = 125

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate b:

-20m + b - (-10m + b) = 265 - 125
-20m + b + 10m - b = 140
-10m = 140
m = -14

Now that we have m, we can solve for b using one of the equations:

-10m + b = 125
-10(-14) + b = 125
140 + b = 125
b = 125 - 140
b = -15

So our equation seems to be:

Output = -14 * Input - 15

Let's test this equation with the positive input:

Input: 6
Output = -14 * 6 - 15
Output = -84 - 15
Output = -99

This matches the given output for the input of 6. Now we can use this equation to find the output for the input of 10:

Output = -14 * 10 - 15
Output = -140 - 15
Output = -155

Input: -15 | Output: 195
Input: -5  | Output: 55
Input: -10 | Output: 125
Input: 6   | Output: -99

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to check if there's a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. However, the output does not change consistently as the input changes, so it's likely not a simple linear function.

Let's consider the possibility of a quadratic function or some polynomial function. We can look for a pattern in the changes of the output values:

- From -20 to -15 (a change of 5), the output increases from 265 to 195 (a decrease of 70).
- From -15 to -10 (a change of 5), the output increases from 195 to 125 (a decrease of 70).
- From -10 to -5 (a change of 5), the output increases from 125 to 55 (a decrease of 70).

This suggests that the output decreases by 70 when the input increases by 5, which hints at a linear relationship between the input and output. However, the input of 6 resulting in an output of -99 does not fit this pattern, suggesting that there might be different rules for positive and negative inputs.

Let's assume the function is different for negative and positive inputs. For negative inputs, we can see that the output decreases by 70 for every increase of 5 in the input. We can write this as:

Output = -14 * Input + k

Where k is a constant that we need to determine. Let's use one of the input-output pairs to find k. For example, with an input of -20:

265 = -14 * (-20) + k
265 = 280 + k
k = 265 - 280
k = -15

So for negative inputs, the function seems to be:

Output = -14 * Input - 15

Now let's test this function with the input of -7:

Output = -14 * (-7) - 15

Input: -5  | Output: 55

We can start by looking for a pattern. It seems that for negative inputs, the output is positive, and for a positive input, the output is negative. Let's see if there's a linear relationship by calculating the differences between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

For the negative inputs, let's see if there's a consistent difference when we increase the input by 5:

- From -20 to -15, the output increases by 195 - 265 = -70
- From -15 to -10, the output increases by 125 - 195 = -70
- From -10 to -5, the output increases by 55 - 125 = -70

This suggests a linear relationship for the negative inputs with a slope of -70 when the input increases by 5.

Now let's check the positive input:

- From -5 to 6, the output changes by -99 - 55 = -154

The change in input from -5 to 6 is 11, and the change in output is -154, which does not fit the pattern of -70 per 5 units of input change. This suggests that the relationship might be different for positive inputs or that there is a different function at play.

However, since we only have one positive input, it's difficult to determine the exact relationship for positive inputs. We can try to extend the pattern we found for negative inputs to the positive input of 5 and see if it fits.

If we were to continue the pattern of adding 70 for every decrease of 5 in the input, we would expect the output for an input of 0 to be 55 - 70 = -15. However, this does not match the pattern for the positive input of 6, which has an output of -99.

Given the inconsistency and lack of information for positive inputs, we can only make an educated guess based on the pattern we observed for negative inputs. If we assume the pattern continues linearly, we can try to predict the output for an input of 5 by extending the pattern from the negative inputs.

If the output for -5 is 55, and we assume the pattern continues with a slope of -70 for every 5 units of input, then the output for 0 would be 55 - 70 = -15, as mentioned earlier. Continuing this pattern, the output for 5 would be -15 - 70 = -85.

However, this is purely speculative, as we do not have enough information to confirm the pattern for positive inputs. Given the data provided, we can only make an educated guess.

Input: -5  | Output: 55
Input: -10 | Output: 125
Input: 6   | Output: -99

Let's first consider the positive and negative inputs separately to see if there's a different pattern for each.

For the negative inputs, it seems that as the input increases (becomes less negative), the output decreases. Let's see if we can find a relationship by looking at the differences between the inputs and outputs.

For the input of -20, the output is 265. If we add 20 to the input to get 0, let's see what happens if we subtract 20 from the output:

265 - 20 = 245

This doesn't match any of the given outputs, so let's try a different approach. Let's consider the absolute value of the input and see if there's a multiplication factor that can give us the output.

For input -20:
|-20| * x = 265
20x = 265
x = 265 / 20
x = 13.25

For input -15:
|-15| * x = 195
15x = 195
x = 195 / 15
x = 13

For input -10:
|-10| * x = 125
10x = 125
x = 125 / 10
x = 12.5

For input -5:
|-5| * x = 55
5x = 55
x = 55 / 5
x = 11

It seems that the multiplier decreases by 0.25 each time the input increases by 5. If we continue this pattern:

For input -17:
|-17| * x = Output
17x = Output

The multiplier for -20 was 13.25, and for -15 it was 13. If we decrease by 0.25 for each increment of 5 in the input, then for -17 (which is 2 away from -15), the multiplier should decrease by 0.25 * (2/5) = 0.1.

So the multiplier for -17 would be:
13 (multiplier for -15) - 0.1 = 12.9

Now we can calculate the output for -17:
17 * 12.9 = Output
Output = 219.3

However, all the given outputs are integers, so we might need to adjust our approach. Since we're looking for an integer output, let's consider that the multiplier decreases by 0.5 for each increment of 5 in the input, which would fit the pattern for the given integer outputs.

For input -17:
|-17| * x = Output
17x = Output

The multiplier for -15 was 13, so for -17 (which is 2 away from -15), the multiplier should decrease by 0.5 * (2/5) = 0.2.

So the multiplier for -17 would be:
13 (multiplier for -15) - 0.2 = 12.8

Now we can calculate the output for -17:
17 * 12.8 = Output
Output = 217.6

Since we're still not getting an integer, let's look at the pattern again. We notice that the multiplier decreases by 0.25 for each increment of 5 in the input, but the outputs are all integers. This suggests that there might be an additional constant being added or subtracted after the multiplication.

Let's try to find this constant by looking at the difference between the actual output and the product of the input and the multiplier we've found:

For input -20:
20 * 13.25 = 265 (no constant needed)

For input -15:
15 * 13 = 195 (no constant needed)

For input -10:
10 * 12.5 = 125 (no constant needed)

For input -5:
5 * 11 = 55 (no constant needed)

For input 6:
The pattern breaks here, as the input is positive and the output is negative. This suggests that there might be a different rule for positive inputs.

Since we cannot determine the exact function with the given information, especially considering the positive input case, we cannot confidently provide the output for the input of -17. However, we can make an educated guess based on the pattern we've observed for negative inputs.

If we assume the pattern holds and there is no additional constant, the output for -17, using a multiplier of 12.8, would be:

17 * 12.8 = 217.6

Since we need an integer output, we might round this to the nearest integer:

Output = 218

Therefore, an educated guess for the output, based on the observed pattern, would be:

","To solve the problem, let's first try to find a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the input-output pairs:

- For an input of -10, the output is -54.
- For an input of 4, the output is 2.
- For an input of -20, the output is -94.
- For an input of 4 (again), the output is 2 (consistent with the previous pair).
- For an input of -4, the output is -30.

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship, such as y = ax + b.

For the input of -10 (x = -10), the output is -54 (y = -54). If we assume a linear relationship, we can write:

-54 = a(-10) + b

For the input of 4 (x = 4), the output is 2 (y = 2):

2 = a(4) + b

Now we have two equations:

1) -54 = -10a + b
2) 2 = 4a + b

We can solve this system of equations for a and b. However, before we do that, let's check if the other input-output pairs are consistent with a linear relationship:

For the input of -20 (x = -20), the output is -94 (y = -94):

-94 = a(-20) + b

For the input of -4 (x = -4), the output is -30 (y = -30):

-30 = a(-4) + b

Let's use the two initial equations to solve for a and b:

From equation 2) 2 = 4a + b, we can express b as:

b = 2 - 4a

Substitute b into equation 1):

-54 = -10a + (2 - 4a)
-54 = -10a + 2 - 4a
-56 = -14a
a = 4

Now we can find b using the value of a:

b = 2 - 4(4)
b = 2 - 16
b = -14

So our assumed linear function is:

y = 4x - 14

Let's check this function with the other input-output pairs:

For x = -20:
y = 4(-20) - 14
y = -80 - 14
y = -94 (which matches the given output)

For x = -4:
y = 4(-4) - 14
y = -16 - 14
y = -30 (which matches the given output)

Since the function y = 4x - 14 matches all the given input-output pairs, we can use it to find the output for the input of 9:

y = 4(9) - 14
y = 36 - 14
y = 22

","To determine the function that transforms the input to the output, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -10 | Output: -54
Input: 4 | Output: 2
Input: -20 | Output: -94
Input: 4 | Output: 2
Input: -4 | Output: -30

Looking at the pairs, it seems that when the input is negative, the output is also negative, and when the input is positive, the output is positive. Let's try to find a pattern or a rule that applies to all the given pairs.

For the negative inputs:
- When the input is -10, the output is -54. If we multiply -10 by 5 and then subtract 4, we get -54 (-10 * 5 - 4 = -54).
- When the input is -20, the output is -94. If we multiply -20 by 5 and then subtract 4, we get -94 (-20 * 5 - 4 = -94).
- When the input is -4, the output is -30. If we multiply -4 by 5 and then subtract 4, we get -30 (-4 * 5 - 4 = -30).

For the positive inputs:
- When the input is 4, the output is 2. If we divide 4 by 2, we get 2 (4 / 2 = 2).

It seems that for negative inputs, the function could be f(x) = 5x - 4, and for positive inputs, the function could be f(x) = x / 2. However, this is not a definitive conclusion since we have only one example of a positive input and its corresponding output.

Let's apply the potential function to the new input:
Input: -2

If we use the function for negative inputs:
f(-2) = 5 * (-2) - 4 = -10 - 4 = -14

So, the output for the input -2 would be -14.

Input: -10 | Output: -54
Input: 4 | Output: 2
Input: -20 | Output: -94
Input: 4 | Output: 2
Input: -4 | Output: -30

Looking at the pairs, it seems that negative inputs result in negative outputs, and positive inputs result in positive outputs. Let's try to find a pattern by considering the possible operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

For the first pair:
-10 → -54
If we consider multiplication and addition, we can try multiplying the input by a certain number and then adding or subtracting another number to get the output. Let's assume the function is of the form f(x) = ax + b.

Using the first pair (-10, -54), we can set up the equation:
-10a + b = -54

Now let's use another pair with a negative input to find 'a' and 'b':
-20 → -94
-20a + b = -94

We have two equations now:
1) -10a + b = -54
2) -20a + b = -94

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
-10a = -40
a = 4

Now we can substitute 'a' back into one of the equations to find 'b':
-10 * 4 + b = -54
-40 + b = -54
b = -54 + 40
b = -14

So the function seems to be f(x) = 4x - 14.

Let's verify this with a positive input:
4 → 2
4 * 4 - 14 = 16 - 14 = 2

And with a negative input that is not in the original pairs:
-4 → -30
-4 * 4 - 14 = -16 - 14 = -30

The function f(x) = 4x - 14 seems to work for all the given pairs. Now let's apply it to the new input:

","To determine the function that transforms the input to the output, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -10 | Output: -54
Input: 4 | Output: 2
Input: -20 | Output: -94
Input: 4 | Output: 2
Input: -4 | Output: -30

Looking at the pairs, it seems that negative inputs result in negative outputs, and positive inputs result in positive outputs. Let's try to find a pattern or a rule that applies to all the given pairs.

For the input -10, the output is -54. If we try to find a relationship by considering a linear function of the form f(x) = ax + b, we can set up the following equation for the given pair (-10, -54):

a(-10) + b = -54

Similarly, for the input 4 and output 2, we have:

a(4) + b = 2

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

-10a + b = -54
4a + b = 2

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. Let's multiply the second equation by 2.5 to make the coefficient of a the same as in the first equation:

-10a + b = -54
10a + 2.5b = 5

Now, let's add the two equations:

-10a + b + 10a + 2.5b = -54 + 5
3.5b = -49

Divide both sides by 3.5:

b = -49 / 3.5
b = -14

Now that we have b, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find a. Let's use the second equation:

4a - 14 = 2
4a = 16
a = 4

So the function seems to be f(x) = 4x - 14.

Let's verify this with the other given pairs:

For input -20:
f(-20) = 4(-20) - 14 = -80 - 14 = -94 (matches the given output)

For input -4:
f(-4) = 4(-4) - 14 = -16 - 14 = -30 (matches the given output)

Input: 11
","To solve the problem, let's try to find a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs.

From the given input-output pairs:

- When the input is -10, the output is -54.
- When the input is 4, the output is 2.
- When the input is -20, the output is -94.
- When the input is 4 again, the output is still 2 (this confirms the function is consistent for the same input).
- When the input is -4, the output is -30.

Let's look for a pattern. We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. For a linear function, the change in output would be proportional to the change in input.

Let's calculate the differences between inputs and the corresponding outputs:

- For input -10, output -54: If we assume a linear function f(x) = ax + b, then -54 = -10a + b.
- For input 4, output 2: 2 = 4a + b.
- For input -20, output -94: -94 = -20a + b.
- For input -4, output -30: -30 = -4a + b.

Now, let's use two of these equations to solve for a and b. We can use the equations for inputs -10 and 4:

-54 = -10a + b (1)
2 = 4a + b (2)

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) gives us:

-56 = -14a
a = 4

Now we can substitute a back into equation (2) to find b:

2 = 4(4) + b
2 = 16 + b
b = 2 - 16
b = -14

So the function seems to be f(x) = 4x - 14.

Let's verify this with the other inputs:

- For input -20: f(-20) = 4(-20) - 14 = -80 - 14 = -94 (matches the given output).
- For input -4: f(-4) = 4(-4) - 14 = -16 - 14 = -30 (matches the given output).

Now, let's apply this function to the new input:

Input: -2  | Output: -2  (difference of 0)
Input: -7  | Output: -12 (difference of -5)
Input: -17 | Output: -32 (difference of -15)

It seems that the output is less than the input by a certain pattern. Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can see that the difference between the input and output increases as the input becomes more negative.

One possible relationship could be that the output is the input subtracted by the absolute value of the input divided by 2 (and possibly rounded down if necessary).

Let's test this hypothesis with the given pairs:

For input -11: (-11) - (|-11|/2) = -11 - 5.5 = -16.5 (rounded down to -17, but the actual output is -20)
For input -8: (-8) - (|-8|/2) = -8 - 4 = -12 (but the actual output is -14)
For input -2: (-2) - (|-2|/2) = -2 - 1 = -3 (but the actual output is -2)
For input -7: (-7) - (|-7|/2) = -7 - 3.5 = -10.5 (rounded down to -11, but the actual output is -12)
For input -17: (-17) - (|-17|/2) = -17 - 8.5 = -25.5 (rounded down to -26, but the actual output is -32)

The hypothesis does not hold for all cases, so let's try another approach.

Another possibility is that the function involves multiplying the input by a certain factor and then subtracting a constant. Let's see if we can find a pattern:

For input -11: If we multiply by 2, we get -22, and adding 2 gives us -20.
For input -8: If we multiply by 2, we get -16, and adding 2 gives us -14.
For input -2: If we multiply by 2, we get -4, and adding 2 gives us -2.
For input -7: If we multiply by 2, we get -14, and adding 2 gives us -12.
For input -17: If we multiply by 2, we get -34, and adding 2 gives us -32.

-11 - (-20) = 9
-8 - (-14) = 6
-2 - (-2) = 0
-7 - (-12) = 5
-17 - (-32) = 15

The differences are not constant, so it's not a simple linear function. However, if we look closely, we can see that the difference between the input and output seems to be related to the input itself. Let's try multiplying the input by a factor and then adding or subtracting a constant to see if we can find a pattern:

If we consider the possibility of the function being f(x) = 2x + C, where C is a constant, let's see if it fits the pattern:

For input -11:
2(-11) + C = -20
-22 + C = -20
C = 2

Let's test this with another pair:

For input -8:
2(-8) + 2 = -14

It seems to work. Let's test all the pairs to confirm:

For the first pair:

For the second pair:

For the fourth pair:

For the fifth pair:
-17 to -32: The difference is 15.

The differences don't immediately suggest a simple arithmetic operation like addition or multiplication. However, if we look closely, we might notice that the difference between the input and output seems to be related to the absolute value of the input.

Let's test this hypothesis by adding the absolute value of the input divided by 2 to the input itself:

For the first pair:
-11 + (|-11| / 2) = -11 + 5.5 = -16.5 (which is not the output we're looking for)

This hypothesis doesn't seem to work, so let's try another approach. Let's see if the difference between the input and output is a multiple of the input:

For the first pair:
-20 - (-11) = -9, which is not a multiple of -11.

This approach also doesn't seem to work. Let's try another pattern, perhaps the output is the input subtracted by its own absolute value:

For the first pair:
-11 - |-11| = -11 - 11 = -22 (which is close but not the output we're looking for)

This is also not consistent with the other pairs. Let's try another pattern, perhaps the output is the input subtracted by a multiple of the input's absolute value:

For the first pair:
-11 - (|-11| - 1) = -11 - (11 - 1) = -11 - 10 = -21 (which is close but not the output we're looking for)

This is also not consistent with the other pairs. It seems that the pattern is not immediately obvious. Let's try a different approach and look for a pattern in the differences between the inputs and outputs:

-7 to -12: Difference of 5 (which is -7 + 2)

The differences appear to be increasing by 1 each time the input decreases by 1, starting from the input of -2 which has a difference of 0. This suggests a linear relationship between the input and the difference. If we assume the input of -2 is the ""starting point"" where the output equals the input, we can infer that for each unit decrease in input from -2, the difference decreases by an additional 1.

So, for the input of 0, which is 2 units greater than -2, the difference would be 2 units less than the difference at -2. Since the difference at -2 is 0, the difference at 0 would also be 0.

-17 -> -310
17 -> 302
10 -> 176
12 -> 212
13 -> 230

Let's look for a pattern. We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. We can calculate the differences between the outputs and see if they correspond to the differences in the inputs.

For the positive numbers:
17 -> 302
13 -> 230
12 -> 212
10 -> 176

The differences between the inputs are:
17 - 13 = 4
13 - 12 = 1
12 - 10 = 2

The differences between the outputs are:
302 - 230 = 72
230 - 212 = 18
212 - 176 = 36

We can see that the differences between the outputs are multiples of 18. It seems like for each increment of 1 in the input, the output increases by 18. However, the pattern is not strictly linear since the differences between the outputs are not consistent (they are not the same for each step in the input).

Let's try to find a function that fits the positive inputs and outputs. We can see that multiplying the input by 18 gets us close to the output:

10 * 18 = 180 (which is 4 less than 176)
12 * 18 = 216 (which is 4 more than 212)
13 * 18 = 234 (which is 4 more than 230)
17 * 18 = 306 (which is 4 more than 302)

It seems that for positive numbers, the function could be 18 * input - 4.

Let's check if this pattern holds for the negative input:
-17 * 18 = -306 (which is 4 less than -310)

It seems to hold for the negative input as well. So the function could be 18 * input - 4 for both positive and negative inputs.

Now let's apply this function to the new input:

","To solve the problem, let's first look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs. We can start by examining the positive inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: 10, Output: 176
Input: 12, Output: 212
Input: 13, Output: 230
Input: 17, Output: 302

It seems that the output is increasing as the input increases, which suggests that the function is likely to be a polynomial or an arithmetic operation involving the input. Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y).

One way to approach this is to look at the differences between the outputs and see if there's a consistent pattern:

Output for 10: 176
Output for 12: 212 (difference from 10: 36)
Output for 13: 230 (difference from 12: 18)
Output for 17: 302 (difference from 13: 72)

The differences are not consistent, which suggests that the relationship is not a simple linear one. However, we can notice that the output seems to be roughly 18 times the input, with some adjustments. Let's test this hypothesis:

For input 10: 10 * 18 = 180 (which is close to 176)
For input 12: 12 * 18 = 216 (which is close to 212)
For input 13: 13 * 18 = 234 (which is close to 230)
For input 17: 17 * 18 = 306 (which is close to 302)

Now, let's consider the negative input:

Input: -17, Output: -310

If we apply the same hypothesis:

For input -17: -17 * 18 = -306 (which is close to -310)

It seems that the output is 18 times the input minus a small constant. To find the constant, we can look at one of the pairs:

For input 10: 10 * 18 = 180, and the output is 176, so the constant might be 4 (180 - 4 = 176).

Let's apply this to the negative input:

For input -17: -17 * 18 = -306, and if we subtract 4, we get -310, which matches the output.

So the function could be:

y = 18x - 4

Now, let's apply this function to the given input of -17:

","To solve the problem, let's try to find a pattern or a function that maps the input to the output based on the given input-output pairs.

Given pairs:
-17 -> -310
17 -> 302
10 -> 176
12 -> 212
13 -> 230

Let's look for a pattern. We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs.

For the positive inputs:
17 -> 302 (17 * 18 - 4)
10 -> 176 (10 * 18 - 4)
12 -> 212 (12 * 18 - 4)
13 -> 230 (13 * 18 - 4)

It seems that for positive inputs, the function could be:
f(x) = 18x - 4

Let's check if this holds for the negative input:
-17 -> -310
f(-17) = 18 * (-17) - 4 = -306 - 4 = -310

The function f(x) = 18x - 4 seems to work for all given pairs.

Now, let's apply this function to the new input:
Input: 12
f(12) = 18 * 12 - 4 = 216 - 4 = 212

","To solve the problem, let's first try to identify a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs. We can start by looking at the positive input-output pairs and see if we can discern a relationship.

Input: 10
Output: 176

Input: 12
Output: 212

Input: 13
Output: 230

Input: 17
Output: 302

Let's look for a pattern by possibly considering common operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

One possible approach is to check if there's a linear relationship. We can do this by calculating the differences between the outputs and the inputs:

For input 10: 176 - 10 = 166
For input 12: 212 - 12 = 200
For input 13: 230 - 13 = 217
For input 17: 302 - 17 = 285

The differences are not constant, so it's not a simple linear function. However, we can notice that the differences themselves seem to increase by a pattern that could be related to multiplication or squaring the input.

Let's try squaring the input and then adding or subtracting a constant value to see if that fits:

For input 10: 10^2 = 100, 100 + 76 = 176
For input 12: 12^2 = 144, 144 + 68 = 212
For input 13: 13^2 = 169, 169 + 61 = 230
For input 17: 17^2 = 289, 289 + 13 = 302

It seems that the output could be the input squared plus a number that decreases as the input increases. However, the pattern for the number we add to the square of the input is not immediately clear.

Let's now consider the negative input and its output:

Input: -17
Output: -310

If we assume the function involves squaring the input, then the square of -17 would be the same as the square of 17, which is 289. To get to -310, we would have to subtract a number greater than 289. In fact, 289 - 310 = -21, which is not consistent with the pattern we saw with the positive numbers.

Given the inconsistency, we might need to consider that the function behaves differently for negative inputs compared to positive inputs. It's possible that for negative inputs, the function involves subtracting the square of the input from a certain value.

Let's try to find a consistent operation for the negative input:

For input -17: (-17)^2 = 289, and if we subtract this from a number slightly greater than 310, we get a small negative number. For example, 300 - 289 = 11, which is not enough. We need a number that when subtracted from 289 gives us -310. That number would be 289 + 310 = 599. So, if we subtract 599 from 289, we get -310.

Now, let's apply this logic to the input -15 to see if we can find the output:

(-15)^2 = 225. If we use the same operation as with -17, we would subtract this from 599 to find the output.

599 - 225 = 374

So, if the function is consistent, the output for the input -15 should be -374.

Input: -9
","To solve the problem, let's first try to identify the pattern or function that transforms the input to the output based on the given input-output pairs.

Looking at the pairs:

-17 -> -310
17 -> 302
10 -> 176
12 -> 212
13 -> 230

We can notice that the output is always an even number, which suggests that the transformation might involve multiplication or addition by an even number.

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by looking at the positive inputs and their outputs:

If x = 10, y = 176, which could be 10 * 17 + 6 (since 10 * 17 = 170 and 170 + 6 = 176)
If x = 12, y = 212, which could be 12 * 17 + 8 (since 12 * 17 = 204 and 204 + 8 = 212)
If x = 13, y = 230, which could be 13 * 17 + 9 (since 13 * 17 = 221 and 221 + 9 = 230)
If x = 17, y = 302, which could be 17 * 17 + 11 (since 17 * 17 = 289 and 289 + 11 = 302)

It seems that the output is 17 times the input plus an increment that increases as the input increases. However, the increment is not consistent (6, 8, 9, 11), so let's look at the negative input:

If x = -17, y = -310, which could be -17 * 18 (since -17 * 18 = -306 and -306 - 4 = -310)

The negative input seems to be multiplied by a number greater than 17, and then a small number is subtracted.

To find a consistent function, we need to find a relationship that works for both positive and negative inputs. Let's try to find a pattern in the increments for the positive numbers:

For x = 10, increment is 6 (which is 16 - 10)
For x = 12, increment is 8 (which is 20 - 12)
For x = 13, increment is 9 (which is 22 - 13)
For x = 17, increment is 11 (which is 28 - 17)

It seems that the increment might be related to doubling the input and then subtracting the input from it. Let's test this hypothesis:

For x = 10, 2x = 20, 20 - 10 = 10, but we need 6, so we subtract 4 more.
For x = 12, 2x = 24, 24 - 12 = 12, but we need 8, so we subtract 4 more.
For x = 13, 2x = 26, 26 - 13 = 13, but we need 9, so we subtract 4 more.
For x = 17, 2x = 34, 34 - 17 = 17, but we need 11, so we subtract 6 more.

The pattern is not entirely clear, but it seems that for positive numbers, the function could be:

y = 17x + (2x - x - 4) for x = 10, 12, 13
y = 17x + (2x - x - 6) for x = 17

For the negative number, the function seems to be:

y = 17x - 4 for x = -17

Given the inconsistency in the pattern, we may need to make an educated guess for the input -9. If we follow the pattern for positive numbers and assume that the function for negative numbers is similar (multiplying by 17 and then subtracting a number), we might guess:

y = 17(-9) - 4 = -153 - 4 = -157

However, this is a speculative guess based on an incomplete pattern. Without a clear rule, we cannot be certain of the output for the input -9. But based on the information we have, we can provide this as a tentative answer.

Input: -13
","To solve the problem, let's first look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs. We can start by examining the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: -16 | Output: 297
Input: 18 | Output: -315
Input: -16 | Output: 297 (repeated, confirms the pattern)
Input: -5 | Output: 99
Input: 5 | Output: -81

We can notice that when the input is negative, the output is positive, and when the input is positive, the output is negative. This suggests that the output might be the result of multiplying the input by a certain number and then either adding or subtracting a constant.

Let's try to find the multiplier and the constant. We can start by looking at the absolute values of the inputs and outputs to see if there's a simple multiple between them.

For input -16 and output 297:
|-16| * x + y = 297
16x + y = 297

For input 18 and output -315:
|18| * x + y = -315
18x + y = -315

Now we have two equations:
16x + y = 297
18x + y = -315

We can solve this system of equations to find x and y. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
18x - 16x = -315 - 297
2x = -612
x = -306

Now we can substitute x back into one of the equations to find y:
16(-306) + y = 297
-4896 + y = 297
y = 297 + 4896
y = 5193

So the function seems to be:
f(input) = -306 * input + 5193

Let's test this function with the input -13:
f(-13) = -306 * (-13) + 5193
f(-13) = 3978 + 5193
f(-13) = 9171

Therefore, the final output for the input -13 is:

Input: -16 | Output: 297 (repeated, confirms the relationship is consistent)
Input: -5 | Output: 99

Looking at the pairs, it seems that when the input is negative, the output is positive, and when the input is positive, the output is negative. This suggests that there might be a multiplication by -1 involved. Also, the magnitude of the output increases as the magnitude of the input increases.

Let's try to find a pattern by examining the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For input -16, output 297:
|-16| + |297| = 16 + 297 = 313

For input 18, output -315:
|18| + |-315| = 18 + 315 = 333

For input -5, output 99:
|-5| + |99| = 5 + 99 = 104

For input 5, output -81:
|5| + |-81| = 5 + 81 = 86

It seems that the sum of the absolute values of the input and output is increasing by a constant amount. Let's see if we can find that constant:

(333 - 313) = 20
(104 - 86) = 18

The difference between the sums is not consistent, so this is not a linear relationship. However, we can notice that the output is always 9 more than a multiple of the input:

For input -16, output 297:
16 * 18 + 9 = 297

For input 18, output -315:
18 * -17 - 9 = -315

For input -5, output 99:
5 * 19 + 9 = 99

For input 5, output -81:
5 * -16 - 9 = -81

It seems that the output is the input multiplied by a certain number (which changes with the input) and then either added or subtracted by 9, depending on the sign of the input.

Let's try to apply this pattern to the new input:

Input: 16

We need to find the multiplier for 16. Looking at the pattern, when the input was -16, the multiplier was 18. When the input was 18, the multiplier was -17. It seems that the multiplier decreases by 1 as the input increases by 1. So, for the input of 16, the multiplier would be -17 (since 18 - 1 = 17, and we change the sign because the input is positive).

Now we calculate the output:

16 * -17 - 9 = -272 - 9 = -281

We can see that when the input is negative, the output is positive, and when the input is positive, the output is negative. This suggests that there might be a multiplication by -1 involved. Also, the output seems to be increasing as the input decreases.

Let's try to find a pattern by examining the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For Input: -16 and Output: 297, the difference is 297 - (-16) = 313
For Input: 18 and Output: -315, the difference is -315 - 18 = -333
For Input: -5 and Output: 99, the difference is 99 - (-5) = 104
For Input: 5 and Output: -81, the difference is -81 - 5 = -86

It seems that the difference between the output and the input is always a multiple of the input plus or minus a constant. Let's try to find a function that fits this pattern.

If we assume the function is a polynomial of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, we can try to solve for a, b, and c using the given input-output pairs. However, since we have only five pairs, and they are not all unique, we might not be able to find a unique solution.

Let's try to find a function that fits at least one pair perfectly and then test it with the other pairs:

For Input: -16 and Output: 297, if we assume the function is f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, we have:
297 = a(-16)^2 + b(-16) + c
297 = 256a - 16b + c

For Input: 18 and Output: -315, we have:
-315 = a(18)^2 + b(18) + c
-315 = 324a + 18b + c

For Input: -5 and Output: 99, we have:
99 = a(-5)^2 + b(-5) + c
99 = 25a - 5b + c

For Input: 5 and Output: -81, we have:
-81 = a(5)^2 + b(5) + c
-81 = 25a + 5b + c

We can set up a system of equations with these four equations, but since we have only three variables (a, b, c) and four equations, the system might be overdetermined. However, we can try to find a solution that fits all the equations as closely as possible.

Let's use the first and last equations to solve for a and b, assuming c is the same in both cases:

297 = 256a - 16b + c
-81 = 25a + 5b + c

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
378 = 231a - 21b

Let's solve for a:
a = (378 + 21b) / 231

Now, let's plug this value of a into one of the equations to solve for b. We'll use the first equation:

297 = 256((378 + 21b) / 231) - 16b + c

This equation is quite complex, and solving it by hand might be error-prone. However, we can use a computer or a calculator to find the values of a, b, and c that fit the given input-output pairs as closely as possible.

After solving for a, b, and c, we can then use the function f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c to find the output for the input -5.

However, since we are looking for a pattern and not the exact function, we can also try to find a simpler relationship. We can notice that the output seems to be roughly 18 times the input, negated, and then adjusted by a constant. For example:

For Input: -16, Output: 297 is approximately -18(-16) + 33
For Input: 18, Output: -315 is approximately -18(18) - 27
For Input: -5, Output: 99 is approximately -18(-5) + 9
For Input: 5, Output: -81 is approximately -18(5) - 9

This suggests a function of the form f(x) = -18x + k, where k is a constant that changes based on whether x is positive or negative.

To find the output for the input -5 using this simpler pattern, we would calculate:

f(-5) = -18(-5) + k
f(-5) = 90 + k

We need to determine the value of k for negative inputs. Looking at the pattern for Input: -16, Output: 297:

297 = -18(-16) + k
297 = 288 + k
k = 297 - 288
k = 9

So for Input: -5, using the pattern we've deduced:

f(-5) = 90 + 9
f(-5) = 99

Therefore, the Final Output for the input -5 is:

Looking at the inputs and outputs, it seems that negative inputs result in positive outputs and positive inputs result in negative outputs. This suggests that the function involves multiplying the input by a negative number.

Let's try to find a pattern by comparing the inputs to their corresponding outputs:

For Input: -16, Output: 297
For Input: 18, Output: -315

If we look at the absolute values of the outputs and compare them to the inputs, we can see that they are not simply multiples of the inputs. However, we can try to find a relationship by considering a polynomial function, since the change in output does not seem to be linear or directly proportional.

Let's consider a quadratic function of the form:
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c

We can use the given input-output pairs to create a system of equations and solve for a, b, and c. However, since we only need to find the output for the input 17, we can try to find a pattern by examining the differences between the outputs and the squares of the inputs.

For Input: -16, Output: 297
(-16)^2 = 256, and 297 - 256 = 41

For Input: 18, Output: -315
18^2 = 324, and -315 - (-324) = 9

(-5)^2 = 25, and 99 - 25 = 74

For Input: 5, Output: -81
5^2 = 25, and -81 - (-25) = -56

The differences don't seem to follow a simple pattern, but we can notice that the output is always the opposite sign of the input. Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the absolute values of the differences:

For Input: -16, the difference is 41
For Input: 18, the difference is 9
For Input: -5, the difference is 74
For Input: 5, the difference is 56

It's not immediately clear what the pattern is, but we can guess that the function might involve a cubic term since the differences are not consistent with a quadratic function.

Without a clear pattern, we can't definitively determine the function. However, we can make an educated guess based on the fact that the output changes sign with the input and seems to involve higher powers of the input.

For Input: 17, we can guess that the output will be negative (since the input is positive) and will involve a higher power of 17. However, without a clear pattern or additional information, we cannot accurately calculate the output.

Let's try to determine the function by using the given pairs. We can start by looking at the absolute values of the outputs and see if there's a simple relationship with the inputs.

For input -16, the output is 297. Ignoring the sign, 297/16 = 18.5625, which doesn't immediately suggest a simple relationship.

For input 18, the output is -315. Ignoring the sign, 315/18 = 17.5, which is a bit closer to a whole number.

For input -5, the output is 99. Ignoring the sign, 99/5 = 19.8.

For input 5, the output is -81. Ignoring the sign, 81/5 = 16.2.

The relationship is not immediately clear, but we can try to look for a pattern in the differences between the input numbers and the corresponding output numbers.

Let's calculate the difference between the output and the input times a constant factor. We can start with the factor of 18, which we saw in the first pair:

For input -16: |297| - 18 * |-16| = 297 - 288 = 9
For input 18: |315| - 18 * |18| = 315 - 324 = -9
For input -5: |99| - 18 * |-5| = 99 - 90 = 9
For input 5: |81| - 18 * |5| = 81 - 90 = -9

It seems that when we multiply the absolute value of the input by 18 and subtract it from the absolute value of the output, we get 9 for negative inputs and -9 for positive inputs.

So, the function could be: f(x) = -18x + 9 for x < 0 and f(x) = -18x - 9 for x > 0.

Let's apply this function to the new input of 18:

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider whether the output is a function of the input squared, since the output seems to increase significantly as the input moves away from zero.

Let's test this hypothesis by squaring the inputs and comparing them to the outputs:

(-18)^2 = 324, but the output is -265.
19^2 = 361, and the output is 253.
(-15)^2 = 225, but the output is -223.
6^2 = 36, and the output is 71.
17^2 = 289, and the output is 225.

The squared inputs do not match the outputs directly, but we can notice that the outputs are close to 13 times the input minus a certain number. Let's test this with the input of 19:

19 * 13 = 247, and the output is 253, which is 6 more than 247.

Let's try this with another input, -15:

The difference between the calculated value and the output is not consistent, so we need to refine our hypothesis. Let's consider a linear function of the form f(x) = ax + b, where a and b are constants.

We can use two input-output pairs to solve for a and b. Let's use the pairs (19, 253) and (17, 225):

For input 19: 19a + b = 253
For input 17: 17a + b = 225

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:

2a = 28
a = 14

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b:

19 * 14 + b = 253
266 + b = 253
b = 253 - 266
b = -13

So our function seems to be f(x) = 14x - 13. Let's test this with the input of 16:

f(16) = 14 * 16 - 13
f(16) = 224 - 13
f(16) = 211

Input: 13
","To solve this problem, let's first look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs. We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship or if the output is a result of a polynomial function of the input.

Let's consider the first pair:
Input: -18
Output: -265

If we assume a linear function of the form `f(x) = ax + b`, we would need another pair to solve for `a` and `b`. However, since we have multiple pairs, we can try to determine if the relationship is indeed linear or if there's a different pattern.

Let's look at the differences between inputs and their corresponding outputs:

For Input: -18, Output: -265
For Input: 19, Output: 253
The difference in input is 19 - (-18) = 37
The difference in output is 253 - (-265) = 518

For Input: -15, Output: -223
The difference in input from the first pair is -15 - (-18) = 3
The difference in output from the first pair is -223 - (-265) = 42

For Input: 6, Output: 71
The difference in input from the first pair is 6 - (-18) = 24
The difference in output from the first pair is 71 - (-265) = 336

For Input: 17, Output: 225
The difference in input from the first pair is 17 - (-18) = 35
The difference in output from the first pair is 225 - (-265) = 490

Now, let's see if the differences in outputs are multiples of the differences in inputs:

For the first and second pair:
518 / 37 = 14 (approximately, but not exactly)

For the first and third pair:
42 / 3 = 14 (exactly)

For the first and fourth pair:
336 / 24 = 14 (exactly)

For the first and fifth pair:
490 / 35 = 14 (exactly)

It seems that for every increase of 1 in the input, the output increases by 14. This suggests a linear relationship with a slope of 14. However, the first pair does not fit this pattern exactly, which could mean there is an additional constant involved or a non-linear component.

Let's try to find the function using the exact differences:

For Input: -15, Output: -223
If we assume the slope is 14, then for an increase of 3 in input, the increase in output should be 3 * 14 = 42.
If we take the output at -18, which is -265, and add 42, we get -265 + 42 = -223, which matches the output for -15.

This confirms our slope of 14. Now we need to find the constant `b` in the linear function `f(x) = 14x + b`.

Using the input-output pair for -18:
-265 = 14(-18) + b
-265 = -252 + b
b = -265 + 252
b = -13

So our function seems to be `f(x) = 14x - 13`.

Let's test this with the input 13:
f(13) = 14(13) - 13
f(13) = 182 - 13
f(13) = 169

","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -18 | Output: -265
Input: 19  | Output: 253
Input: -15 | Output: -223
Input: 6   | Output: 71
Input: 17  | Output: 225

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider whether the output is a function of the input squared, since the sign of the output changes with the sign of the input, which suggests that the function involves an odd power or a multiplication by the input itself.

Let's test the hypothesis that the output is a linear function of the input, which can be represented as:

Output = a * Input + b

We can use two input-output pairs to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Let's use the pairs (6, 71) and (17, 225):

For input 6:
71 = a * 6 + b

For input 17:
225 = a * 17 + b

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

1) 71 = 6a + b
2) 225 = 17a + b

We can solve for 'a' and 'b' by subtracting the first equation from the second:

225 - 71 = 17a - 6a
154 = 11a
a = 154 / 11
a = 14

Now we can substitute 'a' back into one of the equations to find 'b'. Let's use the first equation:

71 = 6 * 14 + b
71 = 84 + b
b = 71 - 84
b = -13

So our function seems to be:

Output = 14 * Input - 13

Let's test this function with the input 0:

Output = 14 * 0 - 13
Output = 0 - 13
Output = -13

Therefore, the final output for the input 0 is:

Input: -4
","To solve the problem, let's first try to find a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs. We can start by looking at the differences between the inputs and outputs.

For the input -18 and output -265, the difference is:
-265 - (-18) = -265 + 18 = -247

For the input 19 and output 253, the difference is:
253 - 19 = 234

For the input -15 and output -223, the difference is:
-223 - (-15) = -223 + 15 = -208

For the input 6 and output 71, the difference is:
71 - 6 = 65

For the input 17 and output 225, the difference is:
225 - 17 = 208

The differences don't seem to follow a simple arithmetic progression. Let's try to see if there's a pattern in how the differences change with respect to the inputs.

If we look at the inputs and their corresponding differences, we can try to see if there's a multiplicative or exponential pattern:

-18 -> -247 (which is -18 * 13 + 7)
19 -> 234 (which is 19 * 12 + 6)
-15 -> -208 (which is -15 * 13 + 7)
6 -> 65 (which is 6 * 10 + 5)
17 -> 208 (which is 17 * 12 + 8)

It seems that the output might be a function of the input multiplied by a certain number plus a constant. The multiplier seems to vary, but it could be related to whether the input is positive or negative and perhaps its magnitude.

Let's try to find a pattern for the multiplier and the constant:

For negative inputs:
-18 -> -18 * 13 + 7
-15 -> -15 * 13 + 7

For positive inputs:
19 -> 19 * 12 + 6
6 -> 6 * 10 + 5
17 -> 17 * 12 + 8

It seems that for negative inputs, the multiplier might be 13 and the constant is 7. For positive inputs, the multiplier seems to decrease as the input gets smaller, and the constant seems to be related to the multiplier (multiplier - 5 or multiplier - 4).

Let's try to apply this pattern to the new input -4:

If the input is negative, we might use a multiplier of 13 and add 7:
-4 * 13 + 7 = -52 + 7 = -45

So, the tentative output for the input -4 would be -45. Let's write this down as the final output:

","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -18 | Output: -265
Input: 19  | Output: 253
Input: -15 | Output: -223
Input: 6   | Output: 71
Input: 17  | Output: 225

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to check if the output is a function of the input squared, since the output changes sign with the input, which suggests an odd power or an additional operation that accounts for the sign change.

Let's test the hypothesis that the output is related to the input cubed (since the sign changes with the input, indicating an odd power), possibly with some linear transformation (addition or subtraction of a constant).

For input -18:
(-18)^3 = -5832
This is not close to -265, so we need to consider a linear transformation. Let's try adding or subtracting a value.

If we look at the difference between the input cubed and the output for a couple of examples, we might notice a pattern:

For input -18:
(-18)^3 = -5832
Difference with output: -5832 - (-265) = -5567

For input 19:
19^3 = 6859
Difference with output: 6859 - 253 = 6606

The differences are not consistent, which suggests that the relationship is not simply the cube of the input plus or minus a constant.

Let's try another approach. Since the outputs are much smaller than the cubes of the inputs, let's consider the possibility of the output being related to the input squared.

For input -18:
(-18)^2 = 324
This is closer to the magnitude of the output, but we still need a transformation.

Let's look at the differences when we square the input:

For input -18:
(-18)^2 = 324
Difference with output: 324 - (-265) = 589

For input 19:
19^2 = 361
Difference with output: 361 - 253 = 108

For input -15:
(-15)^2 = 225
Difference with output: 225 - (-223) = 448

For input 6:
6^2 = 36
Difference with output: 36 - 71 = -35

For input 17:
17^2 = 289
Difference with output: 289 - 225 = 64

The differences are not consistent, but they seem to be related to the input itself. Let's try multiplying the input by a constant and then adding or subtracting from the squared value.

If we look at the pattern, we can see that the output is always 13 less than the square of the input when the input is positive, and 13 more than the square of the input when the input is negative. This suggests the formula:

Output = Input^2 - 13 * Input

Let's test this formula with the input -7:

Output = (-7)^2 - 13 * (-7)
Output = 49 + 91
Output = 140

Therefore, the final output for the input -7 is:

","To solve the problem, let's first try to find a pattern or a function that fits the given input-output pairs. We can start by looking at the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For input 0:
Output = -15
Difference = -15 - 0 = -15

For input -5:
Output = -35
Difference = -35 - (-5) = -30

For input -4:
Output = -31
Difference = -31 - (-4) = -27

For input 5:
Output = 5
Difference = 5 - 5 = 0

For input -12:
Output = -63
Difference = -63 - (-12) = -51

The differences don't seem to follow a simple arithmetic progression, so let's try to find a pattern by considering the possibility of a polynomial function. We can start by assuming a linear function of the form f(x) = ax + b and see if it fits the data.

Let's use two input-output pairs to solve for a and b:

Using input 0 and output -15:
f(0) = a*0 + b = -15
b = -15

Using input 5 and output 5:
f(5) = a*5 - 15 = 5
5a = 5 + 15
5a = 20
a = 4

So, we have a potential function f(x) = 4x - 15. Let's test this function with the other given inputs to see if it holds:

For input -5:
f(-5) = 4*(-5) - 15 = -20 - 15 = -35 (matches the given output)

For input -4:
f(-4) = 4*(-4) - 15 = -16 - 15 = -31 (matches the given output)

For input -12:
f(-12) = 4*(-12) - 15 = -48 - 15 = -63 (matches the given output)

It seems that the function f(x) = 4x - 15 fits all the given input-output pairs. Now, let's use this function to find the output for the input -1:

Input: 9
","To solve the problem, let's first try to find a pattern or a function that fits the given input-output pairs. We can start by looking at the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For an input of 0, the output is -15. This suggests that there might be a constant being subtracted from the input, since 0 - 15 = -15.

For an input of -5, the output is -35. If we consider the difference, -5 - (-35) = 30, which is not the same as the previous difference.

For an input of -4, the output is -31. The difference here is -4 - (-31) = 27, which is again different.

For an input of 5, the output is 5. This suggests that for positive inputs, the output might be the same as the input.

For an input of -12, the output is -63. The difference is -12 - (-63) = 51.

The differences are not constant, but they seem to be increasing by a multiple of 3 each time we go from one input to the next in the sequence of negative numbers. Let's see if we can find a relationship based on this observation.

If we look at the inputs and outputs for negative numbers, we can try to find a linear relationship. Let's assume the function is of the form f(x) = ax + b.

Using the input-output pair (-5, -35):
-35 = a(-5) + b
-35 = -5a + b

Using the input-output pair (-4, -31):
-31 = a(-4) + b
-31 = -4a + b

If we subtract the second equation from the first, we get:
-35 - (-31) = -5a - (-4a)
-4 = -a
a = 4

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b:
-35 = -5(4) + b
-35 = -20 + b
b = -15

So the function for negative inputs seems to be f(x) = 4x - 15.

For positive inputs, it seems the output is the same as the input, so the function could be simply f(x) = x for x > 0.

Now let's apply this to the input of 9:
Since 9 is positive, we use the function f(x) = x.
f(9) = 9

Input: 0 → Output: -15

Input: -12 → Output: -63

We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). A linear function has the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to find the slope (m):

Using inputs 0 and -5:
For input 0, output is -15, so (0, -15)
For input -5, output is -35, so (-5, -35)

The slope (m) is calculated by (change in y) / (change in x):
m = (-35 - (-15)) / (-5 - 0) = (-35 + 15) / (-5) = -20 / -5 = 4

Now let's find the y-intercept (b) using the input 0:
For input 0, output is -15, so b = -15 since y = mx + b and m*0 = 0.

So the tentative linear function is y = 4x - 15.

Let's test this function with the other input-output pairs:

For input -4:
y = 4*(-4) - 15 = -16 - 15 = -31 (which matches the given output)

y = 4*5 - 15 = 20 - 15 = 5 (which matches the given output)

For input -12:

Since the function y = 4x - 15 works for all the given input-output pairs, we can use it to find the output for the input 0:

Looking at the input-output pairs:

Input: 0, Output: -15
Input: -5, Output: -35
Input: -4, Output: -31
Input: 5, Output: 5
Input: -12, Output: -63

We can try to determine if there's a linear relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). A linear function can be represented as y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

Let's see if we can find a consistent difference between the inputs and outputs:

For Input: 0, Output: -15, if we assume a linear function, then -15 would be our y-intercept (b).

Now let's check the slope (m) by seeing how the output changes with the input:

From Input: -5 to Input: 0, the output changes from -35 to -15, which is a change of 20 over a change in input of 5. This gives us a slope of 20/5 = 4. However, since the input increased from -5 to 0 (a positive direction), and the output increased (which means it became less negative), the slope would actually be negative. So, m = -4.

Let's test this with another pair to see if it holds:

From Input: -4 to Input: -5, the output changes from -31 to -35, which is a change of 4 over a change in input of 1. This confirms our slope of -4, as the output decreases by 4 when the input decreases by 1.

So, our function seems to be y = -4x - 15.

Let's apply this function to the new input to find the output:

Let's look for a pattern. We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). A linear function can be represented as y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

From the first pair (0, -15), we can see that when x is 0, y is -15. This suggests that the y-intercept (b) might be -15.

Now let's see if the changes in x correspond to consistent changes in y to determine the slope (m). We can use the other pairs to calculate the differences:

For the pair (-5, -35):
If we assume the y-intercept is -15, then the change in y from the y-intercept is -35 - (-15) = -20.
The change in x from 0 to -5 is -5.
So, the slope (m) could be -20 / -5 = 4.

Let's test this slope with another pair to see if it holds:

For the pair (-4, -31):
Change in y from the y-intercept is -31 - (-15) = -16.
Change in x from 0 to -4 is -4.
The slope here would be -16 / -4 = 4.

This matches our previous slope calculation, which is a good sign.

Let's test this with a positive input:

For the pair (5, 5):
Change in y from the y-intercept is 5 - (-15) = 20.
Change in x from 0 to 5 is 5.
The slope here would be 20 / 5 = 4.

This also matches our slope calculation.

So far, it seems that the function could be y = 4x - 15.

Let's test this function with the last given pair to confirm:

For the pair (-12, -63):
According to our function, y should be 4 * (-12) - 15 = -48 - 15 = -63.

Let's try to find a relationship between the inputs and outputs. We can start by checking if there's a simple arithmetic operation (like multiplication or addition) that can be applied to the inputs to get the outputs.

For the positive numbers, if we multiply the input by 14 and add 7, we seem to get the output:
- 9 * 14 + 7 = 126 + 7 = 133
- 19 * 14 + 7 = 266 + 7 = 273 (but this does not match the given output of 283, so there might be an error in the pattern here)
- 16 * 14 + 7 = 224 + 7 = 231 (which also does not match the given output of 238)

- (-14) * 14 - 7 = -196 - 7 = -203 (which does not match the given output of -212)
- (-16) * 14 - 7 = -224 - 7 = -231 (which also does not match the given output of -242)

The pattern is not consistent with a simple multiplication and addition or subtraction. However, we can notice that the output is always 14 times the input plus or minus a certain number. Let's try to find the correct constant by looking at the positive and negative examples separately.

For positive numbers, let's subtract the input multiplied by 14 from the output to find the constant:
- 133 - (9 * 14) = 133 - 126 = 7
- 283 - (19 * 14) = 283 - 266 = 17 (which suggests there might be an error in the pattern)
- 238 - (16 * 14) = 238 - 224 = 14

For negative numbers, let's add the input multiplied by 14 to the output to find the constant:
- (-212) + (-14 * 14) = -212 + 196 = -16
- (-242) + (-16 * 14) = -242 + 224 = -18

The constant seems to vary, but it appears to be related to the input in some way. It's not a simple addition or subtraction of a fixed number. However, if we look closely, we can see that the constant is actually the input plus or minus 2 for the positive and negative cases, respectively.

So the rule could be:
- For positive inputs: Output = Input * 14 + (Input + 2)
- For negative inputs: Output = Input * 14 - (Input - 2)

Let's apply this rule to the new input of 14:
For a positive input of 14:
Output = 14 * 14 + (14 + 2) = 196 + 16 = 212

Therefore, the final output for the input of 14 is:

Input: -7
","To solve the problem, let's first try to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input to the output based on the given input-output pairs.

Looking at the positive inputs first:

Input: 9 → Output: 133
Input: 19 → Output: 283
Input: 16 → Output: 238

Now let's look at the negative inputs:

Input: -14 → Output: -212
Input: -16 → Output: -242

Let's try to find a relationship between the inputs and outputs. One way to approach this is to look for a mathematical operation that can be applied to the input to get the output.

For positive numbers, it seems like the output is 14 times the input plus a constant. Let's check:

For input 9: 9 * 14 = 126, and 133 - 126 = 7
For input 19: 19 * 14 = 266, and 283 - 266 = 17 (This doesn't seem to fit the constant addition we saw with 9.)
For input 16: 16 * 14 = 224, and 238 - 224 = 14

The constant addition doesn't seem to be the same, so let's try another approach. It seems like the output is more than 14 times the input. Let's see if there's a pattern in how much more:

For input 9: 133 - (9 * 14) = 133 - 126 = 7
For input 19: 283 - (19 * 14) = 283 - 266 = 17
For input 16: 238 - (16 * 14) = 238 - 224 = 14

It looks like the difference between the output and 14 times the input is the input itself minus 2. Let's check this with the positive numbers:

For input 9: 9 - 2 = 7
For input 19: 19 - 2 = 17
For input 16: 16 - 2 = 14

This seems to fit. Now let's check with the negative numbers:

For input -14: -212 - (-14 * 14) = -212 - (-196) = -16, and -14 - 2 = -16
For input -16: -242 - (-16 * 14) = -242 - (-224) = -18, and -16 - 2 = -18

This pattern holds for negative numbers as well. So the rule seems to be:

Output = Input * 14 + (Input - 2)

Now let's apply this rule to the new input:

Input: -7
Output = -7 * 14 + (-7 - 2)
Output = -98 - 9
Output = -107

","To solve the problem, let's first try to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input to the output based on the given input-output pairs.

Looking at the positive inputs and their outputs:
- Input: 9, Output: 133
- Input: 19, Output: 283
- Input: 16, Output: 238

It seems like the output is always 14 times the input plus an additional 7. Let's check if this rule applies to all the given positive inputs:

For input 9: (9 * 14) + 7 = 126 + 7 = 133 (matches the output)
For input 19: (19 * 14) + 7 = 266 + 7 = 273 (does not match the output, so there might be an error in the given output or in our rule)
For input 16: (16 * 14) + 7 = 224 + 7 = 231 (does not match the output, so there might be an error in the given output or in our rule)

Since the rule does not match all the given outputs, let's try to find another pattern. We can notice that the output is always 14 times the input plus an additional 19. Let's check if this new rule applies:

For input 9: (9 * 14) + 19 = 126 + 19 = 145 (does not match the output)
For input 19: (19 * 14) + 19 = 266 + 19 = 285 (does not match the output)
For input 16: (16 * 14) + 19 = 224 + 19 = 243 (does not match the output)

This rule also does not match the given outputs. Let's try to find a different pattern.

Looking at the negative inputs and their outputs:
- Input: -14, Output: -212
- Input: -16, Output: -242

It seems like the output is 14 times the input minus an additional 20. Let's check if this rule applies to the given negative inputs:

For input -14: (-14 * 14) - 20 = -196 - 20 = -216 (does not match the output)
For input -16: (-16 * 14) - 20 = -224 - 20 = -244 (does not match the output)

This rule also does not match the given outputs. However, if we adjust the additional number to 18 for negative inputs, it seems to work:

For input -14: (-14 * 14) - 18 = -196 - 18 = -214 (almost matches the output, off by 2)
For input -16: (-16 * 14) - 18 = -224 - 18 = -242 (matches the output)

It seems that the rule might be slightly different for positive and negative inputs. Let's try to find a consistent rule that applies to both.

After carefully examining the given pairs, we can see that the output is 15 times the input minus 2 for both positive and negative inputs:

For input 9: (9 * 15) - 2 = 135 - 2 = 133 (matches the output)
For input 19: (19 * 15) - 2 = 285 - 2 = 283 (matches the output)
For input 16: (16 * 15) - 2 = 240 - 2 = 238 (matches the output)
For input -14: (-14 * 15) - 2 = -210 - 2 = -212 (matches the output)
For input -16: (-16 * 15) - 2 = -240 - 2 = -242 (matches the output)

Now that we have a consistent rule, let's apply it to the new input:

Let's think step by step about what the function could be. Remember to write down 'Final Output:' before your final answer.
Input: -4
","To solve the problem, let's first look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs. We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs.

For input 9, the output is 133. If we assume a linear function of the form `f(x) = ax + b`, we can create two equations using two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for `a` and `b`.

Let's use the input-output pairs (9, 133) and (19, 283):

1. For input 9: `9a + b = 133`
2. For input 19: `19a + b = 283`

Now, let's solve these two equations to find `a` and `b`.

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

`19a + b - (9a + b) = 283 - 133`
`10a = 150`
`a = 15`

Now that we have `a`, we can substitute it back into one of the equations to find `b`. Using the first equation:

`9a + b = 133`
`9(15) + b = 133`
`135 + b = 133`
`b = 133 - 135`
`b = -2`

So our function seems to be `f(x) = 15x - 2`.

Let's verify this with another pair, say (16, 238):

`f(16) = 15(16) - 2`
`f(16) = 240 - 2`
`f(16) = 238`

This matches the given output for input 16, so our function seems correct.

Now let's apply this function to the new input, -4:

`f(-4) = 15(-4) - 2`
`f(-4) = -60 - 2`
`f(-4) = -62`

Therefore, the final output for the input -4 is:

Let's think step by step about what the function could be. Remember to write down 'Final Output:' before your final answer.
Input: -12
","To determine the function, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: 9 → Output: 133
Input: 19 → Output: 283
Input: 16 → Output: 238
Input: -14 → Output: -212
Input: -16 → Output: -242

Looking at the positive inputs first, it seems that the output is 14 times the input plus an additional 7.

9 * 14 + 7 = 126 + 7 = 133
19 * 14 + 7 = 266 + 7 = 273 (Note: There seems to be a mistake here as the provided output is 283, not 273. This could be a typo or an indication that the function has a different form.)
16 * 14 + 7 = 224 + 7 = 231 (Again, the provided output is 238, not 231, suggesting a possible typo or a different function.)

Now, let's look at the negative inputs:

-14 * 14 + 7 = -196 + 7 = -189 (The provided output is -212, which does not match this calculation.)
-16 * 14 + 7 = -224 + 7 = -217 (The provided output is -242, which does not match this calculation.)

Given the discrepancies, let's consider that the function might be 14 times the input plus an additional amount that increases with the input. For positive numbers, it seems to be 7 more than the product of 14 and the input, but for negative numbers, the additional amount is greater than 7.

Let's try to find a pattern that fits all the given pairs. We can notice that the difference between the output and the product of the input and 14 is increasing by 10 for each increment of 1 in the input:

For input 9, the difference is 7 (133 - 9*14 = 7).
For input 16, the difference is 14 (238 - 16*14 = 14).
For input 19, the difference is 17 (283 - 19*14 = 17).

This suggests that the function could be adding 14 times the input plus an additional amount that increases by 3 for each increment of 1 in the input, starting from 7 when the input is 9.

Let's apply this logic to the negative inputs:

For input -14, the difference is 26 (-212 - (-14)*14 = 26).
For input -16, the difference is 34 (-242 - (-16)*14 = 34).

This pattern suggests that the additional amount for negative inputs is also increasing by 3 for each decrement of 1 in the input, starting from some base value.

To find the function for the negative inputs, we need to determine the base value for the additional amount when the input is 0. We can do this by extrapolating the pattern from the known negative inputs:

If the difference increases by 3 when the input decreases by 1, we can calculate the base difference for input 0 by subtracting 3 for each increment from -14 to 0:

Difference at -14 is 26.
Difference at -13 would be 26 - 3 = 23.
Continuing this pattern up to 0 would give us the base difference.

However, since we don't have the output for 0, we can't be certain of the base difference. But we can still try to find a consistent pattern for the negative inputs:

If we assume the base difference at 0 is a certain value, we can then add 3 for each decrement of 1 in the input to find the additional amount for any negative input.

Let's try to find the function for the input -12 using the pattern we've observed:

For input -14, the difference is 26.
For input -13, the difference would be 23.
For input -12, the difference would be 20.

So, the function for input -12 could be:

-12 * 14 + 20 = -168 + 20 = -148

Therefore, the final output for input -12 would be:

","To solve the problem, we need to determine the function that transforms the input to the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Output: 59

Input: -16
Output: -301

Input: -5
Output: -81

Input: 3
Output: 79

Input: -2

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider that the function might be a polynomial function. We can try to find a polynomial that fits all the given points. However, since we have only five points, there could be multiple polynomials that fit these points. We need to look for the simplest function that fits all the points.

Let's look at the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For input 2, the output is 59, which is 2^3 + 3*2 + 1 = 8 + 6 + 1 = 15.
For input -16, the output is -301, which is (-16)^3 + 3*(-16) + 1 = -4096 - 48 + 1 = -4143.
For input -5, the output is -81, which is (-5)^3 + 3*(-5) + 1 = -125 - 15 + 1 = -139.
For input 3, the output is 79, which is 3^3 + 3*3 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 1 = 37.
For input -2, the output is -21, which is (-2)^3 + 3*(-2) + 1 = -8 - 6 + 1 = -13.

The pattern is not immediately clear from these calculations. Let's try another approach by looking at the differences between the outputs for consecutive inputs:

Output for input 3 - Output for input 2 = 79 - 59 = 20
Output for input 2 - Output for input -2 = 59 - (-21) = 80
Output for input -2 - Output for input -5 = -21 - (-81) = 60
Output for input -5 - Output for input -16 = -81 - (-301) = 220

The differences between the outputs are not consistent, which suggests that the function is not linear. However, we can notice that the output increases when the input increases, and decreases when the input decreases, which suggests that the function might be increasing and decreasing in a consistent manner.

Let's try to find a function that fits the given points. We can start by assuming the function is a cubic function, since the outputs seem to be related to the cube of the inputs. A general cubic function can be written as:

f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d

We need to find the coefficients a, b, c, and d that fit the given points. However, with only five points, we cannot uniquely determine a cubic function. We need at least four points to determine a cubic function, and we have five, so there might be multiple solutions.

Given the complexity of determining the exact function without more information or a pattern, we can try to guess the function based on the given points. One possible approach is to look at the symmetry of the inputs and outputs. We can see that the output for -2 is -21, and the output for 2 is 59. The difference between these outputs is 80, which is 40 times the difference between the inputs. Similarly, the difference between the outputs for -5 and 3 is 160, which is 40 times the difference between the inputs.

Based on this observation, we can guess that the function might be of the form:

f(x) = 40x + k

where k is a constant that we need to determine. However, this function does not fit the given points, as it is a linear function and the outputs do not increase linearly with the inputs.

Since we cannot determine the exact function without more information, we can try to interpolate the function using the given points. One method of interpolation is Lagrange interpolation, which can give us a polynomial that passes through all the given points. However, this method is complex and beyond the scope of this problem.

Given the complexity of the problem and the lack of a clear pattern, we cannot determine the exact function that transforms the input to the output. Therefore, we cannot provide the output for the input -10 without more information or a clear pattern.

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider that the function might be a polynomial function, as the outputs for both positive and negative inputs are not following a simple linear relationship.

Let's try to find a polynomial that fits the data. We can start by looking at the differences between the outputs for consecutive inputs:

Output at 3 - Output at 2 = 79 - 59 = 20
Output at 2 - Output at -2 = 59 - (-21) = 80
Output at -2 - Output at -5 = -21 - (-81) = 60
Output at -5 - Output at -16 = -81 - (-301) = 220

The differences are not consistent, which suggests that the function is not linear. However, the differences between the outputs seem to be multiples of 20, which might indicate that the function includes a term that is a multiple of the input squared (since the square of the input would change more significantly for larger differences in input).

Let's try to find a quadratic term that fits the data. We can assume the function is of the form:

f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c

We can use three input-output pairs to solve for a, b, and c. Let's use the pairs (2, 59), (-2, -21), and (3, 79).

For input 2:
4a + 2b + c = 59

For input -2:
4a - 2b + c = -21

For input 3:
9a + 3b + c = 79

Now we have a system of three equations. We can solve this system to find the values of a, b, and c.

Adding the first two equations:
8a + 2c = 38
4a + c = 19
c = 19 - 4a

Now we can substitute c into the third equation:
9a + 3b + (19 - 4a) = 79
5a + 3b = 60

We still need another equation to solve for a and b. Let's use another pair, for example, (-5, -81):

25a - 5b + c = -81

Substituting c from before:
25a - 5b + (19 - 4a) = -81
21a - 5b = -100

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:
5a + 3b = 60
21a - 5b = -100

Multiplying the first equation by 5 and the second by 3, we get:
25a + 15b = 300
63a - 15b = -300

Adding these two equations:
88a = 0
a = 0

This suggests that there is no quadratic term, which contradicts our initial assumption. Since the quadratic term is zero, we need to reconsider our approach.

Given the inconsistency in the differences, it's possible that the function involves higher powers or a combination of different types of functions (e.g., polynomial and exponential). Without a clear pattern, we cannot determine the exact function with the information provided.

However, since we are asked to provide an output for the input of 8, we can try to look for a pattern that might fit the given data points and apply it to the input of 8.

One possible pattern could be that the function involves a cubic term, since the differences between outputs are not consistent with a quadratic function. Let's assume the function is of the form:

f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d

We would need at least four input-output pairs to solve for a, b, c, and d. However, without additional information or a clear pattern, we cannot accurately determine the coefficients a, b, c, and d.

However, the differences between the outputs are not consistent with the differences you would expect from a simple quadratic function either.

Given the complexity of the differences, we might be dealing with a higher-order polynomial or a function that includes both polynomial and non-polynomial terms.

(4a + 2b + c) - (4a - 2b + c) = 59 - (-21)
4b = 80
b = 20

Now we have the value for b. We can substitute b into equation (1) to find a and c:

4a + c = 19

We still need another equation to solve for a and c. We can use equation (3) with the known value of b:

9a + 3(20) + c = 79
9a + 60 + c = 79
9a + c = 19

Now we have two equations with 4a + c and 9a + c both equal to 19. This suggests that a = 0, because increasing the coefficient of a does not change the result. Let's verify this:

If a = 0, then from 4a + c = 19, we get c = 19.

Now we have a = 0, b = 20, and c = 19. Let's check these values with another input-output pair to verify:

For input -5:
f(-5) = 0(-5)^2 + 20(-5) + 19
f(-5) = -100 + 19
f(-5) = -81

This matches the given output for input -5, so our function seems to be:
f(x) = 20x + 19

Now, let's find the output for the input -1 using our function:
f(-1) = 20(-1) + 19
f(-1) = -20 + 19
f(-1) = -1

Input: 19
","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: 2
Output: 59

Input: -16
Output: -301

Input: -5
Output: -81

Input: 3
Output: 79

Input: -2
Output: -21

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider that the function might be a polynomial. We can try to find a polynomial that fits the given points. However, with only five points, there could be multiple polynomials that fit, so we might need to look for additional patterns.

Let's look at the differences between the outputs and the inputs:

For input 2, output 59: 59 - (2) = 57
For input -16, output -301: -301 - (-16) = -285
For input -5, output -81: -81 - (-5) = -76
For input 3, output 79: 79 - (3) = 76
For input -2, output -21: -21 - (-2) = -19

The differences don't seem to follow a simple arithmetic progression. However, we can notice that the absolute values of the differences are close to being multiples of the input. Let's try multiplying the input by a number and then adding or subtracting a constant to see if we can find a match:

For input 2, if we multiply by 29, we get 58, and adding 1 gives us 59.
For input -16, if we multiply by 18, we get -288, and subtracting 13 gives us -301.
For input -5, if we multiply by 16, we get -80, and subtracting 1 gives us -81.
For input 3, if we multiply by 26, we get 78, and adding 1 gives us 79.
For input -2, if we multiply by 10, we get -20, and subtracting 1 gives us -21.

This doesn't seem to follow a clear pattern either, as the multiplier changes. Let's try another approach by looking at the outputs for positive and negative inputs separately:

For positive inputs (2 and 3), the outputs (59 and 79) are both prime numbers. For negative inputs (-16, -5, and -2), the outputs (-301, -81, and -21) are not prime and are negative.

Let's consider the possibility that the function involves squaring the input, as squaring would give a positive result for negative inputs, which could then be negated:

For input 2, 2^2 = 4, and 4 * something + something = 59.
For input -16, (-16)^2 = 256, and 256 * something - something = -301.
For input -5, (-5)^2 = 25, and 25 * something - something = -81.
For input 3, 3^2 = 9, and 9 * something + something = 79.
For input -2, (-2)^2 = 4, and 4 * something - something = -21.

This pattern suggests that the function might involve squaring the input, multiplying by a constant, and then adding or subtracting a constant. However, without a clear pattern for the constants, it's difficult to determine the exact function.

Given the complexity and the limited data points, it's challenging to determine the exact function without more information or additional input-output pairs. However, we can try to guess the function for the input 19 by looking for a pattern that fits all the given pairs.

Since we don't have a clear pattern, we can't provide a definitive answer for the input 19. However, if we assume that the function involves squaring the input and then adding or subtracting a constant, we could guess by extrapolating from the positive inputs:

For input 2, output 59: 2^2 = 4, and 59 - 4 = 55, which is 4 * 13 + 3.
For input 3, output 79: 3^2 = 9, and 79 - 9 = 70, which is 3 * 23 + 1.

If we assume the function for positive inputs is to square the number, multiply by a constant, and then add a different constant, we could try to apply this to input 19:

19^2 = 361. If we were to guess that the multiplier is around the same as for input 3 (which is 23), we could try:

361 * 23 = 8303. This is obviously too large compared to the other outputs, so this multiplier is likely incorrect.

Without a clear pattern, we cannot accurately determine the function or provide a correct output for input 19. Therefore, we can only acknowledge that the function is not clear from the given data.

Input: -12
","To solve the problem, let's first try to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input to the output based on the given input-output pairs.

Looking at the pairs:

1. Input: 13 → Output: 55
2. Input: -20 → Output: -44
3. Input: 15 → Output: 61
4. Input: -1 → Output: 13
5. Input: -14 → Output: -26

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by looking at the positive inputs and their outputs:

- For input 13, the output is 55. If we try to find a simple arithmetic operation, we can see that 13 * 4 + 3 = 55.
- For input 15, the output is 61. Using the same operation, 15 * 4 + 1 = 61.

Now let's look at the negative inputs:

- For input -20, the output is -44. If we apply the same operation, -20 * 4 + 36 = -44.
- For input -1, the output is 13. Using the same operation, -1 * 4 + 17 = 13.
- For input -14, the output is -26. Using the same operation, -14 * 4 + 30 = -26.

It seems that the operation for negative numbers is not consistent with the one for positive numbers. Let's try to find a pattern for the negative numbers separately:

- For input -20, the output is -44. If we try adding 24, -20 + 24 = 4, and then multiplying by -11, we get -44.
- For input -1, the output is 13. If we add 14 to -1, we get 13, which is the output.
- For input -14, the output is -26. If we add 12 to -14, we get -2, and then multiplying by 13 gives us -26.

It seems that for negative numbers, the operation might involve adding a certain number to the input and then multiplying by another number. However, the pattern is not immediately clear.

Given the complexity and the lack of a clear pattern, we might need more information or more input-output pairs to determine the exact rule. However, based on the given data, we can attempt to guess the output for the new input of -12 by trying to apply the patterns we observed:

For negative numbers, if we consider adding a certain number that increases as the input becomes less negative (closer to zero), we might guess that for input -12, we would add 14 (as we did for -1 to get 13). So:

-12 + 14 = 2

Now, if we consider the multiplication factor, it's not clear what it should be. However, if we look at the previous outputs, we can see that the multiplication factor for -1 was 13, and for -14 it was -2 (since -14 + 12 = -2, and -2 * 13 = -26). If we assume the multiplication factor decreases by 1 for each increment in the input, then for -12, the multiplication factor might be 12 (since -1 had a factor of 13).

So, if we multiply 2 by 12, we get:

2 * 12 = 24

This is a guess based on an observed pattern, but without a clear rule, it's speculative. Let's go with this guess for now.

Looking at the pairs:

2. Input: -20 → Output: -44
3. Input: 15 → Output: 61
4. Input: -1 → Output: 13
5. Input: -14 → Output: -26

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship, such as y = ax + b.

For the first pair (13, 55), if we assume a linear relationship:
55 = a * 13 + b

For the second pair (-20, -44):
-44 = a * (-20) + b

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. 55 = 13a + b
2. -44 = -20a + b

We can solve this system for a and b. Let's subtract the second equation from the first:
55 - (-44) = 13a - (-20a)
99 = 33a
a = 99 / 33
a = 3

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b. Using the first equation:
55 = 13 * 3 + b
55 = 39 + b
b = 55 - 39
b = 16

So, the linear relationship could be y = 3x + 16.

Let's check this with the other given pairs:
For input 15:
y = 3 * 15 + 16
y = 45 + 16
y = 61 (which matches the given output)

For input -1:
y = 3 * (-1) + 16
y = -3 + 16
y = 13 (which matches the given output)

For input -14:
y = 3 * (-14) + 16
y = -42 + 16
y = -26 (which matches the given output)

Since the linear relationship y = 3x + 16 works for all the given pairs, we can use it to find the output for the new input:

For the first pair (13, 55), if we assume a linear relationship, we can set up the equation:
55 = a * 13 + b

For the second pair (-20, -44):
-44 = a * (-20) + b

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. 55 = 13a + b
2. -44 = -20a + b

We can solve this system for a and b. Let's subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate b:
55 - (-44) = 13a - (-20a)
99 = 33a
a = 99 / 33
a = 3

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b. Using the first equation:
55 = 13 * 3 + b
55 = 39 + b
b = 55 - 39
b = 16

So our linear equation seems to be y = 3x + 16.

Let's check this with the other given pairs:

For the third pair (15, 61):
61 = 3 * 15 + 16
61 = 45 + 16
61 = 61 (This matches)

","To solve the problem, let's first look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs. We can try to determine the function that transforms the input to the output.

For input 13, the output is 55. For input -20, the output is -44. For input 15, the output is 61. For input -1, the output is 13. For input -14, the output is -26.

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by looking at the positive inputs and their outputs:

Input: 13, Output: 55
Input: 15, Output: 61

It seems that the output is increasing as the input increases. Let's see if there's a linear relationship by calculating the difference between the outputs and the inputs:

For input 13: 55 - 13 = 42
For input 15: 61 - 15 = 46

The difference is not constant, so it's not a simple addition. However, the difference between the differences is 4, which suggests that the relationship might be quadratic.

Now let's look at the negative inputs:

Input: -20, Output: -44
Input: -1, Output: 13
Input: -14, Output: -26

For input -20: -44 - (-20) = -24
For input -1: 13 - (-1) = 14
For input -14: -26 - (-14) = -12

Again, the relationship is not linear. However, we can notice that the output is less than twice the input for negative numbers.

Let's try to find a function that fits both the positive and negative inputs. We can start by assuming a quadratic function of the form:

y = ax^2 + bx + c

We can use the given input-output pairs to create a system of equations and solve for a, b, and c. However, since we don't have enough information to determine the exact function, we can look for a pattern that fits all given pairs.

By examining the inputs and outputs, we can notice that for positive inputs, the output seems to be 4 times the input plus a constant. For negative inputs, the output seems to be 2 times the input plus a different constant.

Let's test this with the given pairs:

For input 13 (positive), the output is approximately 4 * 13 + a constant. The constant would be 55 - (4 * 13) = 55 - 52 = 3.

For input -20 (negative), the output is approximately 2 * (-20) + a different constant. The constant would be -44 - (2 * -20) = -44 - (-40) = -4.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the input -14:

For negative inputs, we multiply by 2 and add -4:

Output = 2 * (-14) - 4
Output = -28 - 4
Output = -32

However, this does not match the given output for -14, which is -26. This suggests that our assumed pattern is not correct.

Since we cannot determine the exact function with the given information, we can only provide the output for the input -14 based on the given pattern, which we already know is -26.

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by looking at the positive inputs and their outputs:

For input 13, the output is 55. If we try to find a simple arithmetic relationship, we might consider multiplication and addition. For example, if we multiply 13 by 4, we get 52, and adding 3 gives us 55. Let's see if this works for input 15:

15 * 4 = 60, and if we add 1 (since 15 is two more than 13, we add two less than we did for 13), we get 61, which matches the given output.

Now let's check the negative inputs:

For input -20, the output is -44. If we use the same multiplication factor of 4:

-20 * 4 = -80, but we need to get to -44. If we add 36 (which is the difference between -80 and -44), we get the correct output. However, this doesn't seem to match the pattern we used for positive numbers.

For input -1, the output is 13. Using the same logic:

-1 * 4 = -4, and if we add 17 (which is the difference between -4 and 13), we get the correct output.

For input -14, the output is -26:

-14 * 4 = -56, and if we add 30 (which is the difference between -56 and -26), we get the correct output.

It seems that the addition part is not consistent, but let's try to find a pattern in the addition:

For 13, we added 3.
For -20, we added 36.
For -1, we added 17.
For -14, we added 30.

It looks like the addition might be related to the absolute value of the input. Let's try to find a relationship:

For 13 (positive), we added 3, which is 16 less than the input.
For -20 (negative), we added 36, which is 16 more than the absolute value of the input.
For -1 (negative), we added 17, which is 16 more than the absolute value of the input.
For -14 (negative), we added 30, which is 16 more than the absolute value of the input.

It seems that for negative numbers, we add 16 more than the absolute value of the input, and for positive numbers, we subtract 16 from the input and then add that to the product of the input and 4.

Let's apply this to the new input of 15:

For positive 15:
15 * 4 = 60
15 - 16 = -1 (but since we can't add a negative to get our output, we might consider that for positive numbers, we actually add the absolute value of this difference)
So, we add 1 to 60, which gives us 61.

This matches the given output for 15, so let's use this rule for the new input of 15:

Input: -11 | Output: 72
Input: -3  | Output: 8
Input: -2  | Output: 0
Input: 18  | Output: -160
Input: -7  | Output: 40

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider whether the function is linear or quadratic, or if there's another operation at play. Let's first check if there's a linear relationship by calculating the differences between the inputs and outputs.

For the input of -11 and output of 72, if we assume a linear function of the form f(x) = ax + b, we can set up the following equations based on the given pairs:

For input -11: a(-11) + b = 72
For input -3: a(-3) + b = 8
For input -2: a(-2) + b = 0
For input 18: a(18) + b = -160
For input -7: a(-7) + b = 40

However, it's clear that these equations will not have a consistent solution for 'a' and 'b' because the function does not seem to be linear. The outputs do not change consistently as the inputs increase or decrease.

Let's consider a quadratic function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. We can try to find a pattern by looking at the square of the inputs:

(-11)^2 = 121
(-3)^2 = 9
(-2)^2 = 4
18^2 = 324
(-7)^2 = 49

These squared values do not seem to correlate directly with the outputs either.

Another approach is to look for a pattern in the changes of the output when the input changes. For example, when the input increases from -11 to -3 (a change of 8), the output decreases from 72 to 8 (a change of 64). However, when the input increases from -3 to -2 (a change of 1), the output decreases from 8 to 0 (a change of 8). This suggests that the relationship is not linear or purely quadratic.

Given the complexity of the pattern, we might consider that the function involves a combination of operations, possibly including multiplication, addition, and even conditional logic based on whether the input is positive or negative.

Without a clear pattern, we can't determine the exact function. However, we can still provide an output for the input of 1 by making an educated guess based on the pattern of the inputs and outputs.

Since the function is not obvious, and we don't have a consistent rule to apply, we can't provide a definitive output for the input of 1. However, if we were to guess based on the given data, we might notice that negative inputs seem to produce positive outputs and positive inputs produce negative outputs. If this pattern holds, we might expect a positive output for the input of 1. But without more information or a clearer pattern, this is purely speculative.

","To solve this problem, let's try to find a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs. We have the following input-output pairs:

-11 → 72
-3 → 8
-2 → 0
18 → -160
-7 → 40

Let's look for a pattern. We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship or if the output is a result of a polynomial function of the input.

First, let's see if the output increases or decreases consistently with the input. We can see that it does not, as the output for -11 is 72, but for a lower negative number, -3, the output is 8, which is much less. Similarly, the output for 18 is -160, which is a negative number, unlike the outputs for the negative inputs.

This suggests that the function might involve an absolute value or a piecewise definition, or it could be a polynomial that includes both the input squared and the input to the first power.

Let's try to find a polynomial function that fits the data. We can start by assuming a quadratic function of the form:

f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c

We can use three of the given points to solve for a, b, and c. However, since we have five points, we can check our solution against all of them to ensure it fits.

Using the points (-11, 72), (-3, 8), and (-2, 0), we can set up a system of equations:

For (-11, 72):
a(-11)^2 + b(-11) + c = 72
121a - 11b + c = 72

For (-3, 8):
a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c = 8
9a - 3b + c = 8

For (-2, 0):
a(-2)^2 + b(-2) + c = 0
4a - 2b + c = 0

We can solve this system of equations to find a, b, and c. However, since we are looking for the output for the input -7, and we already have the output for that input given in the list (which is 40), we can use that information directly to provide the answer without solving the system.

Input: -7  | Output: 40

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider that the function might involve squaring the input, as squaring both positive and negative numbers results in a positive number, and we see positive outputs for negative inputs. However, the output for a positive input (18) is negative, which suggests there might be a negative coefficient involved when the input is positive.

Let's test the hypothesis that the function involves squaring the input and then adding or subtracting a value. We'll start by squaring the input and comparing it to the output:

(-11)^2 = 121, but the output is 72, which is 121 - 49.
(-3)^2 = 9, but the output is 8, which is 9 - 1.
(-2)^2 = 4, but the output is 0, which is 4 - 4.
(18)^2 = 324, but the output is -160, which is -324 + 164.
(-7)^2 = 49, but the output is 40, which is 49 - 9.

From these calculations, it seems that when the input is negative, we subtract the square of the input from a certain number, and when the input is positive, we subtract the square of the input from a different number.

Let's try to find a pattern in the numbers we're subtracting:

For -11, we subtract 49, which is 7^2.
For -3, we subtract 1, which is 1^2.
For -2, we subtract 4, which is 2^2.
For 18, we subtract 164, which doesn't fit the pattern of squaring the input.
For -7, we subtract 9, which is 3^2.

It seems that for negative inputs, we might be subtracting the square of the input plus the square of the input's absolute value. Let's test this with -11:

(-11)^2 - (11)^2 = 121 - 121 = 0, which does not match the output.

This hypothesis does not hold. Let's try a different approach. We might be adding or subtracting a multiple of the input to the square of the input. Let's see if there's a consistent multiple that works for all the given pairs:

For -11, 121 - 49 = 72, so we subtract 49, which is 11 * 4 + 5.
For -3, 9 - 1 = 8, so we subtract 1, which is 3 * 0 + 1.
For -2, 4 - 4 = 0, so we subtract 4, which is 2 * 2.
For 18, 324 - 484 = -160, so we subtract 484, which is 18 * 27.
For -7, 49 - 9 = 40, so we subtract 9, which is 7 * 1 + 2.

The multiples do not seem to follow a simple pattern. However, we can notice that for negative inputs, the number we subtract is always a perfect square, and for the positive input, the number we subtract is not a perfect square.

Let's try to find a function that fits all the given pairs. We can see that for negative inputs, the output is the square of the input plus an increasing perfect square:

(-11)^2 + 7^2 = 121 + 49 = 170 (which is incorrect, so this pattern does not hold)
(-3)^2 + 1^2 = 9 + 1 = 10 (which is incorrect, so this pattern does not hold)
(-2)^2 + 0^2 = 4 + 0 = 4 (which is incorrect, so this pattern does not hold)
(-7)^2 + 3^2 = 49 + 9 = 58 (which is incorrect, so this pattern does not hold)

This pattern does not hold either. Let's try a different approach. We can notice that for negative inputs, the output seems to be the square of the input's absolute value minus the input itself:

For -11: 11^2 - (-11) = 121 + 11 = 132 (which is incorrect, so this pattern does not hold)
For -3: 3^2 - (-3) = 9 + 3 = 12 (which is incorrect, so this pattern does not hold)
For -2: 2^2 - (-2) = 4 + 2 = 6 (which is incorrect, so this pattern does not hold)
For -7: 7^2 - (-7) = 49 + 7 = 56 (which is incorrect, so this pattern does not hold)

This pattern does not hold either. It seems that finding the function is not straightforward. We might need to consider a piecewise function or a function that behaves differently for positive and negative inputs.

Given the complexity and the lack of a clear pattern, we may not be able to determine the exact function without more information or additional input-output pairs. However, we can try to make an educated guess for the input of 20 based on the assumption that the function might involve squaring the input and then adding or subtracting a value that is somehow related to the input.

Since the input of 18 resulted in an output of -160, and the input of 20 is close to 18, we might guess that the output for 20 would be somewhat close to -160, but likely a bit lower since the square of 20 (400) is higher than the square of 18 (324). Without a clear pattern, this is purely speculative.

","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. Input: -11, Output: 72
2. Input: -3, Output: 8
3. Input: -2, Output: 0
4. Input: 18, Output: -160
5. Input: -7, Output: 40

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider that the function might involve squaring the input, as squaring would result in a positive number for negative inputs and a negative number for positive inputs when combined with a subtraction or addition.

Let's test this hypothesis by squaring the inputs and comparing them to the outputs:

1. (-11)^2 = 121, but the output is 72. If we subtract 49 (which is 7^2), we get 72.
2. (-3)^2 = 9, but the output is 8. If we subtract 1 (which is 1^2), we get 8.
3. (-2)^2 = 4, but the output is 0. If we subtract 4 (which is 2^2), we get 0.
4. (18)^2 = 324, but the output is -160. If we subtract 484 (which is 22^2), we get -160.
5. (-7)^2 = 49, but the output is 40. If we subtract 9 (which is 3^2), we get 40.

It seems that the function involves squaring the input and then subtracting the square of another number. The second number appears to be related to the input in a way that it increases or decreases by a fixed amount.

Let's try to find the pattern for the second number:

1. For input -11, the second number is 7 (11 + 4).
2. For input -3, the second number is 1 (3 + 2).
3. For input -2, the second number is 2 (2 + 0).
4. For input 18, the second number is 22 (18 + 4).
5. For input -7, the second number is 3 (7 + 4).

It seems that for negative inputs, we add 4 to the absolute value of the input to get the second number, and for positive inputs, we add 4 to the input itself.

Now let's apply this pattern to the new input:

Input: -4

First, we square the input: (-4)^2 = 16.
Then, we determine the second number: 4 (absolute value of input) + 4 = 8.
Now we square the second number: 8^2 = 64.
Finally, we subtract the square of the second number from the square of the input: 16 - 64 = -48.

Input: 18  | Output: -160
Input: -7  | Output: 40

We can start by looking for patterns. One approach is to consider whether the output is a function of the input squared, since the sign of the input does not affect the sign of the output in the given examples.

Let's test this hypothesis by squaring the inputs and comparing them to the outputs:

(-11)^2 = 121, but the output is 72, which is 121 - 49.
(-3)^2 = 9, but the output is 8, which is 9 - 1.
(-2)^2 = 4, but the output is 0, which is 4 - 4.
18^2 = 324, but the output is -160, which is -324 + 164.
(-7)^2 = 49, but the output is 40, which is 49 - 9.

It seems that when the input is negative, the output is the input squared minus the input, and when the input is positive, the output is the negative of the input squared plus twice the input.

Let's try to formalize this into a function f(x):

If x < 0, f(x) = x^2 - x
If x >= 0, f(x) = -(x^2) + 2x

Now let's apply this function to the new input:

Input: 12

Since 12 is positive, we use the second part of the function:

f(12) = -(12^2) + 2*12
f(12) = -(144) + 24
f(12) = -144 + 24
f(12) = -120

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider whether the output is a linear function of the input, which would mean the output changes by a constant amount for a constant change in input. However, the changes here do not seem to be constant, so it's likely not a simple linear function.

Another approach is to look at the absolute differences between the inputs and outputs to see if there's a multiplicative or additive pattern:

For input 11, the output is -204. If we consider a multiplicative pattern, we might try multiplying 11 by a certain number and then adding or subtracting a constant to get -204.

Let's try to find a pattern by comparing the input and output values:

For input -4 and output 66, if we multiply -4 by -18, we get 72, and subtracting 6 gives us 66.
For input -17 and output 300, if we multiply -17 by -18, we get 306, and subtracting 6 gives us 300.
For input -15 and output 264, if we multiply -15 by -18, we get 270, and subtracting 6 gives us 264.
For input 20 and output -366, if we multiply 20 by -18, we get -360, and subtracting 6 gives us -366.

It seems that the pattern might be to multiply the input by -18 and then subtract 6. Let's test this with the input of 7:

7 * -18 = -126

5. Input: 20, Output: -366

We can start by looking for a pattern. Let's consider the possibility of a linear function first, which has the form f(x) = ax + b.

However, a quick glance at the numbers suggests that the relationship might not be linear, as the change in output does not seem to be constant when the input changes by a constant amount.

Let's consider the possibility of a quadratic function, which has the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

To determine if it's quadratic, we can check if the differences between the outputs for consecutive inputs have a constant difference (which would suggest a linear relationship between the outputs and the inputs squared).

Let's calculate the differences between the outputs for the given inputs:

For inputs 11 and -4 (difference of 15):
-204 - 66 = -270

For inputs -4 and -17 (difference of 13):
66 - 300 = -234

For inputs -17 and -15 (difference of 2):
300 - 264 = 36

For inputs -15 and 20 (difference of 35):
264 - (-366) = 264 + 366 = 630

The differences between the outputs are not consistent, which suggests that the relationship is not quadratic either.

Let's try another approach. We can look for a pattern in how the output changes as the input changes. We can notice that the output is negative when the input is positive and positive when the input is negative. This suggests that there might be a negative sign involved in the relationship.

Let's try multiplying the input by itself and then by a negative number to see if we can find a consistent relationship:

For input 11:
11 * 11 = 121
We need to find a number that when multiplied by 121 and possibly added to a constant gives -204.

For input -4:
-4 * -4 = 16
We need to find a number that when multiplied by 16 and possibly added to a constant gives 66.

Let's try to find a pattern by dividing the output by the square of the input:

For input 11:
-204 / (11 * 11) = -204 / 121 ≈ -1.686

For input -4:
66 / (-4 * -4) = 66 / 16 = 4.125

For input -17:
300 / (-17 * -17) = 300 / 289 ≈ 1.038

For input -15:
264 / (-15 * -15) = 264 / 225 ≈ 1.173

For input 20:
-366 / (20 * 20) = -366 / 400 = -0.915

The results are not consistent, which suggests that the relationship is not simply a matter of dividing the output by the square of the input.

Given the complexity of the pattern and the lack of a clear linear, quadratic, or simple multiplicative relationship, we may need to consider a more complex function or a piecewise function that behaves differently for positive and negative inputs.

Without a clear pattern, we cannot determine the exact function. However, we can still try to guess the output for the input -3 by looking for a pattern in the changes of the output as the input changes.

Let's look at the inputs closest to -3, which are -4 and -15:

For input -4, the output is 66.
For input -15, the output is 264.

The output increases as the input decreases from -4 to -15. If we assume a similar pattern for an input of -3 (which is one unit greater than -4), we might expect the output to be slightly less than 66.

However, without a clear pattern, this is purely speculative. We need more information or a different approach to accurately determine the function and calculate the output for an input of -3.

However, a quick glance at the numbers suggests that the relationship is not linear, as the change in output is not proportional to the change in input. Let's consider whether the relationship could be quadratic, which would be of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

To determine if it's quadratic, we can look at the differences between the outputs for consecutive inputs, but since the inputs are not consecutive, we can't directly apply this method. Instead, let's try to find a pattern by examining the inputs and outputs more closely.

Notice that when the input is positive, the output is negative, and when the input is negative, the output is positive. This suggests that there might be a negative sign involved in the relationship.

Let's try to find a function that fits the input-output pairs by using the simplest input-output pair to guess the function. We can start with the input -4, which has an output of 66. If we assume a quadratic function, we might guess that the function involves squaring the input, multiplying by a constant, and possibly adding or subtracting a constant.

For input -4:
(-4)^2 = 16
To get to 66, we would need to multiply 16 by a number and then add or subtract a constant. If we guess that the number we multiply by is 4 (since 4 * 16 = 64), we would then add 2 to get 66.

Let's test this with another pair:
For input -17:
(-17)^2 = 289
If we multiply by 4, we get 1156. This is not close to 300, so our initial guess is incorrect.

We need to find a different relationship. Let's try to find a function that fits all the given pairs. We can notice that the output is always a multiple of 11 away from being a multiple of 6. Let's test this hypothesis:

For input 11, the output is -204, which is 6 * -34 (which is a multiple of 6) minus 6 (which is 11 - 5).
For input -4, the output is 66, which is 6 * 11 (which is a multiple of 6) plus 6 (which is 11 - 5).
For input -17, the output is 300, which is 6 * 50 (which is a multiple of 6) minus 6 (which is 11 - 5).
For input -15, the output is 264, which is 6 * 44 (which is a multiple of 6) minus 6 (which is 11 - 5).
For input 20, the output is -366, which is 6 * -61 (which is a multiple of 6) minus 6 (which is 11 - 5).

This pattern suggests a function of the form f(x) = 6x - (11 - 5) when x is negative and f(x) = 6x - (11 + 5) when x is positive.

Let's apply this function to the new input -18:
f(-18) = 6 * (-18) - (11 - 5)
f(-18) = -108 - 6
f(-18) = -114

Input: -4, Output: 66
Input: -17, Output: 300
Input: -15, Output: 264

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider that the function might involve a polynomial, where the input is raised to a power and then multiplied by a constant, possibly with some additional operations.

Let's look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs to see if we can discern a pattern:

For positive inputs:
- When the input is 11, the output is negative.
- When the input is 20, the output is also negative.

For negative inputs:
- When the input is -4, the output is positive.
- When the input is -17, the output is positive.
- When the input is -15, the output is positive.

This suggests that the sign of the output is opposite to the sign of the input. This could mean that the function involves multiplication by a negative number.

Let's try to find a function that fits the given pairs. We can start by assuming a linear function of the form f(x) = ax + b. However, the large differences in the outputs suggest that the function might be quadratic or of a higher degree.

To simplify the process, let's look at the differences between the outputs for consecutive inputs:

- The difference between the outputs for inputs -17 and -15 is 300 - 264 = 36.
- The difference between the outputs for inputs -4 and 11 is 66 - (-204) = 270.

The differences are not consistent, which suggests that the function is not linear. Let's consider a quadratic function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

We can use the given pairs to set up a system of equations and solve for a, b, and c. However, since we are looking for a pattern rather than an exact formula, we can also look for a simpler relationship.

Notice that the outputs are all multiples of 6, which suggests that 6 might be a factor in the function. Let's divide the outputs by 6 and see if we can find a simpler pattern:

- For input 11, output/6 = -204/6 = -34
- For input -4, output/6 = 66/6 = 11
- For input -17, output/6 = 300/6 = 50
- For input -15, output/6 = 264/6 = 44
- For input 20, output/6 = -366/6 = -61

Now let's look at the relationship between the inputs and the divided outputs:

- For input 11, 11^2 = 121, and -34 is close to -3 times 11 plus a small constant.
- For input -4, (-4)^2 = 16, and 11 is close to -3 times -4 plus a small constant.
- For input -17, (-17)^2 = 289, and 50 is close to -3 times -17 plus a small constant.
- For input -15, (-15)^2 = 225, and 44 is close to -3 times -15 plus a small constant.
- For input 20, 20^2 = 400, and -61 is close to -3 times 20 plus a small constant.

This suggests a possible function of the form f(x) = -6(3x + k), where k is a constant.

To find the exact value of k, we would need to solve the system of equations, but since we are looking for a pattern, let's test this function with the input -20:

f(-20) = -6(3(-20) + k) = -6(-60 + k) = 360 - 6k

We need to find the value of k that makes the function work for one of the given pairs. Let's use the pair (11, -204):

-204 = -6(3(11) + k)
-204 = -6(33 + k)
-204 = -198 - 6k
6k = 6
k = 1

Now we can use this value of k to find the output for the input -20:

f(-20) = -6(3(-20) + 1) = -6(-60 + 1) = -6(-59) = 354

Therefore, the output for the input -20 is 354.

One approach is to consider whether the output is a linear function of the input, which would mean the output changes by a constant amount for a constant change in input. However, the changes here do not seem to be constant, suggesting a non-linear relationship.

Let's consider the possibility of a quadratic relationship, where the output is a function of the square of the input. We can test this by squaring the inputs and seeing if there's a linear relationship between the squared inputs and the outputs.

For input 11, the square is 121.
For input -4, the square is 16.
For input -17, the square is 289.
For input -15, the square is 225.
For input 20, the square is 400.

Now let's see if there's a linear relationship between the squared inputs and the outputs:

121 -> -204
16 -> 66
289 -> 300
225 -> 264
400 -> -366

This still doesn't seem to be linear. However, we can notice that the outputs are negative when the inputs are positive, and the outputs are positive when the inputs are negative. This suggests that there might be a negative coefficient involved when the input is positive and a positive coefficient when the input is negative.

Let's try to find a function that fits the pattern. We can start by assuming the function has the form:

f(x) = a * x^2 + b * x + c

We need to find the values of a, b, and c that fit the given input-output pairs. Since we have five pairs, we can set up a system of equations to solve for a, b, and c. However, given the complexity of the problem and the limited data points, it might be more efficient to look for a pattern in the differences between the outputs and the squares of the inputs.

Let's calculate the differences:

For input 11, output -204 and square 121: -204 - (-121) = -83
For input -4, output 66 and square 16: 66 - 16 = 50
For input -17, output 300 and square 289: 300 - 289 = 11
For input -15, output 264 and square 225: 264 - 225 = 39
For input 20, output -366 and square 400: -366 - 400 = -766

The differences do not form a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence. However, we can notice that the differences are multiples of 11 (except for the first one, which is a multiple of -11). This suggests that the function might involve multiplying the square of the input by a factor and then adding or subtracting a multiple of 11.

Let's try to find a consistent rule for the multiples of 11:

For input 11, the difference is -83, which is -11 * 7.5 (not an integer multiple)
For input -4, the difference is 50, which is 11 * 4.5 (not an integer multiple)
For input -17, the difference is 11, which is 11 * 1
For input -15, the difference is 39, which is 11 * 3.5 (not an integer multiple)
For input 20, the difference is -766, which is -11 * 69.5 (not an integer multiple)

The multiples of 11 are not consistent, and some are not even integers. This suggests that the function might be more complex than a simple quadratic equation with an added multiple of 11.

Given the complexity of the problem and the lack of a clear pattern, we may need more information or a different approach to determine the exact function. However, we can still try to find the output for the input of 1 by looking for a pattern in the way the function changes as the input changes.

Let's look at the inputs closest to 1, which are -4 and 11:

For input -4, the output is 66.
For input 11, the output is -204.

The change in output from -4 to 11 is -204 - 66 = -270. The change in input from -4 to 11 is 11 - (-4) = 15. This suggests that for each unit change in input, the output changes by -270 / 15 = -18.

However, this is a very rough estimate and assumes a linear change between the two points, which is unlikely to be accurate given the non-linear nature of the function.

Without a clear pattern or additional information, we cannot accurately determine the output for an input of 1. Therefore, we cannot provide a ""Final Output"" for this input.",-24,False,"[-18, -6]"

Let's think step by step about what the function could be. Remember to write down 'Final Output:' before your final answer.
Input: 15
","To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -12 | Output: 9
Input: 20  | Output: -55
Input: -4  | Output: -7
Input: -10 | Output: 5
Input: 8   | Output: -31

We can start by looking for patterns. One approach is to check if there's a linear relationship, such as output = a * input + b. However, a quick check shows that this isn't the case, as the ratio of output to input isn't consistent.

Another approach is to look for a polynomial relationship, but given the small number of points and the lack of a clear pattern, this might be complex and not immediately evident.

We can also consider if the output is a function of the absolute value of the input, given that both positive and negative inputs are present. Let's see if there's a pattern when we consider the absolute values:

Input: -12 | Absolute: 12 | Output: 9
Input: 20  | Absolute: 20 | Output: -55
Input: -4  | Absolute: 4  | Output: -7
Input: -10 | Absolute: 10 | Output: 5
Input: 8   | Absolute: 8  | Output: -31

There's no clear linear relationship here either. However, we can notice that the sign of the output is opposite to the sign of the input. This suggests that part of the function involves multiplying by -1.

Let's try to find a pattern by multiplying the input by a number and then adding or subtracting a constant:

For input -12, multiplying by -1 gives us 12, and to get to 9, we subtract 3.
For input 20, multiplying by -1 gives us -20, and to get to -55, we subtract 35.
For input -4, multiplying by -1 gives us 4, and to get to -7, we subtract 11.
For input -10, multiplying by -1 gives us 10, and to get to 5, we subtract 5.
For input 8, multiplying by -1 gives us -8, and to get to -31, we subtract 23.

This doesn't seem to follow a simple addition or subtraction pattern either. However, we can notice that the numbers we're subtracting (3, 35, 11, 5, 23) are all odd, which might suggest that the function involves subtracting an odd function of the input.

Given the complexity and the lack of a clear pattern, we might need to consider other mathematical operations or combinations of operations, such as modular arithmetic, exponentiation, or conditional statements based on the input's properties (e.g., whether it's even or odd, positive or negative).

Without a clear pattern, we can't definitively determine the function. However, we can make an educated guess based on the observation that the output changes sign with respect to the input and seems to involve subtracting an odd number.

Let's try to apply this observation to the new input:

Input: 15

Following the pattern that the output changes sign with respect to the input, we would start by multiplying by -1:

15 * -1 = -15

Now, we need to subtract an odd number. Since we don't have a clear rule for which odd number to subtract, we can't provide an exact output. However, if we were to guess based on the previous outputs, we might guess that the number to subtract could be related to the input in a way we haven't determined yet.

Since we cannot determine the exact function with the information provided, we cannot provide a final output for the input of 15.

","To solve the problem, let's first try to identify a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs. We will look at the input-output pairs and try to deduce a rule or formula.

Input: -12 | Output: 9
Input: 20  | Output: -55
Input: -4  | Output: -7
Input: -10 | Output: 5
Input: 8   | Output: -31

Let's look for a pattern. We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs.

For input -12, the output is 9. If we assume a linear function of the form f(x) = ax + b, we can set up the following equation for this input-output pair:

-12a + b = 9

We would need another pair to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Let's use the input 20 and its output -55:

20a + b = -55

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) -12a + b = 9
2) 20a + b = -55

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second to eliminate 'b':

(20a + b) - (-12a + b) = -55 - 9
20a + b + 12a - b = -55 - 9
32a = -64
a = -64 / 32
a = -2

Now that we have 'a', we can substitute it back into one of the equations to find 'b'. Let's use the first equation:

-12(-2) + b = 9
24 + b = 9
b = 9 - 24
b = -15

So our assumed linear function is f(x) = -2x - 15. Let's test this function with another input-output pair to see if it holds true:

For input -4, the output is -7 according to the given pairs.

f(-4) = -2(-4) - 15
f(-4) = 8 - 15
f(-4) = -7

This matches the given output, so it seems our function is correct. Now let's apply this function to the new input:

Input: 15
","To solve the problem, let's first look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs. We can start by checking if there is a linear relationship or if the output is a result of some arithmetic operation applied to the input.

Let's analyze the given pairs:

1. Input: -12 | Output: 9
2. Input: 20 | Output: -55
3. Input: -4 | Output: -7
4. Input: -10 | Output: 5
5. Input: 8 | Output: -31

We can try to determine if there's a simple arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) that can be applied to the input to get the output. However, the relationship does not seem to be linear, as both positive and negative inputs can yield both positive and negative outputs.

Let's look for a pattern by considering the possibility of a polynomial function or a piecewise function. We can start by checking if the output is a result of squaring the input, taking its absolute value, or multiplying by a constant, then adding or subtracting a value.

If we look at the first pair, -12 and 9, we can see that if we square -12, we get 144, which is not close to 9. However, if we consider the possibility of the output being the negative of the input squared plus a constant, we can try:

(-12)^2 = 144
144 + ? = 9

This does not seem to work since we would need to subtract a much larger number to get down to 9.

Let's try another approach. We can look at the differences between the inputs and outputs:

1. -12 to 9 is a difference of 21
2. 20 to -55 is a difference of -75
3. -4 to -7 is a difference of -3
4. -10 to 5 is a difference of 15
5. 8 to -31 is a difference of -39

The differences do not suggest a simple arithmetic progression or a common factor.

Another approach is to look for a pattern in the changes between consecutive inputs and outputs:

1. From -12 to 20 (input), the change is 32, and from 9 to -55 (output), the change is -64.
2. From 20 to -4 (input), the change is -24, and from -55 to -7 (output), the change is 48.
3. From -4 to -10 (input), the change is -6, and from -7 to 5 (output), the change is 12.
4. From -10 to 8 (input), the change is 18, and from 5 to -31 (output), the change is -36.

It seems that the change in output is consistently the negative of the change in input multiplied by 2. Let's test this pattern with the next input:

From 8 to 15 (input), the change is 7. If we apply the pattern, the change in output should be -14 (since -2 * 7 = -14).

The last output we have is -31, so applying the change of -14:

-31 + (-14) = -31 - 14 = -45

Therefore, if the pattern holds, the output for the input 15 should be -45.

- Input: 20, Output: -55
- Input: -4, Output: -7
- Input: -10, Output: 5
- Input: 8, Output: -31

Let's look for a pattern. We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship, a quadratic relationship, or some other mathematical operation that could explain the transformation from input to output.

First, let's consider the possibility of a linear function of the form `f(x) = ax + b`. However, a quick look at the pairs suggests that the relationship is not linear, as the difference between outputs does not increase or decrease consistently with the increase or decrease in inputs.

Next, let's consider if the function could be quadratic or involve some other polynomial. We can look for a pattern in the changes of the output values as the input values change. However, the outputs do not seem to follow a simple polynomial pattern either.

Another approach is to look at the signs of the inputs and outputs. Negative inputs seem to produce positive outputs and vice versa, except for the input -4. This suggests that there might be a conditional aspect to the function, where different rules apply to different ranges of input values.

Given the complexity and the lack of a clear pattern, we might suspect that the function involves conditional statements or a piecewise definition. Without more information or additional input-output pairs, it is difficult to determine the exact function.

However, we can still try to make an educated guess for the input -20 based on the observed pattern of sign changes. Since -20 is a negative number and most negative inputs result in positive outputs, we might guess that the output for -20 will be positive. But without a clear pattern, this is purely speculative.

Since we cannot determine the exact function with the information provided, we cannot provide a definitive output for the input -20. Therefore, the final output cannot be determined.

Input: -12 | Output: 9
Input: 20  | Output: -55
Input: -4  | Output: -7
Input: -10 | Output: 5
Input: 8   | Output: -31

We can start by looking for patterns. One approach is to check if there's a linear relationship, such as a constant difference or ratio. However, the outputs do not increase or decrease consistently relative to the inputs, so it's likely not a simple linear function.

Another approach is to consider whether the output depends on whether the input is positive or negative. We can see that negative inputs result in positive outputs and vice versa. This suggests that the function might involve multiplying the input by a negative number.

Let's try to find a function that fits the first pair:

Input: -12 | Output: 9
If we multiply -12 by -1, we get 12, which is not enough to reach 9. However, if we consider a linear function of the form f(x) = ax + b, we can try to find the values of a and b that fit the data.

Let's assume the function is of the form f(x) = ax + b. We can use two input-output pairs to create two equations and solve for a and b.

Using the pairs (-12, 9) and (20, -55), we get:
1) -12a + b = 9
2) 20a + b = -55

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b. Let's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate b:

(20a + b) - (-12a + b) = -55 - 9
20a - (-12a) = -55 - 9
32a = -64
a = -64 / 32
a = -2

Now we can substitute the value of a back into one of the equations to find b. Using the first equation:

-12(-2) + b = 9
24 + b = 9
b = 9 - 24
b = -15

So the function seems to be f(x) = -2x - 15. Let's verify this with another pair:

Input: -4 | Output: -7
f(-4) = -2(-4) - 15
f(-4) = 8 - 15

This matches the given output, so our function seems to be correct.

Let's try to find a relationship between the inputs and outputs. One approach is to look for a linear relationship of the form `Output = a * Input + b`.

Let's compare the inputs and outputs:

For Input: -16, Output: 82, we have:
82 = a * (-16) + b

For Input: -11, Output: 52, we have:
52 = a * (-11) + b

Let's try to solve for `a` and `b` using these two equations:

82 = -16a + b
52 = -11a + b

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
30 = -5a
a = -6

Now we can substitute `a` back into one of the equations to find `b`:

82 = -16 * (-6) + b
82 = 96 + b
b = 82 - 96
b = -14

So the function seems to be:
Output = -6 * Input - 14

Let's try to find a relationship between the inputs and outputs. We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship, such as a multiplication or addition/subtraction that can be applied to all pairs.

For the first pair, if we consider a linear function f(x) = ax + b, we have:
f(-16) = a(-16) + b = 82
-16a + b = 82

For the second pair:
f(-11) = a(-11) + b = 52

For the fifth pair:
f(3) = a(3) + b = -32
3a + b = -32

Let's try to find the difference between the outputs when the inputs increase by 1 unit:

From Input -16 to -11 (difference of 5 units), the output increases from 82 to 52 (difference of -30 units).
From Input -11 to 14 (difference of 25 units), the output increases from 52 to -98 (difference of -150 units).
From Input 14 to -18 (difference of -32 units), the output increases from -98 to 94 (difference of 192 units).
From Input -18 to 3 (difference of 21 units), the output increases from 94 to -32 (difference of -126 units).

The differences in outputs are not consistent with a linear function. However, we can notice that the output seems to be the negative of the input multiplied by a certain number plus a constant. Let's try to find a pattern by multiplying the input by 6 and then subtracting 2:

For Input -16:
(-16 * 6) - 2 = -96 - 2 = -98
But we need 82, so let's add 180 to the result:
-98 + 180 = 82

For Input -11:
(-11 * 6) - 2 = -66 - 2 = -68
Adding 180 gives us:
-68 + 180 = 112 (which is not the expected 52, so this pattern doesn't hold)

Since the pattern doesn't hold, let's try another approach. We can notice that the output changes sign when the input changes from negative to positive. This suggests that there might be a piecewise function at play, where the function behaves differently for negative and positive inputs.

Let's consider the possibility of a piecewise function where for negative inputs, the function is f(x) = -6x - 2, and for positive inputs, the function is f(x) = -6x + 2.

Testing this for the given inputs:
For Input -16:
f(-16) = -6(-16) - 2 = 96 - 2 = 94 (which is not the expected 82)

For Input 3:
f(3) = -6(3) + 2 = -18 + 2 = -16 (which is not the expected -32)

This piecewise function also does not fit all the given data.

Since the linear and piecewise approaches did not work, we might be dealing with a more complex function or a pattern that is not immediately obvious. Without a clear pattern, we cannot confidently determine the function that transforms the input to the output.

However, if we look at the inputs and outputs more closely, we can see that for negative inputs, the output is the input multiplied by -6 and then increased by 2 less than the absolute value of the input:

For Input -16:
(-16 * -6) + (-16 - 2) = 96 + (-18) = 78 (which is not the expected 82)

For Input -11:
(-11 * -6) + (-11 - 2) = 66 + (-13) = 53 (which is not the expected 52)

This pattern also does not fit all the given data.

For the first pair:
Output - Input = 82 - (-16) = 82 + 16 = 98

For the second pair:
Output - Input = 52 - (-11) = 52 + 11 = 63

For the third pair:

It seems that for negative inputs, the difference is 16 more than for positive inputs. This suggests that the function might involve multiplying the input by -6 and then adding or subtracting a constant to get the output.

Let's test this hypothesis with the given pairs:

For the first pair (-16):
(-16) * (-6) = 96

One possible approach is to check if there is a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. We can try to find a function of the form f(x) = ax + b, where a and b are constants.

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for a and b:

Using Input: -16, Output: 82
82 = a(-16) + b
82 = -16a + b (1)

Using Input: -11, Output: 52
52 = a(-11) + b
52 = -11a + b (2)

Now, let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate b and solve for a:

82 - 52 = -16a - (-11a)
30 = -5a
a = -6

Now that we have a, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find b:

82 = -16(-6) + b
82 = 96 + b
b = 82 - 96
b = -14

So, our function seems to be f(x) = -6x - 14.

Input: -12
","To determine the function that transforms the input to the output, let's look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs:

Input: -16 | Output: 82
Input: -11 | Output: 52
Input: 14  | Output: -98
Input: -18 | Output: 94
Input: 3   | Output: -32

Let's try to find a relationship between the inputs and outputs. We can start by checking if there's a linear relationship, which means we would look for a function of the form f(x) = ax + b.

For the first pair, if we assume a linear relationship, we would have:
a(-16) + b = 82

For the second pair:
a(-11) + b = 52

We can set up a system of equations, but before we do that, let's see if there's a simpler pattern. We can notice that the sign of the output is opposite to the sign of the input, which suggests that the function involves multiplication by -1. Also, the magnitude of the output seems to be larger than the magnitude of the input.

Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the differences between the input and output values:

For the first pair:
|-16| + 82 = 98
For the second pair:
|-11| + 52 = 63
For the third pair:
|14| + (-98) = 112
For the fourth pair:
|-18| + 94 = 112
For the fifth pair:
|3| + (-32) = 35

It seems that the output is not a simple linear function of the input. However, we can notice that the difference between the output and the input, when both are taken as positive values, is consistently a multiple of 14 (98, 63, 112, 112, 35). This suggests that the function might involve multiplying the input by -7 and then adding or subtracting a constant.

Let's test this hypothesis with the first input-output pair:
-16 * -7 = 112
112 - 30 = 82

This seems to work for the first pair. Let's test it with another pair:
-11 * -7 = 77
77 - 25 = 52

This doesn't work for the second pair, so our hypothesis is incorrect. We need to look for another pattern.

Let's try another approach by looking at the absolute differences between the input and output values:

For the first pair:
|82 - (-16)| = 98
For the second pair:
|52 - (-11)| = 63
For the third pair:
|-98 - 14| = 112
For the fourth pair:
|94 - (-18)| = 112
For the fifth pair:
|-32 - 3| = 35

Now, let's see if we can find a relationship between these differences and the inputs:

98 / 16 = 6.125
63 / 11 = 5.727...
112 / 14 = 8
112 / 18 = 6.222...
35 / 3 = 11.666...

The differences divided by the absolute value of the inputs do not yield a consistent ratio, so it's not a simple division either.

Given the complexity of the pattern and the lack of a clear linear, multiplicative, or divisional relationship, it's possible that the function involves a more complex operation or a piecewise definition that cannot be easily deduced from the given pairs.

Without a clear pattern, we cannot confidently determine the function that transforms the input to the output. Therefore, we cannot provide the output for the input -12 with the information currently available.

Input: -1 → Output: -7
Input: 3 → Output: 9
Input: -18 → Output: -75 (repeated, so no new information)

Looking at the inputs and outputs, we can try to find a pattern or a mathematical relationship. One approach is to look for a linear relationship first, which is of the form:

Output = a * Input + b

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for 'a' and 'b'.

Using Input: -1 and Output: -7:
-7 = a * (-1) + b
-7 = -a + b ... (1)

Using Input: 2 and Output: 5:
5 = a * 2 + b
5 = 2a + b ... (2)

Now, let's solve these two equations simultaneously.

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):
5 - (-7) = 2a - (-a)
12 = 3a
a = 4

Now, let's find 'b' using the value of 'a' in equation (1):
-7 = -4 + b
b = -7 + 4
b = -3

So, the function seems to be:
Output = 4 * Input - 3

Looking at the pairs, it seems that the output is not a simple linear function of the input. However, we can try to find a pattern by examining the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For Input: -18, the difference is -75 - (-18) = -57
For Input: -1, the difference is -7 - (-1) = -6
For Input: 3, the difference is 9 - 3 = 6
For Input: 2, the difference is 5 - 2 = 3

It seems that the difference between the output and the input is a multiple of 3, except for the first pair. Let's try to find a function that fits all the given pairs. We can start by assuming the function is of the form:

Output = a * (Input) + b

Now let's use the input-output pairs to find 'a' and 'b'.

Using Input: -1 and Output: -7:
-7 = a * (-1) + b
b = -7 + a

Using Input: 3 and Output: 9:
9 = a * 3 + b
9 = 3a + (-7 + a)
9 = 4a - 7
16 = 4a
a = 4

Now that we have 'a', we can find 'b':
b = -7 + a
b = -7 + 4
b = -3

So the function seems to be:

Input: -1  | Output: -7
Input: 3   | Output: 9
Input: -18 | Output: -75 (repeated, confirms the relationship)
Input: 2   | Output: 5

Looking at the inputs and outputs, we can try to find a pattern or a mathematical relationship. One way to approach this is to look for a simple arithmetic operation that can be applied to the input to get the output.

Let's try to find a function f(x) such that f(input) = output.

For the first pair:
f(-18) = -75
For the second pair:
f(-1) = -7
For the third pair:
f(3) = 9
For the fifth pair:
f(2) = 5

We can notice that the output is always less than the input when the input is negative and greater when the input is positive. This suggests that the function might involve multiplication and addition or subtraction.

Let's try to find a linear function of the form f(x) = ax + b.

Using the first pair (-18, -75), we can create the equation:
a(-18) + b = -75

Using the second pair (-1, -7), we can create the equation:
a(-1) + b = -7

Now we have a system of two equations:
-18a + b = -75
-a + b = -7

We can solve this system to find the values of a and b. Let's multiply the second equation by 18 to eliminate b:

18(-a + b) = 18(-7)
-18a + 18b = -126

Now we add this to the first equation:
-18a + b = -75
-18a + 18b = -126
-------------------
17b = -201

b = -201 / 17
b = -11.8235 (approximately)

This value of b doesn't seem to be an integer, which is unusual for such problems. Let's check our calculations by trying to find a pattern without solving the system of equations.

We can look for a pattern by examining the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For -18 to -75, the difference is -57.
For -1 to -7, the difference is -6.
For 3 to 9, the difference is 6.
For 2 to 5, the difference is 3.

It seems like the difference is related to the input by a factor. If we divide the difference by the input, we get:

-57 / -18 = 3.166...
-6 / -1 = 6
6 / 3 = 2
3 / 2 = 1.5

This doesn't give us a clear pattern either. However, if we look closely, we can see that the output seems to be the input cubed and then subtracted by the input itself:

(-18)^3 - (-18) = -5832 + 18 = -5814 (which is not -75)
(-1)^3 - (-1) = -1 + 1 = 0 (which is not -7)
(3)^3 - 3 = 27 - 3 = 24 (which is not 9)
(2)^3 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 (which is not 5)

This pattern does not hold either. Let's try another approach by looking at the differences between the outputs and the inputs:

-75 - (-18) = -57
-7 - (-1) = -6
9 - 3 = 6
5 - 2 = 3

Now, let's look at the relationship between the input and the difference:

-18 -> -57 (3 * 19)
-1 -> -6 (3 * 2)
3 -> 6 (3 * 2)
2 -> 3 (3 * 1)

It seems that the difference is 3 times one more than the absolute value of the input. Let's test this pattern:

For input -14:
The absolute value is 14.
One more than the absolute value is 15.
3 times this number is 45.
The output should be the input minus this number: -14 - 45 = -59.

So, if this pattern holds, the output for the input -14 should be -59.

-7 = -a + b ... (1)

Using Input: 3 and Output: 9:
9 = a * 3 + b
9 = 3a + b ... (2)

Now, let's solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

9 - (-7) = 3a - (-a)
16 = 4a
a = 4

Now, let's substitute 'a' back into equation (1) to find 'b':

-7 = -4 * (-1) + b
-7 = 4 + b
b = -7 - 4
b = -11

So, the function seems to be:

Output = 4 * Input - 11

Let's test this function with the input 2:

Output = 4 * 2 - 11
Output = 8 - 11
Output = -3

However, this does not match the given output for the input 2, which is 5. This suggests that the relationship might not be linear or that it involves a different mathematical operation.

Let's try another approach by looking at the differences between the inputs and outputs:

For Input: -18 and Output: -75, the difference is -75 - (-18) = -57
For Input: -1 and Output: -7, the difference is -7 - (-1) = -6
For Input: 3 and Output: 9, the difference is 9 - 3 = 6
For Input: 2 and Output: 5, the difference is 5 - 2 = 3

It seems that the difference between the output and the input is a multiple of 3. Let's see if multiplying the input by 3 and then subtracting a certain number gives us the correct output:

For Input: -18, -18 * 3 = -54, and -54 - 21 = -75
For Input: -1, -1 * 3 = -3, and -3 - 4 = -7
For Input: 3, 3 * 3 = 9, and 9 - 0 = 9
For Input: 2, 2 * 3 = 6, and 6 - 1 = 5

This pattern suggests that the function might be:

Output = 3 * Input - (Input + 2)

Let's test this function with the input 2:

Output = 3 * 2 - (2 + 2)
Output = 6 - 4
Output = 2

This still does not match the given output for the input 2, which is 5. The pattern is not clear from the given data, and the function is not consistent with a simple algebraic operation.

For input 3, the output is 9. The difference is 9 - 3 = 6.
For input 2, the output is 5. The difference is 5 - 2 = 3.

It seems that the output is 3 times the input minus 3, as we can see from the following:

Looking at the positive inputs and their outputs:
- Input: 6, Output: 74
- Input: 19, Output: 191

It seems that for positive numbers, the output is the input followed by the digit 1. This could be represented by the function f(x) = 10x + 1, where x is the input.

Now, let's look at the negative inputs and their outputs:
- Input: -11, Output: -79
- Input: -5, Output: -25
- Input: -10, Output: -70

For negative numbers, the pattern is not immediately clear. However, if we multiply the input by 7 and then add 2, we get the output:
- Input: -11, Output: (-11 * 7) + 2 = -77 + 2 = -75 (which is not the given output, so there might be an error in our assumption)
- Input: -5, Output: (-5 * 7) + 2 = -35 + 2 = -33 (which is not the given output, so the pattern does not hold)
- Input: -10, Output: (-10 * 7) + 2 = -70 + 2 = -68 (which is not the given output, so the pattern does not hold)

The pattern for negative numbers is not as straightforward as for positive numbers. Let's try to find a different relationship for the negative inputs. We can notice that the output is the input multiplied by a certain number plus an offset. Let's try to find this multiplier and offset.

For input -11, the output is -79. If we add 11 to both sides to try to find a multiplier, we get:
-11 + 11 = -79 + 11
0 = -68

This doesn't help us find a multiplier. Let's try multiplying the input by a number and then adding a constant to see if we can find a pattern:
- Input: -11, Output: -79 (possible function: f(x) = ax + b)
- Input: -5, Output: -25 (possible function: f(x) = ax + b)
- Input: -10, Output: -70 (possible function: f(x) = ax + b)

If we assume the function is linear, we can try to find 'a' and 'b' such that f(x) = ax + b. Let's use two points to find the equation of the line:
Using inputs -11 and -5:
- For -11: -79 = a(-11) + b
- For -5: -25 = a(-5) + b

Let's solve this system of equations:
1) -79 = -11a + b
2) -25 = -5a + b

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1, we get:
-79 - (-25) = -11a - (-5a)
-54 = -6a
a = 9

Now we can substitute 'a' back into one of the equations to find 'b':
-79 = -11(9) + b
-79 = -99 + b
b = -79 + 99
b = 20

So the function for negative numbers seems to be f(x) = 9x + 20.

From the given input-output pairs:

Input: 19 → Output: 191
Input: -11 → Output: -79
Input: -5 → Output: -25
Input: -10 → Output: -70

Let's look for a pattern. For positive numbers, it seems like the output is the input followed by the number 1 (as a digit, not as a value to be added). For example, 6 becomes 74, and 19 becomes 191.

For negative numbers, the pattern is different. It seems like the output is the input multiplied by 7 plus 1. For example:
-11 * 7 + 1 = -77 + 1 = -76 (but the actual output is -79, so this pattern doesn't hold)
-5 * 7 + 1 = -35 + 1 = -34 (but the actual output is -25, so this pattern doesn't hold)
-10 * 7 + 1 = -70 + 1 = -69 (but the actual output is -70, so this pattern doesn't hold)

The pattern for negative numbers is not immediately clear, so let's look for a different relationship. We can notice that the output is the input multiplied by a certain number and then either added or subtracted by a constant. Let's try to find the multiplier and the constant.

For -11, the output is -79. If we add 11 to both sides to try to find a multiplier, we get:
-11 + 11 = 0
-79 + 11 = -68

Now, if we divide -68 by -11, we get:
-68 / -11 = 6.1818...

This doesn't give us a clear multiplier. Let's try the same with -5 and -25:
-5 + 5 = 0
-25 + 5 = -20

Now, if we divide -20 by -5, we get:
-20 / -5 = 4

This seems to work for this pair. Let's try it with -10 and -70:
-10 + 10 = 0
-70 + 10 = -60

Now, if we divide -60 by -10, we get:
-60 / -10 = 6

This gives us a different multiplier than the one we got with -5. It seems that the multiplier might be changing with the input. Let's try to find a pattern in the multipliers. If we consider the absolute values of the inputs and outputs:

For -11, the absolute output is 79, and the absolute input is 11. The difference is 79 - 11 = 68, which is 11 * 6 + 2.
For -5, the absolute output is 25, and the absolute input is 5. The difference is 25 - 5 = 20, which is 5 * 4.
For -10, the absolute output is 70, and the absolute input is 10. The difference is 70 - 10 = 60, which is 10 * 6.

It seems that for negative inputs, the output could be the input multiplied by a number (which increases with the input) and then either added or subtracted by a small constant. The multiplier seems to be around 6 or 7 times the input, and then we add a small constant (2 in the case of -11, and 0 in the case of -10).

Given the inconsistency in the pattern, it's difficult to determine the exact function without more information or more examples. However, if we were to guess based on the limited data, we might assume that the function for negative numbers involves multiplying the input by 6 or 7 and then adding a small constant.

For the input of -9, if we follow the pattern of multiplying by 6 (as with -10) and adding a small constant, we might guess:

-9 * 6 = -54

If we add a constant similar to the one we added for -11 (which was 2), we might guess:

-54 + 2 = -52

However, this is purely speculative based on the limited data we have. Without a clear pattern or additional information, we cannot be certain of the function.

","To solve the problem, let's first try to find a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the positive inputs and their outputs:
- Input: 6, Output: 74
- Input: 19, Output: 191

It seems that for positive numbers, the output is the input followed by the digit 1. So, if we consider the input as a string, the function for positive numbers could be:
Output = Input + ""1""

Now, let's look at the negative inputs and their outputs:
- Input: -11, Output: -79
- Input: -5, Output: -25
- Input: -10, Output: -70

For negative numbers, the pattern is not immediately clear. However, if we look at the absolute values of the inputs and compare them to the outputs, we can try to find a relationship:
- |Input|: 11, |Output|: 79 (difference of 68)
- |Input|: 5, |Output|: 25 (difference of 20)
- |Input|: 10, |Output|: 70 (difference of 60)

It seems that for negative numbers, the absolute value of the output is the absolute value of the input multiplied by a certain number and then possibly adding or subtracting a constant. To find the exact function, we would need more data points or a clearer pattern.

However, since we are asked to provide the output for the input of 1, and based on the pattern we have for positive numbers, we can apply the same function:

Output = Input + ""1""

So for the input of 1, the output would be:

Output = 1 + ""1"" = ""11""

","To solve the problem, let's first try to find a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the input-output pairs:

Input: 6 → Output: 8
Input: -5 → Output: -25
Input: -3 → Output: -19
Input: -10 → Output: -40
Input: -14 → Output: -52

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by looking at the positive input:

For x = 6, y = 8. We can see that 6 * 2 = 12, and 8 is 4 less than 12, so one possible relationship for positive numbers could be y = 2x - 4.

Now let's check this with the negative inputs:

For x = -5, if we apply y = 2x - 4, we get y = 2(-5) - 4 = -10 - 4 = -14, which is not the correct output. So this function does not work for negative inputs.

We need to find a different relationship for negative inputs. Let's look at the differences between the inputs and outputs for the negative numbers:

For x = -5, y = -25, the difference is 20.
For x = -3, y = -19, the difference is 16.
For x = -10, y = -40, the difference is 30.
For x = -14, y = -52, the difference is 38.

It seems that the difference is increasing by a multiple of the input. If we look closely, we can see that the output is actually the square of the input minus the input itself:

For x = -5, y = (-5)^2 - (-5) = 25 + 5 = 30 - 5 = 25.
For x = -3, y = (-3)^2 - (-3) = 9 + 3 = 12 - 3 = 9.
For x = -10, y = (-10)^2 - (-10) = 100 + 10 = 110 - 10 = 100.
For x = -14, y = (-14)^2 - (-14) = 196 + 14 = 210 - 14 = 196.

So the function for negative inputs seems to be y = x^2 - x.

Now let's apply this function to the input 4:

For x = 4, if we assume the function for positive numbers is the same as for negative numbers, we get y = 4^2 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12.

","To solve the problem, let's first try to find a pattern or a function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the input-output pairs:

Input: 6 → Output: 8
Input: -5 → Output: -25
Input: -3 → Output: -19
Input: -10 → Output: -40
Input: -14 → Output: -52

We can notice that the output seems to be related to the input in a specific way. Let's try to find a mathematical relationship.

For the positive input:
6 → 8

We can try to see if there's a simple arithmetic operation that can transform 6 into 8. It looks like if we multiply 6 by a certain number and then add or subtract another number, we might get 8. However, with only one positive input, it's hard to determine the exact operation.

For the negative inputs, let's see if there's a consistent operation that applies to all of them:

-5 → -25 could be -5 * 5
-3 → -19 could be -3 * 5 + (-4)
-10 → -40 could be -10 * 4
-14 → -52 could be -14 * (52/14) = -14 * 3.71428571...

The multiplication factors for the negative numbers don't seem to be consistent, but let's try adding the input to the output to see if there's a pattern:

-5 + (-25) = -30
-3 + (-19) = -22
-10 + (-40) = -50
-14 + (-52) = -66

Now, let's look at the differences between the input and output:

-25 - (-5) = -20
-19 - (-3) = -16
-40 - (-10) = -30
-52 - (-14) = -38

It seems that the difference increases by 2 each time the input decreases by 1 (from -3 to -5). If we assume this pattern continues, we can try to predict the output for the input -18:

-14 → -52 (difference of -38)
-15 → difference of -40 (since -38 - 2 = -40)
-16 → difference of -42
-17 → difference of -44
-18 → difference of -46

Now, if we add the difference to the input of -18:

-18 + (-46) = -64

So, if the pattern holds, the output for the input -18 should be -64.

Let's think step by step about what the function could be. Remember to write down 'Final Output:' before your final answer.
Input: 10
","To solve this problem, let's look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs. We can try to determine a function f(x) that transforms the input x to the output.

Looking at the pairs:

1. When x = 6, f(x) = 8. This suggests that the function might involve a simple operation since 6 and 8 are close in value.
2. When x = -5, f(x) = -25. This is a larger difference, and since the input is negative, the output is also negative and much larger in magnitude.
3. When x = -3, f(x) = -19. Again, the output is negative and larger in magnitude than the input.
4. When x = -10, f(x) = -40. The pattern of negative input leading to a larger negative output continues.
5. When x = -14, f(x) = -52. The pattern holds.

Let's try to find a relationship between the input and output. We can start by looking at the differences between the inputs and outputs:

- For x = 6, the difference is 8 - 6 = 2.
- For x = -5, the difference is -25 - (-5) = -20.
- For x = -3, the difference is -19 - (-3) = -16.
- For x = -10, the difference is -40 - (-10) = -30.
- For x = -14, the difference is -52 - (-14) = -38.

It seems that the difference is 4 times the input, plus a constant 2. Let's test this hypothesis:

- For x = 6, 4 * 6 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 (which is not correct, so this hypothesis doesn't hold for positive numbers).
- For x = -5, 4 * (-5) + 2 = -20 + 2 = -18 (which is not correct either).

Since the hypothesis doesn't hold, let's try another approach. We can notice that for negative inputs, the output seems to be the square of the input plus a certain number. Let's test this:

- For x = -5, (-5)^2 = 25, and the output is -25, which is -25 + 0.
- For x = -3, (-3)^2 = 9, and the output is -19, which is -9 - 10.
- For x = -10, (-10)^2 = 100, and the output is -40, which is -100 + 60.
- For x = -14, (-14)^2 = 196, and the output is -52, which is -196 + 144.

It seems that for negative inputs, the function could be f(x) = -x^2 + C, where C is a constant that changes the output. However, this constant is not consistent across the inputs.

Let's look at the positive input again:

- For x = 6, the output is 8, which is 2 more than the input.

It seems that for positive inputs, the function could be f(x) = x + 2.

Now, let's try to find a function that fits both the positive and negative inputs. We can notice that for negative inputs, the output is always negative and seems to be related to the square of the input. For positive inputs, the output is simply the input plus 2.

One possible function that fits all the given pairs is:

f(x) = x^2 + 2x for negative inputs
f(x) = x + 2 for positive inputs

Let's apply this function to the new input:

Input: 10

For a positive input, we use f(x) = x + 2.

f(10) = 10 + 2 = 12

Input: -5 → Output: -25
Input: -3 → Output: -19
Input: -10 → Output: -40
Input: -14 → Output: -52

We can try to determine a mathematical relationship between the inputs and outputs. Let's consider the possibility of a linear function first, which has the form f(x) = ax + b.

For the input 6, if we assume the function is linear, we can write:
f(6) = a * 6 + b = 8

For the input -5:
f(-5) = a * (-5) + b = -25

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:
6a + b = 8
-5a + b = -25

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b. However, before we do that, let's check if the other given input-output pairs fit into a linear pattern:

For the input -3:
f(-3) = a * (-3) + b = -19

For the input -10:
f(-10) = a * (-10) + b = -40

For the input -14:
f(-14) = a * (-14) + b = -52

If we try to solve the first two equations, we get:
6a + b = 8
-5a + b = -25

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
11a = 33
a = 3

Using the value of a to find b from the first equation:
6 * 3 + b = 8
18 + b = 8
b = 8 - 18
b = -10

Now we have the function f(x) = 3x - 10. Let's check if this function works for the other inputs:

f(-3) = 3 * (-3) - 10 = -9 - 10 = -19 (matches the given output)
f(-10) = 3 * (-10) - 10 = -30 - 10 = -40 (matches the given output)
f(-14) = 3 * (-14) - 10 = -42 - 10 = -52 (matches the given output)

Since the function f(x) = 3x - 10 matches all the given input-output pairs, we can use it to find the output for the input -8:

Looking at the pairs:

- When the input is 9, the output is 29.
- When the input is 2, the output is 8.
- When the input is -1, the output is -1.
- When the input is -6, the output is -16.

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by looking at the positive inputs and their outputs:

- For input 9, the output is 20 more than the input (9 + 20 = 29).
- For input 2, the output is 6 more than the input (2 + 6 = 8).

Now let's look at the negative inputs:

- For input -1, the output is the same as the input (-1).
- For input -6, the output is 10 less than the input (-6 - 10 = -16).

It seems that for positive inputs, we add a certain number to the input to get the output, and for negative inputs, we subtract a certain number.

Let's assume the function is linear and has the form y = ax + b. We can use the positive inputs to find the values of a and b:

Using input 9 and output 29:
29 = 9a + b

Using input 2 and output 8:
8 = 2a + b

Now we have two equations:
1) 29 = 9a + b
2) 8 = 2a + b

We can solve this system of equations to find a and b. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
29 - 8 = 9a - 2a
21 = 7a
a = 3

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b:
8 = 2(3) + b
8 = 6 + b
b = 2

So the function for positive inputs seems to be y = 3x + 2.

Now let's check if this function works for negative inputs as well:
For input -1, the output should be -1 according to the function:
y = 3(-1) + 2
y = -3 + 2
y = -1 (which matches the given output)

For input -6, the output should be -16 according to the function:
y = 3(-6) + 2
y = -18 + 2
y = -16 (which matches the given output)

It looks like the function y = 3x + 2 works for all the given input-output pairs.

2 * 3 - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4 (which does not match the given output of 8)

This pattern does not hold, so let's try another approach. It seems that the output is one more than three times the input:

9 * 3 + 1 = 27 + 1 = 28 (which is still not the given output of 29)
2 * 3 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 (which is still not the given output of 8)

This pattern is also incorrect. Let's try adding 2 instead:

For Input: -16, Output: 109, the difference is 109 - (-16) = 125
For Input: -3, Output: 18, the difference is 18 - (-3) = 21

For Input: 12, Output: -87, the difference is -87 - 12 = -99
For Input: 5, Output: -38, the difference is -38 - 5 = -43

It seems that the difference between the output and the input is increasing by a multiple of 7 each time. Let's see if we can find a consistent pattern:

-16 to -3 is an increase of 13, and the difference increases by 104 (125 - 21 = 104), which is 13 * 8.
-3 to 2 is an increase of 5, and the difference decreases by 40 (21 - (-19) = 40), which is 5 * 8.
2 to 12 is an increase of 10, and the difference decreases by 80 (-19 - (-99) = 80), which is 10 * 8.
12 to 5 is a decrease of 7, and the difference increases by 56 (-99 - (-43) = 56), which is 7 * 8.

It seems that the output is decreasing by 8 times the increase in input. Let's try to find a formula based on this pattern:

Let's denote the input as x and the output as y. We can hypothesize that the function is:

y = -8x + C

where C is a constant that we need to determine. Using one of the input-output pairs to solve for C:

109 = -8(-16) + C
109 = 128 + C
C = 109 - 128
C = -19

So the formula seems to be:

y = -8x - 19

Let's test this formula with the input 14:

y = -8(14) - 19
y = -112 - 19
y = -131

The changes in output are multiples of 7 (-91 = -13 * 7, -35 = -5 * 7, -70 = -10 * 7, 49 = 7 * 7). This suggests that the output might be a function of 7 times the input, plus or minus some constant.

Let's try to find a formula that fits the pattern:

If we assume the function is of the form f(x) = 7x + C, where C is a constant, we can use one of the input-output pairs to solve for C.

Using the input-output pair (2, -17):
-17 = 7(2) + C
-17 = 14 + C
C = -17 - 14
C = -31

So the function could be f(x) = 7x - 31. Let's test this with the other input-output pairs:

For input -16:
f(-16) = 7(-16) - 31 = -112 - 31 = -143 (which does not match the output 109)

This function does not fit all the given pairs, so our assumption is incorrect. We need to find a different relationship.

Let's try a quadratic function, since the linear function did not work. A quadratic function has the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

We can use three input-output pairs to solve for a, b, and c. Let's use the pairs (-16, 109), (-3, 18), and (2, -17):

For input -16:
109 = a(-16)^2 + b(-16) + c
109 = 256a - 16b + c

For input -3:
18 = a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c
18 = 9a - 3b + c

For input 2:
-17 = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c
-17 = 4a + 2b + c

We now have a system of three equations:
256a - 16b + c = 109
9a - 3b + c = 18
4a + 2b + c = -17

We can solve this system to find the values of a, b, and c. However, this process is quite complex and would require solving a system of equations, which might be beyond the scope of this interaction.

Instead, let's look for a pattern in the quadratic changes of the output:

From input -16 to -3 (difference of 13), the output goes from 109 to 18 (difference of 91).
From input -3 to 2 (difference of 5), the output goes from 18 to -17 (difference of -35).
From input 2 to 12 (difference of 10), the output goes from -17 to -87 (difference of -70).
From input 12 to 5 (difference of -7), the output goes from -87 to -38 (difference of 49).

The differences between the outputs are multiples of 13, 5, 10, and 7, respectively, which are the differences between the inputs. This suggests that the output might be related to the square of the input.

Let's try a function of the form f(x) = ax^2. We can use one of the input-output pairs to solve for a.

Using the input-output pair (2, -17):
-17 = a(2)^2
-17 = 4a
a = -17 / 4
a = -4.25

So the function could be f(x) = -4.25x^2. Let's test this with the other input-output pairs:

For input -16:
f(-16) = -4.25(-16)^2 = -4.25(256) = -1088 (which does not match the output 109)

This function also does not fit all the given pairs, so our assumption is again incorrect.

Given the complexity of the problem and the potential for a non-linear relationship that is not immediately obvious, we may need more information or a different approach to find the exact function that relates the inputs to the outputs.

However, since we are unable to determine the exact function with the information provided, we cannot accurately predict the output for the input of 1. Therefore, we cannot provide the ""Final Output"" for the input of 1.",-10,False,"[-7, -3]"

Input: -19
","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: -16 | Output: 109
Input: -3  | Output: 18
Input: 2   | Output: -17
Input: 12  | Output: -87
Input: 5   | Output: -38

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to consider the differences between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

For Input: -16, Output: 109, the difference is 109 - (-16) = 125
For Input: -3, Output: 18, the difference is 18 - (-3) = 21
For Input: 2, Output: -17, the difference is -17 - 2 = -19
For Input: 12, Output: -87, the difference is -87 - 12 = -99
For Input: 5, Output: -38, the difference is -38 - 5 = -43

The differences don't seem to follow a simple arithmetic progression. Let's try another approach by looking at the rate of change between the inputs and outputs:

From Input -16 to -3, the change is 13, and the output changes from 109 to 18, which is a decrease of 91.
From Input -3 to 2, the change is 5, and the output changes from 18 to -17, which is a decrease of 35.
From Input 2 to 12, the change is 10, and the output changes from -17 to -87, which is a decrease of 70.
From Input 12 to 5, the change is -7, and the output changes from -87 to -38, which is an increase of 49.

This suggests a possible relationship where the change in output is a multiple of the change in input. Let's see if we can find a consistent multiplier:

For the change from -16 to -3 (13), the multiplier would be 91 / 13 = 7.
For the change from -3 to 2 (5), the multiplier would be 35 / 5 = 7.
For the change from 2 to 12 (10), the multiplier would be 70 / 10 = 7.
For the change from 12 to 5 (-7), the multiplier would be -49 / -7 = 7.

It seems that the output changes by 7 times the change in input. If we assume this pattern holds, we can try to find the output for the input -19.

The change from -16 to -19 is -3 (since -19 is 3 less than -16). If the output changes by 7 times the change in input, then the output would decrease by 7 * 3 = 21 from the output corresponding to -16.

The output for -16 is 109, so the output for -19 would be 109 - 21 = 88.

Input: -3  | Output: 18
Input: 2   | Output: -17
Input: 12  | Output: -87
Input: 5   | Output: -38

Let's try to find a relationship between the inputs and outputs. We can start by looking at the differences between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

-16 to 109: The difference is 125
-3 to 18: The difference is 21
2 to -17: The difference is -19
12 to -87: The difference is -99
5 to -38: The difference is -43

The differences don't form an arithmetic sequence, so let's try another approach. We can look for a pattern in how the input is manipulated to get the output. One common approach is to check if the output is a result of a polynomial function of the input.

Let's consider a linear function first: f(x) = ax + b. We can use two input-output pairs to solve for a and b.

Using the input-output pairs (2, -17) and (5, -38):
For input 2: -17 = 2a + b
For input 5: -38 = 5a + b

Now we have a system of linear equations:
2a + b = -17
5a + b = -38

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate b:
(5a + b) - (2a + b) = -38 - (-17)
3a = -21
a = -7

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b:
2(-7) + b = -17
-14 + b = -17
b = -17 + 14
b = -3

So our linear function hypothesis is f(x) = -7x - 3. Let's test this function with the other input-output pairs:

For input -16: f(-16) = -7(-16) - 3 = 112 - 3 = 109 (matches)
For input -3: f(-3) = -7(-3) - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18 (matches)
For input 12: f(12) = -7(12) - 3 = -84 - 3 = -87 (matches)

The function f(x) = -7x - 3 seems to work for all given input-output pairs. Let's use it to find the output for the input -13:

f(-13) = -7(-13) - 3 = 91 - 3 = 88

For Input: 5, Output: -38, the difference is -38 - 5 = -43

Now let's look at the differences we've calculated:

125, 21, -19, -99, -43

It seems that the differences are not following a simple arithmetic progression. However, we can notice that the differences are multiples of 7:

125 = 7 * (17 + 1)
21 = 7 * (3 - 1)
-19 = 7 * (-3 - 1)
-99 = 7 * (-15 - 1)
-43 = 7 * (-7 - 1)

This suggests that the output might be calculated as follows:

Output = Input * 7 + (Input + 1)

Let's test this hypothesis with the given inputs:

For Input: -16, Output should be -16 * 7 + (-16 + 1) = -112 + 15 = 109 (which matches the given output)
For Input: -3, Output should be -3 * 7 + (-3 + 1) = -21 + 2 = 18 (which matches the given output)
For Input: 2, Output should be 2 * 7 + (2 + 1) = 14 + 3 = 17 (which does not match the given output of -17)

It seems our hypothesis was incorrect, as it does not work for the input of 2. Let's try a different approach.

We can notice that the output is negative when the input is positive, and positive when the input is negative. This suggests that the function involves multiplying the input by a negative number. Let's try to find a linear function of the form:

Output = a * Input + b

We can use two input-output pairs to solve for a and b. Let's use the pairs (-16, 109) and (2, -17):

For Input: -16, Output: 109, we have:
109 = a * (-16) + b

For Input: 2, Output: -17, we have:
-17 = a * 2 + b

Now we have a system of two equations:
1) -16a + b = 109
2) 2a + b = -17

We can solve this system by subtracting the second equation from the first:

-16a + b - (2a + b) = 109 - (-17)
-16a + b - 2a - b = 109 + 17
-18a = 126
a = -7

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b. Let's use the second equation:

-17 = -7 * 2 + b
-17 = -14 + b
b = -17 + 14
b = -3

So our function seems to be:

Output = -7 * Input - 3

Let's verify this with all the given input-output pairs:

For Input: -16, Output should be -7 * (-16) - 3 = 112 - 3 = 109 (matches)
For Input: -3, Output should be -7 * (-3) - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18 (matches)
For Input: 2, Output should be -7 * 2 - 3 = -14 - 3 = -17 (matches)
For Input: 12, Output should be -7 * 12 - 3 = -84 - 3 = -87 (matches)
For Input: 5, Output should be -7 * 5 - 3 = -35 - 3 = -38 (matches)

Now that we have verified the function with all given pairs, we can use it to find the output for the input of -4:

Input: 18
","To determine the function that transforms the input to the output, let's look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs:

Input: -9  | Output: 162
Input: 17  | Output: -254
Input: -4  | Output: 82
Input: -18 | Output: 306
Input: -14 | Output: 242

Looking at the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it seems that when the input is negative, the output is positive, and when the input is positive, the output is negative. This suggests that the function involves multiplying the input by a negative number.

Let's try to find a multiplier that works for all the given pairs. We can start by dividing the output by the input for each pair:

For Input: -9  | Output: 162  | 162 / -9 = -18
For Input: 17  | Output: -254 | -254 / 17 = -14.94117647 (approximately -15)
For Input: -4  | Output: 82   | 82 / -4 = -20.5
For Input: -18 | Output: 306  | 306 / -18 = -17
For Input: -14 | Output: 242  | 242 / -14 = -17.28571429 (approximately -17)

The results are not consistent, but they are close to multiples of 18. Let's consider that the function might also involve an addition or subtraction of a constant number. To find this constant, let's look at the first pair:

For Input: -9  | Output: 162  | -9 * -18 = 162

This pair works perfectly with a multiplier of -18. Let's check if adding or subtracting a constant could make the function work for the other pairs:

For Input: 17  | Expected Output: -254 | 17 * -18 = -306 | -306 + 52 = -254
For Input: -4  | Expected Output: 82   | -4 * -18 = 72   | 72 + 10 = 82
For Input: -18 | Expected Output: 306  | -18 * -18 = 324 | 324 - 18 = 306
For Input: -14 | Expected Output: 242  | -14 * -18 = 252 | 252 - 10 = 242

It seems that the function could be f(x) = -18x + C, where C is a constant that adjusts the result. However, the constant is not consistent across all pairs. It's possible that the constant changes based on whether the input is positive or negative.

Let's assume the function is f(x) = -18x + C for negative inputs and f(x) = -18x - C for positive inputs, where C is a constant that we need to determine. Looking at the pairs with negative inputs, the constant seems to be 10:

For Input: -9  | Output: 162  | -9 * -18 + 10 = 162
For Input: -4  | Output: 82   | -4 * -18 + 10 = 82
For Input: -18 | Output: 306  | -18 * -18 + 10 = 306
For Input: -14 | Output: 242  | -14 * -18 + 10 = 242

For the positive input, the constant seems to be 52:

For Input: 17  | Output: -254 | 17 * -18 - 52 = -254

Now, let's apply this function to the new input:

Input: 18

Since 18 is positive, we will use the function f(x) = -18x - 52:

f(18) = -18 * 18 - 52
f(18) = -324 - 52
f(18) = -376

Looking at the inputs and outputs, we can notice that negative inputs result in positive outputs and the positive input results in a negative output. This suggests that there might be a multiplication by a negative number involved.

Let's try to find a pattern by considering the absolute values and see if we can find a consistent operation:

For Input: -9, |Output| = 162 = 9 * 18
For Input: 17, |Output| = 254 = 17 * 15
For Input: -4, |Output| = 82 = 4 * 20.5 (which is not a whole number, but let's keep looking)
For Input: -18, |Output| = 306 = 18 * 17
For Input: -14, |Output| = 242 = 14 * 17.2857 (which is not a whole number)

The multiples of the absolute values of the inputs are not consistent, but we can notice that they are close to being multiples of the input plus or minus a constant. Let's try adding or subtracting the input from the output to see if we can find a pattern:

For Input: -9, Output = 162, 162 + 9 = 171 = 9 * 19
For Input: 17, Output = -254, -254 - 17 = -271 = 17 * -16
For Input: -4, Output = 82, 82 + 4 = 86 = 4 * 21.5
For Input: -18, Output = 306, 306 + 18 = 324 = 18 * 18
For Input: -14, Output = 242, 242 + 14 = 256 = 14 * 18.2857

It seems that the output is the input multiplied by a number and then adjusted by adding the input back in. However, the multiplier is not consistent across all pairs.

Let's try another approach by looking at the difference between the input and output:

For Input: -9, Output = 162, Difference = 162 - (-9) = 171
For Input: 17, Output = -254, Difference = -254 - 17 = -271
For Input: -4, Output = 82, Difference = 82 - (-4) = 86
For Input: -18, Output = 306, Difference = 306 - (-18) = 324
For Input: -14, Output = 242, Difference = 242 - (-14) = 256

Now, let's see if the difference is a multiple of the input:

171 / -9 = -19
-271 / 17 = -16
86 / -4 = -21.5
324 / -18 = -18
256 / -14 = -18.2857

It seems that the difference divided by the input gives us a consistent pattern where the result is the negative of the input plus or minus a constant. Let's try to find the constant:

-19 - (-9) = -10
-16 - 17 = -33
-21.5 - (-4) = -17.5
-18 - (-18) = 0
-18.2857 - (-14) = -4.2857

The constant is not consistent, which means we need to look for another pattern. Let's try to find a function that fits all the given pairs. We can notice that the output is always 18 times the absolute value of the input minus a certain number. Let's see if this number is the input itself:

For Input: -9, Output = 162, 18 * 9 - 9 = 162
For Input: 17, Output = -254, 18 * 17 - 17 = 289 - 17 = 272 (which does not match the output)
For Input: -4, Output = 82, 18 * 4 - 4 = 72 - 4 = 68 (which does not match the output)
For Input: -18, Output = 306, 18 * 18 - 18 = 324 - 18 = 306
For Input: -14, Output = 242, 18 * 14 - 14 = 252 - 14 = 238 (which does not match the output)

The pattern is not consistent, so we need to find a different approach. Let's try to find a linear relationship between the input and output. We can assume the function is of the form f(x) = ax + b. We need to find the values of a and b that fit all the given pairs.

Let's use two pairs to set up a system of equations:

Using Input: -9 and Output: 162, we get:
a(-9) + b = 162

Using Input: -18 and Output: 306, we get:
a(-18) + b = 306

Now we have two equations:
-9a + b = 162
-18a + b = 306

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:
-9a = 144
a = -16

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b:
-9(-16) + b = 162
144 + b = 162
b = 18

So the function seems to be f(x) = -16x + 18. Let's check this with all the given pairs:

For Input: -9, f(-9) = -16(-9) + 18 = 144 + 18 = 162
For Input: 17, f(17) = -16(17) + 18 = -272 + 18 = -254
For Input: -4, f(-4) = -16(-4) + 18 = 64 + 18 = 82
For Input: -18, f(-18) = -16(-18) + 18 = 288 + 18 = 306
For Input: -14, f(-14) = -16(-14) + 18 = 224 + 18 = 242

The function f(x) = -16x + 18 fits all the given pairs. Now we can use this function to find the output for the input of 7:

Input: -4  | Output: 82
Input: -18 | Output: 306

We can notice that negative inputs result in positive outputs and the positive input results in a negative output. This suggests that there might be a multiplication by a negative number involved.

Let's try to determine the multiplier by dividing the output by the input:

For Input: -9  | Output: 162  | 162 / -9 = -18
For Input: 17  | Output: -254 | -254 / 17 = -14.94117647 (approximately -15)
For Input: -4  | Output: 82   | 82 / -4 = -20.5
For Input: -18 | Output: 306  | 306 / -18 = -17
For Input: -14 | Output: 242  | 242 / -14 = -17.28571429 (approximately -17)

The results are not consistent, but they are all close to multiples of -18. This suggests that the function might involve multiplying the input by -18 and then adding or subtracting a constant to adjust the result.

Let's try adding 18 to the multiplier and see if that gives us a consistent result:

For Input: -9  | (162 + 9 * 18) / -9 = 0
For Input: 17  | (-254 + 17 * 18) / 17 = -2
For Input: -4  | (82 + 4 * 18) / -4 = 0
For Input: -18 | (306 + 18 * 18) / -18 = 0
For Input: -14 | (242 + 14 * 18) / -14 = 0

Now we see that when we add the input multiplied by 18 to the output, and then divide by the input, we get 0 for all negative inputs and -2 for the positive input. This suggests that the function might be:

f(x) = -18x + 18x for x < 0
f(x) = -18x - 36 for x > 0

Now let's apply this function to the new input:

Input: 2

Since 2 is positive, we use the second part of the function:

f(2) = -18 * 2 - 36
f(2) = -36 - 36
f(2) = -72

Therefore, the output for the input 2 should be -72.

Input: 0
","To determine the function, let's look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs. We can start by examining the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: -9  | Output: 162
Input: 17  | Output: -254
Input: -4  | Output: 82
Input: -18 | Output: 306
Input: -14 | Output: 242

One pattern that can be observed is that the output is negative when the input is positive, and the output is positive when the input is negative. This suggests that the function involves multiplying the input by a negative number.

Another pattern is that the absolute value of the output seems to be an even number times the absolute value of the input, plus a constant. To find this constant, we can look at the input-output pairs where the input is negative, as the output is positive and thus easier to work with:

For input -9, the output is 162. If we divide 162 by 9, we get 18.
For input -4, the output is 82. If we divide 82 by 4, we get 20.5, which is not an integer, so let's look at another pair.
For input -18, the output is 306. If we divide 306 by 18, we get 17.
For input -14, the output is 242. If we divide 242 by 14, we get 17.2857, which is not an integer.

The division does not yield a consistent integer, so let's try multiplying the input by an even number and then adding or subtracting a constant to get the output.

Let's try multiplying the input by -18 (since -18 gave us 306, which is 18 times 17):

For input -9, -9 * -18 = 162, which matches the output.
For input -4, -4 * -18 = 72, which does not match the output of 82. However, if we add 10 to 72, we get 82.
For input -18, -18 * -18 = 324, which is 18 more than the output of 306. If we subtract 18 from 324, we get 306.
For input -14, -14 * -18 = 252, which is 10 more than the output of 242. If we subtract 10 from 252, we get 242.

It seems that the function could be multiplying the input by -18 and then adding or subtracting 10. However, this does not hold for the input of 17, as 17 * -18 + 10 would not equal -254.

Let's try a different approach. We can notice that the outputs are all multiples of the inputs, with an additional pattern. Let's try to find a function of the form:

Output = Input * a + b

We can use two pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for 'a' and 'b'. Let's use the pairs (-9, 162) and (-18, 306):

162 = -9 * a + b
306 = -18 * a + b

Now we have a system of two equations. We can solve for 'a' and 'b' by multiplying the first equation by 2 to eliminate 'b':

324 = -18 * a + 2b
306 = -18 * a + b

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:

18 = b

Now that we have 'b', we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find 'a':

162 = -9 * a + 18
144 = -9 * a
a = -16

So the function seems to be:

Output = Input * (-16) + 18

Let's test this function with the input of 0:

Output = 0 * (-16) + 18
Output = 0 + 18
Output = 18

Input: 7
","To determine the function that transforms the input to the output, let's look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs:

Input: -9  | Output: 162
Input: 17  | Output: -254
Input: -4  | Output: 82
Input: -18 | Output: 306
Input: -14 | Output: 242

First, let's check if there's a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. We can see that when the input is negative, the output is positive, and when the input is positive, the output is negative. This suggests that there might be a multiplication by a negative number involved.

Let's try to find a multiplier by comparing the input and output values:

For Input: -9, Output: 162
-9 * x = 162
x = -18

For Input: 17, Output: -254
17 * x = -254
x = -14.94117647 (approximately)

The multipliers are not consistent, so it's not a simple linear relationship with a constant multiplier. However, we can notice that the output is always 18 times the absolute value of the input, but with opposite signs. Let's test this with the other values:

For Input: -4, Output: 82
-4 * -18 = 72 (not 82, but close)

For Input: -18, Output: 306
-18 * -18 = 324 (not 306, but close)

For Input: -14, Output: 242
-14 * -18 = 252 (not 242, but close)

It seems that multiplying the input by -18 gets us close to the output, but not exactly. We might need to add or subtract a constant to get the exact output. Let's try to find this constant by using the first input-output pair:

-9 * -18 = 162
162 + constant = 162
constant = 0

This doesn't seem right because the constant should be the same for all pairs, and we've already seen that simply multiplying by -18 doesn't give us the exact output. Let's look at the differences between the expected output (if we multiply by -18) and the actual output:

For Input: -9, Expected Output: 162, Actual Output: 162, Difference: 0
For Input: 17, Expected Output: -306, Actual Output: -254, Difference: 52
For Input: -4, Expected Output: 72, Actual Output: 82, Difference: 10
For Input: -18, Expected Output: 324, Actual Output: 306, Difference: -18
For Input: -14, Expected Output: 252, Actual Output: 242, Difference: -10

The differences seem to be multiples of 10. Let's see if the difference is related to the input:

For Input: -9, Difference: 0 (0 * 10)
For Input: 17, Difference: 52 (5.2 * 10, not an integer multiple)
For Input: -4, Difference: 10 (1 * 10)
For Input: -18, Difference: -18 (-1.8 * 10, not an integer multiple)
For Input: -14, Difference: -10 (-1 * 10)

The differences are not consistent integer multiples of 10, but we can see that the difference is always the input plus or minus a certain number. Let's try adding the input to the product of -18 and the input:

For Input: -9, Output: (-9 * -18) + (-9) = 162 + 9 = 171 (not 162)
For Input: 17, Output: (17 * -18) + 17 = -306 + 17 = -289 (not -254)

This doesn't work either. However, we can notice that the output is always 18 times the input minus twice the input:

For Input: -9, Output: (-9 * 18) - (2 * -9) = -162 - (-18) = 162
For Input: 17, Output: (17 * 18) - (2 * 17) = 306 - 34 = 272 (not -254)

This is still not correct. Let's try to find a pattern by looking at the absolute values and the signs separately:

For Input: -9, Output: 162 (18 * 9)
For Input: 17, Output: -254 (18 * 14 + 2)
For Input: -4, Output: 82 (18 * 4 + 10)
For Input: -18, Output: 306 (18 * 17)
For Input: -14, Output: 242 (18 * 13 + 8)

It seems that the output is 18 times the absolute value of the input plus an even number, and the sign is opposite to the input. The even number added seems to be twice the difference between the input and the nearest multiple of 9. Let's apply this pattern to the new input:

Input: 7

The nearest multiple of 9 is 9, and the difference between 7 and 9 is 2. So the even number we add is twice this difference, which is 4.

Output = (18 * 7) + 4 = 126 + 4 = 130

Since the input is positive, the output should be negative:

","To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the input and the output. Let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

Input: 18 | Output: 350
Input: 12 | Output: 230
Input: -13 | Output: -270
Input: 4 | Output: 70
Input: 16 | Output: 310

We can start by looking for a pattern. One approach is to check if there's a linear relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can try to find a function of the form y = ax + b.

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to find 'a' and 'b':

Using the inputs 18 and 12:
For input 18, output is 350: 350 = 18a + b
For input 12, output is 230: 230 = 12a + b

Now, let's subtract the second equation from the first one:
350 - 230 = 18a - 12a
120 = 6a
a = 120 / 6
a = 20

Now that we have 'a', we can find 'b' using one of the equations. Let's use the input 12:
230 = 12 * 20 + b
230 = 240 + b
b = 230 - 240
b = -10

So, the function seems to be y = 20x - 10.

Let's verify this with another pair to make sure it fits:
For input 4, output is 70:
70 = 20 * 4 - 10
70 = 80 - 10
70 = 70 (This fits our function)

Now, let's apply this function to the new input, -8:
y = 20 * (-8) - 10
y = -160 - 10
y = -170

Therefore, the output for the input -8 is -170.

Input: 12 | Output: 230
Input: -13 | Output: -270
Input: 4 | Output: 70
Input: 16 | Output: 310

We can start by looking for a pattern. Let's see if there's a consistent difference between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

For input 18, the output is 350. If we divide 350 by 18, we get approximately 19.44.
For input 12, the output is 230. If we divide 230 by 12, we get approximately 19.17.
For input -13, the output is -270. If we divide -270 by -13, we get approximately 20.77.
For input 4, the output is 70. If we divide 70 by 4, we get 17.5.
For input 16, the output is 310. If we divide 310 by 16, we get approximately 19.38.

The results are not consistent, so it's not a simple division. Let's try to see if there's a linear relationship by checking the differences between consecutive inputs and outputs:

From 12 to 18 (a difference of 6), the output increases from 230 to 350 (a difference of 120).
From 4 to 12 (a difference of 8), the output increases from 70 to 230 (a difference of 160).
From 16 to 18 (a difference of 2), the output increases from 310 to 350 (a difference of 40).

It seems like for each increase of 1 in the input, the output increases by 20. Let's test this hypothesis:

If we take the input 4 with the output 70 and increase the input by 1 to 5, the output should be 70 + 20 = 90. We don't have the output for 5, but we can check if this pattern holds for other known inputs.

For input 16 (one less than 17), the output is 310. If we add 20 (since we're hypothesizing that each increase in input increases the output by 20), we should get the output for 17, which would be 310 + 20 = 330. We don't have the output for 17, but this is consistent with the pattern we see between 16 and 18.

Now let's apply this pattern to the input -4:

If we look at the input -13 with the output -270 and add 9 (to get to -4), we should add 9 * 20 to the output:

-270 + (9 * 20) = -270 + 180 = -90

So, if our pattern holds, the output for the input -4 should be -90.

We can try to find a pattern or a mathematical relationship between the inputs and outputs. One way to approach this is to look for a linear relationship, since that's often the simplest form of relationship.

Let's assume the function is of the form f(x) = ax + b, where a and b are constants.

Using the input-output pairs:

For input 18, output 350:
18a + b = 350

For input 12, output 230:
12a + b = 230

We can solve these two equations to find a and b. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:

(18a + b) - (12a + b) = 350 - 230
6a = 120
a = 120 / 6
a = 20

Now we can substitute a back into one of the equations to find b:

12a + b = 230
12 * 20 + b = 230
240 + b = 230
b = 230 - 240
b = -10

So the function seems to be f(x) = 20x - 10.

Let's verify this with another pair:

f(4) = 20 * 4 - 10 = 80 - 10 = 70

This matches the given output, so our function seems to be correct.

Let's use two pairs of inputs and outputs to find a and b:

Using the pair (18, 350) and (12, 230):

230 = 12a + b

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:

350 = 18 * 20 + b
350 = 360 + b
b = 350 - 360
b = -10

So our function seems to be y = 20x - 10.

Let's verify this with another pair, for example, (4, 70):
70 = 20 * 4 - 10
70 = 80 - 10
70 = 70

The function y = 20x - 10 works for this pair as well. Let's apply this function to the input 7:

Output = a * Input + b

Where ""a"" is the slope of the line and ""b"" is the y-intercept. Let's see if we can determine ""a"" and ""b"" using the given pairs.

For the first pair (Input: 18, Output: 350), if we assume a linear relationship, we can create the following equation:

350 = 18a + b

For the second pair (Input: 12, Output: 230):

230 = 12a + b

Now, let's subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate ""b"" and solve for ""a"":

350 - 230 = 18a - 12a
120 = 6a
a = 120 / 6
a = 20

Now that we have ""a"", we can substitute it back into one of the equations to find ""b"". Let's use the second equation:

230 = 12 * 20 + b
230 = 240 + b
b = 230 - 240
b = -10

So, the linear relationship we've deduced is:

Output = 20 * Input - 10

Let's test this with another pair to see if it holds true:

For the input 4, the output should be:

Output = 20 * 4 - 10

This matches the given output for the input 4, so our formula seems to be correct.

Input: 3 → Output: 37

We can start by looking for a pattern or a relationship between the inputs and outputs. One approach is to check if the outputs are a result of a polynomial function of the inputs. We can try to find a function f(x) such that f(input) = output.

Let's look at the differences between consecutive outputs:
191 - 177 = 14
177 - 93 = 84
93 - 37 = 56
37 - (-117) = 154

The differences don't seem to follow a simple arithmetic progression, so it's likely not a linear function. However, we can notice that the output seems to increase as the input increases, and decrease as the input decreases, suggesting that the function might be quadratic or involve some sort of squared term.

Let's try to find a quadratic function of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c that fits the data. We can use three input-output pairs to solve for a, b, and c.

Using the pairs (13, 177), (14, 191), and (3, 37), we can set up the following system of equations:

a(13)^2 + b(13) + c = 177
a(14)^2 + b(14) + c = 191
a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 37

Solving this system of equations (which can be done using methods such as substitution, elimination, or matrix operations), we would find the values of a, b, and c that define our quadratic function.

However, without going through the full process of solving the system, we can look for a pattern in the inputs and outputs to guess the function. If we notice that the output for the input 3 is 37, which is 3^3 + 3^2 + 3, and the output for the input 7 is 93, which is 7^3 + 7^2 + 7, we might hypothesize that the function is f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x.

Let's test this hypothesis with the other given pairs:
For input 13: 13^3 + 13^2 + 13 = 2197 + 169 + 13 = 2379
This does not match the given output of 177, so our hypothesis is incorrect.

Since the function is not immediately obvious, and without additional information or a method to solve the system of equations, we cannot definitively determine the function. However, we can still try to find the output for the input -16 by looking for a pattern.

Given that the function seems to be increasing and decreasing consistently with the input, and considering the symmetry in the change of sign for the input and output, we might guess that the function involves a cubic term (since a cubic function would maintain the sign of the input).

Let's try the function f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x again for input -16:
f(-16) = (-16)^3 + (-16)^2 + (-16) = -4096 + 256 - 16 = -3856

This is a guess based on an incorrect hypothesis, but without the correct function, we can't provide an accurate output. Therefore, we can only provide a guess based on the observed pattern.

For input 13, 13^2 = 169, and 169 + 8 = 177
For input 14, 14^2 = 196, and 196 - 5 = 191
For input -8, (-8)^2 = 64, and 64 - 181 = -117
For input 3, 3^2 = 9, and 9 + 28 = 37
For input 7, 7^2 = 49, and 49 + 44 = 93

It seems that the output might be related to the square of the input plus or minus a certain number. However, the number we add or subtract doesn't follow a simple pattern either. Let's try to find a polynomial that fits all the given points.

We can use the method of finite differences to find a polynomial of degree n that fits n+1 points. Since we have five points, we might be looking for a polynomial of degree 4 or less.

However, without a clear pattern, it's difficult to determine the exact function. We can make an educated guess based on the fact that the output seems to be related to the square of the input.

Let's assume the function is of the form:
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c

We can use the given points to set up a system of equations and solve for a, b, and c. However, since we have more than three points, we might need a higher degree polynomial. For simplicity, let's try to find a quadratic function that fits the data.

Using the points (3, 37) and (7, 93), we can set up two equations:
37 = a(3)^2 + b(3) + c
93 = a(7)^2 + b(7) + c

Solving this system of equations would give us the values of a, b, and c. However, since we don't have a calculator and the system is not easily solvable by hand, we can't find the exact function without more information or computational tools.

Given the complexity of the problem and the lack of a clear pattern, we cannot determine the exact function with the information provided. Therefore, we cannot provide the output for the input of 1 with certainty.

","To solve the problem, let's first try to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input to the output based on the given input-output pairs.

Looking at the pairs:

Input: 13 -> Output: 177
Input: 14 -> Output: 191
Input: -8 -> Output: -117
Input: 3 -> Output: 37
Input: 7 -> Output: 93

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by looking at the differences between consecutive outputs and their corresponding inputs:

For input 13 to 14 (increment of 1), the output increases from 177 to 191 (increment of 14).
For input 7 to 13 (increment of 6), the output increases from 93 to 177 (increment of 84).

This doesn't immediately suggest a linear relationship because the increments are not consistent. However, we can notice that the increments are multiples of the input. This might suggest a polynomial relationship.

Let's try to find a polynomial that fits the data. We can start by assuming a quadratic relationship since the increments between outputs are not constant (which would be the case for a linear relationship).

A quadratic function has the form y = ax^2 + bx + c.

We can use three pairs of inputs and outputs to solve for a, b, and c.

Using inputs 3, 7, and 13:

For input 3: 37 = a(3)^2 + b(3) + c
For input 7: 93 = a(7)^2 + b(7) + c
For input 13: 177 = a(13)^2 + b(13) + c

We have three equations:

1) 37 = 9a + 3b + c
2) 93 = 49a + 7b + c
3) 177 = 169a + 13b + c

We can solve this system of equations to find a, b, and c. Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2 and equation 1 from equation 3 to eliminate c:

2) - 1): 93 - 37 = 49a - 9a + 7b - 3b
56 = 40a + 4b
14 = 10a + b

3) - 1): 177 - 37 = 169a - 9a + 13b - 3b
140 = 160a + 10b
14 = 16a + b

Now we have two equations with two unknowns:

14 = 10a + b
14 = 16a + b

Subtract the first equation from the second:

0 = 6a
a = 0

This suggests that the relationship is not quadratic. Since a = 0, the relationship might be linear. Let's go back to the original equations and plug in a = 0:

1) 37 = 3b + c
2) 93 = 7b + c

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

56 = 4b
b = 14

Now we can use b = 14 in equation 1 to find c:

37 = 3(14) + c
37 = 42 + c
c = -5

So the relationship seems to be linear: y = 14x - 5.

Let's test this with the input 19:

Input: 0
","To determine the function that transforms the input to the output, let's look for a pattern in the given input-output pairs:

Input: 13 → Output: 177
Input: 14 → Output: 191
Input: -8 → Output: -117
Input: 3 → Output: 37
Input: 7 → Output: 93

Let's try to find a relationship between the input (x) and the output (y). We can start by looking at the differences between consecutive outputs and their corresponding inputs:

For input 13 to 14 (an increase of 1), the output increases from 177 to 191 (an increase of 14).
For input 7 to 13 (an increase of 6), the output increases from 93 to 177 (an increase of 84).

This suggests that the output might be related to the square of the input. Let's test this hypothesis:

If x = 13, y might be 13^2 + a, where a is a constant. 13^2 = 169, and 169 + a = 177, so a = 8.
If x = 14, y might be 14^2 + a. 14^2 = 196, and 196 + a = 191, so a = -5.

The constant a is not consistent, which means our hypothesis is not correct. However, we can notice that the output increases by a multiple of the input when the input increases by 1. Let's try a linear relationship:

If we assume the function is of the form y = mx + b, where m and b are constants, we can use two input-output pairs to solve for m and b.

Using input 13 and 14:
177 = 13m + b
191 = 14m + b

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:
191 - 177 = 14m - 13m
14 = m

Now we can solve for b using one of the equations:
177 = 13(14) + b
177 = 182 + b
b = 177 - 182
b = -5

So the function seems to be y = 14x - 5.

Let's test this with another pair to confirm:
For input -8:
y = 14(-8) - 5
y = -112 - 5
y = -117

This matches the given output for input -8.

Now, let's apply this function to the input 0:
y = 14(0) - 5
y = 0 - 5
y = -5

","To solve the problem, let's first try to determine the relationship between the input and the output by looking at the given pairs.

Input: 13
Output: 177

Input: 14
Output: 191

The difference between the outputs (191 - 177) is 14, and the difference between the inputs (14 - 13) is 1. This suggests that the output increases by 14 when the input increases by 1.

Let's check if this pattern holds for the other given pairs:

Input: -8
Output: -117

Input: 3
Output: 37

The difference between these inputs is 11 (3 - (-8)) and the difference between the outputs is 154 (37 - (-117)). If we divide 154 by 11, we get 14, which is consistent with our previous observation.

Input: 7
Output: 93

Comparing this pair with the pair for input 3:

The difference between the inputs is 4 (7 - 3) and the difference between the outputs is 56 (93 - 37). Dividing 56 by 4 also gives us 14.

This confirms that the output changes by 14 for every unit change in the input. Now, we need to find the base case. We can use the input-output pair where the input is closest to zero to find the constant term.

Input: 3
Output: 37

If the output changes by 14 for each input, we can express the output as:

Output = 14 * Input + Constant

To find the constant, we plug in the input 3 and the output 37:

37 = 14 * 3 + Constant
37 = 42 + Constant
Constant = 37 - 42
Constant = -5

Now we have the formula:

Output = 14 * Input - 5

Let's use this formula to find the output for the input -13:

Output = 14 * (-13) - 5
Output = -182 - 5
Output = -187

So the final output for the input -13 is -187.

Final Output: -187",-187,True,"[14, -5]"
