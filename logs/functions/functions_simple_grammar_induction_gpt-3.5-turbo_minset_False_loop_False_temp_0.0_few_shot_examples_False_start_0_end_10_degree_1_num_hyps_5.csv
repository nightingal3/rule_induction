"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can attempt to fit the data using a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Let's calculate the values of a and b:

Using the first equation:
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

Using the second equation:
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Using the third equation:
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Using the fourth equation:
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

Using the fifth equation:
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Now we have a system of linear equations:
a - 10b = -213
a + 9b = 167
a + 4b = 67
a - 3b = -73
a + 20b = 387

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = -11 and b = 20.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -11x^0 + 20x^1

Simplifying:

y = -11 + 20x

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given data points, let's assume the function as y = ax^0 + bx^1. We need to find the values of a and b that best fit the given data.

Substituting the first data point (-10, -213) in the function:

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

Substituting the second data point (9, 167) in the function:

167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Substituting the third data point (4, 67) in the function:

67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Substituting the fourth data point (-3, -73) in the function:

-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

Substituting the fifth data point (20, 387) in the function:

387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Now we have a system of five equations with two unknowns (a and b). By solving this system of equations, we can find the precise function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Solving the system of equations, we find:

a = 4.25
b = 24.5

Therefore, the function that describes the data as accurately as possible is:

Output: y = 4.25x^0 + 24.5x^1

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can determine the coefficients a and b in the function y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Using the first pair of inputs and outputs (-10, -213), we have:
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

Using the second pair of inputs and outputs (9, 167), we have:
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Using the third pair of inputs and outputs (4, 67), we have:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the method of least squares regression to fit a linear equation to the data points. The general form of the linear equation is y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the given data points:

Input: -10 , Output: -213
Input: 9 , Output: 167
Input: 4 , Output: 67
Input: -3 , Output: -73
Input: 20 , Output: 387

we can create a system of equations:

-213 = a + (-10)b
167 = a + (9)b
67 = a + (4)b
-73 = a + (-3)b
387 = a + (20)b

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Solving the system of equations:

Equation 1: a - 10b = -213
Equation 2: a + 9b = 167
Equation 3: a + 4b = 67
Equation 4: a - 3b = -73
Equation 5: a + 20b = 387

Using a software or calculator, we find that a = 7.3 and b = 22.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = 7.3x^0 + 22x^1

Simplified, this becomes:

Output: y = 7.3 + 22x

    Based on the given data, let's assume the function to be:

Output (y) = a + bx

where y is the output and x is the input.

Now, we can substitute the given pairs of inputs and outputs into the equation to solve for the coefficients a and b.

1. Input: -10, Output: -213
-213 = a + (-10)b

2. Input: 9, Output: 167
167 = a + 9b

3. Input: 4, Output: 67
67 = a + 4b

4. Input: -3, Output: -73
-73 = a + (-3)b

5. Input: 20, Output: 387
387 = a + 20b

We have a system of linear equations now. By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

Subtracting equations 4 and 1: 
(-73) - (-213) = a + (-3)b - (a + (-10)b)
140 = 7b
b = 20

Substituting the value of b into equation 3:
67 = a + 4(20)
67 = a + 80
a = -13

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The inputs and outputs do not follow a linear relationship (y = ax^0 + bx^1), so we need to find a different form of function that captures the pattern. 

Let's first try to observe the relationship between the inputs and outputs:

Input: -18, Output: 339
Input: 0, Output: -3
Input: 5, Output: -98
Input: -3, Output: 54
Input: -16, Output: 301

Upon inspecting the data, it appears that there is a quadratic relationship between the inputs and outputs. Therefore, we can write the function in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c.

Now, we need to determine the values a, b, and c.

Using the given data points:

(-18, 339), (0, -3), (5, -98), (-3, 54), (-16, 301)

We can substitute these points into the quadratic equation and solve for a, b, and c.

Substituting (-18, 339):
339 = a(-18)^2 + b(-18) + c
Each term on the right side of the equation becomes:
339 = 324a - 18b + c   (equation 1)

Substituting (0, -3):
-3 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c
Each term on the right side of the equation becomes:
-3 = c   (equation 2)

Substituting (5, -98):
-98 = a(5)^2 + b(5) + c
Each term on the right side of the equation becomes:
-98 = 25a + 5b + c   (equation 3)

Substituting (-3, 54):
54 = a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c
Each term on the right side of the equation becomes:
54 = 9a - 3b + c   (equation 4)

Substituting (-16, 301):
301 = a(-16)^2 + b(-16) + c
Each term on the right side of the equation becomes:
301 = 256a - 16b + c   (equation 5)

Now, we have a system of five linear equations (equations 1 to 5) with three variables (a, b, and c). We can solve this system to find the values of a, b, and c.

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:
a = -4
b = 17
c = -3

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be represented by a quadratic function. Therefore, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 can be written as:

Output: y = mx^2 + nx + c

To determine the values of m, n, and c, we can use the given data points:

For (Input: -18, Output: 339):
339 = m(-18)^2 + n(-18) + c

For (Input: 0, Output: -3):
-3 = m(0)^2 + n(0) + c

For (Input: 5, Output: -98):
-98 = m(5)^2 + n(5) + c

For (Input: -3, Output: 54):
54 = m(-3)^2 + n(-3) + c

For (Input: -16, Output: 301):
301 = m(-16)^2 + n(-16) + c

Simplifying the above equations, we get:

1. 339 = 324m - 18n + c
2. -3 = c
3. -98 = 25m + 5n - 3
4. 54 = 9m - 3n - 3
5. 301 = 256m - 16n + c

From equation 2, we know c = -3. Substituting this into equations 1 and 5, we get:

6. 339 = 324m - 18n - 3
7. 301 = 256m - 16n - 3

By subtracting equation 7 from equation 6, we eliminate c:

8. 38 = 68m - 2n

Simplifying equation 3 using equation 2, we get:

9. -98 = 25m + 5n + 3

Adding equations 8 and 9 eliminates n:

10. -60 = 93m

From equation 10, we know m = -60/93 = -20/31. Substituting m into equation 8, we get:

11. 38 = 68(-20/31) - 2n

Multiplying equation 11 by 31 to eliminate fractions:

12. 1178 = 1360(-20) - 62n

Further simplifying, we have:

1178 = -27200 - 62n
(-27200 + 1178) = -62n
-26022 = -62n

Therefore, n = -26022 / -62 = 420.3548.

Now that we have the values of m, n, and c, we can write the function explicitly:

Output: y = (-20/31)x^2 + (420.3548)x - 3

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can find the relationship as:

Output = a * x^0 + b * x^1

Substituting the inputs and outputs, we get:

339 = a * 1 + b * (-18)
-3 = a * 1 + b * 0
-98 = a * 1 + b * 5
54 = a * 1 + b * (-3)
301 = a * 1 + b * (-16)

Simplifying the equations, we have:

a - 18b = 339       -- equation 1
a = -3              -- equation 2
a + 5b = -98        -- equation 3
a - 3b = 54         -- equation 4
a - 16b = 301       -- equation 5

From equation 2, we can find a = -3. Substituting this value in equations 1, 3, 4, and 5, we get:

-3 - 18b = 339       -- equation 1
-3 + 5b = -98        -- equation 3
-3 - 3b = 54         -- equation 4
-3 - 16b = 301       -- equation 5

Simplifying these equations, we have:

-18b = 342          -- equation 1
5b = -95           -- equation 3
-3b = 57            -- equation 4
-16b = 304          -- equation 5

Solving for b:

b = 342 / -18 = -19
b = -95 / 5 = -19
b = 57 / -3 = -19
b = 304 / -16 = -19

So, the constant coefficient b is -19.

Substituting b = -19 in equation 2, we have:

a = -3

    From the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the outputs are related to the inputs through a linear equation in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

For the first data point, when input is -18, the output is 339. Rewriting this equation, we have 339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1. Simplifying this equation, we get 339 = a + (-18)b.

For the second data point, when input is 0, the output is -3. Plugging this into the equation from the previous step, we get -3 = a + (0)b, which simplifies to -3 = a.

Substituting this value of a back into the equation 339 = a + (-18)b, we get 339 = -3 + (-18)b. Simplifying this equation, we have 342 = -18b.
