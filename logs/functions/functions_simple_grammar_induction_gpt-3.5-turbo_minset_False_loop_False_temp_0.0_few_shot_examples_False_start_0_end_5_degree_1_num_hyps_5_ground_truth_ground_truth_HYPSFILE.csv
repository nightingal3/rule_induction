Input: -10, Output: -213

Input: 9, Output: 167

Input: 4, Output: 67

"Based on the given data, we can write the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Let's denote y as the output and x as the input.

From the data, we can observe that the coefficients a and b are not constant across all inputs. So, we will treat a and b as variables.

Using the first data point (-10, -213), we can substitute the values of x and y into the function:

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1

Simplifying this equation, we get:

-213 = a - 10b

By rearranging the equation, we obtain a in terms of b:

a = 213 - 10b

Now, we can substitute the second data point (9, 167) into the function:

167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1

Simplifying this equation:

167 = a + 9b

Substituting the value of a from the previous equation into this equation, we get:

167 = (213 - 10b) + 9b

Simplifying further:

167 = 213 - b

Rearranging the equation, we find b in terms of a:

b = 213 - 167

b = 46

Substituting the value of b into the equation a = 213 - 10b, we can solve for a:

a = 213 - 10(46)

a = 213 - 460

a = -247

The predicted output matches the given output of 167.

For Input 4:

Output = -10 + 92
Output = 82

The predicted output matches the given output of 67.

For Input -3:

To find the values of a and b, we can use two of the given input-output pairs.

-213 = -10a + b 
167 = 9a + b

Subtracting these two equations gives:
-380 = -19a 
a = 380/19 = 20

Substituting this value of a into one of the equations, we find:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs (x) and outputs (y) can be represented by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. Since any number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1, the function simplifies to y = a + bx.

By substituting the given input-output pairs into the equation, we can solve for the values of a and b:

For the first pair (-10, -213):

-213 = a - 10b

For the second pair (9, 167):

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, let's try to find a function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Looking at the data, we can observe that for each input value x, the corresponding output y can be obtained by multiplying x by a certain coefficient and adding a constant term. Let's denote the constant term as a0 and the coefficient of x as a1.

Thus, the function can be expressed as:

Output: y = a0 + a1x

To find the values of a0 and a1, we can use any two data points. Let's choose the first and second data points (-10, -213) and (9, 167):

-213 = a0 + a1(-10)   ...(1)
167 = a0 + a1(9)      ...(2)

Simplifying equation (1), we get:

-213 = a0 - 10a1

Simplifying equation (2), we get:

167 = a0 + 9a1

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables (a0 and a1). By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a0 and a1 and obtain the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

Solving the system of linear equations, we find:

a0 = -243
a1 = 3.0

"After observing the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship can be expressed as a linear function. The function can be written in the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

To determine the values of a and b, let's substitute the given coordinate pairs into the equation and solve for the coefficients:

For the first coordinate (-10, -213):
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

For the second coordinate (9, 167):
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b:

a - 10b = -213    (equation 1)
a + 9b = 167      (equation 2)

Multiply equation 2 by 10 to eliminate the a's:

10a + 90b = 1670   (equation 3)

Subtract equation 1 from equation 3:

10a + 90b - a + 10b = 1670 + 213
9a + 100b = 1883

Solve equation 4 for a:

9a = 1883 - 100b
a = (1883 - 100b) / 9

Now we can substitute the value of a into equation 1 and solve for b:

(1883 - 100b) / 9 - 10b = -213
Multiply both sides by 9 to get rid of the denominator:
1883 - 100b - 90b = -213 * 9
1883 - 190b = -1917
-190b = -1917 - 1883
-190b = -3800
b = -3800 / -190
b = 20

We can now substitute the value of b back into equation 1 to find a:

a - 10(20) = -213
a - 200 = -213
a = -213 + 200
a = -13

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Simplifying these equations, we get:

-213 = a + -10b
167 = a + 9b
67 = a + 4b
-73 = a + -3b
387 = a + 20b

Now, let's solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.

Adding the first equation and the second equation, we get:

-46 = 2a - b

Adding the third equation and the fourth equation, we get:

67 + -73 = a + 4b + a + -3b
-6 = 2a + b

Adding the first equation and the fifth equation, we get:

-213 + 387 = a + -10b + a + 20b
174 = 2a + 10b

Now, we have a system of three equations:

-46 = 2a - b
-6 = 2a + b
