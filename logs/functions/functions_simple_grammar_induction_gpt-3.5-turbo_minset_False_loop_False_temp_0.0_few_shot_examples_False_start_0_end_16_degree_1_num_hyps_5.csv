"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not linear. It appears that the function may be a quadratic equation.

Let's assume the function to be in the form: y = ax^0 + bx^1 + cx^2

To determine the coefficients a, b, and c, we can substitute the input-output pairs into the equation and solve the resulting system of equations.

Using the given pairs:
-10: -213 = a * 1 + b * -10 + c * 100
9: 167 = a * 1 + b * 9 + c * 81
4: 67 = a * 1 + b * 4 + c * 16
-3: -73 = a * 1 + b * -3 + c * 9
20: 387 = a * 1 + b * 20 + c * 400

Solving these equations will give us the values of a, b, and c, which can be used to form the function.

y = -5x^2 + 7x - 1

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described using a linear function of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where 0 and 1 represent the exponents of x.

To find the values of a and b, we can substitute the given input-output pairs into the equation and solve the resulting system of equations.

Using the first input-output pair (-10, -213):
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

Using the second input-output pair (9, 167):
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Using the third input-output pair (4, 67):
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Using the fourth input-output pair (-3, -73):
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

Using the fifth input-output pair (20, 387):
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = -3 and b = 20.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs can be written as follows:

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we need to determine the values of a and b in the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Using the given input and output pairs, we can form the following system of equations:

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1

Simplifying the equations, we get:

-213 = a + (-10)b
167 = a + 9b
67 = a + 4b
-73 = a + (-3)b
387 = a + 20b

The matrix is now in Row-Echelon form, and the last row indicates that we have a zero determinant. This suggests that the system of equations is inconsistent and does not have a unique solution. Therefore, we cannot determine the values of a and b with certainty.

As a pattern recognition system, we could still attempt to find a function that approximates the relationship between inputs and outputs by fitting a curve to the data points using regression techniques. However, without additional information or a consistent pattern in the given data, it is difficult to determine the exact form of the function.

Upon inspection, it appears that the outputs can be represented by a linear function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where x^0 represents the constant term and x^1 represents the linear term.

Let's write the equation for this function:

y = a + bx

To find the values of a and b, we can use any two sets of input-output pairs and solve the resulting system of equations.

Using Input: 4, Output: 67
67 = a + 4b   ... (Equation 1)

Using Input: 20, Output: 387
387 = a + 20b  ... (Equation 2)

To solve the system of equations, we can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

387 - 67 = (a + 20b) - (a + 4b)
320 = 20b - 4b
320 = 16b
b = 320/16
b = 20

Substituting the value of b back into Equation 1, we can solve for a:

67 = a + 4(20)
67 = a + 80
a = 67 - 80
a = -13

    To write the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs, we can use the given form: y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Considering the given inputs and outputs, let's denote the input as x and the output as y. Writing the function explicitly, we have:

For the first data point: 
x = -18, y = 339

So, 339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
This simplifies to 339 = a + (-18b)

For the second data point: 
x = 0, y = -3

So, -3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
This simplifies to -3 = a

For the third data point: 
x = 5, y = -98

So, -98 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
This simplifies to -98 = a + 5b

For the fourth data point: 
x = -3, y = 54

So, 54 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
This simplifies to 54 = a - 3b

For the fifth data point: 
x = -16, y = 301

So, 301 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
This simplifies to 301 = a - 16b

Now, we have a system of linear equations with two unknowns (a and b). We can solve this system to find the values of a and b.

From the second data point, we know that a = -3.
Substituting this value in the first, third, fourth, and fifth equations, we get:

339 = -3 + (-18b)  ->  18b = 342  ->  b = 19

-98 = -3 + 5(19)  ->  -98 = -3 + 95   (which is true)

54 = -3 - 3(19)  ->  54 = -3 - 57  (which is true)

301 = -3 - 16(19)  ->  301 = -3 - 304  (which is true)

From equation (2), we can directly see that a = -3. 

Substituting this value of a into equations (1), (3), (4), and (5) gives:

339 = -3 - 18b
-98 = -3 + 5b
54 = -3 - 3b
301 = -3 + 16b

Solving these equations will yield the value of b, and then substituting the value of b back into any of these equations will allow us to find a.

Using the given data points, we have the following equations:

Equation 1: -18 = a + (-18)b
Equation 2: 0 = a + (0)b 
Equation 3: 5 = a + (5)b

| 1    0  | |b| = |  -3  |
| 1    5  |       | -98  |

By substituting the first pair of input and output values (5, -31) into the equation, we have -31 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1, which simplifies to -31 = a + 5b.

Substituting the second pair of input and output values (9, -51), we have -51 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1, which simplifies to -51 = a + 9b.

By solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b.

Solving the system of equations:
-31 = a + 5b    (Equation 1)
-51 = a + 9b    (Equation 2)

Multiplying Equation 1 by 9 and Equation 2 by 5, we get:

49 = a - 11b

Input: -4, Output: 14
14 = a((-4)^0) + b((-4)^1)
14 = a - 4b

Input: -12, Output: 54
54 = a((-12)^0) + b((-12)^1)
54 = a - 12b

Now we have a system of linear equations:

a + 5b = -31
a + 9b = -51
a - 11b = 49
a - 4b = 14
a - 12b = 54

By solving this system of equations, we can find the values of a and b, and hence the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: 5
Output: -31

Input: 9
Output: -51

Input: -11
Output: 49

Input: -4
Output: 14

Input: -12
Output: 54


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: 17
    ",Output: -91,-91,True,"[-5, -6]"
"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given input and output values, it seems that the relationship can be represented by a linear function of the form:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Let's substitute the values from the examples into the equation to find the values of a and b:

Input: 7, Output: -98
-98 = a(7)^0 + b(7)^1 => -98 = a + 7b

Input: 17, Output: -218
-218 = a(17)^0 + b(17)^1 => -218 = a + 17b

Input: 5, Output: -74
-74 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1 => -74 = a + 5b

Input: 3, Output: -50
-50 = a(3)^0 + b(3)^1 => -50 = a + 3b

Input: -6, Output: 58
58 = a(-6)^0 + b(-6)^1 => 58 = a - 6b

Now, we have a system of equations:

a + 7b = -98
a + 17b = -218
a + 5b = -74
a + 3b = -50
a - 6b = 58

By solving this system of equations, we can determine the values of a and b.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
