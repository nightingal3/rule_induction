Substituting the first data point (-10, -213) into the function, we get:
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

Similarly, substituting the second data point (9, 167) into the function, we get:
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

We now have a system of linear equations:

-213 = a - 10b

1a + 20b = 387

Writing the system of equations in matrix form:

[[1, -10], [1, 9], [1, 4], [1, -3], [1, 20]] * [a, b] = [-213, 167, 67, -73, 387]

Now, let's solve this system of equations:

Using a matrix inversion calculator, we find the solution:

[a, b] = [12.18, 18.06]

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the input and output is:

Output: y = 12.18x^0 + 18.06x^1",0.95,3
"Based on the given inputs and outputs, the function can be described as:

Output: y = -7x^0 + 20x^1",0.95,3
"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be captured by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1. 

Let's solve for the values of a and b by substituting one of the input-output pairs into the equation.

When input x = -10, output y = -213.

Substituting these values into the equation:

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

When input x = 9, output y = 167.

Substituting these values into the equation:

167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

We now have a system of two equations:

-213 = a - 10b
167 = a + 9b

Solving this system of equations, we find that a = 47 and b = -19.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
y = 47x^0 - 19x^1",0.95,3
Function: y = -5x^0 + 21x^1,1.0,4
"To find the function that describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we can use the given data to solve a system of equations.

Taking the general form of the function as y = ax^0 + bx^1, we can simplify it to y = a + bx.

Given the following data points:

Input: -10
Output: -213

Input: 9
Output: 167

Input: 4
Output: 67

Input: -3
Output: -73

Input: 20
Output: 387

We can set up the following system of equations:

-213 = a - 10b         (equation 1)
167 = a + 9b           (equation 2)
67 = a + 4b            (equation 3)
-73 = a - 3b           (equation 4)
387 = a + 20b          (equation 5)

To solve this system of equations, we can use any method like substitution or elimination. Solving the system, we find that a = -10 and b = 24.

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

Output: y = -10 + 24x",0.999,4
Output: y = -76 + 9x,0.95,4
y = -3x^0 + 8x^1,0.95,4
"Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the relationship between the input (x) and output (y) can be captured by a linear equation of the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, where a and b are constants.

To find the values of a and b, we can solve the equation system formed by substituting the given input-output pairs.

Substituting the first pair (-10, -213):
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a - 10b

Substituting the second pair (9, 167):
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Substituting the third pair (4, 67):
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Substituting the fourth pair (-3, -73):
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

Substituting the fifth pair (20, 387):
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

We can solve this system of linear equations to find the values of a and b.",0.9,4
