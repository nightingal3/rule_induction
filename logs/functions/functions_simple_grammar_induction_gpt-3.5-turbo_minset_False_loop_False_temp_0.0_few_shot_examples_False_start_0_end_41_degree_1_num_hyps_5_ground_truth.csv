"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the function y = ax^0 + bx^1 can be used to describe the relationship. Since x^0 is equal to 1, the function simplifies to y = a + bx. To find the values of a and b, we can use any two input-output pairs.

Let's use the first two pairs (-10, -213) and (9, 167) to solve for a and b.

For (-10, -213):
-213 = a + b(-10)
-213 = a - 10b

For (9, 167):
167 = a + b(9)
167 = a + 9b

Solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of a and b:

From -213 = a - 10b:
a = -213 + 10b

Substituting into 167 = a + 9b:
167 = (-213 + 10b) + 9b
167 = -213 + 19b
19b = 167 + 213
19b = 380
b = 20

Substituting b = 20 into a = -213 + 10b:
a = -213 + 10(20)
a = -213 + 200
a = -13

Therefore, the function that describes the given data is:
Output: y = -13 + 20x

    Based on the given input-output pairs, we can observe that the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

After calculating the values, we find that a = -30 and b = 26. Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

    After analyzing the given inputs and outputs, it seems that the relationship between the input and output can be approximated as a linear function. Therefore, we can write the function to describe the data as:

Output: y = ax^0 + bx^1

Now, let's find the values of a and b by substituting the given input-output pairs into the function:

1. For input -10, output -213:
   -213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
   -213 = a - 10b

2. For input 9, output 167:
   167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
   167 = a + 9b

3. For input 4, output 67:
   67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
   67 = a + 4b

4. For input -3, output -73:
   -73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
   -73 = a - 3b

5. For input 20, output 387:
   387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
   387 = a + 20b

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

-213 = a - 10b
167 = a + 9b
67 = a + 4b
-73 = a - 3b
387 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b, which will help us formulate the function.

a = -196
b = 21

Substituting the values of a and b in the function, we get:

Output: y = -196x^0 + 21x^1

Simplifying, we find:

Output: y = -196 + 21x

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The given data shows a unique relationship between the inputs and outputs. Looking at the pattern, it seems that the output values are determined by the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given input-output pairs:

For the first pair (-18, 339):
339 = a(-18)^0 + b(-18)^1
339 = a + (-18b)

For the second pair (0, -3):
-3 = a(0)^0 + b(0)^1
-3 = a + 0

For the third pair (5, -98):
-98 = a(5)^0 + b(5)^1
-98 = a + 5b

For the fourth pair (-3, 54):
54 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
54 = a - 3b

For the fifth pair (-16, 301):
301 = a(-16)^0 + b(-16)^1
301 = a - 16b

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

a - 18b = 339
a = -3
a + 5b = -98
a - 3b = 54
a - 16b = 301

Solving this system of equations, we find a = -3 and b = 19.

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the function can be approximated as a linear function in the form y = bx + a. 

To determine the values of a and b, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation. 

Let's take the first data point (-13, -197):
-197 = b*(-13) + a

Next, let's use another data point (-11, -169):
-169 = b*(-11) + a

Solving these two equations simultaneously will give us the values of a and b. 

Simplifying the equations, we get:
-197 = -13b + a   (equation 1)
-169 = -11b + a   (equation 2)

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1, we have:

    Since the input values are being raised to the power of 0 or 1, the function can be written as y = a + bx. To find the values of a and b, we need to solve a system of equations using the given input-output pairs.

From the first pair (-2, 17), we get:
17 = a - 2b

From the second pair (7, -145), we get:
-145 = a + 7b

Solving these equations simultaneously, we find a = -136 and b = 29. 

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

    Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the function is quadratic rather than linear. Therefore, the function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 would not accurately capture the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

To capture the relationship more accurately, we can use a quadratic function in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c. Let's calculate the coefficients a, b, and c using the given inputs and outputs:

Input: 20, Output: -307
-307 = a(20)^2 + b(20) + c          (equation 1)

Input: -1, Output: 8
8 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c            (equation 2)

Input: 12, Output: -187
-187 = a(12)^2 + b(12) + c         (equation 3)

Input: 18, Output: -277
-277 = a(18)^2 + b(18) + c         (equation 4)

Simplifying equations 2, 3, and 4, we get:

a - b + c = 8                       (equation 2')
144a + 12b + c = -187                (equation 3')
324a + 18b + c = -277                (equation 4')

Solving equations 2' and 3', we find:
a = -2
b = 14
c = -4

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
