"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is essentially y = a + bx. Given the pairs of inputs and outputs, we can see that the relationship between x and y is that y is 19 times x plus 3. 

So, the function is: y = 3 + 19x.

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is essentially a linear function y = a + bx, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the line.

Given the points, we can see that the relationship between x and y is consistent. The change in y relative to the change in x is constant. This constant is the slope (b) of the line.

By observing the given points, we can see that for every increase of 1 in x, y increases by 19. Therefore, b = 19.

The y-intercept (a) is the value of y when x = 0. However, this value is not given in the points. But since the slope is consistent, we can calculate a by substitifying any point into the equation and solving for a. If we take the point (-10, -213), we get:

-213 = a + 19*(-10)
-213 = a - 190
a = -213 + 190
a = -23

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:

y = -23 + 19x

    The function in the form y = ax^0 + bx^1 is essentially a linear function y = a + bx. Here, a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the line. 

Given the points, we can see that the change in y divided by the change in x (which is the slope b) is consistently 19. Therefore, b = 19.

The y-intercept a can be found by substituting one of the points into the equation and solving for a. If we take the point (4, 67), we get:

67 = a + 19*4
67 = a + 76
a = 67 - 76
a = -9

"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    The function is y = 2x + 3. 

Explanation: 
In the form y = ax^0 + bx^1, ax^0 is a constant and bx^1 is a linear term. 
Looking at the given pairs, we can see that when x = -1, y = -7 and when x = 2, y = 5. 
If we subtract these two equations, we get 3 = 2b, so b = 3/2 = 1.5. 
Substituting b = 1.5 into the equation y = ax^0 + bx^1, we get y = a + 1.5x. 
Substituting x = -1 and y = -7 into this equation, we get -7 = a - 1.5, so a = -7 + 1.5 = -5.5. 
So the function is y = -5.5 + 1.5x. 

However, this function does not fit all the given pairs. For example, when x = 3, y should be 9 according to the given pairs, but y = -5.5 + 1.5*3 = -0.5 according to the function. 

So, there seems to be a mistake in the question. If we assume that the function should fit all the given pairs, then the function is y = 2x + 3, because for each pair (x, y), y is 2 times x plus 3.
