"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it appears that the function that captures the relationship is a quadratic equation. Let's assume the function as y = ax^0 + bx^1.

To find the values of a and b, we can use the given data points.

Using the first data point (-10, -213), we can substitute the values into the function:

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1
-213 = a + (-10)b

Using the second data point (9, 167):

167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1
167 = a + 9b

Using the third data point (4, 67):

67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1
67 = a + 4b

Using the fourth data point (-3, -73):

-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1
-73 = a - 3b

Using the fifth data point (20, 387):

387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1
387 = a + 20b

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

"Based on the given inputs and outputs, it seems like the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be described by a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1, where a and b are coefficients. 

Let's calculate the values of a and b using the given data points:

Using the first data point (-10, -213):
-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1

-73 = a - 3b

Using the fifth data point (20, 387):

387 = a + 20b

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

1: -213 = a + (-10b)
2: 167 = a + 9b
3: 67 = a + 4b
4: -73 = a - 3b
5: 387 = a + 20b

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of a and b, which will allow us to write the function:

From equation 1: a = -213 + 10b
Substituting this into equations 2, 3, 4, and 5:

167 = (-213 + 10b) + 9b
67 = (-213 + 10b) + 4b
-73 = (-213 + 10b) - 3b
387 = (-213 + 10b) + 20b

Simplifying these equations:

167 = -213 + 19b
67 = -213 + 14b
-73 = -213 + 7b
387 = -213 + 30b

We can write these equations as a matrix equation:

b ≈ -5.2980

Therefore, the function that captures the relationship between inputs and outputs is:

-213 = a - 10b

For (9, 167):

For (20, 387):

387 = a + 20b

We can rearrange these equations to solve for a and b:

From the equation -213 = a - 10b, we can rewrite it as a = 10b - 213

From the equation 167 = a + 9b, we can substitute the value of a from the previous equation:
167 = (10b - 213) + 9b
167 = 19b - 213

b = 20

Substituting the value of b into the equation a = 10b - 213, we get:
