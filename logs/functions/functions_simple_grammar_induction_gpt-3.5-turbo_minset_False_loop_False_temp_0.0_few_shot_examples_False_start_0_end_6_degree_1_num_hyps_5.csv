"Use this function to apply to the input example to get the correct output.

    To find the relationship between the inputs and outputs, let's fit the data to a linear function in the form of y = ax^0 + bx^1.

We can form a system of linear equations using the given input-output pairs:

-213 = a(-10)^0 + b(-10)^1   -->   a - 10b = -213   (Equation 1)
167 = a(9)^0 + b(9)^1         -->   a + 9b = 167     (Equation 2)
67 = a(4)^0 + b(4)^1           -->   a + 4b = 67      (Equation 3)
-73 = a(-3)^0 + b(-3)^1       -->   a - 3b = -73     (Equation 4)
387 = a(20)^0 + b(20)^1     -->   a + 20b = 387   (Equation 5)

Solving this system of equations will give us the values of 'a' and 'b', which we can then plug back into the function y = ax^0 + bx^1.

Solving the system of equations, we find:
a = 8
b = 21

Thus, the function that captures the relationship between the inputs and outputs is:
Output: y = 8x^0 + 21x^1

Simplifying this equation yields:
Output: y = 8 + 21x
