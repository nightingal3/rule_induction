Example 1: Input: dax lug wif | Output: green blue red
Explanation: ""Lug"" is positioned in between ""dax"" and ""wif."" The color assigned to ""lug"" (blue) is influenced by the colors assigned to the adjacent words. In this case, ""dax"" and ""wif"" are assigned the colors green and red respectively.

Example 2: Input: lug wif dax walm zup | Output: blue red green green green yellow
Explanation: ""Lug"" is positioned at the beginning. The color assigned to ""lug"" (blue) is only influenced by the color assigned to the following word ""wif"" (red).

lug -> blue. Rule: In the context of the given examples, the word ""lug"" always represents the color blue.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors in different instances. The color is determined by the previous words in the sentence and follows a specific pattern:
- If the previous word is ""zup"", then dax means yellow.
- If the previous word is ""lug"", then dax means blue.
- If the previous word is ""wif"", then dax means red.
- If the previous word is ""walm"", then dax means green.
wif -> color. 

Rule: In the given examples, wif is associated with different colors - red, blue, and green. The color associated with wif can vary depending on its position in the sequence of words. For example, if wif appears at the beginning or end of the sequence, it is associated with the color red. If it appears in the middle of the sequence, it is associated with the color blue. If there is more than one occurrence of wif, the colors associated with wif alternate between red and blue.

Meaning: lug seems to represent different colors in each example. The color seems to correspond to its position in the input sequence, starting with red as the first color, green as the second color, and blue as the third color.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to refer to different colors in the given examples. In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"". In the second example, ""dax"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""red"". In the third example, ""dax"" is again associated with ""green"". In the fourth example, ""dax"" is associated with ""red"" and ""yellow"". And finally, in the fifth example, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""yellow"". Therefore, it seems that the meaning of ""dax"" is dependent on the context and refers to different colors.
wif -> color code. The word ""wif"" seems to represent a code for colors. In the given examples, ""wif"" is paired with other words that represent colors, and the corresponding outputs indicate colors based on a certain code. For example, ""wif lug"" gives the output ""red blue"", which suggests that ""red"" corresponds to ""wif"" and ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug"". Similarly, ""wif zup"" gives the output ""red yellow"", indicating that ""red"" corresponds to ""wif"" and ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup"". Based on these examples, it can be concluded that ""wif"" is a code for the color ""red"".
zup -> color

Meaning: ""zup"" represents a color.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors in each example. Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to specific colors, possibly representing a coloring scheme or a pattern.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" always represents the color blue.
dax -> color. It seems that in the given examples, the word ""dax"" is associated with different colors. The context suggests that ""dax"" is a placeholder for a color.
wif -> color (with reference to the examples provided)
Meaning: ""wif"" represents different colors in different contexts. The color corresponding to ""wif"" can vary based on the context in which it is used. 

Rule: The color represented by ""wif"" can be determined by its position relative to other words in the input, as shown in the examples:

1. If ""wif"" appears before or between other words, it corresponds to the color mentioned in the subsequent word(s).
   Example: ""wif walm"" -> red red

2. If ""wif"" appears as the last word in the input, it corresponds to a specific color, regardless of any previous occurrences of ""wif"".
   Example: ""wif"" -> red

Thus, the meaning of ""wif"" is context-dependent and can be determined based on its position in relation to other words.
zup -> color

Rule: zup represents a color, and the color it represents can change from example to example.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents different colors in different contexts. It seems to map to the colors yellow, red, blue, green, and possibly others. The mapping of bluf to different colors is consistent within each example. The specific rules for mapping bluf to colors may not be immediately apparent and further examples would be needed to confirm any patterns, but for now, it can be concluded that bluf represents colors.
walm -> color

Rule: In the given context, whenever the word ""walm"" appears, it should be replaced by a color. The specific color that should be used is determined by looking at the words that precede and follow ""walm"". 

From the examples provided, we can deduce the following color mappings:
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by another instance of ""walm"", the color is blue.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax"", the color is yellow.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif"", the color is green.
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" or ""wif"", the color is red.

While the specific color mappings may be arbitrary and context-specific, the rule suggests that ""walm"" is meant to represent different colors in different contexts.
