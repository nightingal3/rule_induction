"dax -> color combination

Meaning:
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" is used to represent different color combinations. Each input example provides a sequence of colors and the corresponding output specifies the color combination associated with the presence of ""dax"" in the sequence.

Rule:
The rule for determining the color combination associated with ""dax"" can be derived from the examples as follows:

- If ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""wif"" (e.g., Input: dax lug dax lug wif), the color combination is ""green blue green blue red"".

- If ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" (e.g., Input: dax zup), the color combination is ""green yellow"".

- If ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" (e.g., Input: dax lug), the color combination is ""green blue"".

- If ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" and preceded by a color, the color combination is determined by considering the colors before and after ""dax"". For example, in Input: dax wif zup, the color combination is ""green red yellow"", where ""green"" comes before ""dax"" and ""red yellow"" comes after ""dax"".

- If ""dax"" appears by itself (e.g., Input: lug dax walm), the color combination explicitly specified after ""dax"" is repeated. For example, in Input: lug dax walm, the color combination is ""blue green green green"".

Overall, it seems that the meaning of ""dax"" is to indicate a specific color combination or sequence based on the colors preceding and following it.",-0.8725708536199999,22,dax

- If the word ""zup"" is present in the input, then ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"".
- If the word ""lug"" is present in the input, then ""dax"" is associated with the color ""blue"".
- If the word ""wif"" is present in the input, then ""dax"" is associated with the color ""red"".

- The color associated with ""dax"" is repeated for each occurrence of ""dax"" within a sentence. For example, ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green"", where ""red"" is the color associated with ""wif"" and ""green"" is the color associated with the first occurrence of ""dax"".
- The colors associated with ""dax"" and the other words in a sentence follow a pattern of repetition. For example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green"", where ""blue"" is the color associated with ""lug"" and ""red"" is the color associated with ""walm"", ""wif"", and ""bluf"". The pattern of repetition is maintained even if ""dax"" appears in different positions within the sentence.
- If ""dax"" is combined with a word that does not have an associated color, the color associated with ""dax"" is used. For example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", where ""green"" is the color associated with both ""dax"" and ""bluf"".

2. When dax appears in conjunction with other words, each word is associated with a color. The color associated with each word remains the same across examples.

   Example 1: dax lug wif -> green blue red
   - Since ""lug"" is associated with blue and ""wif"" is associated with red, ""dax"" must be associated with green.

   Example 2: zup dax zup wif -> yellow green yellow red
   - Since ""zup"" is associated with yellow and ""wif"" is associated with red, ""dax"" must be associated with green.

   Example 3: lug zup dax lug dax -> blue yellow green blue green
   - Since ""lug"" is associated with blue and ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""dax"" must be associated with green.

   Example 4: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue

"lug -> color

Meaning: The word ""lug"" represents different colors based on the context.

Rule: The meaning of ""lug"" is determined by the presence of other words in the input. The color represented by ""lug"" corresponds to the color associated with the last word mentioned before ""lug"" in the input. If ""lug"" is the first word in the input, then its color is not determined.

Example 1:
Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
Explanation: ""lug"" follows the word ""wif"" and ""wif"" is associated with the color red. Therefore, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.

Example 2:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
Explanation: ""lug"" follows the word ""walm"" and ""walm"" is associated with the color red. Therefore, the three instances of ""lug"" are associated with the color red. The last occurrence of ""lug"" follows the word ""bluf"" which is associated with the color blue. Hence, the last occurrence of ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.

Example 3:
Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
Explanation: ""lug"" follows the word ""dax"" and ""dax"" is associated with the color green. Therefore, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.

Example 4:
Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue
Explanation: ""lug"" follows the word ""wif"" and ""wif"" is associated with the color red. Therefore, the first occurrence of ""lug"" is associated with the color blue. The second occurrence of ""lug"" follows the word ""zup"" and ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. Hence, the second occurrence of ""lug"" is associated with the color yellow.

Example 5:
Input: dax zup lug
Output: green yellow blue
Explanation: ""lug"" follows the word ""zup"" and ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. Therefore, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.",-3.631741077149999,106,lug
