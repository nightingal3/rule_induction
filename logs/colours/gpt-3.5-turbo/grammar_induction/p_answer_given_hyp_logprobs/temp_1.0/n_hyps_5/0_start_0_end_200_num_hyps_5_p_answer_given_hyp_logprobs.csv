    Rules:
lug -> color. Rule: Lug maps to a color, where ""blue"" represents ""lug"" based on the examples given.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" seems to be closely associated with colors, specifically green. The examples consistently show that when ""dax"" is mentioned, it is followed by a color word (e.g., zup, bluf, wif). Furthermore, each time ""dax"" appears, it is associated with a different color in a sequential order (green, blue, red). Therefore, it can be concluded that ""dax"" is a nonce word representing the color green.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" appears to be a color, based on the examples. In every instance, ""wif"" is paired with other words representing colors such as ""lug"", ""walm"", ""green"", ""red"", ""blue"", and ""yellow"".
zup -> color

Meaning: ""zup"" seems to refer to different colors based on the given examples. In most cases, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"". However, it can also take on other colors like ""red"", ""green"", and ""blue"" depending on the context.

Rule: The word ""zup"" in this context has the following color associations:
- zup -> yellow
- wif zup dax -> red yellow green
- zup dax zup lug -> yellow green yellow blue
- zup lug zup lug wif -> yellow blue yellow blue red
bluf -> color

Meaning:
The word ""bluf"" seems to represent colors. From the examples, we can see that each occurrence of ""bluf"" is associated with a specific color. 

Rule:
""bluf"" is followed by a color, and this color seems to be consistently encoded in the output as follows:

- ""bluf"" followed by ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""bluf"" followed by ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""bluf"" followed by ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""bluf"" followed by ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" in this context is a code word for different colors.
walm -> color (yellow, red, or blue)

Rule:
In the given examples, the word ""walm"" is associated with the color of the preceding word. Specifically, if the preceding word is ""zup"", the color associated with ""walm"" is yellow. If the preceding word is ""wif"", the color associated with ""walm"" is red. If the preceding word is ""lug"", the color associated with ""walm"" is blue.

Meaning: The word ""lug"" can be equated to different colors depending on its context. The color assignments are as follows:

- lug -> blue
- walm -> green
- dax -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""lug"" is a placeholder for colors.
dax -> color

Meaning: Dax seems to refer to colors in the given examples. Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:
- When ""dax"" appears alone, it represents the color green.
- When ""dax"" appears in a sequence with other words, it indicates the color of the object mentioned after it.

Rule: dax = green (by default)
Examples:
- Input: dax -> Output: green

Rule: dax + object = color of the object
Examples:
- Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
- Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
- Input: dax bluf lug wif -> Output: green green blue red
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" seems to be associated with colors. The rule can be inferred as follows:
- If ""wif"" is the only word in the input, the meaning is ""red"".
- If ""wif"" is used in a sentence with other words, the meaning depends on the position within the sentence. The first occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""yellow"", the second occurrence corresponds to ""red"", and so on.
zup -> color sequence
Meaning: The word ""zup"" indicates a sequence of colors. The first example shows that ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"". The second example shows that ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". Based on these two examples, it can be inferred that the first color in the sequence is always yellow. The remaining examples further support this inference, as the color sequence follows a pattern where yellow is followed by other colors such as green, blue, and red.
bluf -> color
Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to refer to different colors in each given example. It can represent the colors yellow, blue, red, and green depending on its context. The rule deduction suggests that ""bluf"" is used as a placeholder for different colors each time it appears.
walm -> color. The color that walm represents changes based on the previous words used in the sequence. 

Rule 1: If the previous word is ""zup"", the color represented by walm is yellow.
Rule 2: If the previous word is ""wif"", the color represented by walm is red.
Rule 3: If the previous word is ""lug"", the color represented by walm is blue.
Rule 4: If the previous word is ""dax"", the color represented by walm is green.

These rules can be generalized as:
walm -> yellow if previous word is zup
walm -> red if previous word is wif
walm -> blue if previous word is lug
walm -> green if previous word is dax

It can represent ""green"" in some cases, ""blue"" in some cases, and possibly other colors not mentioned in the examples. The exact meaning of ""dax"" may vary depending on the specific situation.
wif -> position of a word in a sentence

Rule: The word ""wif"" maps to the position of a word in a sentence, where the first word in a sentence is mapped to ""red"", the second word is mapped to ""green"", and subsequent words alternate between ""red"" and ""green"" as shown in the examples.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" in each example represents a color. The color represented by ""bluf"" is determined by the context of the other words in the input. We can see that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green when it is preceded by the word ""dax"" and to the color red when it is preceded by the word ""wif"". In all other cases, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.
walm -> color

Based on the given examples, it can be inferred that the word ""walm"" represents different colors. The mappings observed are:

- The first example shows that ""walm"" corresponds to the color green.
- The second example indicates that ""walm"" represents the color yellow.
- The third example suggests that ""walm"" stands for the color blue.
- The fourth example implies that ""walm"" symbolizes the color yellow.
- The fifth example deduces that ""walm"" signifies the color red.

    Rules:
lug -> blue.
Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it should be interpreted as ""blue"".
From the given examples, we can deduce the following rule for the meaning of the word ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green

Based on this rule, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to different colors in different contexts. In some cases, it represents the color ""red"" (e.g., input: wif -> Output: red), while in other cases it corresponds to the color ""green"" (e.g., Input: dax wif -> Output: green red). Additionally, the color ""blue"" is associated with ""wif"" when it appears in specific patterns (e.g., Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow). Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" appears to be dependent on the context and represents various colors.
zup -> color
Rule: The word ""zup"" represents a color. In the given examples, ""yellow"" is consistently associated with the word ""zup"".
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents different colors.
walm -> color. Rule: walm seems to be associated with the color ""red"" in the context of the first and last examples, and with the color ""blue"" in the context of the second and third examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to represent colors. Based on the examples provided, the context of ""lug"" determines the specific color it represents. However, there is a consistent pattern in the examples where the color associated with ""lug"" seems to correspond to its position within the input sequence.

Rule: 
The color corresponding to ""lug"" depends on its position in the input sequence as follows:
- First occurrence of ""lug"" in the sequence: red
- Second occurrence of ""lug"" in the sequence: blue
- Third occurrence of ""lug"" in the sequence: yellow
- Fourth occurrence of ""lug"" in the sequence: green

This rule is consistent with all the provided examples, where ""lug"" is always associated with a color, and the specific color depends on its position in the input sequence.
dax -> color. The color associated with ""dax"" can be determined by looking at the first letter of the following word in the sequence. If the first letter is ""l,"" the color is blue. If the first letter is ""w,"" the color is red. If the first letter is anything other than ""l"" or ""w,"" the color is green.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" appears to map to different colors based on its position in the sentence. In the first position, it is mapped to green, in the second position, it is mapped to red, in the third position, it is mapped to blue, and so on. The color mapping appears to cyclically repeat based on the position of ""wif"" in the sentence.
zup -> color.
I have observed that in all the examples, the word ""zup"" is always associated with colors. Specifically, it is associated with the color yellow. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to indicate that it means the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf seems to represent a color. Based on the given examples, bluf is associated with the color green.
walm -> color (associated with the given context)
Meaning: The word ""walm"" seems to refer to colors in the given examples, where different colors are mentioned in the output corresponding to the position of ""walm"" in the input. There is a consistent pattern observed in the examples where ""walm"" is associated with the color green in the third position of the output sequence. In the fourth position, ""walm"" is associated with the color green or red depending on its occurrence. Furthermore, in the second position of the output sequence, ""walm"" is associated with the color yellow or blue. Lastly, in the first position, ""walm"" is associated with the color blue.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" always corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors in each example. In example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to the color yellow. In example 2, it corresponds to the color green. In example 3, it corresponds to red. In example 4, it stands alone as ""green."" In example 5, it corresponds to ""green"" twice and ""red"" twice. Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" represents colors.
The word ""wif"" appears in each example, and its meaning seems to depend on the other words in the example. Based on the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: If ""wif"" is followed by a word that has been mentioned before, its meaning is the same as the meaning of that previously mentioned word.

For example, in the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" which has been mentioned before and its meaning is ""green."" Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" in that example is also ""green."" Similarly, in the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which has been mentioned before and its meaning is ""red,"" so the meaning of ""wif"" in that example is also ""red.""

In the last example, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" which has been mentioned before and its meaning is ""yellow,"" so the meaning of ""wif"" in that example is also ""yellow.""

Therefore, based on these examples, we can conclude:

wif -> the meaning of the word that follows it in each specific example
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule:
The word ""bluf"" is associated with different colors in each example. It seems that the color associated with ""bluf"" depends on the other words surrounding it. Here are the rules that can be deduced from the examples:

1. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax"", it represents the color yellow.
2. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and not followed by ""lug"", it represents the color blue.
3. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""walm"", it represents the color green.
4. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""walm"" or ""lug"", it represents the color red.

These rules can be applied to predict the color associated with ""bluf"" in other examples.
walm -> yellow. Rule: Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color yellow.

Meaning: The word ""lug"" represents different colors based on its context in each example. The rules can be deduced as follows:

Rule 1: If ""lug"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""dax"" (e.g., zup lug dax), it represents the color blue.
Rule 2: If ""lug"" appears after ""zup"" only (e.g., zup lug), it represents the color yellow.
Rule 3: If ""lug"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""dax"" (e.g., wif lug dax), it represents the color red.
Rule 4: If ""lug"" appears after ""wif"" only (e.g., wif lug), it represents the color blue.
Rule 5: If ""lug"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""bluf"" (e.g., dax lug bluf), it represents the color green.
Rule 6: If ""lug"" appears after ""dax"" only (e.g., dax lug), it represents the color blue.

Please note that the rules are based on the given examples and may not necessarily generalize to other contexts or meanings.
dax -> color 
Meaning: The word ""dax"" represents different colors based on the context in which it is used. 

Rule: 
- When ""dax"" appears alone, it corresponds to the color ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears in a sequence with other words, each word in the sequence corresponds to a color. The order of the colors in the output corresponds to the order of the words in the input.
  - For example, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green green yellow yellow green"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The specific colors assigned to the words ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup"" may vary depending on the context and are not explicitly defined in the given examples.

Using this rule, ""wif"" can be understood as a placeholder for different colors.
zup -> yellow

Meaning: The word ""zup"" represents the color yellow.
bluf -> color combination

Explanation:
From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is associated with different color combinations. The color combinations are represented by other words like ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""blue."" The specific color combination seems to depend on the context in which ""bluf"" is used.

Based on the examples, we can infer the following color combinations associated with ""bluf"":
- ""bluf"" followed by ""zup"" results in a color combination of ""yellow red red yellow.""
- ""bluf"" without any other words yields a color combination of ""yellow red red.""
- ""bluf"" preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""walm"" results in a color combination of ""green green green red red.""
- ""bluf"" surrounded by other words such as ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" yields a color combination of ""red red green green red red red blue red.""
- ""bluf"" followed by ""lug"" results in a color combination of ""red red blue.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" here seems to be associated with different color combinations.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: Lug is a word that represents a color. It can refer to either blue or yellow, depending on the context.
dax -> green. Rule: In the given context, ""dax"" refers to the color green.
wif -> color. The color associated with ""wif"" can vary depending on the context, but it always corresponds to a color.
zup -> color

Meaning:
The word ""zup"" in the given examples is associated with different colors. It appears that ""zup"" represents a color, specifically the following mapping can be observed:

- ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"" (repeated in all examples).
- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" which is associated with the color ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"" which is associated with the color ""green"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"" which is associated with the color ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"", ""walm"", and ""lug"" which are associated with the colors ""green"", ""green"", and ""blue"" respectively, in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""walm"" which are associated with the colors ""red"" (repeated) in the output.

Based on these examples, it can be concluded that the meaning of ""zup"" is the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> position in a sequence of colors or objects. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be related to its position in a sequence of colors or objects. In all the examples, ""bluf"" appears alongside other colored words, and its output corresponds to its position in the sequence. For example, in the first example, ""bluf"" is the fourth word, so it is associated with the color blue. In the second example, ""bluf"" appears twice, and its output indicates that it is green when it is the first or fifth word, and yellow when it is the second or fourth word. The specific meaning of ""bluf"" may vary depending on the context, but its role appears to be tied to its position within a sequence.
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" seems to correspond to different colors in each example. In the first example, ""walm"" is associated with the color yellow. In the second example, it is associated with the color green. In the third example, it is associated with the color red. In the fourth example, it is again associated with the color yellow. In the fifth example, it is associated with the color blue. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to be a word used to represent different colors, similar to how ""red"" represents the color red, ""blue"" represents the color blue, and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Meaning: The word ""lug"" is assigned the color blue. The rule seems to be that ""lug"" always corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green

Meaning: green

Rule: In the given examples, whenever the word ""dax"" is provided as input, the output is always ""green"". Therefore, it can be inferred that ""dax"" means ""green"" in this context.
wif -> color

Meaning: The word ""wif"" appears to represent colors. Here are the rules that can be deduced from the examples:

Rule 1: If ""wif"" appears alone, it represents the color red.
   - Example: Input: wif
              Output: red

Rule 2: If ""wif"" appears before another word, the word that follows represents a color that is associated with the previous word.
   - Example: Input: wif lug
              Output: red blue
     - In this example, ""wif"" is associated with the color red, so ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
   
Rule 3: If ""wif"" appears after another word, the previous word represents a color that is associated with ""wif"".
   - Example: Input: dax wif
              Output: green red
     - In this example, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, so ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
     
Rule 4: If ""wif"" appears multiple times in a sentence, each occurrence follows the same color pattern as Rule 3 for the previous word.
   - Example: Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
              Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
     - In this example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, so the first occurrence of ""wif"" is associated with blue. Then, ""walm"" is associated with the color blue, so the second occurrence of ""wif"" is also associated with blue. The third occurrence follows the rule for ""wif"" after ""lug"", so it is associated with red. And so on.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""wif"" represents colors.
zup -> yellow. 

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. The word ""zup"" consistently appears in combination with other words, where the output color is related to the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence. It is observed that ""zup"" is always followed by words that correspond to specific colors in the output. Therefore, it can be inferred that ""zup"" is a signal for the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents a color. The following rules can be deduced from the given examples:

Rule 1: If bluf is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup"", the color is green.
Example: ""dax bluf zup"" -> green green yellow

Rule 2: If bluf is preceded by ""zup"", the color is yellow.
Example: ""zup lug bluf wif"" -> yellow blue blue red

Rule 3: If bluf is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup"" and ""lug"", the colors are green and blue respectively.
Example: ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> green yellow blue blue

Rule 4: If bluf is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""wif"", the colors are yellow and red respectively.
Example: ""zup wif bluf"" -> yellow red red

Rule 5: If bluf is preceded by ""wif"", the color is red.
Example: ""wif bluf"" -> red red

Based on these rules, bluf can be interpreted as a representation of colors.
walm -> color, where the color is determined based on the position of the word ""walm"" in the input sequence. The color assigned to ""walm"" in each position follows the following pattern: 

1. If ""walm"" is the first word in the sequence, it represents the color red.
2. If ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence, it represents the color green.
3. If ""walm"" is the third word in the sequence, it represents the color blue.
4. If ""walm"" appears in any other position, its color is determined by the color of the preceding word. The color of ""walm"" is the same as the preceding word's color.

This rule is consistent throughout the examples provided.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

zup -> color. The meaning of ""zup"" seems to be associated with colors. In most examples, ""zup"" is followed by a list of colors, and the output corresponds to the colors mentioned. In Example 1, the output is ""green yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" represents the colors green and yellow. In Example 2, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""zup"" represents the color yellow. In Example 3, the output is ""red green yellow green,"" showing that ""zup"" is associated with the colors red, green, and yellow. In Example 4, the output is simply ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" may be a standalone word for the color yellow. Example 5 further supports this interpretation, as ""zup"" is preceded by other colors, and the output includes ""yellow."" Based on these examples, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: zup -> color (specifically yellow, but potentially other colors as well).
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" appears to represent different colors based on the context. From the examples, we can deduce the following rules:

Rule 1: If the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" represents the color green.

Rule 2: If the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" represents the color blue.

Rule 3: If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" and there is a word after ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" represents the color red.

Additionally, in example 4, ""bluf"" represents the color yellow when there is a second occurrence of ""wif"" after ""bluf.""

So, in summary:

bluf -> green (when preceded by ""dax"")
bluf -> blue (when preceded by ""lug"")
bluf -> red (when preceded by ""wif"" and followed by a word)
bluf -> yellow (when preceded by ""wif"" and followed by a second occurrence of ""wif"")

In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to the color sequence of blue, green, and blue. In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to the color sequence of yellow and blue. In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to the color sequence of blue, green, and yellow. In the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to the colors red and blue. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""lug"" represents different colors in different contexts.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" seems to be related to colors based on the examples given. The color associated with ""dax"" varies in different contexts. For instance, the first example suggests that ""dax"" means ""green,"" while the second example suggests that ""dax"" means ""yellow green."" The third example indicates that ""dax"" can appear multiple times and correspond to different colors, including ""green,"" ""red,"" and ""blue."" The fourth example suggests that ""dax"" can be combined with other words, such as ""zup,"" to indicate a specific color combination. Finally, the fifth example suggests that the word order matters, as ""wif dax"" results in a different color combination compared to ""dax wif.""
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to represent different colors depending on its context. It can signify the color yellow or red, based on the examples provided.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color
Meaning: lug seems to be associated with different colors in the given examples. Based on the examples provided, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: If lug is present
- If lug is the only word, it represents the color blue.
- If lug appears before zup, it represents the color yellow.
- If lug appears after dax, it represents the color green.
- If lug appears after zup, it represents the color red.

Note: The meaning of lug could potentially have different interpretations based on further examples or additional context. The above rule is based solely on the given examples.
dax -> green. Rule: In these examples, the word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"".
wif -> color representation. The word ""wif"" seems to be used to represent different colors depending on the context. In the given examples, ""wif"" is associated with the color red in all cases. However, in some cases, ""wif"" is also associated with other colors, such as blue and yellow. So, the general rule would be that ""wif"" represents different colors, and the specific color would be determined by the context.
zup -> yellow. Rule: zup always corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent a color, and the color it represents is determined by the other words in the sentence. Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following associations:

- If the sentence contains only ""lug bluf"", the output is always ""blue blue"".
- If the sentence contains ""dax wif bluf"", the output is always ""green red red"".
- If the sentence contains ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"", the output is always ""yellow blue red green green red"".
- If the sentence contains ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", the output is always ""blue blue blue red blue blue"".

Therefore, the rule for determining the meaning of ""bluf"" is contextual. It appears that the words ""lug"", ""dax"", ""wif"", ""zup"", and ""walm"" influence the color assigned to ""bluf"". However, without further context or information, it is unclear how exactly these words determine the color.
walm -> color code

Explanation: Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" is a placeholder for a color code. Each occurrence of ""walm"" in the inputs is replaced with a corresponding color in the outputs. The color code appears to consist of the following mapping:

- ""walm"" -> blue
- ""walm wif"" -> red
- ""walm wif bluf"" -> red red

Therefore, we can infer that ""walm"" represents the color blue, while ""walm wif"" represents the color red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to represent different colors in different contexts. In the examples provided, ""lug"" is associated with the colors green, blue, yellow, and red, depending on its position and the surrounding words. From the given examples, it can be observed that ""lug"" is consistently associated with the color blue when it appears after the word ""dax"", and with the color red when it appears after the word ""wif"". However, there isn't a clear pattern when ""lug"" is the first word in the sequence. Therefore, it can be concluded that ""lug"" denotes different colors based on the context in which it is used.
dax -> placement in a sequence of colors

Rule: The meaning of ""dax"" is determined by its position in a sequence of colors. The colors in the sequence correspond to specific words in the input. The first color in the sequence is red, the second color is green, the third color is blue, and the fourth color is yellow. The position of ""dax"" in the sequence determines its meaning. For example, if ""dax"" is in the first position, it means red. If ""dax"" is in the second position, it means green. If ""dax"" is in the third position, it means blue. And if ""dax"" is in the fourth position, it means yellow.
wif -> red. 

Meaning: The word ""wif"" represents the color red. 

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the examples, it is used to indicate the color red.
zup -> color

Meaning: The word ""zup"" seems to represent different colors in each example. Based on the given examples, ""zup"" appears to be associated with the following colors:
- Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
- Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
- Input: dax walm wif zup -> Output: green green green red yellow
- Input: zup -> Output: yellow
- Input: zup wif dax -> Output: yellow red green

From these examples, we can observe that ""zup"" represents the color yellow. Therefore, the rule can be stated as: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> color rule

Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" is a word associated with colors. Each instance of ""bluf"" is followed by a sequence of words that correspond to colors. By examining the patterns in the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

If ""bluf"" is followed by a sequence of words, each word in the sequence represents a color. The order of the colors is significant and corresponds to the desired output. For example, ""yellow green green"" in the first example suggests that the first color is yellow, followed by green, and then green again.

Therefore, ""bluf"" can be interpreted as a term that signifies a sequence of colors.
walm -> color based on its position in the input sequence. Rule:
- If walm is the first word in the sequence, it represents the color red.
- If walm is the second word in the sequence, it represents the color yellow.

Meaning: zup represents colors. Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" can take on the values ""green"" or ""yellow"" and is used in a pattern with other words to represent combinations of colors. For example, ""dax zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow"" and ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue"".
bluf -> color mapping

Meaning: bluf represents a color.

Rule: bluf is a nonce word used to represent different colors in each example. The color mapping can be inferred based on the consistent pattern observed across the examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" based on the output sequence ""red red yellow yellow red"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" based on the output sequence ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" based on the output sequence ""yellow green green"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" based on the output sequence ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" based on the output sequence ""green green red yellow red"".

Therefore, the rule can be stated as: bluf -> color mapping. The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the context and refers to a specific color.

wif -> color combination

Based on the examples given, it appears that the ""wif"" is associated with color combinations. Here is the rule:

Rule: The color combination represented by ""wif"" consists of a sequence of colors, where each color corresponds to a different word in the input sentence. The order of the colors in the ""wif"" output matches the order of the words in the input sentence.

For example, in the first example ""wif zup"", the output is ""red yellow"", which suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""red"" corresponds to the unknown word ""wif."" Similarly, in the second example ""wif bluf dax walm"", the output is ""red red green green green"", meaning that ""bluf"" corresponds to two consecutive ""red"" colors, ""dax"" corresponds to a ""green"" color, and ""walm"" corresponds to three consecutive ""green"" colors.

Based on this rule, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" in the other examples:

- Input: wif bluf lug
  Output: red red blue
  This implies that ""bluf"" corresponds to two consecutive ""red"" colors, and ""lug"" corresponds to a ""blue"" color.

- Input: dax wif lug
  Output: green red blue
  This implies that ""dax"" corresponds to a ""green"" color, and ""lug"" corresponds to a ""blue"" color.
