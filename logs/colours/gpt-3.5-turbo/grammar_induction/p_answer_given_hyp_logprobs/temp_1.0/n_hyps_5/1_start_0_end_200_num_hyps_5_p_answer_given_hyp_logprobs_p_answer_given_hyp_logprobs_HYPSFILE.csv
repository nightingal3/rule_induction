"wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" appears to be associated with different colors based on the context. The rules can be derived as follows:

1. In examples 1 and 5, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output colors are green and red respectively. This suggests that ""wif"" followed by ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
2. In examples 2, 3, and 4, ""wif"" is followed by words other than ""dax"" and the output colors are red, blue, and yellow respectively. This indicates that when ""wif"" is followed by a word other than ""dax"", it corresponds to a different color each time, namely red, blue, and yellow.

In summary, the meaning of ""wif"" depends on the following rule:
- If ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", it corresponds to the color green.
- If ""wif"" is followed by any other word, it corresponds to a different color each time, specifically red, blue, and yellow in separate instances.",-9.91116920652,0,wif

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with a color pattern. Based on the given examples, it appears that the color pattern is as follows:
- ""bluf"" after ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""
- ""bluf"" after ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""

"dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" in the given examples appears to be a color. Based on the provided examples, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: If ""dax"" appears alone, it represents the color green. If ""dax"" appears within a sequence of words, it represents a specific color based on its position in the sequence. The color represented by ""dax"" is determined by counting the number of words before and after ""dax"" in the sequence and following the mapping below:

- If there are no words before and after ""dax"", its color is green.
- If there is one word before ""dax"" and one after, its color is red.
- If there is no word before ""dax"" and one word after, its color is yellow.
- If there is one word before ""dax"" and no word after, its color is blue.

Based on this rule, the provided examples can be explained as follows:

1. ""wif dax wif"" -> ""red green red"": ""dax"" is surrounded by one word before and one word after, resulting in the color red.
2. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green"": ""dax"" is preceded by no words and followed by one word, resulting in the color yellow.
3. ""dax"" -> ""green"": ""dax"" appears alone, representing the color green.
4. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green"": The first and second occurrences of ""dax"" have no words before or after, representing green. The third occurrence is preceded by one word and followed by one word, representing red. The fourth occurrence is preceded by one word and followed by no words, representing blue. The fifth occurrence is preceded by no words and followed by two words, representing green.
5. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue"": ""dax"" is preceded by no words and followed by one word, resulting in the color blue.",-1.081787382754,31,dax
"dax -> color

Meaning: dax represents different colors in different contexts. The rules for determining the meaning of dax based on the given examples are as follows:

1. If dax appears alone or surrounded by other instances of dax, it represents the color green.
   Example: dax -> green

2. If dax appears in a sequence with other words and no other instance of dax, it represents a specific color in that sequence.
   Example: ""wif dax wif"" -> ""red green red""
            ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
   
3. If dax appears in a sequence with other words and there are other instances of dax, it represents the color green, and the other instances represent different colors.
   Example: ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green""

4. If dax appears in a sequence with other words and there is another instance of dax, it represents the color green, and the other word(s) represent a different color.
   Example: ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""

Therefore, the meaning of dax is dependent on its context and can refer to different colors based on the rules mentioned above.",-1.19023633134,31,dax
"dax -> color
Meaning: ""dax"" represents different colors in each example. Based on the examples, ""dax"" can be interpreted as follows:

Rule:
- If ""dax"" appears alone, it represents the color green.
- If ""dax"" appears with other words, it represents a sequence of colors where each word corresponds to a specific color.

Example:
If we consider the first example: ""wif dax wif"" -> ""red green red""
- ""dax"" is surrounded by two occurrences of the color red.

Similarly, in the second example: ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
- ""dax"" is surrounded by the color yellow on the left and the color blue on the right, representing the sequence of colors ""yellow green green"".

From these observations, we can conclude that ""dax"" acts as a placeholder for colors and the specific meaning of ""dax"" depends on its context in the given examples.",-4.82726782544,31,dax
"dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" in the given examples appears to be a representation of color. The color assigned to ""dax"" is determined by the context of its appearance in the input sequence. Here are the rules that can be deduced from the examples:

- ""zup bluf wif"" -> yellow yellow red
- ""lug zup lug"" -> blue yellow blue
- ""lug zup"" -> blue yellow

  Rule: If ""dax"" is followed by a color word, then ""dax"" represents that color.
  
Examples:
- Input: dax wif lug dax  
  Output: green red blue green  
  In this example, ""dax"" is followed by a color word ""wif"" which represents ""green"". Therefore, ""dax"" also represents ""green"" in this context. 
  
- Input: lug dax zup  
  Output: blue green yellow  
  In this example, ""dax"" is followed by a color word ""zup"" which represents ""yellow"". Hence, ""dax"" represents ""yellow"" in this context.
  
- Input: dax  
  Output: green  
  Here, ""dax"" appears alone without any following color word. However, based on the previous examples and the established rule, we can infer that ""dax"" still represents ""green"" in this context.
  
- Input: dax zup bluf  
  Output: green yellow yellow  
  In this case, ""dax"" is followed by the color word ""zup"" which represents ""yellow"". Therefore, ""dax"" also represents ""green"" in this context since that is the previous color associated with ""dax"".
  
- Input: dax lug walm  
  Output: green blue blue blue  
  Here, ""dax"" is followed by the color word ""lug"" which represents ""blue"". Hence, ""dax"" represents ""green"" in this context.

- In the second example, ""dax"" is both preceded and followed by another word. The corresponding output is ""green yellow green"". Based on this pattern, we deduce that ""dax"" represents the color ""yellow"".

- In the third example, ""dax"" is only followed by another word. The corresponding output is ""yellow green blue"". Here, we notice that the color represented by ""dax"" changes from ""yellow"" to ""green"" to ""blue"".
