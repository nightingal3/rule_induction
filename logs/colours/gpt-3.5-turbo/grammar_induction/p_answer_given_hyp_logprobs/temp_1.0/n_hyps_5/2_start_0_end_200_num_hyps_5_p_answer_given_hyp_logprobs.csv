    Rules:
lug -> color

Rule: The word ""lug"" represents a color, where ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug"".
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors in each example. The word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"" when it appears before the word ""wif,"" while it is associated with the color ""red"" when it appears before the word ""bluf"" or after the word ""lug."" In the context of ""zup wif lug dax,"" ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green."" Therefore, based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" generally represents colors, and its specific meaning may depend on the context.
wif -> color. 

Meaning: The word ""wif"" is used to indicate a color. The color ""red"" is associated with the word ""wif"" in all cases where ""wif"" appears in the input.
zup -> color (yellow or green). Interpretation: The meaning of ""zup"" seems to be associated with the colors yellow and green. It is not clear what specific rule determines which color is chosen for each instance of ""zup"", as the examples do not provide a consistent pattern. However, it can be observed that ""zup"" generally appears to correspond to the color yellow when it is the first word in the input sequence, and it tends to be followed by repetitions of the same color within the same sentence. This suggests that the position of ""zup"" and its association with repeated colors may play a role in determining its meaning.

The rule for determining the color combination associated with ""dax"" can be derived from the examples as follows:

- If ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""wif"" (e.g., Input: dax lug dax lug wif), the color combination is ""green blue green blue red"".

- If ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" (e.g., Input: dax zup), the color combination is ""green yellow"".

- If ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" (e.g., Input: dax lug), the color combination is ""green blue"".

- If ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" and preceded by a color, the color combination is determined by considering the colors before and after ""dax"". For example, in Input: dax wif zup, the color combination is ""green red yellow"", where ""green"" comes before ""dax"" and ""red yellow"" comes after ""dax"".

- If ""dax"" appears by itself (e.g., Input: lug dax walm), the color combination explicitly specified after ""dax"" is repeated. For example, in Input: lug dax walm, the color combination is ""blue green green green"".

Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" seems to be determined by its preceding and following words, and specifically, it represents a color.
wif -> red
zup -> color. Rule: zup corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: bluf seems to represent different colors depending on its context. In the given examples, it represents the colors yellow, blue, green, and red. However, without more examples or context, it is difficult to determine a specific meaning for bluf. It could potentially represent any color based on the specific context in which it is used.
walm -> color

Meaning: The word ""walm"" corresponds to colors in a specific pattern.

Rule: The color pattern associated with ""walm"" is as follows:
- The first occurrence of ""walm"" in a sequence corresponds to the color red.
- The second occurrence of ""walm"" in a sequence corresponds to the color yellow.
- The third occurrence of ""walm"" in a sequence corresponds to the color blue.
- Any subsequent occurrence of ""walm"" in a sequence repeats the color pattern from the beginning.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Meaning: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"".
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" seems to refer to different colors in different contexts. In the first example, ""dax"" maps to the color ""green"". In the second example, ""dax"" maps to the color ""yellow"". In the third example where ""dax"" is used by itself, it still maps to the color ""green"". In the fourth and fifth examples, ""dax"" is used in combination with other words, indicating a pattern that suggests ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"" when used before or after the word ""lug"". Therefore, the rule we can infer is: if ""dax"" is used by itself, it means ""green"", if ""dax"" is used with ""lug"", it means ""green"", otherwise the meaning of ""dax"" depends on the context.
wif -> color coding based on the position of wif in the input sequence.
Rule: wif is always assigned the color red, and the other words in the sequence are assigned colors based on their respective positions. The first word is assigned the color blue, the second word is assigned the color green, and any subsequent words are assigned colors in a repeating pattern of red, blue, green.
zup -> color

Meaning: zup is representing different colors in different contexts. It can represent the colors red, blue, and yellow. The order of the colors seems to depend on the position of zup within the input.

walm -> color

Meaning: walm represents a color. The color assigned to ""walm"" depends on the context and the colors mentioned in the input. It appears that ""walm"" is consistently associated with the colors mentioned earlier in the input sequence. Based on the examples given, the color assignments for ""walm"" are as follows:

- ""wif walm"" -> red red red: In this example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""wif"" is associated with the color red. Therefore, ""walm"" is also assigned the color red.

- ""wif dax lug walm"" -> red green blue blue blue: Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is associated with red. Therefore, ""walm"" is assigned the color red. Other colors mentioned after ""walm"" are blue and green, hence the sequence of colors red green blue blue blue.

- ""dax zup dax walm"" -> green yellow green green green: Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" associated with the color green. Therefore, ""walm"" is assigned the color green. The repetition of the color green can be seen in the output.

- ""dax walm wif"" -> green green green red: In this example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" associated with green. Therefore, ""walm"" is assigned the color green. The following word is ""wif,"" which is associated with red. Hence, the output sequence is green green green red.

- ""zup walm lug"" -> yellow yellow yellow blue: ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" associated with yellow. Therefore, ""walm"" is assigned the color yellow. The following word is ""lug,"" associated with blue. Hence, the output sequence is yellow yellow yellow blue.

Rule: ""walm"" is assigned the color of the preceding word in the input sequence.

The word ""lug"" in these examples seems to represent a color. Based on the patterns observed in the examples, lug can represent different colors depending on the context:

1. ""lug wif"" -> blue red
   - In this example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.

2. ""dax lug wif bluf"" -> green blue red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to red.

3. ""lug zup lug"" -> blue yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

4. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> red blue green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""walm"" corresponds to green.

5. ""lug wif walm"" -> blue red red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""walm"" corresponds to red.

Based on these examples, it appears that the meaning of ""lug"" is related to colors. More context or additional examples may be needed to determine if ""lug"" always represents colors or if it can have multiple meanings depending on the specific context.
dax -> color

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to refer to colors. It appears that ""dax"" maps to the colors blue, green, red, and yellow, depending on the context. The specific color associated with ""dax"" in each example is determined by the surrounding words.
wif -> color

Rule: wif represents a color, where green corresponds to ""dax"", blue corresponds to ""lug"", and red corresponds to ""bluf"".

Rule 2: When ""bluf"" appears between two other words, it represents the color red.
Example: dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red

Rule 3: When ""bluf"" appears multiple times within a phrase, each occurrence represents a different color, each color being determined based on the context.
Example: zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow

Based on these rules, it seems like the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the surrounding words or its position within the phrase. Specifically, it represents the color blue when it stands alone or at the end, and it represents the color red when it is between two other words. The color may vary when ""bluf"" appears multiple times in a phrase, with each occurrence representing a different color.
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" appears to represent different colors depending on its position in the sequence. When ""walm"" appears between two other words, it is followed by three instances of the color yellow (""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow). When ""walm"" appears as the first word in the sequence, it is followed by three instances of the color red (""wif dax lug walm"" -> red green blue blue blue). When ""walm"" appears as the last word in the sequence, it is preceded by three instances of the color blue (""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> yellow blue blue blue red green). When ""walm"" appears between two instances of the same word, it is followed by three instances of that same word's color (""dax walm wif dax"" -> green green green red green).

    Rules:
lug -> color

Rule: lug represents a color, with ""blue"" being the most common representation in the given examples. The color represented by lug can vary depending on the context in which it appears.
dax -> color (meaning)

Rule: The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors depending on its context. In the given examples, the meaning of ""dax"" appears to be correlated with the position of ""dax"" in the input. Specifically:

1. When ""dax"" is the first word in the input, it implies the color green was mentioned. (e.g., Input: dax --> Output: green)
2. When ""dax"" appears after other words in the input, it implies the color following ""dax"" was mentioned. (e.g., Input: wif bluf dax --> Output: red red green)
3. ""Dax"" is also influenced by other words in the input that are not colors. (e.g., Input: lug dax --> Output: blue green)

Based on these examples, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as a representation of colors mentioned in the inputs. However, without more examples or context, it is difficult to determine if ""dax"" has a broader semantic meaning.

lug -> color. Rule: In the given context, ""lug"" is associated with different colors. The word ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" in most cases, but can also map to other colors such as ""yellow"", ""green"", and ""red"" depending on the context.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" is determined by its position within the input sequence. When ""dax"" appears alone (e.g., ""dax""), it is associated with the color ""green."" When ""dax"" appears after another word or words (e.g., ""zup dax""), it is associated with the color ""yellow green."" The color association follows a pattern where each subsequent occurrence of ""dax"" within an input sequence follows the pattern of the previous occurrence.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

The word ""wif"" seems to always correspond to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" seems to represent the color yellow in the given examples.
bluf -> color. Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents a color, where ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup,"" ""red"" corresponds to ""wif,"" ""green"" corresponds to ""dax,"" ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug,"" and ""walm"" does not have a corresponding color.
walm -> color

Meaning: walm refers to a color. The color associated with walm seems to be determined by the position of walm in the input sequence. When walm is the first word, it corresponds to the color yellow. When walm is the second word, it corresponds to the color red. When walm is the third word, it corresponds to the color green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: lug refers to the color blue.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors based on the context it is used in. Here are the rules based on the examples:

1. The first example shows that ""dax"" corresponds to the colors ""yellow"" and ""green"" when it is used in the sequence ""zup dax bluf zup dax"". The colors assigned to ""dax"" are alternating between ""yellow"" and ""green"".

2. The second example indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it is used in the sequence ""zup wif lug dax"". 

3. The third example suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the colors ""yellow"" and ""green"" when it is used in the sequence ""wif zup walm dax zup"". Similar to the first example, the colors assigned to ""dax"" are alternating between ""yellow"" and ""green"".

4. The fourth example shows that when ""dax"" is used alone without any surrounding words, it corresponds to the color ""green"".

5. The fifth example demonstrates that ""dax"" corresponds to the colors ""red"" and ""green"" when it is preceded by the word ""wif"". The color assigned to ""dax"" is ""green"" in this context.

Rule: ""dax"" can represent different colors depending on the context it is used in. When ""dax"" is part of a sequence, the colors assigned to it alternate between ""yellow"" and ""green"". When ""dax"" is used alone, it represents the color ""green"".
wif -> color. Rule: The color of ""wif"" is determined by its position in the input sequence. If ""wif"" is the first word, the color is yellow. If ""wif"" is the second word, the color is green. If ""wif"" is the third word, the color is blue. If ""wif"" is any subsequent word, the color is red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples.
bluf -> color sequence or pattern

Based on the examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is associated with a color sequence or pattern. In each example, ""bluf"" is always followed by a sequence of colors. The specific colors in the sequence vary, but there seems to be some pattern or rule governing their order.

The rules underlying the color sequences are not explicitly provided in the examples. However, we can infer some patterns based on the given inputs and outputs:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red blue yellow yellow"".
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red green yellow red green green"".
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green red green yellow yellow"".
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red green"".
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red yellow yellow red red red"".

Examining these examples, we can see some recurring patterns and rules:

- ""bluf"" is always followed by a sequence of colors.
- The length of the color sequence can vary.
- The specific colors in the sequence can vary.
- There may be a repetition of colors within the sequence.
- The order of colors within the sequence may follow a certain pattern, but it is not explicitly defined in the examples.

Based on the provided examples, we can conclude that the word ""bluf"" is associated with a color sequence or pattern, but the specific rules governing the color sequences are not explicitly defined. Further information or examples would be necessary to determine the exact meaning or rule behind the color sequences.

dax -> color

Meaning: dax represents a color. Based on the examples, it seems that dax can represent different colors in different contexts. The rules can be summarized as follows:

Rule 1: If dax appears alone, it represents the color green.
Example: ""dax"" -> green

Rule 2: If dax appears in a sequence of words, the color represented by dax is repeated for each occurrence of dax.
Examples: 
- ""dax zup dax"" -> green yellow green
- ""dax walm"" -> green green green

Rule 3: If dax appears along with another word, the color represented by dax is specific to that context.
Examples:
- ""lug dax"" -> blue green
- ""dax wif"" -> green red

In summary, dax in this context appears to represent colors, with the specific color being determined by the context in which it appears.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" in these examples appears to be associated with colors. In the first two examples, ""wif"" corresponds to the colors ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively. In the third example ""wif dax"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". In the fourth example ""wif dax lug walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and the subsequent words correspond to colors ""green"", ""blue"", and ""blue"" respectively. In the fifth example ""zup wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Therefore, based on these examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" is used to represent the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word 'zup' is correlated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color. The word ""bluf"" seems to represent the color of the preceding word(s) in the examples given. When the word ""bluf"" appears after a word, it assigns the color ""red"" to that word. When ""bluf"" appears alone, it assigns the color ""red"" to it. When ""bluf"" appears before a word, it assigns the color ""yellow"" to that word.

Rule: The meaning of bluf is determined by the color that it represents in the given context.
walm -> color

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence of words, it is associated with the colors mentioned in the corresponding output. The color associated with ""walm"" can vary from sequence to sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color. Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> color (context-dependent) Rule: 

Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""dax"" is being used to represent different colors. In the first example, ""dax wif dax"" translates to ""green red green"", where the first and third instances of ""dax"" are mapped to the color green, and the second instance is mapped to the color red. Similarly, in the second example ""dax"" is mapped to the color green. 

In the remaining examples, additional colors are introduced to the pattern. In example three, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"", where ""dax"" is green and ""bluf"" is red. In example four, ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow"", where ""dax"" appears twice and is always green, and ""bluf"" is red, while ""zup"" is yellow. Lastly, in example five, ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue"", where ""dax"" is always green, ""walm"" is also green, and ""lug"" is blue.

From the examples, we can conclude that ""dax"" is serving as a placeholder for different colors, with its meaning being context-dependent.
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> color

Rule: The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to different colors in each example. The color associated with ""zup"" is determined by the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence. In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because it is the first word. In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because it is still the first word. In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because it is the first word. In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because it is the second word. In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because it is the second word.
bluf -> color (red, yellow, blue) based on its position in the sentence. Rule:	In the given examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color (red, yellow, or blue) based on its position in the sentence. When ""bluf"" appears after the word ""zup"", it is represented by the color yellow. When it appears after the word ""lug"", it is represented by the color blue. And when it appears after the word ""wif"", it is represented by the color red.
walm -> color. The color associated with walm depends on the appearance of colors in the inputs. walm is associated with the color red when it follows the word wif, it is associated with the color blue when it follows the word lug, and it is associated with the color green when it follows the word dax.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" always corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to be used to represent different colors in different contexts. From the examples provided, we can deduce the following rules:

1. If ""dax"" appears alone, it represents the color green.
2. If ""dax"" appears after another color word, it represents that color.
3. If ""dax"" appears before another color word, it represents the color green.

Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" can be categorized as a color, with the specific color being determined by its position in the sentence.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" appears to be code for different colors, with ""red"" being the most common meaning, followed by ""green"" and ""blue"".
zup -> yellow

Meaning: ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color.

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors based on the context. The following rules can be inferred from the examples:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears between two instances of the same color word (e.g., ""lug bluf lug"" or ""zup bluf zup""), it represents the color of the preceding word. For example, ""lug bluf lug"" means ""blue red blue"" and ""zup bluf zup"" means ""yellow red yellow"".

2. When ""bluf"" appears before a color word, it represents the previous color word but also adds the color ""blue"" at the end. For example, ""wif bluf zup"" means ""red red yellow blue"" and ""lug bluf dax"" means ""blue blue green blue"".

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced as a word that represents a color, either repeating the previous color or adding the color ""blue"" at the end.
walm -> color code for different words: 
- blue for ""lug""
- yellow for ""zup"" 
- red for ""wif""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: lug represents a color. The color associated with lug changes based on the context. The examples suggest that lug can represent different colors such as yellow, blue, red, and green. However, there is no clear pattern or consistent rule to determine which color lug represents in each case.
dax -> color. Rule: dax refers to a color and its meaning is determined by the context. In the given examples, dax is associated with the colors ""green"", ""red"", and ""yellow"".
wif -> color

Meaning: The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to different colors in each example. In the first example, ""wif walm"" maps to ""red red"", suggesting that ""wif"" represents the color red. In the second example, ""zup wif lug"" maps to ""yellow red blue"", indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red again. In the third example, ""lug dax wif"" maps to ""blue green red"", further supporting the idea that ""wif"" represents the color red.

However, there is an exception in the fourth example, where ""wif"" is used in isolation and maps to just ""red"". This suggests that the meaning of ""wif"" can be context-dependent and can also stand alone as a single color.

The fifth example, ""wif bluf"", maps to ""red red"". This example reaffirms the previous deduction that ""wif"" represents the color red.

Based on these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" can be stated as:
Rule: wif represents the color red, but can also stand alone as a standalone color. The precise meaning of ""wif"" might depend on the context.
zup -> color of the subsequent words.

Meaning: zup represents the color of the following words. 

Rule: The word zup indicates the color of the following words in the sequence.
bluf -> color word (yellow, red, green, blue)
walm -> repetition of the previous color word or its equivalent. Rule: walm repeats the color word that comes immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color
Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to represent different colors in each context. In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with the color red. In the following examples, ""lug"" is consistently associated with the color blue. Therefore, it can be inferred that ""lug"" generally means the color blue, with the exception of the first example where it takes the meaning of red.
dax -> coloration pattern. The word ""dax"" seems to represent a pattern of coloration in the examples provided, where each occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to a particular color. The color pattern seems to be:
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""dax"" followed by ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" followed by ""zup"" followed by ""dax"" -> green
- ""dax"" followed by ""zup"" followed by ""dax"" followed by ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" followed by ""wif"" -> red
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to represent colors based on the provided examples. In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to the colors yellow, red, and green. In the second and third examples, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. The fourth example shows ""wif"" as alternating between green and red. The fifth example shows ""wif"" as yellow, red, and blue.
zup -> yellow. Rule: zup is a placeholder for the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning can be deduced from the examples as follows:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" is associated with ""red"" twice, so it can be inferred that ""bluf"" represents the color ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is associated with ""green"" and ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" represents the colors ""green"" and ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is associated with ""red"" and ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" represents the colors ""red"" and ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""yellow"" twice, so ""bluf"" represents the colors ""blue"" and ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is associated with ""green"" twice, so ""bluf"" represents the color ""green.""

Rule: bluf represents different colors depending on the context, with the possible colors being red, green, blue, and yellow.
walm -> color

Meaning: walm represents a color. Based on the examples, it seems that walm can be any of the following colors: green, blue, red, or yellow. The specific color assigned to walm may depend on the presence or position of other words in the sentence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: lug represents different colors in different contexts. It can represent colors such as yellow, blue, green, or red.
dax -> color

Rule: The word ""dax"" is associated with a specific color. In all the given examples, ""dax"" is always followed by a color word (e.g., bluf, lug, wif), and the output corresponds to the colors mentioned in the examples. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""dax"" is a word used to represent a color, specifically green.
wif -> color. The meaning of the word ""wif"" in these examples seems to be related to color. Based on the examples, we can observe the following rules:

1. When ""wif"" is surrounded by other words, it denotes a color. For example:
   - Input: lug walm wif lug
     Output: blue blue blue red blue
     In this case, ""wif"" represents the color blue.

   - Input: dax wif
     Output: green red
     Here, ""wif"" represents the color red.

2. When ""wif"" appears alone, it represents a color as well. For example:
   - Input: wif
     Output: red
     Here, ""wif"" represents the color red.

3. The color represented by ""wif"" may vary depending on its context. For example:
   - Input: wif lug
     Output: red blue
     Here, ""wif"" denotes red, but when followed by ""lug,"" it represents blue.

   - Input: wif bluf
     Output: red red
     In this case, ""wif"" represents red, regardless of the following word.

It is worth noting that without more examples, it is difficult to fully determine the precise meaning of ""wif"" or the system behind its assignment to specific colors in different contexts. However, based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" is associated with different colors depending on its neighboring words.
zup -> yellow. Rule: zup represents the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning of ""bluf"" can be interpreted as different colors based on the examples given. It seems that ""bluf"" is associated with the following colors:

- ""bluf"" is associated with the color yellow in the first example (""zup dax bluf"").
- ""bluf"" is associated with the color green in the second and fourth examples (""dax bluf"" and ""dax zup wif bluf lug"").
- ""bluf"" is associated with the color blue in the third example (""lug bluf dax lug"").
- ""bluf"" is associated with the color red in the fifth example (""wif bluf zup"").

Based on these examples, the rule can be defined as follows:
Rule: bluf -> Meaning (color)
- If ""bluf"" is present with ""zup"", the meaning is ""yellow"".
- If ""bluf"" is present alone or with ""dax"" or ""zup"", the meaning is ""green"".
- If ""bluf"" is present with ""lug"", the meaning is ""blue"".
- If ""bluf"" is present with ""wif"", the meaning is ""red"".

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- If ""lug"" is the only word in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green.
wif -> order of colors. The word ""wif"" seems to indicate the order of colors being mentioned in the sentence. In the first example, ""wif"" appears after ""dax"" which corresponds to the colors ""green green green"". In the second example, ""wif"" appears before ""dax"" which corresponds to the colors ""red green"". In the third example, ""wif"" appears after ""dax"" which corresponds to the colors ""green red"". In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears before ""zup"" which corresponds to the colors ""red yellow"". In the final example, ""wif"" appears after ""bluf"" which corresponds to the colors ""yellow red red red"".

dax -> color, with the following mappings:
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> yellow
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to different colors depending on its context. In the first example, ""wif"" maps to ""yellow"" and ""red"" in the second example. In subsequent examples, it always maps to ""red"" when presented on its own. However, when ""wif"" is part of a longer sequence, its corresponding color varies. For example, in the last example, ""wif"" maps to ""yellow"" within the context of ""zup wif"" but maps to ""red"" in the broader context. There doesn't appear to be a clear-cut general rule for ""wif"" but its meaning seems to depend on the surrounding words or context.
zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow. Therefore, the general rule deduced from the examples is that ""zup"" represents the color yellow.
bluf -> color

- In the first example, ""dax"" represents the color green.
- In the second example, ""dax"" represents the color blue.
- In the third example, ""dax"" represents the color red.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" represents the color green.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" represents the color green.

Based on these examples, it seems like ""dax"" is being used to represent different colors each time. Therefore, we can infer that the meaning of ""dax"" is context-dependent and is assigned as the color that occurs with it in each example.
wif -> color (red, green, blue, yellow)

Rule: The word ""wif"" represents a color, with the color changing in a specific order: red, green, blue, yellow.

dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors in different contexts, as indicated by the examples. Here are the rules I deduced:

- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""walm"" and followed by another ""walm,"" it corresponds to the color ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""wif,"" it corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""bluf,"" it corresponds to the color ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif,"" followed by ""zup,"" and not followed by ""bluf,"" it corresponds to the color ""red.""
- When ""dax"" is surrounded by ""lug"" on both sides, it corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Note: These rules are specific to the given examples and may not hold true in other contexts or language.
Based on the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red, green, yellow, blue

The meaning of ""wif"" can correspond to different colors: red, green, yellow, or blue, depending on its position in the input.
zup -> color

Meaning: zup represents different colors depending on its position in the sequence of words. 

Rule: 
- When zup is the first word in the sequence, it represents the color yellow.
- When zup is in any other position, it represents the color green.
bluf -> color. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a color based on the observed outputs. The rule appears to be that each occurrence of ""bluf"" is associated with a specific color, with different instances having different colors. The specific colors assigned to ""bluf"" appear to be arbitrary and do not follow a consistent pattern in the given examples.
walm -> color
Meaning: walm represents a color. 

Rule: 
The color represented by walm is determined by the sequence of previous words in the input. The mapping is as follows:

- If the sequence contains ""dax"" before walm, the color is green.
- If the sequence contains ""lug"" before walm, the color is blue.
- If the sequence contains ""zup"" before walm, the color is yellow.
- If the sequence contains ""wif"" before walm, the color is red.

If there are multiple occurrences of walm in a sequence, each occurrence should be given the corresponding color based on the preceding word.

Meaning: Dax represents different colors based on its context in the sentence. The following rules can be observed:

1. When dax is surrounded by the word ""zup"", it represents the color yellow.
2. When dax is surrounded by the word ""wif"", it represents the color red.
3. When dax is mentioned independently, it represents the color green.
4. When dax is surrounded by the word ""lug"", it represents the color blue.

Based on these patterns, it can be inferred that the meaning of dax is dependent on the words surrounding it and represents different colors in different contexts.
wif -> color. The color associated with ""wif"" depends on the context in which it appears. If ""wif"" appears alone, it has a meaning of ""red"". However, if ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup"", it takes on the meaning of ""yellow"". If ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax"", it takes on the meaning of ""green"". In all other cases, ""wif"" does not have a specific color association and can be considered as a separate category.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow in this context.
bluf -> color: 

The word ""bluf"" appears in different contexts alongside different words, such as lug, zup, dax, and wif. By observing the examples, it is apparent that ""bluf"" is associated with color descriptions. In each example, ""bluf"" is consistently translated to the color ""green"" or ""red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" represents a color. However, further examples are necessary to determine a more specific rule or meaning for ""bluf"" in different contexts.
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" seems to represent different colors in different contexts. In the given examples, ""walm"" is associated with the color green in the first example, blue in the second and fourth examples, and yellow in the third and fifth examples.

dax -> green. Meaning: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green.
wif -> color.

The rules can be deduced as follows:
1. In the first two examples, ""wif"" is always paired with ""dax"" and the output is always ""red green"", suggesting that ""wif"" represents the colors red and green in some order.
2. In the third example, ""wif"" is paired with ""lug"" and the output is ""blue red"", suggesting that ""wif"" represents the colors blue and red in some order. 
3. In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears alone and the output is ""red"", suggesting that ""wif"" represents the color red.
4. In the fifth example, ""wif"" is paired with ""dax"" and ""zup"" and the output is ""green red yellow"", suggesting that ""wif"" again represents the colors green, red, and yellow in some order.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it represents a sequence of colors. The specific colors and their order may vary depending on the context.
zup -> position in a color sequence

Meaning: The word ""zup"" seems to indicate a specific position in a sequence of colors. In the given examples, the sequence appears to be blue, red, green, and yellow. The position of ""zup"" determines the color that follows it. For example, if ""zup"" is in the first position after another color, then it corresponds to blue. If ""zup"" is in the second position, it corresponds to red. If ""zup"" is in the third position, it corresponds to green. And if ""zup"" is in the fourth position, it corresponds to yellow.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Explanation: Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it is consistently associated with the color blue. Therefore, the rule deduced is that ""lug"" means the color blue in this context.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" seems to represent different colors based on the context, as shown in the examples. The colors associated with ""dax"" are green, green green, red, and blue green.
wif -> color code

Meaning:
The word ""wif"" seems to represent a color code in the given examples. It is used in conjunction with other words, and the resulting output indicates different colors. The color codes assigned to ""wif"" are as follows:

- ""wif dax"" -> red green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug dax wif"" -> blue green red
- ""wif bluf zup"" -> red red yellow
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> green green red blue

Rule:
The color code assigned to ""wif"" can vary depending on the input context. It appears that the color assigned to ""wif"" corresponds to the position of ""wif"" in the input. For example, if ""wif"" is the first word, it is associated with the first color; if it is the second word, it is associated with the second color, and so on.
zup -> yellow. Based on the examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> position in a color sequence

Rule: 
The word ""bluf"" seems to be indicating the position in a color sequence. The color sequence starts with yellow, followed by green, red, and then blue. The position of ""bluf"" in the sequence determines the meaning. For example, if ""bluf"" is in the first position, it corresponds to yellow. Similarly, if ""bluf"" is in the second position, it corresponds to green, and so on.

Meaning:
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the word ""zup"" is equivalent to the color yellow. In all of the given inputs, the word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow in the corresponding outputs. This suggests that ""zup"" serves as a specific label or indicator for the color yellow in this context.
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, where each color is represented by a specific word. The color mapping is as follows:
- yellow -> ""zup""
- green -> ""dax""
- red -> ""wif""
- blue -> ""lug""

Therefore, ""bluf"" can be understood as a placeholder for a color.

dax -> green. 

Meaning: The word ""dax"" in these examples seems to refer to the color green. Based on the examples provided, it appears that whenever ""dax"" is mentioned, it is associated with the color green.
wif -> red. Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it should be interpreted as the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to have a consistent pattern with the color that comes after it in the input sequence. For example, in the first two examples, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively. In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" and then ""yellow"". In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" twice and then ""red"" three times. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"", ""green"", and then ""blue"". 

Therefore, based on the given examples, the general rule appears to be that ""bluf"" is associated with the color that comes after it in the input sequence.
walm -> green/blue/yellow/red

Meaning: The word ""walm"" represents a color, and the specific color it represents depends on the context. The color is determined by the presence and order of other words in the input. 

Rule: If ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by one or more occurrences of ""walm"", the color is green. 
        If ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by one or more occurrences of ""walm"", the color is yellow.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: Lug seems to represent different colors based on the examples provided. In each example, the word ""lug"" is associated with a specific color, such as blue, red, or yellow. Therefore, in this context, ""lug"" appears to be a symbol or placeholder for colors.
Based on the examples given, the meaning of the word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

dax -> green

From the examples, ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green.
wif -> color. The meaning of wif seems to be associated with colors. In the examples, wif is consistently assigned the color ""red"".
zup -> color

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents a color. Based on the examples, ""yellow"" is associated with ""zup"" most frequently, followed by ""blue"" and ""red"".
bluf -> color

Meaning: ""bluf"" is used to represent a color. From the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" represents different colors based on its position in the sequence of words. The rules can be summarized as follows:

1. If ""bluf"" is the first word, then the next word will be ""yellow.""
2. If ""bluf"" is the second word, then the previous word will be ""yellow"" and the next word will be ""green.""
3. If ""bluf"" is the third word, then the previous two words will be ""green"" and the next word will be ""green.""
4. If ""bluf"" is the fourth word, then the previous three words will be ""blue"" and the next word will also be ""blue.""

Therefore, we can conclude that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on its position in the sequence and represents different colors: yellow, green, and blue.
walm -> color

Rule: Walm corresponds to a color, with the following mapping:
- red: walm appears after the word ""wif"".
- yellow: walm appears after the word ""zup"".
- green: walm appears after the word ""dax"".
- blue: walm appears after the word ""lug"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Meaning: lug refers to a color. The color is determined by the order in which lug appears in the input sequence. The colors associated with lug are: blue, yellow, red, green.
dax -> color, where the color corresponds to the position of dax in the sequence of words. The first occurrence of dax is green, the second occurrence is yellow, and subsequent occurrences are green again.
wif -> color. The color associated with ""wif"" is determined by the colors in the context. ""wif"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the context.
zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow. Therefore, we can infer the rule: 

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> color based on its position in the input.

Rule: The color of bluf is determined by its position in the input. The first occurrence of bluf is green, the second occurrence is red, the third occurrence is blue, and any subsequent occurrences are yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be related to the count or repetition of certain colors in the sequence. Here is a possible rule:

walm -> The number of times the previous color appears consecutively in the sequence.

This rule suggests that the color that precedes ""walm"" determines the number of times it should be repeated. For example, if the previous color is ""blue,"" then ""walm"" will be followed by ""blue"" repeated three times. The same logic applies to other colors as well.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

- Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> Output: red red yellow red blue green
- Input: lug zup dax lug -> Output: blue yellow green blue
- Input: dax -> Output: green
- Input: dax -> Output: green

Therefore, it can be concluded that ""dax"" represents different colors, specifically green, blue, and red in the given examples.
wif -> red. Rule: When the word ""wif"" appears, it consistently corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> color sequence rule. The word ""zup"" appears to represent a specific sequence of colors. Based on the examples, the possible color sequences linked to ""zup"" are:
- yellow red yellow green
- yellow green
- red green yellow red green green
- blue yellow
- red yellow green

It is unclear if there is any particular pattern or logic behind the color sequences represented by ""zup"".
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents a color. Based on the given examples, bluf can be interpreted as follows:
