Meaning: Lug represents a color, specifically the color blue. This is inferred from the examples where the word ""lug"" is used in combination with other words that represent different colors (e.g., ""lug dax"" -> blue green, ""lug wif"" -> blue red).
dax -> color.

Meaning: The word ""dax"" appears to correspond to different colors. In the given examples, ""dax"" is associated with the colors red, green, yellow, and blue. However, without additional information or context, it is not possible to determine a specific rule for the assignment of colors to ""dax"". It seems that the meaning of ""dax"" is dependent on the specific context in which it is used.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" appears to be a color. Based on the examples, it can represent different colors such as yellow, green, blue, and red.
zup -> yellow

Meaning: In the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow.

Example:
- If ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"", it represents the color blue.
- If ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", it represents the color yellow.
- If ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", it represents the color red.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to indicate a color, with ""blue"" being represented by ""wif"" in the first example, ""yellow"" in the second and fifth examples, and ""red"" in the third and fourth examples. The word ""wif"" is consistently associated with different colors in each example, suggesting that it is likely a nonce word created specifically for these examples.
zup -> color

Meaning: The word ""zup"" seems to represent colors in the given examples. In each example, ""zup"" is followed by a sequence of other words. The corresponding sequence of colors in the output can be determined by assigning each word a color. By analyzing the examples, we can deduce the following color assignments:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> red
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green

Therefore, we can conclude that the meaning of ""zup"" is ""yellow"", based on its consistent association with the color yellow in all the examples.
bluf -> color. The meaning of the word ""bluf"" appears to be a color, based on the examples provided. It can be interpreted as follows:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" is used alongside the colors ""red"" and ""green"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is used alongside the colors ""yellow"" and ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is used alongside the colors ""green"" and ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is used alongside the color ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is used alongside the colors ""red"" and ""green"" once again.

Overall, it appears that ""bluf"" is associated with different colors in different contexts. A rule could be formulated as follows: 
Rule: bluf -> the color mentioned previously, or a specific color in the given context.
walm -> color

Rule: The word ""walm"" is associated with a color. The color of ""walm"" can be determined based on the other words in the sentence. The specific associations established are as follows:

- If ""walm"" appears after the word ""wif"", the color is red.
- If ""walm"" appears before the word ""zup"", the color is yellow.
- If ""walm"" appears before the word ""bluf"", the color is green.
- If ""walm"" appears after the word ""lug"", the color is blue.

These associations suggest that the meaning of ""walm"" is dependent on its position relative to other words in the sentence and may refer to different colors based on the context.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: lug is consistently associated with the color blue.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" in the given examples appears to be a color. Based on the provided examples, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: If ""dax"" appears alone, it represents the color green. If ""dax"" appears within a sequence of words, it represents a specific color based on its position in the sequence. The color represented by ""dax"" is determined by counting the number of words before and after ""dax"" in the sequence and following the mapping below:

- If there are no words before and after ""dax"", its color is green.
- If there is one word before ""dax"" and one after, its color is red.
- If there is no word before ""dax"" and one word after, its color is yellow.
- If there is one word before ""dax"" and no word after, its color is blue.

Based on this rule, the provided examples can be explained as follows:

1. ""wif dax wif"" -> ""red green red"": ""dax"" is surrounded by one word before and one word after, resulting in the color red.
2. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green"": ""dax"" is preceded by no words and followed by one word, resulting in the color yellow.
3. ""dax"" -> ""green"": ""dax"" appears alone, representing the color green.
4. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green"": The first and second occurrences of ""dax"" have no words before or after, representing green. The third occurrence is preceded by one word and followed by one word, representing red. The fourth occurrence is preceded by one word and followed by no words, representing blue. The fifth occurrence is preceded by no words and followed by two words, representing green.
5. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue"": ""dax"" is preceded by no words and followed by one word, resulting in the color blue.
wif -> red. 

Rule: The word ""wif"" can be interpreted as the color red.
zup -> color. The word ""zup"" seems to be associated with different colors in different contexts. In the first example, ""zup"" is associated with the colors yellow, green, and red. In the second example, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. In the third example, ""zup"" is associated with the colors yellow, red, and blue. In the fourth example, ""zup"" is again associated with the color yellow. Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup"" is associated with the colors green and yellow. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""zup"" is a term used to indicate color, specifically yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: bluf represents a color. The color represented by bluf can be determined based on the other words present in the sentence:

- If bluf is preceded by zup, the color is yellow.
- If bluf is preceded by dax, the color is green.
- If bluf is followed by dax, the color is green.
- If bluf is followed by lug, the color is blue.

If none of these conditions are met, the meaning of bluf is not clear from the given examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> color

Meaning: Dax represents different colors depending on its context.

Rule: 
- If dax appears alone, it represents the color ""green"".
- If dax appears after another word, it represents the color associated with that word. For example, if dax follows ""zup"", it represents the color ""yellow"".
- If dax appears before another word, it does not affect the meaning of that word and only represents its own color. For example, in the input ""dax lug"", ""dax"" represents the color ""green"" and ""lug"" represents the color ""blue"".
wif -> color

Meaning: wif represents colors, specifically red, yellow, green, and blue. The specific color represented by wif is determined by its position in the sequence of words.
zup -> color

Meaning: The word ""zup"" seems to represent different colors based on its context. The rules underlying the given examples suggest the following pattern:

- When ""zup"" is the only word in the input, it corresponds to the color yellow.
- When ""zup"" is preceded by another word, the color associated with ""zup"" depends on the color of the preceding word.

Here are the rules deduced from the examples:
- If the preceding word is ""bluf"", then ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- If the preceding word is ""dax"", then ""zup"" corresponds to green.
- If the preceding word is ""wif"", then ""zup"" corresponds to red.

Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as a representation of various colors depending on its context.
bluf -> color pattern

Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent a color pattern. In the examples provided, it always follows a specific pattern: yellow, red, blue, etc. The exact colors may vary, but the pattern stays consistent.
walm -> color

Rule: In the given context, walm refers to a color. The color that walm represents depends on its position in the input sequence. If walm is the first word, it represents yellow. If walm is the second word, it represents blue. If walm is the third word, it represents red. If walm is the fourth word, it represents green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following rule:

lug -> color

Meaning that ""lug"" represents a color. The specific color represented by ""lug"" is determined based on the surrounding words. Here are the color associations we can make from the examples:

lug bluf -> blue blue
dax wif lug dax -> green red blue green
wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
wif lug -> red blue
lug zup lug -> blue yellow blue

This suggests that ""lug"" can represent different colors depending on its position within the sentence. The exact mapping of colors to ""lug"" is not clear from the examples alone, but it can be inferred that ""lug"" can correspond to different colors in different contexts.
dax -> color

Meaning: Dax refers to different colors depending on its context.

Rules:
1. If ""dax"" appears alone or followed by ""bluf"", it means ""green"".
2. If ""dax"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""lug"", it means ""yellow"".
3. If ""dax"" appears after ""zup"", before ""lug"", and after ""walm"", it means ""blue"".
4. If ""dax"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""wif"", it means ""red"".
wif -> color

Rule:
If ""wif"" appears alone, it means ""red"".
If ""wif"" appears before another word, it signifies a color. The specific color can be determined by looking at the corresponding output for that input, e.g., ""wif dax"" -> ""red green"", so ""wif"" means ""red"".
zup -> color

Meaning: zup refers to a color.

Rule: The word ""zup"" is being used to represent different colors in the given examples. Each occurrence of ""zup"" is associated with a specific color. The color mapping for ""zup"" can be determined based on the patterns observed in the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" maps to the color ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" appears twice and is associated with ""yellow"" in both cases.
- In the third example, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""green"" based on its position in the sequence.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" based on its position.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" appears twice and is associated with ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively.

Based on these patterns, it can be concluded that ""zup"" represents colors in the given examples. However, without additional context or more examples, it is difficult to determine a specific rule for the color mapping.
bluf -> color. Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is specified by the sequence of words that precede it, with each word mapping to a specific color. The color mapping is as follows: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue.
walm -> color code of the words in the sentence

Rule: The word ""walm"" represents a color code where each word in the sentence is mapped to a specific color. The color code can be determined based on the position of the word in the sentence. For example, the first occurrence of ""walm"" always results in yellow, the second occurrence results in green, the third occurrence results in red, and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Meaning: 
- When lug is preceded by dax, it means green.
- When lug is preceded by bluf, it means blue.
- In all other cases, lug means blue.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to be associated with different colors in different contexts. Based on the examples, it appears that ""dax"" has been assigned the meaning of a color, and the specific color is indicated by the other words in the sentence. For example, ""zup dax"" suggests that ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" suggests that ""dax"" means ""green"" in the context of ""yellow yellow red blue green."" In general, ""dax"" seems to represent the color that comes after the other colors mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: dax represents the color that comes after the other colors mentioned in the sentence.
wif -> color. 

Meaning: The nonce word ""wif"" seems to represent colors. Based on the given examples, ""wif"" corresponds to different colors, such as red, green, blue, and yellow. Additionally, ""wif"" can appear alone, suggesting that it represents a color in isolation.
zup -> color, where red corresponds to ""wif"", green corresponds to ""dax"", yellow corresponds to ""bluf""
bluf -> color or signal meaning. It seems that the word ""bluf"" is associated with different colors or signals. Based on the examples given, it appears that the colors or signals associated with ""bluf"" are:

- Yellow
- Green
- Blue
- Red

The exact meaning of each color or signal is uncertain based on the examples alone, but a possible rule could be that ""bluf"" represents a sequence of colors or signals that are being described.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color. Rule: lug translates to the color blue. It is always translated as blue regardless of its position in the sentence.
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" in the examples seems to represent different colors. Here are the observed associations:

- The first example suggests that ""dax"" represents the color green since all occurrences of ""dax"" are followed by ""walm"", which is associated with the color green.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by different words, but the corresponding outputs are still associated with colors. This indicates that ""dax"" can represent a different color in each context.
- The third example reinforces the association of ""dax"" with the color green, as it is repeated twice in this context, both times followed by ""walm"", which is associated with green. The other occurrences of ""dax"" in this example are followed by different words, suggesting ""dax"" can represent different colors depending on the context.
- The fourth example supports the previous observations, as ""dax"" is associated with different colors based on the context.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax"" appears alone and is associated with the color green.

Rule: The meaning of ""dax"" depends on its context and represents different colors.
wif -> red 

Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red. In all instances where ""wif"" is present, it is accompanied by other words which are associated with different colors. Therefore, we can conclude that ""wif"" is a placeholder for the color red.
zup -> color. The word zup seems to represent colors in the given examples. It can take on different colors depending on its position in the input sequence. The specific mapping of colors to zup can be determined by looking at the pattern observed in the examples. The mapping in this case is:

zup -> yellow if it comes after a color word, otherwise green.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents a color, and the translation of this color varies depending on the context. Based on the given examples, it appears that bluf can be translated as follows:

1. In the first example, bluf is translated as follows: blue -> green -> green -> yellow -> blue -> red.
2. In the second example, bluf is translated as follows: green -> yellow -> yellow.
3. In the third example, bluf is translated as follows: green -> blue -> blue.
4. In the fourth example, bluf is translated as follows: red -> green -> red -> red -> yellow -> red.
5. In the fifth example, bluf is translated as follows: red -> red.

Rule: The translation of bluf corresponds to a sequence of colors. Each occurrence of bluf is translated as the next color in the sequence, starting from the beginning if necessary.

dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" appears to be associated with color. The following rules can be deduced from the examples:

Rule 1: When ""dax"" appears alone, it means ""green"".
Example: Input: dax   ->   Output: green

Rule 2: When ""dax"" appears in a sequence with other words, it corresponds to a repeating pattern of colors.
Example 1: Input: dax walm wif walm   ->   Output: green green green red red red
Example 2: Input: dax wif zup dax   ->   Output: green red yellow green

Based on these rules, it seems that the meaning of ""dax"" is specifically related to different colors.
wif -> color. The color of ""wif"" seems to depend on the other words in the input. Based on the given examples, the following rule can be deduced:

- If ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", then the color of ""wif"" is red.
- If ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", then the color of ""wif"" is green.

Note that in the last two examples, the color of ""wif"" is determined by the context of the surrounding words. It is possible that the meaning of ""wif"" can vary depending on different contexts, but based on the given examples, it seems to be based on the neighboring words.
zup -> meaning. The meaning of ""zup"" appears to correspond to different colors in different contexts. In the first example, ""zup"" is associated with the colors red, green, and yellow. In the second example, ""zup"" is associated with the colors red, red, and yellow. In the third example, the presence of ""zup"" is associated with the colors yellow, yellow, yellow, blue, yellow, red, and green. In the fourth example, ""zup"" is associated with the colors yellow and red. In the fifth example, ""zup"" is associated with the colors red and yellow. Therefore, based on the examples, it can be deduced that the meaning of ""zup"" is associated with colors.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: Lug seems to be associated with colors. Based on the examples, lug is consistently mapped to a specific color or a sequence of colors.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" in the given examples seems to represent different colors. The first example suggests that ""dax"" represents the color green, as it appears in between the words ""lug"" and ""bluf"" which correspond to blue and green respectively. Similarly, in the second example, ""dax"" appears between ""lug"" and ""zup"" representing blue and yellow respectively, indicating that ""dax"" also represents the color green. In the third example, ""dax"" appears between ""bluf"" and ""lug"", both referring to the color blue, suggesting again that ""dax"" represents the color green. The fourth and fifth examples further confirm this pattern, with ""dax"" appearing after ""lug"" and ""walm"", both associated with green and yellow respectively, indicating that ""dax"" represents the color green.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" in each example seems to correspond to a specific color. In the first example, ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red."" In the second example, ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red."" From these two examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" means the color red. However, in the third example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" indicating that it could also mean the color blue. Similarly, in the fourth example, ""lug zup dax wif,"" ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax,"" suggesting that ""wif"" might correspond to the color green. Lastly, in the fifth example, ""lug dax walm wif,"" ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" further reinforcing that ""wif"" means green. Therefore, the general rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds to a color, with the specific color depending on the context.
zup -> yellow. Rule: zup translates to the color yellow in the given context.

bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to colors in the given examples. The following rules can be observed:

Rule 1: When ""bluf"" appears after a single word, the output is a repetition of the color of that word. For example, ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"" where ""yellow"" is the color of ""zup"". Therefore, bluf -> the color of the preceding word.

Rule 2: When ""bluf"" appears after multiple words, the output consists of the colors of those words repeated in the same order. For example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"" where ""zup"" is represented as ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is represented as ""blue"". Therefore, bluf -> the colors of the preceding words, in order.

Rule 3: In some cases, the color associated with ""bluf"" may vary depending on the context. For example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red"" where ""bluf"" is represented as ""red"". In this case, the color of ""bluf"" seems to be determined by the presence of certain other words. Therefore, the specific meaning of ""bluf"" may depend on the composition of the preceding words.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to represent different colors in different contexts. Based on the examples provided, the following mapping between ""lug"" and colors can be inferred:

lug -> blue
lug -> green
lug -> yellow
lug -> red

It appears that ""lug"" can represent any color, depending on the context or sentence it appears in.
dax -> color

Meaning: Dax seems to represent different colors based on its position in the examples. In the first example, ""lug dax"" is translated to ""blue green,"" where ""dax"" is green. In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug"" is translated to ""green green green yellow blue,"" where ""dax"" is green again. In the fifth example, ""dax lug wif lug"" is translated to ""green blue red blue,"" where ""dax"" is green once more.

Based on these examples, it appears that ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
wif -> color. The color associated with ""wif"" can vary depending on the context, but it seems to consistently represent a color. The following rules can be observed:

1. If ""wif"" is surrounded by other words, the color associated with ""wif"" is the same as the color associated with the word before it.
e.g., ""wif lug wif"" => ""red blue red""

2. If ""wif"" is the only word in the input, it is associated with the color red.
e.g., ""wif"" => ""red""

3. If ""wif"" appears at the end of a sequence of words, the color associated with ""wif"" is the same as the color associated with the word before the second-to-last word.
e.g., ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" => ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red""

These rules may suggest that ""wif"" is used to maintain consistency in color patterns or as a marker for color assignments. However, without more examples or information, it is difficult to determine a definitive meaning for ""wif.""
zup -> yellow or green. 

Rule: In the given context, the word ""zup"" can be interpreted as either ""yellow"" or ""green"".
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors depending on the context. In the given examples, ""bluf"" maps to the colors green, blue, and red, with the possibility of having other colors as well. The color assigned to ""bluf"" seems to be determined by the words that appear before or after it. For example, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""lug,"" it represents the color green. When it is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""zup,"" it represents the color blue. When it is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""luf,"" it represents the color red. Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be considered a color, specifically determined by its context.
walm -> color. 

Meaning: walm represents different colors depending on its surrounding words. It appears that walm corresponds to the colors red, yellow, blue, or green, with each color being repeated three times.

    Rules:
lug -> color
Meaning:

The word ""lug"" seems to indicate a color. Based on the examples given, ""lug"" is associated with different colors in different contexts. In the first example, ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" could mean the color red. In the second example, ""wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""red blue red,"" reinforcing the association with the color red. Similarly, in the fourth example, ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow,"" suggesting that ""lug"" could also mean the color blue. Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue red,"" indicating that ""lug"" can have different meanings depending on the context and its neighboring words.

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" seems to be that it represents a color, with the specific color being determined by the context in which it appears.

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" in the given examples consistently represents a color. Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" can represent different colors in different contexts. Here are the possible rules I have observed:

1. If ""bluf"" appears alone or at the end of a sequence, it represents the color blue.
   Example: Input: lug bluf Output: blue blue

2. If ""bluf"" appears in between words, the color associated with it depends on the surrounding context.
   Example 1: Input: lug bluf wif Output: blue blue red
   In this example, ""bluf"" represents blue, as it appears between the words ""lug"" and ""wif"". 

   Example 2: Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   In this example, ""bluf"" represents red, as it appears between the words ""wif"" and ""dax"".

3. The exact colors associated with ""bluf"" in different contexts are determined by other words in the sequence.
   Example: Input: zup bluf lug dax lug Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
   In this example, ""bluf"" represents blue, but the color is determined by the surrounding words ""lug dax lug"", indicating a sequence of blue-green-blue.

Based on the examples and these observed rules, the meaning of ""bluf"" is a color that can vary depending on the context.

Meaning: The word ""wif"" is associated with colors. In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by two occurrences of the word ""bluf"", which corresponds to yellow in the output. In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"", which corresponds to blue in the output. Similarly, in the fourth and fifth examples, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and ""lug"" respectively, both resulting in the color red (red is repeated in the output for clarity). In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and ""zup lug"", which results in a combination of green, green, red, yellow, and blue in the output. Based on these examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to different colors depending on the context.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears, it is associated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color. The color associated with ""bluf"" depends on the words that come before it in the input sequence. The following rule can be observed from the examples:

If the word ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" in the input sequence, then ""bluf"" represents the color yellow.

If the word ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" in the input sequence, then ""bluf"" represents the color red.

If the word ""bluf"" is preceded by ""walm"" in the input sequence, then ""bluf"" represents the color blue.

If ""bluf"" appears multiple times in the input sequence, each occurrence of ""bluf"" follows the color rule based on the preceding word.

Therefore, the rule could be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> color (yellow, red, blue) depending on the preceding word.
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" seems to be associated with colors. In all the examples, ""walm"" is followed by a series of colors. The output for each example consists of the colors following ""walm"". Therefore, it can be deduced that ""walm"" is a word used to represent or indicate colors.

Meaning: lug represents a color. Based on the examples, the color associated with the word ""lug"" can vary. It can represent the colors yellow, blue, red, or green depending on the context.
dax -> color

Meaning: Dax represents different colors in the given examples, specifically yellow, green, and red. It seems to follow a pattern where it corresponds to a specific color in each example.
Rule: wif -> color

Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" is associated with colors. Specifically, in each example the color associated with ""wif"" is consistently assigned to the word that comes immediately after ""wif"" in the input. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" in this context is that it represents a color.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors in the given examples. The color assigned to ""bluf"" can vary in each context, but it appears to follow a consistent pattern. 

Rule: The color represented by ""bluf"" is determined by the position of ""bluf"" within the sentence. The color assigned to ""bluf"" is derived from the order of appearance of the previous words in the sentence. The exact color assigned is not mentioned, so it can be any color.

For example, in the first input:
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

The word ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and ""wif"". Both ""zup"" and ""wif"" are associated with the color ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" is also assigned the color ""yellow"".

Similarly, in the second input:
Input: wif lug bluf
Output: red blue blue

The word ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and ""wif"". ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue"", and ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"". Therefore, ""bluf"" is assigned the color ""blue"".

Based on these examples, the specific color assigned to ""bluf"" may depend on the specific order or combination of previous words, and additional examples would be needed to determine the exact rules for assigning colors to ""bluf"" in different contexts.
walm -> color

Meaning: The word ""walm"" seems to represent different colors based on its position in the sequence. It can represent the colors green, red, blue, or yellow depending on its context.

Rule:
1. If ""walm"" is the first word in the sequence, it represents the color green.
2. If ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence, it represents the color red.
3. If ""walm"" is the third word in the sequence, it represents the color blue.
4. If ""walm"" is the fourth or subsequent word in the sequence, it represents the color yellow.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: The word lug in the given examples refers to colors. The color associated with ""lug"" seems to be determined by its position in the sequence of words. 

Rule: The color associated with ""lug"" can be determined by its position in the sequence of words:
- If ""lug"" is the first word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color blue.
- If ""lug"" is in the middle or at the end of the sequence, it corresponds to another color:
  - If it is the second word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color red.
  - If it is the third word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color yellow.
  - If it is the fourth word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color green.
dax -> color sequence. The word ""dax"" seems to represent a sequence of colors. Based on the examples provided, the following rule can be derived:
- If ""dax"" appears alone, it represents the color green.
- If ""dax"" appears in a sequence with other words, it represents the next color in the sequence. The colors in the sequence are determined by the order of appearance in previous examples: yellow, red, blue, green.
wif -> color

Meaning: The word ""wif"" seems to represent different colors based on its context. In the given examples, the color mapping is as follows:

- ""wif zup"" -> red yellow
- ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> blue blue blue red yellow red
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""wif dax zup dax"" -> red green yellow green

Based on these examples, we can infer that ""wif"" appears to map to the colors mentioned in the output. The colors assigned to ""wif"" are not consistent across all examples, suggesting that there might be different rules or associations for ""wif"" depending on the context.
zup -> color coding based on the following rules:
1. If zup appears alone, it means ""yellow"".
2. If zup is followed by another word, the color coding of the other word is repeated for each letter in zup.
3. The color coding is as follows: walm -> red, lug -> blue, dax -> green.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf seems to represent different colors based on its position within the sentence. The color sequence appears to be green, red, yellow, blue in the order of appearance. However, it's a hypothetical assumption based on the limited examples provided.
walm -> color. The color associated with ""walm"" seems to vary depending on the position of ""walm"" in the sequence. Based on the examples, the color associated with ""walm"" can be determined as follows:

- If ""walm"" is the first word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color red.
- If ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color green.
- If ""walm"" is the third word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color blue.
- If ""walm"" is the fourth word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color yellow.

Therefore, the rule for determining the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is position-dependent color assignment.

lug -> blue

Meaning: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" appears to be related to colors. In all the examples given, ""dax"" is associated with a specific color:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- In the second example, ""dax"" again corresponds to the color green.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and it is followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and it is followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""zup"" again corresponds to yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and it is followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" corresponds to red as well.

Based on these examples, the rule deduction can be summarized as follows:

- When ""dax"" appears alone, it corresponds to the color green.
- When ""dax"" is followed by another word, the color associated with that word corresponds to the next color in the sequence, which seems to be green, yellow, red, and potentially repeating.

Rule: dax -> color (green in all the examples)

dax -> color

Meaning: dax represents a color in the given context. The color referred to by dax changes depending on the words around it. Here is an analysis of the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by no other word. The corresponding output is ""red green"". Since ""wif"" is related to ""red"", we can infer that ""dax"" represents the color ""green"".

- In the second example, ""dax"" is both preceded and followed by another word. The corresponding output is ""green yellow green"". Based on this pattern, we deduce that ""dax"" represents the color ""yellow"".

- In the third example, ""dax"" is only followed by another word. The corresponding output is ""yellow green blue"". Here, we notice that the color represented by ""dax"" changes from ""yellow"" to ""green"" to ""blue"".

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is only preceded by another word. The corresponding output is ""blue blue blue green"". Similar to the previous example, the color represented by ""dax"" changes from ""blue"" to ""green"".

- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"". The corresponding output is ""yellow yellow red green blue"". Based on this pattern, we can infer that ""dax"" represents the color ""red"" in this case.

Therefore, the general rule we can deduce is that ""dax"" represents a color and its exact meaning depends on the context, specifically the words that precede and/or follow it.

Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to serve as a color code for the words that follow it. In each example, the words that come after ""lug"" are assigned a specific color. The color coding consists of the following rules:

1. The first word after ""lug"" is coded as blue.
2. Any subsequent words after the first one are coded as red.
3. The colors assigned to the words remain consistent within each example.

Rule:
1. If ""lug"" is followed by one or more words, the first word is assigned the color blue, and any subsequent words are assigned the color red.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to be associated with different colors based on the context. In the provided examples, ""dax"" is associated with the colors green, blue, and yellow. Therefore, the general rule could be that ""dax"" represents a color.
wif -> color (yellow, red, blue, green)
zup -> color. The word ""zup"" seems to represent colors, with ""blue"", ""green"", and ""yellow"" appearing in the outputs.
bluf -> color

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to represent a color. It is always associated with specific color words such as blue, red, yellow, and green. Therefore, based on the examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" is used as a placeholder for various colors in the context.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> color 

In this context, ""walm"" seems to represent different colors based on its position in the input. The mapping between ""walm"" and colors is as follows:

- First occurrence of ""walm"" in the input: green
- Second occurrence of ""walm"" in the input: yellow
- Third occurrence of ""walm"" in the input: red
- Fourth occurrence of ""walm"" in the input: blue

It is important to note that this conclusion is based solely on the examples provided and may not hold true in a broader context.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: lug refers to colors. It seems like each occurrence of lug corresponds to a different color.
dax -> color. The color associated with the word ""dax"" depends on its position in the input sequence. The first occurrence of ""dax"" is associated with the color green, the second occurrence is associated with yellow, and the third occurrence is associated with blue.
wif -> color code. The word ""wif"" seems to be related to colors, with different combinations of ""wif"" in the input producing different colors in the output. The specific mapping of ""wif"" to colors is as follows:
- ""wif"" with ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" with ""lug"" translates to ""red""
- ""wif"" with ""walm"" translates to ""red""
- ""wif"" with ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" alone translates to ""red""

Based on these examples, it appears that the presence of ""wif"" determines the color of the output, with different words following ""wif"" resulting in different colors.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: In the given examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents different colors based on the context.

Rule: The color represented by bluf depends on the words that appear before it in the sentence:

dax -> yellow
dax -> green
dax -> blue
dax -> red

Therefore, the general rule could be: dax represents a color, with each occurrence of ""dax"" representing a different color. However, without more examples or context, it is difficult to determine the exact meaning of ""dax"" beyond its association with colors.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" seems to be related to colors based on the provided examples. The color seems to be determined by the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence. If ""wif"" is the first word, it maps to the color red. If it is the second word, it maps to the color green. If it is the third word, it maps to the color blue. If it is the fourth word, it maps to the color yellow. Therefore, the general rule can be stated as: ""The color associated with 'wif' is determined by its position in the input sequence.""
zup -> yellow

Meaning: In the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> position in the sentence

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent the position of the word in the sentence. The examples show that the first occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to the first word, the second occurrence corresponds to the second word, and so on. This suggests that ""bluf"" represents the position in the sentence, starting from the first word being red, the second word being yellow, the third word being green, and so on.

Meaning: dax seems to represent different colors in different contexts. It can be interpreted as yellow, green, red, or blue depending on the surrounding words.
wif -> red

Meaning: In the given examples, the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
zup -> color. The meaning of ""zup"" in all the examples appears to be associated with colors. In each example, the color mentioned after ""zup"" in the output corresponds to the position of ""zup"" in the input. For example, in the first example ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"" where ""yellow"" corresponds to the first position and ""blue"" corresponds to the second position. This pattern holds true for all the examples, indicating that ""zup"" is associated with colors and its meaning is determined by its position in the input.
bluf -> color sequence based on position

Rule: bluf represents a sequence of colors where each position corresponds to a specific word in the input. The color sequence can be determined as follows:

- The first word in the input corresponds to the first color in the sequence.
- The second word in the input corresponds to the second color in the sequence.
- The third word in the input corresponds to the third color in the sequence.
- And so on...

For example, in the first input, ""zup bluf dax lug"", the position of ""bluf"" is 2. Therefore, the second color in the sequence is ""yellow"". Similarly, in the second input, ""zup dax bluf"", since ""bluf"" is the third word, the third color in the sequence is ""green"".

So, bluf can be understood as a placeholder that represents a color sequence based on the position of the words in the input.
walm -> color. The color represented by the word ""walm"" is determined by the colors of the preceding words in the sentence. The color mappings appear to be as follows:
- ""lug"" -> blue
