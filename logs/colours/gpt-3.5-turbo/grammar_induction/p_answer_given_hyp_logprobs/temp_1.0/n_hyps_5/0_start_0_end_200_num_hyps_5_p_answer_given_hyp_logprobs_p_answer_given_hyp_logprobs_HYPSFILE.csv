The order of appearance of ""wif"" in the sentence corresponds to the order of the colors in the output.",-9.10108409114,52,wif
"wif -> color

Meaning: The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to different colors in each example. The color assigned to ""wif"" varies depending on the words preceding and following it. Based on the given examples, it is difficult to determine a strict rule for assigning colors to ""wif"". However, we can observe some patterns:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" is assigned the color red.
2. In the second example, ""wif"" is assigned the color green when preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""lug"".
3. In the third example, ""wif"" is assigned the color blue when preceded and followed by ""dax"".
4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" is assigned the color red when preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug"".
5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" is assigned the color blue when followed by ""lug"" after ""dax"".

Based on these patterns, it appears that the meaning of the word ""wif"" is tied to the presence of other words in the sentence, and its assigned color may depend on specific combinations of these words. More examples would be needed to determine a more general rule for assigning colors to ""wif"".",-9.39964360934,52,wif

Explanation:
From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is associated with different color combinations.

Based on the examples, we can infer the following color combinations associated with ""bluf"":
- ""bluf"" followed by ""zup"" results in a color combination of ""yellow red red yellow.""
- ""bluf"" without any other words yields a color combination of ""yellow red red.""
- ""bluf"" preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""walm"" results in a color combination of ""green green green red red.""
- ""bluf"" surrounded by other words such as ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" yields a color combination of ""red red green green red red red blue red.""

Rule 2: If ""wif"" appears before another word, the word that follows represents a color that is associated with the previous word.
   - Example: Input: wif lug

     - In this example, ""wif"" is associated with the color red, so ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
   
Rule 3: If ""wif"" appears after another word, the previous word represents a color that is associated with ""wif"".
   - Example: Input: dax wif
              Output: green red
     - In this example, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, so ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
     
Rule 4: If ""wif"" appears multiple times in a sentence, each occurrence follows the same color pattern as Rule 3 for the previous word.
   - Example: Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
              Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
     - In this example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, so the first occurrence of ""wif"" is associated with blue. Then, ""walm"" is associated with the color blue, so the second occurrence of ""wif"" is also associated with blue.

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" appears to represent different colors based on the context. From the examples, we can deduce the following rules:

Rule 1: If the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" represents the color green.

Rule 2: If the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" represents the color blue.

Rule 3: If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" and there is a word after ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" represents the color red.

"wif -> color combination

Based on the examples given, it appears that the ""wif"" is associated with color combinations. Here is the rule:

Rule: The color combination represented by ""wif"" consists of a sequence of colors, where each color corresponds to a different word in the input sentence. The order of the colors in the ""wif"" output matches the order of the words in the input sentence.

For example, in the first example ""wif zup"", the output is ""red yellow"", which suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""red"" corresponds to the unknown word ""wif."" Similarly, in the second example ""wif bluf dax walm"", the output is ""red red green green green"", meaning that ""bluf"" corresponds to two consecutive ""red"" colors, ""dax"" corresponds to a ""green"" color, and ""walm"" corresponds to three consecutive ""green"" colors.

Based on this rule, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" in the other examples:

- Input: wif bluf lug
  Output: red red blue
  This implies that ""bluf"" corresponds to two consecutive ""red"" colors, and ""lug"" corresponds to a ""blue"" color.

- Input: dax wif lug
  Output: green red blue
  This implies that ""dax"" corresponds to a ""green"" color, and ""lug"" corresponds to a ""blue"" color.

- Input: wif lug bluf
