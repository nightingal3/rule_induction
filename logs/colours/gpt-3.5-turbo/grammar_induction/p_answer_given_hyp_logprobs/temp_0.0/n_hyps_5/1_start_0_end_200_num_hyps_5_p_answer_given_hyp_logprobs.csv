    Rules:
lug -> color representation.

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" is used to represent different colors. Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The color representation is consistent throughout the examples, where ""blue"" is represented by ""lug"", ""yellow"" by ""zup"", ""green"" by ""dax"", and ""red"" by ""wif"".
dax -> color

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to be synonymous with the color green.
wif -> color
Meaning: wif represents a color, where red corresponds to ""wif"" and blue corresponds to ""lug"".
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever zup is present in the input, it should be translated to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to represent colors. Each occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by a color word (e.g., blue, red, green, yellow) in the output. Therefore, it can be inferred that ""bluf"" represents a color.
walm -> color sequence

Based on the examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" represents a sequence of colors. Each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of colors. The colors correspond to the position of the word ""walm"" in the input. 

For instance, in the first example, the input is ""dax walm lug"" and the output is ""green green green blue"". The word ""walm"" appears in the second position, so there are three occurrences of the color ""green"" before it, followed by the color ""blue"". Similarly, in the second example, ""walm"" appears in the third position, so there are three occurrences of ""green"", followed by two occurrences of ""red"", and one occurrence of ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as follows:

walm -> color sequence

Where each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of colors based on its position in the input.

dax -> color. Rule: dax represents the color green.
wif -> color combination. The color combination seems to be determined by the words that come before and after ""wif"". Based on the examples, ""wif"" is followed by one or more colors, and the resulting output is a combination of those colors. Additionally, the order of the colors seems to be important as changing their order results in a different output.
zup -> color in the context of a sequence. The color seems to be determined by the position of the word ""zup"" in the sequence. In the first example, ""zup"" is at the beginning and the end of the sequence, which results in the colors ""yellow"" and ""red"". In the second and fourth examples, ""zup"" is in the middle of the sequence, resulting in the color ""yellow"". In the third example, ""zup"" is at the beginning of the sequence, resulting in the color ""yellow"". In the fifth example, ""zup"" is at the end of the sequence, resulting in the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> color sequence

Meaning:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" is a token that represents a specific color sequence. The color sequence varies depending on the context but follows a pattern. The first occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue, the second occurrence corresponds to the color yellow, the third occurrence corresponds to the color green, and so on.

Rule:
bluf(n) -> color_sequence(n)
Where n represents the position or occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input. The color_sequence(n) follows the pattern:
- n = 1: blue
- n = 2: yellow
- n = 3: green
- n = 4: blue
- n = 5: yellow
- n = 6: green
- and so on

dax -> color. Rule: The meaning of dax corresponds to different colors depending on its position in the sentence.
wif -> color

Rule: The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to colors. In each example, ""wif"" is followed by a noun (zup, bluf, dax, or lug) and the corresponding output is a color (red, yellow, green, or blue). Therefore, it can be deduced that ""wif"" is a placeholder for a color.
zup -> color, where ""color"" is determined by the combination of other words in the input. 

From the examples given, it can be observed that the word ""zup"" is always associated with colors. The output seems to be determined by the colors of the other words in the input. 

In the first two examples, ""zup"" is associated with the colors ""yellow"" and ""red"" or ""green"", respectively, depending on the other word in the input. In the third example, the colors associated with ""zup"" are determined by the colors of the other words: ""green green green red yellow"". In the fourth example, ""zup"" takes on the colors of the other words: ""yellow yellow yellow red"". In the fifth example, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" twice, likely because ""bluf"" does not have a specific color mentioned.

Based on these examples, the rule can be stated as: ""zup"" takes on the color(s) of the other word(s) in the input, or ""zup"" represents the color(s) mentioned in the input.
bluf -> color code

Meaning: bluf appears to represent a color code based on the given examples. It is associated with different colors, such as red, yellow, and green. 

Rule: bluf is followed by a color code that corresponds to a particular color. The color codes seem to be consistent across examples, where red corresponds to ""wif,"" green corresponds to ""dax,"" and yellow corresponds to ""zup"" and ""lug.""

Meaning: bluf represents different colors based on its context. Here are the rules deduced from the examples:

Rule 1: If bluf appears alone, it represents the color blue.
Example: Input: wif bluf -> Output: red blue

Rule 2: If bluf appears after any word that represents a color, then bluf represents the color blue as well.
Example: Input: dax bluf wif lug -> Output: green green red blue

Rule 3: If bluf appears before any word that represents a color, then bluf represents the color in reverse order.
Example: Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue yellow red red green

Rule 4: If bluf appears between two words that represent colors, then the color represented by bluf is the third color in the sequence.
Example: Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue

Based on these observations, we can conclude that bluf is a nonce word used to represent different colors in a sequence.
walm -> color
Meaning: ""walm"" represents a color. The color is determined by the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. The first occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to green, the second occurrence corresponds to blue, the third occurrence corresponds to yellow, and so on.

Meaning: lug is a word used to represent different colors, namely, green and blue.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" in the given examples seems to be associated with colors. In the examples, ""dax"" is consistently followed by a color word, such as ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" (green), and ""wif"" (red). Therefore, it is likely that ""dax"" represents a color itself.
wif -> color mapping. The word ""wif"" appears to be associated with a color. The color mapping can be described as follows:
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""bluf"" -> green
- ""dax"" -> yellow
- ""walm"" -> red

The mapping may not always be consistent between examples, as seen in the last example where ""wif"" is mapped to red instead of blue. However, based on the given examples, we can infer the color mapping for ""wif"".
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is present, the output color is ""yellow"".
bluf -> color (green, yellow, or red) based on the presence of other words in the sequence. Rule: 
1. If the word ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""zup"", the color is yellow.

In the second example, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" twice and ""yellow"" once. In the third example, ""dax"" is only associated with ""green"". In the fourth example, ""dax"" is again associated with ""green"" twice and with ""red"" and ""yellow"" once each. In the fifth example, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""yellow"". It appears that ""dax"" can represent different colors, but without more examples, it is not possible to determine a definite mapping of ""dax"" to specific colors. So, the general rule can be stated as dax -> color, where the specific color assigned to ""dax"" may vary based on the context.
wif -> color

Rule: wif corresponds to a color. The color is determined based on the order of appearance in the input sequence, where each color is associated with a specific word.

   - Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   
2. When ""lug"" is in the middle of the sequence:
   - Input: lug zup
   - Output: blue yellow

3. When ""lug"" is at the end of the sequence:
   - Input: wif lug
   - Output: red blue

4. When ""lug"" is surrounded by other words:
   - Input: lug dax zup
   - Output: blue green yellow

5. When ""lug"" is in a different position in the sequence:

Rule: The color sequence represented by ""bluf"" is determined by the order of appearance of colors in the input. ""bluf"" assigns a specific color to each word in the input, starting from the first word encountered in the sequence.

Example:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" assigns the color sequence as follows: ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow, resulting in the output ""red blue yellow yellow"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" assigns the color sequence as follows: ""dax"" -> green, resulting in the output ""green green"".

Based on these examples, we can see that the color sequence assigned by ""bluf"" remains consistent throughout the input, and each word is assigned a color based on its position in the sequence.

2. lug -> blue
3. lug -> green
4. lug -> red

It appears that the specific meaning of lug depends on the context in which it is used. In the examples, lug is always associated with a color, but the specific color changes depending on the context. For example, in the first example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, but in the last example, it is associated with the color green. The meaning of lug can be determined based on the colors that are mentioned in the same sentence as lug.
dax -> color
Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to represent a color. Based on the examples, it represents various colors such as green, blue, red, and yellow.
wif -> color

Meaning: The word ""wif"" appears to represent different colors based on the given examples. The colors associated with ""wif"" are determined by the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence. 

Rule:
- If ""wif"" is the first word in the input sequence, it represents the color red.
- If ""wif"" is the second word in the input sequence, it represents the color yellow.
- If ""wif"" is the third word in the input sequence, it represents the color green.
- If ""wif"" appears in other positions in the sequence, it represents the color blue.
zup -> yellow

Based on the examples given, it can be deduced that the word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning:
The word ""bluf"" seems to represent a color based on the provided examples. The following rules can be deduced:

Rule 1: If ""bluf"" appears after a single word, the output is the same color as the previous word (e.g., ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"").
Rule 2: If ""bluf"" appears after two words, the output is the same color as the first word followed by ""red"" (e.g., ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red"").
Rule 3: If ""bluf"" appears after a single word and there is an additional word after it, the output is the same color as the previous word followed by ""blue"" (e.g., ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue"").
Rule 4: If ""bluf"" appears by itself, the output is ""yellow yellow"" (e.g., ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"").

These rules allow us to understand the meaning of ""bluf"" as representing a color in the given context.
walm -> color sequence

Rule: 
The word ""walm"" seems to represent a sequence of colors. Each occurrence of ""walm"" in the examples is followed by a series of colors. The number and order of the colors in the sequence match the number and order of the words following ""walm"".

For example, in the input ""lug dax walm"", ""walm"" is followed by one color word, ""green"", so the output is ""green green green green"". Similarly, in ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"", ""walm"" is followed by three color words, so the output is ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"".

Based on these examples, it can be deduced that ""walm"" represents a repeating sequence of colors, with the number and order of colors determined by the context in which ""walm"" appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: In the given context, lug refers to the color blue.
dax -> color

Meaning: ""dax"" seems to refer to different colors depending on its position in the sentence. When ""dax"" comes before another word, it signifies the color green. When ""dax"" comes after another word, it signifies the color blue. There may be potential exceptions or other contextual rules, but based on the given examples, this seems to be the general pattern.
wif -> red. Rule: wif is a placeholder for the color red.
zup -> color
Meaning: The word ""zup"" in the given examples is associated with different colors. The color associated with ""zup"" depends on the other words in the input. The following rules can be deduced from the examples:

1. If ""zup"" is the only word in the input, it represents the color yellow.
2. If ""zup"" is followed by the word ""wif"" in the input, it represents the color red.
3. If ""zup"" is followed by the word ""lug"" in the input, it represents the color blue.
4. If ""zup"" is preceded by the word ""lug"" in the input, it represents the color yellow.
5. If ""zup"" is preceded by the word ""dax"" and followed by another occurrence of ""dax"" in the input, it represents the color green.

These rules suggest that the meaning of ""zup"" is a color, and the particular color is determined by the context in which it is used.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf seems to represent different colors based on the examples provided. The color representation is as follows:

- bluf = yellow
- bluf = red
- bluf = green
- bluf = blue

Rule: There is no clear rule based on the given examples. However, it can be deduced that bluf is a unique representation for different colors, and the mapping between bluf and the color is inconsistent and arbitrary.
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" seems to represent a color. Based on the examples, the color assigned to ""walm"" varies depending on the context. For example, in the first example, ""walm"" is associated with the color yellow, while in the second example it is associated with the color green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Meaning: The word ""dax"" appears to represent colors in the given examples. Based on the examples, the rule for determining the meaning of ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color mentioned in the same position in the input sequence.

For example, in the first example, ""dax"" appears in the first position of the input sequence, which corresponds to the first color in the output sequence (""green""). In the third example, ""dax"" appears in the second position of the input sequence, which corresponds to the second color in the output sequence (""blue""). This pattern holds true for all the provided examples.
wif -> color

Rule: The word ""wif"" represents the color assigned to it in each example.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" always translates to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" represents a color. The color associated with ""bluf"" can vary based on the context provided in the examples. The following pattern can be observed from the examples:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"".
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"".
4. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"".

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be understood as representing a color that depends on the preceding word in the input.
walm -> color
Meaning: The word ""walm"" represents colors, specifically red, green, blue, and yellow. The output patterns in the examples suggest that ""walm"" is used to represent different colors in a sequence.

- If the following word is ""zup"", the color of ""dax"" is red.
- If the following word is ""lug"", the color of ""dax"" is green.
- If the following word is ""bluf"", the color of ""dax"" is green.
- If the following word is ""wif"", the color of ""dax"" is red.

If there are multiple ""dax"" words in the input, the colors associated with them are determined independently based on the words following each occurrence of ""dax"".
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to represent different colors based on the examples provided. The color association is as follows:
- red: wif appears with ""lug"" or ""bluf""
- blue: wif appears after ""lug"" or before ""lug""
- yellow: wif appears after ""zup""
- green: wif appears with ""dax"" or after ""dax"" or with ""walm""

dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors in different contexts. In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with the color blue. In the second example, it is associated with the color green. From these examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" represents different colors depending on its position in the sentence or the words surrounding it.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to be associated with different colors based on the context of the sentence. Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule: 

If ""wif"" is preceded by another word, then the meaning of ""wif"" is determined by that word. In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, so ""wif"" also corresponds to green. In the second example, ""bluf"" is associated with red, so ""wif"" becomes red. Similarly, in the third example, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, so ""wif"" corresponds to yellow. 

However, if ""wif"" appears alone without any preceding word, then its meaning is red. This is evident from the fourth and fifth examples, where ""wif"" is not preceded by any other word and is consistently associated with the color red.
zup -> yellow. 

Meaning: In all the examples, when the word ""zup"" is present, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"". This suggests that ""zup"" is being used as a placeholder for the color yellow.
bluf -> color.

From the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" is being used to represent colors. Each color corresponds to a specific word, and the order in which the colors are mentioned is significant. Here are the rules:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. dax wif bluf -> green red red
5. wif bluf -> red red

Based on these examples, we can conclude that ""bluf"" is a way to represent colors, and the corresponding colors are: green, yellow, and red. The order of the colors is preserved, with multiple instances of a color indicated by repeating the respective color word.

Meaning: The word ""lug"" is associated with colors. Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The color mapping seems to follow a consistent pattern, with ""blue"" corresponding to the first occurrence of ""lug"", ""yellow"" corresponding to the second occurrence, ""red"" corresponding to the third occurrence, and ""green"" corresponding to the fourth occurrence.
dax -> color. Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" refers to different colors in different contexts. Here is the rule that can be deduced from the examples:

Rule: When ""dax"" appears:
- After another word, it refers to the color green.
- Before another word, it refers to the color yellow.

This rule seems to hold true for all given examples, where ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the colors green and yellow depending on its position in the sequence of words.
wif -> color

Meaning: wif represents different colors based on the context. The specific mapping of wif to each color is as follows:
- wif dax -> red green
- wif zup -> red yellow
- wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
- dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
- wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

Therefore, it seems that wif can represent any combination of colors, with each color mapped to a specific position in the output. The positions are determined by the order of appearance in the input string.
zup -> color, where ""color"" refers to a specific color based on the context. 

Rule: The position of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the color in the output. For example, if ""zup"" is the first word in the input, the output is ""yellow."" If ""zup"" is the second word in the input, the output is ""blue,"" and if ""zup"" is the third word in the input, the output is ""green.""
bluf -> color. 

Based on the examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with colors. The color mentioned before ""bluf"" determines the color that ""bluf"" represents. The color associations are as follows:

- yellow: bluf appears after the word ""zup""
- red: bluf appears after the word ""wif""
- green: bluf appears after the word ""dax""
- blue: bluf appears after the word ""lug""

So, the rule can be defined as follows:
- If bluf follows zup, it means yellow.
- If bluf follows wif, it means red.
- If bluf follows dax, it means green.
- If bluf follows lug, it means blue.
walm -> color

Meaning: walm represents a color. Based on the examples provided, it seems that walm is used to indicate a specific color, with different colors being represented by different repetitions of walm in the output. For example, ""wif walm"" maps to ""red red red"", ""dax walm"" maps to ""green green green"", and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

    Rules:
lug -> color of an object

Meaning: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently appears in the middle of a sequence of other words. The colors mentioned in the outputs provide a clue that ""lug"" is associated with the color of an object. The mapping seems to be as follows:
- ""lug"" is mapped to ""red"" when it appears between two occurrences of ""wif""
- ""lug"" is mapped to ""green"" when it appears between a ""dax"" and a ""bluf""
- ""lug"" is mapped to ""blue"" when it appears after a ""walm""

Rule: The meaning of ""lug"" depends on its position relative to other words in the sequence. It is associated with a specific color based on the context of its surroundings.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" seems to be related to colors in the context of the examples provided. Specifically, ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color green.
wif -> follows the pattern of being assigned the color ""green"" in the output.
zup -> color
Meaning: The word ""zup"" represents different colors based on its context in the sentence. The color can be determined by observing the words before and after ""zup"". 

Rule:
- If ""zup"" is preceded and followed by the same word, it represents the color yellow.
- If ""zup"" is preceded by a different word and followed by the same word, it represents the color blue.
- If ""zup"" is preceded and followed by different words, it represents the color green.
- If ""zup"" appears alone, it represents the color yellow.
bluf -> color. Rule: 

- When the word bluf is preceded by the word wif, it means red.
- When the word bluf is preceded by the word wif and zup, it means yellow.
- When the word bluf is preceded by any other word, it means blue.
- The color meaning of bluf can be combined with the color meanings of other words in a sentence.
walm -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is consistently associated with the color yellow. Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of ""walm"" is ""yellow"".

    Rules:
lug -> color.

Rule: In the given context, the word ""lug"" seems to be representing different colors. Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" is mapped to different colors such as green, blue, red, and yellow. Therefore, it can be concluded that ""lug"" is used as a placeholder for color descriptions.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" appears in each example and its meaning seems to be related to colors. In the first example, ""dax walm"" is associated with the color green. In the second example, ""dax wif zup"" is associated with the sequence of colors green, red, yellow. In the third example, ""zup dax wif"" is associated with the sequence of colors yellow, green, red. Additionally, in the fourth and fifth examples where only ""dax"" is provided, it is consistently associated with the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: wif is represented by the color red.
zup -> color

Meaning: zup seems to represent different colors based on its position in the examples. When zup is the first word, it represents the color ""yellow"". When zup is the second word, it represents the color ""blue"". When zup is the third word, it represents the color ""green"". When zup is the fourth word or later, it represents the color ""red"".
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents different colors in different contexts. The color it represents is determined by the words that come before and after it. Based on the examples, we can deduce the following rules:

1) If only one word comes before bluf, bluf represents the color red.
   Example: wif bluf -> red red

2) If bluf is repeated multiple times, it represents a combination of colors based on the words that come before and after each occurrence.
   Example: lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red

3) If bluf is the last word in a sentence or has no word after it, it represents the same color as the word before it.
   Example: wif bluf -> red red

4) If bluf is preceded by a distinct word, it represents a different color based on the distinct word.
   Example: zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red

5) Bluf can occur in a sentence with other words, and its color is determined by the words that come before and after it.
   Example: wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" appears to correspond to different colors in the given examples. It is associated with the color yellow in the first example, with the color red in the second example, and with the color green in the third and fourth examples. Therefore, the general rule seems to be that ""walm"" represents a color, with the specific color being context-dependent.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: Lug represents a color. Based on the examples given, the color associated with lug can vary and is not fixed. Instead, the color assigned to lug depends on the position of lug in the input sequence.

Rule: The color associated with lug is determined by its position in the input sequence. The mapping from lug to color can be summarized as follows:
- If lug is the first word in the input sequence, it represents the color green.
- If lug is the second word in the input sequence, it represents the color yellow.
- If lug is the third word in the input sequence, it represents the color blue.
- If lug appears in any other position in the input sequence, its color is not specified by the given examples.

It's important to note that the rule may not be complete as it is based on the limited examples provided. It's possible that additional examples may reveal more about the intended meaning of lug.
dax -> color

Meaning: dax seems to represent different colors based on the context. The rules underlying the examples suggest that:

1. Whenever dax appears alone, it represents the color green.
2. When dax appears in a sequence with other words, it represents a color associated with the position or frequency of the word in the sequence.

Based on the examples, the inferred color pattern for dax is as follows:
- dax in the first position -> red
- dax in the second position -> blue
- dax in the third position -> green
- dax in the fourth position -> yellow

These patterns may not be absolute, but they provide a reasonable interpretation based on the given examples.
wif -> color. The examples suggest that ""wif"" is being used to denote different colors. In the first example, ""wif lug -> red blue"" indicates that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", while in the second example, ""wif -> red"" suggests that ""wif"" alone can also mean ""red"". The third example, ""wif zup -> red yellow"", adds another color, ""yellow"", to the previous meaning. Therefore, the rule deduced from the given examples is that ""wif"" is used to represent colors, specifically ""red"" in isolation or ""red"" and ""blue"" in conjunction.
zup -> color. The word ""zup"" seems to be associated with colors in the given examples. In the first example, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow."" In the second example, ""zup"" is again associated with the color ""yellow."" In the third example, ""zup"" is associated with the colors ""red"" and ""yellow."" In the fourth example, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"" again. In the fifth example, ""zup"" is associated with the colors ""blue"" and ""green."" Therefore, it can be deduced that ""zup"" represents different colors in different contexts.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents a color. The color is determined by the preceding words in the input. Based on the examples given:

- When bluf follows zup, it represents the color yellow.
- When bluf follows lug, it represents the color blue.
- When bluf follows wif, it represents the color red.
- When bluf follows dax, it represents the color green.

Therefore, the meaning of bluf seems to be dependent on the preceding word and represents a color based on that context.
walm -> color

Meaning: walm represents different colors depending on the context. In the provided examples, walm is associated with the color yellow in the first example, and with the color green in the remaining examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

3. If ""wif"" appears more than twice in the input, each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

It's also worth noting that the color ""walm"" is consistently associated with the word ""wif"" in the examples. However, we cannot conclude its exact meaning since it is not used independently of ""wif.""
zup -> yellow (meaning)

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color based on the position in the sentence

Rule: The word ""bluf"" in each sentence corresponds to a color, and the assigned color depends on its position in the sentence:

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors based on the context. By analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is surrounded by other words, it represents the color of the nearest word to its left (if any). If there is no word to the left, ""bluf"" itself represents a color.

Examples:

1. ""lug bluf zup lug"" -> blue blue yellow blue:
   - The word ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""lug"" on its left and ""zup"" on its right.
   - The nearest word to its left is ""lug"", which represents the color blue. Therefore, ""bluf"" also represents the color blue.
   - The word ""bluf"" does not have any impact on the colors represented by other words.

2. ""zup dax bluf"" -> yellow green green:
   - The word ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""dax"" on its left and there is no word to its right.
   - The nearest word to its left is ""dax"", which represents the color green. Therefore, ""bluf"" also represents the color green.
   - The other words (""zup"") remain unaffected by the presence of ""bluf"".

3. ""dax bluf"" -> green green:
   - The word ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""dax"" on its left and there is no word to its right.
   - The nearest word to its left is ""dax"", which represents the color green.
   - The other words remain unaffected by the presence of ""bluf"".

4. ""wif bluf zup"" -> red red yellow:
   - The word ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""wif"" on its left and ""zup"" on its right.
   - The nearest word to its left is ""wif"", which represents the color red. Therefore, ""bluf"" also represents the color red.
   - The word ""bluf"" does not have any impact on the colors represented by other words.

5. ""wif dax bluf"" -> red green green:
   - The word ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""dax"" on its left and there is no word to its right.
   - The nearest word to its left is ""dax"", which represents the color green. Therefore, ""bluf"" also represents the color green.

Meaning: lug refers to the color blue based on the provided examples. 

Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears alone, it represents the color blue.
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to represent a color. In all the examples provided, ""dax"" is associated with either the color green or the color yellow.
It seems that there are two possible meanings for the word ""wif"" based on the examples provided:

1) wif -> red
Based on examples 2, 4, and 5, it can be deduced that when ""wif"" appears alone, it is associated with the color ""red"".

2) wif -> repeating the previous color
In examples 1 and 3, it can be observed that whenever ""wif"" appears after other words, it repeats the color that was previously mentioned. For example, in example 1, ""wif dax zup"" is associated with ""red green yellow"", where ""wif"" repeats the previous color ""red"". Similarly, in example 3, ""dax zup dax zup wif"" is associated with ""green yellow green yellow red"", where ""wif"" repeats the previous color ""yellow"". This suggests a rule where ""wif"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

So the final rules for the word ""wif"" could be:
1) wif -> red
2) wif -> repeaing previous color
zup -> yellow.

Rule: The word ""zup"" is always associated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color based on the position it occurs in the input sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word in the input sequence, it corresponds to the color green.

- blue: corresponds to the word ""lug"" appearing before or after bluf.
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" seems to be associated with colors in the given examples. In each example, the frequency of ""walm"" determines the repetition of the associated color in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: blue green blue red blue,blue green green red blue,False,197
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue in the first position, red in the second position, green in the third position
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to be associated with different colors in the given examples. The colors can vary, but ""green"" appears to be the most common associated color.
wif -> color. Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, it represents the color red.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the provided examples.
bluf -> color

Meaning:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is associated with colors. The following rules can be deduced:

1. If ""bluf"" appears after a word, it corresponds to the color blue.
   Example: ""lug bluf wif"" -> blue blue red

2. If ""bluf"" appears at the beginning of a sentence or after a punctuation mark with no preceding word, it corresponds to the color red.
   Example: ""wif bluf"" -> red red

3. If ""bluf"" appears after a repeated word, it corresponds to the color yellow.
   Example: ""wif zup bluf lug"" -> red yellow yellow blue

4. If ""bluf"" appears after a word that is not repeated, it corresponds to the color green.
   Example: ""wif dax bluf"" -> red green green

These rules may be specific to the given examples and further examples are needed to confirm the generalization.
walm -> color. Rule: In the given context, ""walm"" seems to represent the color of an object. The examples show that ""walm"" can correspond to different colors such as blue, red, green, and yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,198
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue 

Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to represent the color blue. This is evident from all the examples where ""lug"" appears as an input, as the corresponding output always contains the word ""blue."" Therefore, a possible rule could be that ""lug"" is a representation of the color blue.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors based on its position in the input sequence. It can represent the colors blue, green, red, yellow, or even a combination of these colors. The rules can be generalized as follows:

1. If ""dax"" is the first word in the sequence, it represents the color green.
2. If ""dax"" is the last word in the sequence, it represents the color blue.
3. If ""dax"" appears between two words, it represents a combination of the colors of those two words. For example, if the surrounding words are ""lug"" and ""wif"", ""dax"" represents green (combining the colors blue and red).

Overall rule:
- If ""dax"" is the first word, it represents the color green.
- If ""dax"" is the last word, it represents the color blue.
- If ""dax"" appears between two words, it represents a combination of the colors of those two words.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" seems to be related to colors, specifically the sequence of colors red, green, and blue. The rule appears to be that each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to one of these colors, starting with red and cycling through green and blue.
zup -> color

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to represent a color. Based on the outputs, it can be deduced that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf seems to be representing different colors in the given examples. Based on the patterns observed, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule:
- If bluf appears before zup, it represents the color yellow.
- If bluf appears before dax, it represents the color green.
- If bluf appears before wif, it represents the color red.

It is important to note that this understanding is solely based on the given examples and may not hold true outside of the context provided.
walm -> color code

Rule:
The word ""walm"" seems to represent a color code based on the patterns observed in the examples. It appears that each occurrence of ""walm"" is associated with a specific color in the output. The specific color assigned to ""walm"" seems to depend on the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence. 

Based on the examples provided, the color assigned to ""walm"" can be determined as follows:
- If ""walm"" is the first word in the sequence, the color assigned is red.
- If ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence, the color assigned is yellow.
- If ""walm"" is the third word in the sequence, the color assigned is green.
- If ""walm"" is the fourth word in the sequence, the color assigned is blue.

However, it should be noted that these rules may not hold true for all possible inputs, as these examples provide limited information.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green
