    Rules:
lug -> color (dependent on the position in the sequence)

Meaning:
- lug at the start of the sequence indicates green
- lug at the end of the sequence indicates blue
- lug in the middle of the sequence indicates red

Rule:
- If lug is at the start of the sequence, it signifies green.
- If lug is at the end of the sequence, it signifies blue.
- If lug is in the middle of the sequence, it signifies red.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" seems to be associated with colors. From the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" is represented by specific colors. The mapping between ""dax"" and colors is as follows:

- ""dax"" represents green in the second example.
- ""dax"" represents yellow again in the third example.
- ""dax"" represents green again in the fourth example.
- ""dax"" represents green again in the fifth example.

Hence, the rule or mapping would be:
dax -> yellow, green, yellow, green, green
wif -> refers to the color ""red""
zup -> yellow. 

Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" is related to the sequence of colors that come before it. The following rule can be deduced:

bluf -> the color of the previous word and the three colors preceding it in the sequence.

For example:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, and the previous three colors are green, red, and green. Therefore, bluf is yellow yellow red green.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, and the previous three colors are yellow, blue, and yellow. Therefore, bluf is yellow blue yellow blue.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, and there are no previous words. Therefore, bluf is yellow yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, and the previous three colors are yellow, blue, and yellow. Therefore, bluf is yellow blue yellow blue.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, and the previous three colors are yellow, yellow, and blue. Therefore, bluf is yellow yellow yellow blue.

Based on these examples, the presence or absence of certain colors and their sequence before ""bluf"" determine its meaning.

From these examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" represents a color. Additionally, it appears that the word ""bluf"" has a one-to-one correspondence with a color. The color associated with ""bluf"" is specified by the context in which it appears. For example, in the third example, ""wif lug bluf"" is associated with ""red blue blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" takes on the color specified by the adjacent words.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

bluf -> color (specific color determined by context)
walm -> color coding for specific words in the input sentence.

Meaning: The word ""walm"" is used to indicate a specific color coding for other words in the input sentence, which could be green, yellow, blue, or red based on the examples provided.

Rule: 
1. If ""walm"" is followed by another word, assign that word a color based on the following order: green, yellow, blue, red.
2. If ""walm"" is the last word in the input sentence, ignore it.

Meaning: the word ""dax"" represents different colors in different contexts. The color associated with ""dax"" can vary depending on its position in a sequence of words. In isolation, ""dax"" indicates the color green. When preceded by the word ""zup"", it represents the color yellow. When followed by the word ""bluf"", it represents the color blue. When followed by the word ""bluf"" and then ""wif"", it represents the color red.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" seems to be associated with assigning colors to different words. Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule:
- ""wif"" always means ""red"" when it appears alone or with other words.
- When ""wif"" is followed by another word (e.g., ""wif bluf"" or ""wif walm""), each subsequent word is assigned the color ""red"".
- If ""wif"" is interspersed between other words, it separates the colors assigned to each group of words. For example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" is equivalent to ""red blue blue red yellow"".
- The color assigned to words other than ""wif"" is determined by their position relative to ""wif"".

Therefore, the general rule for the word ""wif"" is that it functions as a color indicator and assigns the color ""red"" to words that follow it until another ""wif"" is encountered.
zup -> color coding
Meaning: The word ""zup"" seems to be associated with color coding in the given examples. Depending on the surrounding words, ""zup"" is followed by different colors.

Rule: The color represented by ""bluf"" depends on the order of appearance in the input. The first occurrence represents blue, the second represents red, the third represents yellow, and the fourth represents green.
Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following rule for the word ""walm"":

Rule: walm represents a color, with each occurrence representing a different shade of color starting from green and moving towards red.

Here is the breakdown of the examples:

In the first example, ""walm"" appears once, so it corresponds to ""blue"", which is the third shade after green.

In the second example, ""walm"" appears twice, so it corresponds to ""green"" and ""red"", which are the first and third shades respectively.

In the third example, ""walm"" appears four times, so it corresponds to ""green"", ""yellow"", ""red"", and ""red"", which are the first, second, third, and third shades respectively.

In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears once, so it corresponds to ""green"", which is the first shade.

In the fifth example, ""walm"" appears once, so it corresponds to ""yellow"", which is the second shade.

Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears in a sequence, it represents the color blue.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" in the given examples appears to be associated with different colors. It can represent different colors based on its position in the input sequence. Here are the rules that can be deduced from the examples:

Rule 1: If ""dax"" is the first word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color green.
Example: dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow

Rule 2: If ""dax"" is the second word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color yellow.
Example: zup dax bluf -> yellow green green

Rule 3: If ""dax"" is the third word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color yellow.
Example: dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow

Rule 4: If ""dax"" is the last word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color green.
Example: zup dax zup lug -> yellow green yellow blue

Rule 5: If ""dax"" is in between other words, it corresponds to the color red.
Example: wif dax zup dax -> red green yellow green

Based on these rules, the meaning of ""dax"" can be understood as representing different colors depending on its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the rules regarding the meaning of the word ""wif"" can be summarized as follows:

Rules:
1. ""wif"" maps to the color ""red"".
2. The word ""wif"" can appear alone and always corresponds to the color ""red"".
3. If ""wif"" is preceded by another color, the resulting sequence of colors is a combination of the preceding color(s) and ""red"".
4. If ""wif"" is followed by another word, the resulting sequence of colors is a combination of the previous color(s) and the color(s) associated with the following word(s), which are determined independently.

So, overall, ""wif"" typically represents the color ""red"" unless it is modified by other words to create color sequences.
zup -> color

Meaning: zup is representing different colors in the given examples. The word zup seems to be associated with the colors green, yellow, and red in different positions within the sentence.

Meaning: The word ""lug"" refers to a color. From the given examples, it can be observed that the color associated with ""lug"" changes depending on its surrounding words. The following rules can be inferred from the examples:

Rule 1: If ""lug"" is preceded by another color word, then ""lug"" represents the same color as the preceding word. For example, ""lug dax wif"" -> ""blue green red"" indicates that ""lug"" is blue because ""dax"" is blue.

Rule 2: If ""lug"" is followed by another color word, then ""lug"" represents the same color as the following word. For example, ""lug wif lug"" -> ""blue red blue"" indicates that ""lug"" is blue because it is followed by ""red.""

Rule 3: If ""lug"" is not preceded or followed by another color word, then ""lug"" represents a different color. For example, ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" suggests that ""lug"" represents a distinct color, not represented by any other color word in the examples.

Based on these rules, it can be concluded that the meaning of ""lug"" is a color, and its specific color varies depending on the context of its surrounding words.
dax -> color, more specifically:
- When dax appears alone, it means green.
- When dax appears after another word, the color is determined by the word that comes before it. Examples:

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning:
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" refers to different colors. The color associated with ""lug"" varies depending on the context or position of ""lug"" within the input sequence. It is observed that ""lug"" represents the colors ""green,"" ""red,"" and ""blue"" in different contexts.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to be associated with different colors in different contexts. However, based on the examples, we can derive a general rule: 

Rule: 
If ""dax"" appears alone, it means ""green"". 
If ""dax"" appears before another word, it means the color associated with that word.

Note: The colors mentioned in the examples are ""green"", ""blue"", ""yellow"", and ""red"". However, without more examples or further context, it is not possible to determine the exact mapping of colors to specific words.
wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, it can be observed that the presence of the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, in this context, ""wif"" can be deduced to mean the color ""red"". Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" as follows:

zup -> color

The word ""zup"" is associated with different colors in each example, suggesting that its meaning is related to colors. We can infer the following rules:
- When ""zup"" is preceded by the word ""wif"", it corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" is preceded by the word ""lug"", it corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- When ""zup"" is preceded by multiple instances of the word ""walm"", it corresponds to the color ""red"".
- When ""zup"" is preceded by the word ""dax"", it corresponds to the color ""green"".

It appears that the meaning of ""zup"" is determined by the words that come before it. Therefore, the exact meaning of ""zup"" would depend on the context in which it is used.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf seems to represent different colors in the given examples. The color assigned to bluf depends on the context of the surrounding words. 

Rule: In the given examples, when bluf appears after the word lug, it corresponds to the color blue. When bluf appears after the word wif, it corresponds to the color red. When bluf appears after the word zup, it corresponds to the color yellow.
walm -> color. Walm seems to represent different colors in different contexts. In the first example, walm represents the color sequence yellow, red, red, red, blue. In the second example, walm represents the color sequence green, green, green, red, red, red, yellow. In the fourth example, walm represents the color sequence green, green, green. Therefore, based on the provided examples, it can be inferred that walm refers to a sequence of colors.

    Rules:
lug -> color. The word ""lug"" seems to be associated with different colors in different contexts. Here are the rules that can be deduced from the given examples:

1. If ""lug"" appears alone, the meaning is ""blue"" (e.g., Input: lug -> Output: blue).
2. If ""lug"" appears in a sequence with other words, the meaning is determined by the order of appearance:
    a. If ""lug"" appears before other words, it corresponds to ""blue"" (e.g., Input: lug dax wif lug -> Output: blue green red blue).
    b. If ""lug"" appears after other words, it corresponds to ""green"" (e.g., Input: dax bluf lug wif -> Output: green green blue red).
    c. If ""lug"" appears between other words, it corresponds to ""red"" (e.g., Input: dax lug bluf wif -> Output: green blue blue red).

Therefore, the context and position of ""lug"" in a sequence determine its meaning, which can be either ""blue"", ""green"", or ""red"".
dax -> color. The meaning of 'dax' seems to be associated with colors. It appears to represent different colors depending on its context within the sentence. From the examples given:
- When 'dax' is surrounded by other color words, it represents the color green.

Meaning: ""lug"" refers to the color blue.

Rule: In the given context, ""lug"" is always associated with the color blue.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" appears to represent different colors in different contexts. In the first example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green"", suggesting that ""dax"" represents the color blue. In the second example, ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green"", indicating that ""dax"" represents the color yellow. In the third example, ""dax lug dax wif dax"" translates to ""green blue green red green"", which implies that ""dax"" represents the color green. Finally, in the fourth and fifth examples, ""dax"" is translated as ""green"", further supporting the interpretation of ""dax"" as the color green.
wif -> color combination. The word ""wif"" appears to represent a combination of colors. Each example includes a set of colors, and ""wif"" is followed by a set of colors that appears to be a combination of the previous colors. For example, in the first example ""zup wif dax,"" ""wif"" is followed by ""yellow red green,"" which can be seen as a combination of the colors ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""green"" from the previous set. Similarly, in the second example ""lug walm zup wif,"" ""wif"" is followed by ""blue blue blue yellow red,"" which is a combination of the previous colors ""blue"" and ""red."" Therefore, ""wif"" appears to signify a combination of colors.
zup -> green in the context where zup is followed by two words and the second word is not zup itself. 
zup -> blue in the context where zup is preceded and followed by the same word that is not zup itself.
zup -> yellow in the context where zup is a standalone word.
bluf -> color of an object in the sequence. Rule: The word ""bluf"" indicates the color of an object mentioned in the input sequence. The color can be one of the following: green, red, yellow, or blue.
walm -> color sequence. The meaning of ""walm"" in these examples appears to be a series of colors in a specific order. The color sequence is as follows:
walm -> red
walm wif -> red yellow
walm wif wif -> red yellow yellow
walm bluf -> red blue
walm dax -> red green

    Rules:
lug -> color (green, blue, red, yellow)

Rule: The meaning of ""lug"" appears to be associated with colors. In all the examples, ""lug"" is followed by a sequence of colors. The specific color sequence changes from example to example, but there is a consistent pattern of association between ""lug"" and colors. It is likely that ""lug"" refers to a color or is somehow related to color in the given context.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to represent a color. The examples show that ""dax"" can represent different colors in different contexts. When ""dax"" appears alone, it represents the color green. When ""dax"" appears after other words, it represents the color associated with the previous word. For example, ""dax zup"" means green yellow and ""dax lug"" means green blue. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" can be determined based on the context in which it appears.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" seems to correspond to different colors based on the context. When ""wif"" is present with other words, it represents different colors such as red, green, and yellow. In the first example, ""wif"" is associated with ""dax"" and ""bluf"" which results in the colors red, green, and green. In the fourth example, ""wif"" is associated with ""dax"", ""bluf"", and ""zup"" which results in the colors red, green, red, red, yellow, and red. However, when ""wif"" appears alone in the second and third examples, it is associated with the color red. Overall, the rule would be that ""wif"" represents a color, but the specific color depends on the context it appears in.
zup -> color

Meaning: ""zup"" refers to a color. Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color
Meaning: bluf appears to represent different colors in different contexts. The rule is that bluf corresponds to the colors red, green, yellow, and blue. It is possible that these colors are assigned to bluf in a specific sequence or pattern, but further examples are needed to determine the exact rule.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following rule for the word ""walm"":

walm -> color (corresponding to the position of ""walm"" in the input sentence)

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""walm"" appears as the fifth word, which is associated with the color ""blue"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""walm"" appears as the fourth word, which is associated with the color ""green"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""walm"" appears as the sixth word, which is associated with the color ""blue"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears as the second word, which is associated with the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Meaning: lug refers to the color blue.

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it is used to indicate the color blue.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors in different contexts. In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with blue, green, and red, which can be interpreted as a sequence of colors. In the second example, ""dax"" is associated with green and blue, suggesting a pattern of alternating colors. In the third and fourth examples, ""dax"" is always associated with green, indicating a consistent color reference. The fifth example adds further evidence to suggest that ""dax"" represents a color, as it is associated with yellow and green in a larger context.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to represent colors, with different instances of ""wif"" referring to different colors. Here are the associations found in the examples:

wif -> red
wif -> blue
wif -> green

- When bluf appears after the word ""zup"" in the input sentence, it represents the color yellow.
- When bluf appears after the word ""wif"" in the input sentence, it represents the color red.

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as follows:
- bluf -> blue when preceded or followed by ""lug""
- bluf -> green when preceded by ""dax""
- bluf -> yellow when preceded by ""zup""
- bluf -> red when preceded by ""wif""
walm -> color

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears in different positions in the input sequences.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Rule: 

1) When ""lug"" appears alone, it corresponds to the color ""blue"".

2) When ""lug"" appears with other words, the resulting colors are determined by the order and position of ""lug"" in the input sequence. The color associated with each position is as follows:
  - If ""lug"" is the first word in the sequence, the resulting color is ""green"".
  - If ""lug"" is in the middle of the sequence, the resulting color is ""blue"".
  - If ""lug"" is the last word in the sequence, the resulting color is ""red"".

Example: 

Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green

Explanation: In this example, ""lug"" is the first word, so it corresponds to the color ""blue"". The other words ""wif"" and ""dax"" correspond to the colors ""red"" and ""green"" respectively, based on their positions in the sequence.
dax -> color based on its position in the input sequence. 

Meaning: By analyzing the examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" is associated with different colors, depending on its position within the input sequence. The color correspondences are as follows:

- When ""dax"" is the first word of the sequence, it corresponds to the color green.
- When ""dax"" is the second word of the sequence, it corresponds to the color yellow.
- When ""dax"" is the third word of the sequence, it corresponds to the color blue.
- When ""dax"" is the fourth word of the sequence, it corresponds to the color red.
- When ""dax"" is the fifth word of the sequence, it corresponds to the color green.
- When ""dax"" is the sixth word of the sequence, it corresponds to the color green.

Based on this analysis, the meaning of ""dax"" can be understood as a color that varies depending on its position within the input sequence.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" seems to be associated with colors based on the given examples. In the first example, ""wif"" is associated with the color sequence ""green yellow red yellow"". In the second example, it is associated with the color ""red"". In the third example, it is associated with the color sequence ""red red blue"". Based on these examples, it appears that ""wif"" represents different colors in different contexts. Thus, the rule would be that ""wif"" represents a color, with the specific color determined by the context in which it appears.
zup -> color based on the following rules:
- When zup is preceded by ""dax"", it means ""green"".
- When zup is preceded by ""lug"", it means ""blue"".
- Otherwise, it means ""yellow"".
bluf -> color (blue, red, green, yellow)

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors. The color associated with ""bluf"" can be determined by looking at the adjacent words in the input. For example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" in the first example, and ""lug"" is associated with the color blue. Therefore, ""bluf"" in this case represents the color blue. Similarly, in the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which is associated with the color red, so ""bluf"" represents red. This pattern is consistent across the examples, suggesting that the meaning of ""bluf"" is determined by the colors of the adjacent words.
walm -> color. 
Based on the given examples, it can be inferred that the word ""walm"" is associated with colors. The examples show that when ""walm"" appears in the input, it corresponds to a repetition of a particular color in the output.

Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to represent different colors based on its context in the examples. In the first four examples, ""lug"" is consistently associated with the color blue. However, in the last example, ""lug"" is associated with the colors blue and yellow. This suggests that the meaning of ""lug"" is context-dependent and can represent different colors based on its neighboring words.
dax -> color where ""green"" corresponds to the word ""zup"", ""yellow"" corresponds to the word ""wif"", ""blue"" corresponds to the word ""lug"", and ""red"" corresponds to any other word not mentioned.
wif - > color

Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" is used to represent different colors in different contexts. Here are the observations:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"". Here, ""wif"" represents the color red.

2. In the second example, ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red"", suggesting that ""wif"" stands for red.

3. In the third example, ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green"". ""Wif"" here represents red, like in the previous examples.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red"". Here, ""wif"" represents red again.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red"". ""Wif"" is used to represent red here as well.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""wif"" is a placeholder word used to represent the color red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: ""zup"" refers to the color yellow.
bluf -> color. The color of bluf seems to be determined by the words surrounding it. Based on the examples given, we can form the following rule:
- If bluf is surrounded by zup, then bluf is yellow.
- If bluf is surrounded by zup and lug, then bluf is blue.
- If bluf is surrounded by zup, wif, and lug, then bluf is red.
- If bluf is preceded by dax, then bluf is green.
walm -> color

Rule: The word ""walm"" represents a color, with each occurrence of ""walm"" in a sentence being replaced by a specific color. The color is determined by the position of ""walm"" in the sentence, as shown by the examples:

- The first occurrence of ""walm"" is replaced by ""red"".
- The second occurrence of ""walm"" is replaced by ""yellow"".
- The third occurrence of ""walm"" is replaced by ""blue"".
- Any further occurrences of ""walm"" are replaced by the same color as the third occurrence.

Therefore, the word ""walm"" seems to act as a color marker in the given context.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""lug"" functions as a noun and is associated with two different meanings or patterns:

1) In the context of ""lug"" followed by ""wif"" (e.g., ""lug wif bluf lug wif""), the word ""lug"" seems to represent the color ""blue"". This can be inferred from the consistent output of ""blue red red blue red"" in these cases.

2) In the context of ""lug"" followed by ""dax"" (e.g., ""lug dax""), the word ""lug"" seems to represent the color ""green"". This can be inferred from the consistent output of ""blue green"" in these cases.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

lug + wif -> blue
lug + dax -> green
dax -> color. The color of ""dax"" is determined by the context in which it appears. The specific mapping between ""dax"" and a color is as follows:
- When preceded by ""lug"" and followed by any other word: dax -> blue.
- When preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug"": dax -> yellow.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: The word ""lug"" is associated with colors. Each time the word ""lug"" appears in a sentence, it is followed by a color word (red, blue, green, yellow). The colors assigned to ""lug"" seem to be arbitrary and do not follow a consistent pattern across different examples.
dax -> green. 

Meaning: In the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.
wif -> color

Rule: The word ""wif"" seems to represent different colors based on its position in the input sentence. In each example, ""wif"" is followed by a color name. The color following ""wif"" is then assigned to each previous word until another color is encountered or until the end of the sentence.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: In all given examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf seems to represent different colors in different contexts. Based on the provided examples, bluf can be interpreted as follows:
- When bluf appears in combination with other words like lug, wif, or dax, it represents a specific color. For instance, ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red"", suggesting that bluf denotes the color blue.
- When bluf appears alone, it still represents a color. For example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"", indicating that bluf corresponds to the color yellow.

Therefore, the rule for bluf could be that it represents different colors based on the context in which it appears.
walm -> color ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup""
walm -> color ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup""
walm -> color ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup""
