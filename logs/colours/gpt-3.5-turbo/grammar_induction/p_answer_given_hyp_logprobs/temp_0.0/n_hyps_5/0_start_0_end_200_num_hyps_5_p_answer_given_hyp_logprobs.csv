- If the preceding word is ""bluf"", ""dax"" is green.
- If the preceding word is ""lug"", ""dax"" is blue.
- If the preceding word is ""zup"", ""dax"" is yellow.
- If there is no preceding word, ""dax"" takes its color from the following word (e.g. ""dax walm"" -> green).
- If none of the above rules apply, ""dax"" is red.

Therefore, the general rule for determining the meaning of ""dax"" seems to be that it represents a color, which is determined by the context in which it appears.
wif -> alternating colors in the sequence of ""red"", ""blue"", ""green"", ""yellow"". Rule: Each occurrence of ""wif"" adds a color to the output sequence, starting with ""red"", then ""blue"", then ""green"", then ""yellow"", and repeating in the same order for subsequent occurrences of ""wif"".
zup -> color

Meaning: The word ""zup"" represents a color. Based on the examples, the color appears to be determined by the words that come after ""zup"". Each ""zup"" is followed by a consistent sequence of colors, such as yellow, green, blue, red, etc.

Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

dax -> color
Rule: The meaning of ""dax"" seems to be associated with colors.

Explanation of the rule: In all the examples, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, it is followed by a list of colors. Additionally, in some cases, ""dax"" is also found without any preceding context, in which case it is associated with the color ""green"". Therefore, we can infer that ""dax"" represents colors, and its meaning is dependent on the context in which it is used.
wif -> color. The color attributed to ""wif"" depends on the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the color is yellow. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the color is green. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" the color is blue.

wif -> position in a sequence of words

Meaning:

Rule: wif represents the position of a word in a sequence of words. The color words red, green, blue, and yellow are used to represent the position of the word in the sequence. The first word in the sequence is represented by red, the second word by green, the third word by blue, and the fourth word by yellow. If the sequence has more than four words, the pattern repeats.
zup -> yellow. Rule: ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow in this context.
bluf -> color combination based on the order in which it appears in the examples.

Rule: 

The meaning of ""bluf"" is determined by the colors that come before it in the input sequence. The output of ""bluf"" is a combination of colors based on the order in which it appears. Each color is represented by a specific word (blue, green, red, yellow).

- If ""bluf"" follows a single color, the meaning of ""bluf"" is the same as the preceding color.
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by two colors, the first color represents the first part of its meaning, and the second color represents the second part of its meaning. The order of the colors determines the order of the parts.
- If ""bluf"" follows three or more colors, it combines the colors in the order they appear.

For example, in the input ""zup bluf dax"", ""bluf"" follows the color ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green), so its meaning is ""yellow green"" (yellow represents the first part, and green represents the second part).

Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" can also include repeated colors. For instance, in the input ""wif bluf lug"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), so its meaning is ""red red"" (both parts are represented by the same color).

    Rules:
lug -> color. The word ""lug"" seems to be associated with different colors in different contexts.
dax -> color green. Rule: In the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" seems to be associated with colors. Based on the examples, it can be inferred that ""wif"" represents different colors in different contexts. Here are the observed associations:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is associated with the color yellow twice and then with the color red three times.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is associated with the color red and then with the color blue.
- In the third example, ""wif"" is associated with the color red, then with the color green, and finally with the color red again.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is associated with the colors red, blue, blue, and yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is associated with the colors red, blue, yellow, and yellow.

Based on this pattern, it can be concluded that ""wif"" represents a sequence of colors, potentially repeating colors.

Rule: The word ""wif"" maps to a color. The specific color depends on the context, but it appears that ""wif"" can represent the colors yellow, blue, green, or red.
zup -> color. The word ""zup"" seems to be associated with the color of the preceding words. In the examples, it appears that ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> color representation in a sequence.

From the given examples, it can be observed that the word ""bluf"" is related to a sequence of colors. Each input consists of a sequence of words, and the output is a corresponding sequence of colors.

Here is the rule deduced from the examples:
Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents the colors in a sequence, with each color corresponding to the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence.

For example, in the first input ""dax wif bluf"", the word ""bluf"" is in the third position, so the output is ""green red red"". In the second input ""zup bluf dax lug"", ""bluf"" is in the second position, so the output is ""yellow yellow green blue"" and so on.

bluf zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> color

The word ""walm"" seems to be used as a placeholder or indicator for a color. In each example, the color associated with ""walm"" is consistently applied to all subsequent words in the input sequence.

For example, in the first input, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the corresponding output is ""red blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" represents the color ""red,"" which is then applied to all subsequent words.

Similarly, in the second input, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" represents the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be generalized as follows:

walm -> color

Where ""color"" refers to any specific color that is consistently applied to subsequent words in the input sequence.

Finally, when ""wif"" is preceded by the word ""dax"" and followed by the words ""lug bluf"", its meaning is ""green blue red red"".
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: zup seems to be a word that is associated with the color yellow. It appears that whenever zup is used in a sentence, it is replaced by the word yellow in the output.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf refers to various colors based on the context. It can represent yellow, red, green, or blue. 

Rule: The specific color represented by bluf depends on the words that appear before it. The following rules can be deduced based on the examples:

If bluf is preceded by ""zup"" and another color, it represents yellow.
If bluf is preceded by ""wif"" and another color, it represents red.
If bluf is preceded by ""zup"" and ""dax"" and another color, it represents green.
If bluf is preceded by a sequence of ""lug"" and other colors, it represents blue.

dax -> color

Meaning:
The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors based on its position and context in the examples. In the given examples, ""dax"" is associated with the colors green, yellow, blue, and red. The rule that can be deduced is as follows:

Rule:
When ""dax"" is the first word in a sequence, it represents the color green.
When ""dax"" is the second word in a sequence, it represents the color yellow.
When ""dax"" is the third word in a sequence, it represents the color blue.
When ""dax"" is the last word in a sequence, it represents the color red.
wif -> color. 
Meaning: ""wif"" seems to represent different colors based on its position in the input. In the first position, it represents yellow, in the second position red, in the third position blue, and in the fourth position green. Additionally, when ""wif"" is the only word in the input, it represents red.

Meaning: bluf represents different colors depending on the context. The color assigned to bluf changes based on the neighboring words. The following rules can be observed:

Rule 1: bluf preceded and followed by the same word -> blue
Example: lug bluf lug -> blue blue blue

Rule 2: bluf preceded by a color word -> color of the preceding word
Example: dax lug bluf -> green blue blue

Rule 3: bluf followed by a color word -> color of the following word
Example: lug bluf wif -> blue blue red

Rule 4: bluf preceded and followed by different color words -> alternating red and blue
Example: lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red

Rule 5: bluf with a color word both preceding and following -> alternating colors where the color of the following word takes precedence
Example: zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue

It seems that the assignment of colors to bluf depends on the surrounding words and their colors, following specific patterns or rules.

Meaning:
The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors in different contexts. Based on the examples provided, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule:
If ""dax"" appears alone, it represents the color ""green"".
If ""dax"" appears in a sentence alongside other words, it represents the color corresponding to the position of ""dax"" in the sentence. For example, if ""dax"" is the first word after ""lug"", it represents the color ""blue"". If ""dax"" is the third word after ""wif"", it represents the color ""green"".

Additionally, it seems like ""dax"" always appears next to other words, and the number of occurrences of ""dax"" corresponds to the number of colors in the output.
wif -> color. Based on the examples, it seems that ""wif"" is a nonce word associated with colors. It is also evident that there is a specific mapping between ""wif"" and the colors green, red, and blue. The mapping appears to be as follows:
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""green blue red."" 
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue red.""

Therefore, the context-dependent rule for ""wif"" is that when it is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""lug,"" it represents the color green, when it is preceded by ""dax,"" it represents the color red, and when it is followed by ""lug,"" it represents the color blue.
zup -> yellow. Rule: In the given examples, whenever the word ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to the color yellow.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color. Rule: lug represents a color, specifically blue.
dax -> color rule. The word ""dax"" appears to represent different colors in different contexts. Based on the examples provided:
- When ""dax"" appears alone, it represents the color ""green"" (dax -> green).
- When ""dax"" is accompanied by other words, its meaning seems to be affected by the surrounding context. For example, in the second example, ""dax"" is associated with ""lug"" and ""wif"", which corresponds to the colors ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively (dax -> green, lug -> blue, wif -> red).
- The specific color associated with ""dax"" in these contexts is determined by the sequence of words it appears with. For instance, in the third example, ""dax"" is associated with ""zup"" and ""bluf"", resulting in the colors ""yellow"" and ""green"" (dax -> green, zup -> yellow, bluf -> green).

Therefore, we can hypothesize that the meaning of ""dax"" is based on a color classification, with its value being determined by the surrounding words. However, without further examples or explicit context, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact mapping between ""dax"" and specific colors in all cases.
