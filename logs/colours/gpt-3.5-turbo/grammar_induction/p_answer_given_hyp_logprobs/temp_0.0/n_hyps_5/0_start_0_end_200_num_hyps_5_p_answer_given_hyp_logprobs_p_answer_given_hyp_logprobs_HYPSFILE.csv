"walm -> color

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to refer to a color. The color of ""walm"" is determined by the position of the word in the sentence. 

Observations:
1. In the first example, ""walm"" appears in the fifth position and corresponds to the color ""blue"".
2. In the second example, ""walm"" appears in the third position and corresponds to the color ""red"".
3. In the third example, ""walm"" appears in the fourth position and corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

- If ""bluf"" is followed by another color word (e.g., ""zup bluf""), the output is the color yellow repeated twice (""yellow yellow"").
- If ""bluf"" is followed by multiple color words (e.g., ""zup lug bluf wif""), the output is the corresponding colors repeated in the same order (""yellow blue blue red"").
- If ""bluf"" appears multiple times in a sequence of color words, the colors following each occurrence of ""bluf"" are repeated in the same order (""blue red red blue red"").
- If ""bluf"" appears at the end of a sequence of color words (e.g., ""lug bluf""), the output is the color blue repeated twice (""blue blue"").
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by a non-color word, the output remains unaffected.

1) Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   In this example, ""wif"" is associated with the color red.

2) Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   ""Wif"" is again associated with the color red in this example.

3) Input: lug wif zup wif walm

4) Input: wif lug

"bluf -> color combination based on the order in which it appears in the examples.

Rule: 

The meaning of ""bluf"" is determined by the colors that come before it in the input sequence. The output of ""bluf"" is a combination of colors based on the order in which it appears. Each color is represented by a specific word (blue, green, red, yellow).

- If ""bluf"" follows a single color, the meaning of ""bluf"" is the same as the preceding color.
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by two colors, the first color represents the first part of its meaning, and the second color represents the second part of its meaning. The order of the colors determines the order of the parts.
- If ""bluf"" follows three or more colors, it combines the colors in the order they appear.

For example, in the input ""zup bluf dax"", ""bluf"" follows the color ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green), so its meaning is ""yellow green"" (yellow represents the first part, and green represents the second part).

Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" can also include repeated colors. For instance, in the input ""wif bluf lug"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), so its meaning is ""red red"" (both parts are represented by the same color).",-7.152598427240001,48,bluf

Further examination of the examples reveals that the color associated with ""dax"" follows a specific pattern:

- When ""dax"" appears alone, it is associated with the color green.
- When ""dax"" appears before another color (e.g., ""dax lug""), the next color in the sequence is assigned to ""dax."" In this case, it is blue.
- When ""dax"" appears after another color (e.g., ""lug dax""), the same color as the preceding color is assigned to ""dax."" In this case, it is green.

Based on these patterns, we can refine the rule to:

- Example 2: zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

Based on these two examples, we can see that bluf affects the colors that follow it. In Example 1, bluf is followed by dax, which means that the subsequent colors in the output are red, red, and green. In Example 2, bluf is followed by wif and walm, resulting in yellow, yellow, red, red, and red.
