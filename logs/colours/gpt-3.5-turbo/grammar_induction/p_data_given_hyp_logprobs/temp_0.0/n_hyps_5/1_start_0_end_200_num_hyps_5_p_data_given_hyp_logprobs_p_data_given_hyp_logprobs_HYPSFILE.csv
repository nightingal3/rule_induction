1. When ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence:
   - If the following word is also ""bluf"", the color is ""green"".
   - If the following word is not ""bluf"", the color is ""blue"".

"wif -> color.

Based on the examples, it can be observed that the word ""wif"" is associated with colors. The color assigned to ""wif"" in each example determines the color of the following words. 

Example 1: ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue""
In this example, ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"", so the subsequent words ""bluf"" and ""lug"" are also assigned the color ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively.

Example 2: ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
Similarly, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" which results in ""walm"" and ""dax"" being assigned the colors ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.

By analyzing all the examples, we can deduce the following rule: 
If ""wif"" is associated with a certain color, then each subsequent word is assigned the same color as ""wif"", with the color changing with each occurrence of ""wif"". If ""wif"" appears multiple times, the color assignment restarts with the first occurrence of ""wif"".",-1.0070560986141026,75,wif

"bluf -> color coding based on the position in the input sentence

Meaning:
Rule: The word ""bluf"" is color-coded based on its position in the input sentence.

Explanation:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on its position relative to other words in the input sentence. The color coding in the outputs suggests that ""bluf"" is assigned a color based on its position.

- When ""bluf"" is the first word (e.g., zup wif bluf), it is assigned the color yellow.
- When ""bluf"" is the second word (e.g., wif bluf dax), it is assigned the color red.
- When ""bluf"" is the third word (e.g., zup bluf dax), it is assigned the color yellow again.
- When ""bluf"" is the second-to-last word (e.g., wif bluf dax lug), it is assigned the color red again.
- When ""bluf"" is the last word (e.g., lug bluf), it is assigned the color blue.

Based on these patterns, the rule for determining the color of ""bluf"" appears to be:
- If ""bluf"" is the first word, assign it the color yellow.
- If ""bluf"" is the second word, assign it the color red.
- If ""bluf"" is the third word, assign it the color yellow.
- If ""bluf"" is the second-to-last word, assign it the color red.
- If ""bluf"" is the last word, assign it the color blue.

- The first occurrence of ""dax"" is preceded by one word, so it represents the color green.
- The second occurrence of ""dax"" is preceded by three words, so it represents the color blue.

"walm -> color coding

Meaning: walm seems to be a nonce word used to indicate a specific color. The color associated with walm depends on the context it appears in. The color coding can be observed in the following pattern:

- When walm appears after another color word, it always represents the same color as the previous word. For example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" and ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". This suggests that walm is a synonym for the color given before it.

- When walm appears before other color words, it is always followed by the same color. For example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"". This implies that walm can also be used as a prefix to indicate the color that follows.

Therefore, the inferred rule for understanding the meaning of walm is: walm represents the same color as the previous color word or serves as a prefix to denote the color of the following color word.",-0.9137649076138887,167,walm

Meaning: walm represents a color. The color of walm can be determined by looking at the preceding words in the input sequence. Based on the given examples, it seems that the color of walm is related to the number and types of preceding colors. Here is a possible rule deduced from the examples: 

Rule: 
- If there is only one preceding color word, walm represents the same color as the preceding word.
- If there are multiple preceding color words, walm represents the color that appears the most among the preceding words.

This rule can be seen in action in the examples:
- In the first example, ""dax"" is the only preceding color word, which is green. So, walm is green.
- In the second example, ""zup"" and ""wif"" are the preceding color words. The most common color among them is red. So, walm is red.
- In the third example, ""dax"" and ""lug"" are the preceding color words. The most common color among them is blue. So, walm is blue.
