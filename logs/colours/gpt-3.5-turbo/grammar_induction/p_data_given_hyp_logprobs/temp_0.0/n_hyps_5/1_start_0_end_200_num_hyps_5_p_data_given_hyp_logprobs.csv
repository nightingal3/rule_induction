"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" seems to be associated with the color blue.
dax -> color. 

Possible meanings for dax based on the examples are colors, specifically:
- ""red"" in the context of ""wif dax""
- ""yellow"" and ""blue"" in the context of ""zup lug dax""
- ""green"" in the contexts of ""wif dax"", ""dax lug"", ""dax bluf"", and ""dax""

From these examples, it can be inferred that the word ""dax"" represents different colors in different contexts. Therefore, the rule can be formulated as: 

Rule: dax represents a color. The specific color it represents depends on the context.
wif -> position or status in a sequence

Meaning: The word ""wif"" seems to represent the position or status in a sequence. The examples indicate that when ""wif"" is present, it corresponds to the color red in the output. Additionally, when ""wif"" is not present, it corresponds to the color green in the output. The exact position of ""wif"" within the input phrase seems to determine the position or status of the corresponding color in the output.
zup -> yellow. Rule: In the context of the given examples, the word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents different colors based on the context. The following rules can be derived from the given examples:
1. If bluf appears after dax, it corresponds to the color green.
2. If bluf appears after zup, it corresponds to the color yellow.
3. If bluf appears after lug, it corresponds to the color blue.
4. If bluf appears after wif, it corresponds to the color red.

Therefore, the general rule is: bluf represents different colors based on the preceding word.
walm -> color
Rule: In the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to refer to colors. It is associated with the colors red, green, blue, and yellow. The specific color associated with ""walm"" depends on the surrounding words in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Lug refers to the color blue.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" appears to be a color, specifically green. This is supported by the consistent output of ""green"" whenever ""dax"" appears in the input.
wif -> color of the previous word, with the exception that the first occurrence of wif is always red. 

Meaning: The word ""wif"" represents the color of the previous word in the sequence, where colors are represented by specific words (e.g., green, red, blue, yellow). However, there is an exception that the first occurrence of ""wif"" is always red, regardless of the previous word.
zup -> yellow. 
Rule: The word zup is always associated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents different colors depending on its context. The rules seem to be as follows:

Rule:
- If bluf appears after a word wif, it represents the color red.
- If bluf appears before or after a word lug, it represents the color blue.
- If bluf appears after a word zup, it represents the color yellow.
- If bluf appears after a word dax, it represents the color green.

Based on the examples provided, these rules consistently determine the meaning of bluf in each context.
walm -> color representation of the position of a word in the input sequence.

Rule:
The word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the color representation of the position of a word in the input sequence. 

- When ""walm"" appears at the first position, the output is always ""red"".
- When ""walm"" appears at the second position, the output is always ""yellow"".
- When ""walm"" appears at the third position, the output is always ""green"".
- When ""walm"" appears at the fourth position, the output varies.
- When ""walm"" appears at the fifth position, the output is always ""blue"".

Note: Since the examples only provide a limited number of instances, it is possible that there might be additional rules associated with specific positions beyond the fifth position or variations for other positions that were not captured in the examples. However, based on the provided examples, the most consistent rule is the color representation associated with the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

In the second example, ""dax"" is associated with the word ""green"" again. In the third example, ""dax"" is also associated with the word ""green"" and then ""red"". In the fourth example, ""dax"" is associated with only ""green"". In the fifth example, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""red"" again. Therefore, it appears that ""dax"" represents the color green.
wif -> color. Rule: wif corresponds to the color red.
zup -> color. The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to different colors in each example. In the first example, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"". In the second example, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" again, but followed by a sequence of other colors. In the third example, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" again, followed by a sequence of colors and repeated occurrences of ""red"". In these examples, ""zup"" consistently represents a color. Therefore, the rule could be that ""zup"" represents a color.
bluf -> color 

Rule: 

The word ""bluf"" seems to represent colors based on the given examples. It appears that the color assigned to ""bluf"" is determined by the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence. The following patterns can be observed:

1) If ""bluf"" is the first word in the input sequence, it is assigned the color green.
2) If ""bluf"" is the second word in the input sequence, it is assigned the color red.
3) If ""bluf"" is the third word in the input sequence, it is assigned the color yellow.

   - If ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""walm,"" it corresponds to ""blue"" for both occurrences and then ""red.""
   - If ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""yellow"" followed by ""red.""

Based on these examples, it seems that the color associated with ""wif"" changes based on the surrounding words, and the ordering of the colors follows a consistent pattern.
zup -> color. The meaning of ""zup"" seems to be associated with colors based on the provided examples. It is used as a nonce word to represent different colors, where ""blue"" is associated with ""lug"", ""yellow"" is associated with ""walm"" and ""green"" is associated with ""dax"".
bluf -> color

Rule: bluf refers to the color of an object or entity. The color can be green, blue, red, yellow, or any other color mentioned in the examples.
walm -> color. The color represented by ""walm"" is determined by the position it occupies in the input sequence. 

Rule:
- If ""walm"" is the first word in the input sequence, it represents the color green.
- If ""walm"" is the last word in the input sequence, it represents the color red.
- If ""walm"" is in any other position in the input sequence, it represents the color yellow or blue, alternating between them with each occurrence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Meaning: In all the examples, the word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue. This suggests that ""lug"" has a consistent meaning of representing the color blue.
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to refer to a color in different contexts. Based on the examples, ""dax"" is associated with the color green. It is consistently mapped to green whenever it appears in the input. Therefore, we can conclude that ""dax"" means green.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to different colors in different contexts. In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to blue, and in the second example, it corresponds to red. There is no clear pattern or rule regarding how ""wif"" determines a specific color, as it switches between different colors in different contexts. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be context-dependent and can be interpreted as representing different colors based on the surrounding words.
zup -> yellow

Meaning: The word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. The rule is that whenever ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf refers to different colors in different contexts. Here are the observed rules for determining the meaning of bluf:

Rule 1: When bluf appears after the word ""wif,"" it means red.
Rule 2: When bluf appears after the word ""zup,"" it means yellow.
Rule 3: When bluf appears after the word ""lug,"" it means blue.
Rule 4: When bluf appears after the word ""dax,"" it means green.

Therefore, the meaning of bluf is dependent on the preceding word and the corresponding color is determined based on the observed patterns in the examples.
walm -> color coding based on the following rule:
- If walm is preceded by ""lug"", the meaning is ""blue"".
- If walm is preceded by ""wif"", the meaning is ""red"".
- If walm is preceded by ""dax"", the meaning is ""green"".
- If walm is preceded by ""zup"", the meaning is ""yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color. Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears, it is associated with the color blue.
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to represent colors. In the given examples, it maps to different colors such as green, red, blue, and yellow. Therefore, ""dax"" appears to be a fake or nonce word used to represent different colors in the context of the examples.
wif -> color

Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" is associated with different colors. In each example, ""wif"" is followed by a particular color, and the output color corresponds to the repetition of the preceding color. For example, in the second example, ""lug walm wif lug"", ""wif"" is preceded by ""walm"" (yellow) and the following sequence of colors is ""blue blue blue red blue"". So, ""wif"" seems to represent the repetition of the preceding color.
zup -> color. The word ""zup"" seems to be associated with colors. The color can be determined based on the following pattern:
- If ""zup"" is followed by another word, the color is determined by that word. For example, ""zup bluf"" is associated with ""yellow"" because ""bluf"" is associated with ""yellow"" in the first example.
- If ""zup"" is followed by another instance of ""zup"", the color is determined by the first occurrence of ""zup"". For example, ""zup lug zup"" is associated with ""blue"" because the first occurrence of ""zup"" is associated with ""blue"".
- If ""zup"" is not followed by any other word, the color is not determined. For example, ""zup dax"" is not associated with any specific color.
Based on this pattern, the meaning of ""zup"" can be understood as a placeholder for a color in the given context.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent a color. It appears that the context of the surrounding words determines the specific color associated with ""bluf"". Based on the given examples, the following rule can be inferred:

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup"" or appears as the only word without any preceding words, it represents the color yellow. If ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax,"" it represents the color green. 

It's important to note that this conclusion is based solely on the given examples and may not be applicable or accurate in other contexts.
walm -> color. The color depends on the position of walm within the input sequence. The first occurrence of walm is always red. If walm occurs again, it is yellow. If it occurs for the third time or more, it is green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Rule: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" is consistently associated with the color blue.
dax -> color. 

Rule: The meaning of dax is determined by its position within the input. When dax appears at the beginning of a sequence, it represents the color green. When dax appears at the end of a sequence, it represents the color blue. When dax appears in the middle of a sequence, it represents the color red.
wif -> color

Rule: The word ""wif"" represents a color. The color is determined by the preceding words in the input examples.
zup -> color.

From the examples given, it can be deduced that ""zup"" is associated with colors. The first example, ""zup walm,"" suggests that the ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow since the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" Similarly, in the second example, ""zup wif,"" the output is ""yellow red,"" indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. 

In the third example, ""zup wif dax walm,"" we can see that ""zup"" is associated with yellow as the output starts with ""yellow."" Following the pattern from the previous examples, the remaining words correspond to the colors red, green, green, and green. 

In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup bluf,"" the ""zup"" is associated with yellow as the output starts with ""yellow."" 

Finally, in the last example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" we can see that ""zup"" is associated with yellow as the output starts with ""yellow."" The remaining words correspond to green, yellow, yellow, and red.

Based on these examples, it can be generalized that ""zup"" is used to denote the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: 
When ""bluf"" appears along with the words ""zup"" and ""lug"", it means ""yellow"".
When ""bluf"" appears alone or with the word ""wif"", it means ""red"".
When ""bluf"" appears along with the word ""dax"", it means ""green"".
walm -> color coding

The word ""walm"" appears in all the inputs, and it is associated with different colors in the outputs. Based on the examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents a color coding system. Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, it corresponds to a specific color in the output. 

From the examples, we can infer the following color mapping for ""walm"":
- First appearance of ""walm"" -> yellow
- Second appearance of ""walm"" -> green
- Third appearance of ""walm"" -> blue
- Fourth appearance of ""walm"" -> red

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is a color coding system with the specified mappings.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Rule: The word ""lug"" represents a color.
dax -> green. Rule: In this context, the word ""dax"" seems to be associated with the color green.
wif -> color, where the color is indicated by the previous word. The color assignment seems to follow a pattern: 

- When the previous word is ""lug"", the color is blue.
- When the previous word is ""zup"", the color is yellow.
- When the previous word is ""dax"", the color is green.
- When the previous word is ""walm"", the color is red.

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be a color, with the specific color being determined by the previous word.
zup -> yellow.

Based on the provided examples, we can observe that the word ""zup"" consistently refers to the color yellow. Therefore, the rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" has a specific meaning that can be deduced. By examining the patterns in the input-output pairs, we can infer the following rule:

bluf -> alternating colors

The word ""bluf"" seems to indicate that the colors in the input should alternate in the output. For example, in the first two examples, the colors ""red"" and ""red"" are repeated twice, indicating the rule of alternating colors. In the third example, the input ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" results in the output ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow,"" where the colors alternate. Similarly, in the fourth example, the input ""zup bluf dax"" results in the output ""yellow yellow green,"" where the colors alternate. Finally, in the fifth example, the input ""wif dax bluf"" results in the output ""red green green,"" where the colors also alternate.

Therefore, based on the given examples, it can be concluded that ""bluf"" means alternating colors.
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" appears to represent the color blue. In all examples, when ""walm"" is mentioned, the corresponding output is always ""blue.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> yellow. Rule: When lug appears alone, it signifies the color blue. When lug is followed by another word, the resulting color is determined by the following rule: 
- If the following word is walm, the resulting color is yellow.
- If the following word is wif, the resulting color is red.
- If the following word is bluf, the resulting color is blue.
dax -> color (specifically: red, green, or blue)
Rule: The meaning of dax is determined by the position of its occurrence in the sequence of words. If dax appears at the beginning of the sequence, it represents red. If it appears in the middle of the sequence, it represents green. If it appears at the end of the sequence, it represents blue.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" appears to be associated with colors, as seen in the examples where ""wif"" is followed by color words such as blue, red, green, and yellow. It seems that the color referred to by ""wif"" varies based on the context or input it is paired with.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears as a separate word in the input, it is associated with the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> color
Meaning: bluf is associated with different colors depending on the context.

Rule:
1. If bluf appears alone or after another color, it means yellow.
2. If bluf appears after two different colors, it means green.
3. If bluf appears after the same color twice, it means blue.
4. If bluf appears after three different colors, it means red.

Note: It is important to note that these rules are specific to the given examples and may not generalize to all instances of the word ""bluf"".
walm -> color sequence based on the position in the input phrase.

Meaning: The word ""walm"" appears in different positions in the input phrase and it determines the color sequence of the subsequent words. The colors associated with ""walm"" are:

Meaning: Dax seems to correspond to different colors depending on its context. In the given examples, ""dax"" mostly appears as green, suggesting that it might represent the color green. However, in the second example, ""dax"" is the only input word, and its output is ""green."" Therefore, it could be a specialized color that is consistently represented by green.
wif -> color

Meaning: wif appears to represent colors. In the provided examples, wif is replacing a specific color in each sentence. The order and repetition of the colors may provide clues as to their meaning. However, without additional information or context, it is difficult to determine a precise rule for mapping specific colors to wif.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever zup appears in the input, it is always associated with the color yellow in the output.
bluf -> color

Rule:
In the given examples, the word ""bluf"" is associated with different colors. The color associated with ""bluf"" is determined by the context in which it appears. The examples suggest that ""bluf"" is assigned the color based on the position of its previous occurrence. Specifically:

    Rules:
lug -> color

Rule:
The word ""lug"" seems to be associated with different colors in different contexts. In all examples, ""lug"" appears to be associated with the color blue. However, its meaning changes depending on the surrounding words. Specifically, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue when it is followed by another word, and that word determines the specific color. For example, in the second example ""dax lug wif lug,"" the first occurrence of ""lug"" is associated with the color green, while the second occurrence is associated with the color red. It is important to note that ""lug"" does not seem to have a consistent meaning when it appears on its own.
dax -> color

Meaning:
Dax refers to different colors based on the context. Based on the examples, it can mean green, yellow, or blue. The association of dax with a specific color seems to depend on its position in the input sequence. The rule for determining the meaning of dax can be described as follows:

Rule:
- If dax is the only word in the input sequence, it means green.
- If dax is followed by another word, it means the color associated with that word. The mapping between words and colors is as follows:
    - zup -> yellow
    - lug -> blue
    - wif -> red
    - walm -> green

Further examples could help confirm or refine this rule.
wif -> color

Meaning: wif represents colors. The specific mapping of wif to colors can vary depending on the example, but in general, wif seems to be a word used to indicate a color.
zup -> color

Meaning: The word ""zup"" seems to represent different colors based on the context. In the provided examples, ""zup"" corresponds to the colors green, yellow, and red, suggesting that ""zup"" represents colors in some sequence or pattern. The specific patterns are as follows:

Rule:
- When ""zup"" is surrounded by two instances of the same word (e.g., dax zup dax), it represents the color green.
- When ""zup"" appears at the beginning of the phrase and is followed by a different word (e.g., zup wif walm), it represents the color yellow.
- When ""zup"" appears in the middle of the phrase and is surrounded by different words (e.g., zup wif zup), it represents the color red.
- When ""zup"" appears by itself (e.g., zup lug), it represents the color blue.

Based on these examples, it seems that the meaning of ""zup"" is related to a color sequence or pattern. However, without additional context or information, it is challenging to determine the exact meaning or pattern beyond colors.
bluf -> color. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents a color, and the color it represents changes based on the context of the sentence or words around it.
walm -> color

Meaning: Walm seems to represent colors. Based on the examples, it appears that walm is associated with various shades of colors. 

Rule: The color associated with walm seems to be dependent on its position in the input sequence. In some cases, walm is preceded by a specific word (lug, dax, wif). However, in other cases, it is followed by a specific word. The specific color associated with walm depends on the context of the word before or after it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

zup -> color

Meaning: The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to a color. Based on the examples given, ""zup"" represents the color yellow.
bluf -> color. 

Rule: The color associated with ""bluf"" seems to be determined by the word preceding it in the input. The color assigned to ""bluf"" is based on a mapping of the word's color to the next word's color in the input. If the previous word is ""zup"", ""lug"", or ""wif"", then ""bluf"" is assigned the color yellow, blue, or red, respectively.
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the meaning of ""walm"" is most likely determined by the number of occurrences of ""walm"" within the sentence. 

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" is represented by the color of the word that directly follows it in the sentence.

Examples:
1. If ""walm"" appears once, the meaning is ""blue"".
2. If ""walm"" appears twice, the meaning is ""yellow"".
3. If ""walm"" appears three times, the meaning is ""green"".
4. If ""walm"" appears four times, the meaning is ""red"".

It is associated with ""green"" when it is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by a different word (zup or lug), and when it is the first word in the sentence. Finally, dax is associated with ""blue"" when it is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"" or ""bluf"".

Note: The examples provided are limited, so there might be additional rules or context-specific meanings for dax that are not explicitly captured.
wif -> color (blue, green, red, yellow)

Rule: The word ""wif"" is associated with colors. Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input is replaced with a specific color in the output. The color assignment seems to be arbitrary and context-dependent.
zup -> color

Meaning: zup seems to represent a color. It can be either blue or yellow, depending on the context. When zup is preceded or followed by other words, the color associated with zup seems to alternate between blue and yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf refers to different colors, specifically red, blue, and green, in different contexts. 

Rule: bluf is associated with the color red when it is preceded by ""wif"" or followed by ""dax"" (e.g., ""wif bluf"" -> red red). bluf is associated with the color blue when it is preceded by ""lug"" (e.g., ""lug bluf"" -> blue red red). bluf is associated with the color green when it is preceded by ""dax"" (e.g., ""dax bluf"" -> green green).
walm -> color based on position in the input sequence.

Rule: 
The word ""walm"" represents a color, and the color it represents is determined by its position in the input sequence. From the given examples, it can be observed that the color assigned to ""walm"" changes based on its position relative to other words.

In the first example, ""walm"" always corresponds to the color red when it is the last word in the sequence. In the second example, ""walm"" corresponds to the color red when it is the second-to-last word in the sequence. In the third example, ""walm"" corresponds to the color yellow when it is the fourth word in the sequence. In the fourth example, ""walm"" corresponds to the color red when it is the third word in the sequence. In the fifth example, ""walm"" corresponds to the color green when it is the fourth word in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule deduced is that the color assigned to ""walm"" is determined by its position in the input sequence, with different colors assigned to different positions.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is mentioned, it is associated with the color blue.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"", as it consistently appears in contexts where the output is ""green"".
wif -> color

Rule: The word ""wif"" is used to indicate a color. In the given examples, ""wif"" is always followed by a color term, such as ""zup"" (yellow), ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" (red), or ""dax"" (green). Therefore, ""wif"" can be understood to represent different colors based on the context in which it appears.
zup -> yellow. 

Meaning: In all the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> color

Rule: 

Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" represents a color. The color associated with ""bluf"" varies depending on the context, but it can refer to different colors such as yellow, green, blue, or red. Therefore, the exact meaning of ""bluf"" is determined by the specific context in which it is used.
walm -> color

Meaning: The word ""walm"" appears to correspond to different colors in the given examples. The rule can be inferred as follows:

- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" or ""zup"", it corresponds to the color green.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""wif"", it corresponds to the color red.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug"", it corresponds to the color blue.
- When ""walm"" appears before ""zup"", it corresponds to the color yellow.

Therefore, the general rule is that ""walm"" takes on a color based on the preceding or following words in the given examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In the given examples, when the word ""lug"" appears, it is associated with the color blue.
dax -> color
Meaning: The word ""dax"" represents different colors based on the context.

Rule: 
1. If ""dax"" appears at the beginning or end of a sentence without any other words, it represents the color green.
2. If ""dax"" appears between two instances of the word ""lug"", it represents the color blue.
3. If ""dax"" appears after the word ""zup"", it represents the color yellow.
4. If ""dax"" appears in a sequence alternating between ""lug"" and ""zup"", it represents a sequence of colors: blue, yellow, blue, yellow, and so on.
wif -> color.

Based on the examples, it can be observed that the word ""wif"" is associated with colors. The color assigned to ""wif"" in each example determines the color of the following words. 

Example 1: ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue""
In this example, ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"", so the subsequent words ""bluf"" and ""lug"" are also assigned the color ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively.

Example 2: ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
Similarly, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" which results in ""walm"" and ""dax"" being assigned the colors ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.

By analyzing all the examples, we can deduce the following rule: 
If ""wif"" is associated with a certain color, then each subsequent word is assigned the same color as ""wif"", with the color changing with each occurrence of ""wif"". If ""wif"" appears multiple times, the color assignment restarts with the first occurrence of ""wif"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents a color. Based on the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" can take on the following color values:

- ""lug"" in the presence of ""dax"" represents green.
- ""lug"" in the presence of ""bluf"" represents blue.
- ""lug"" in the presence of both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" represents green followed by blue.
- If ""lug"" appears after ""zup bluf"" or ""zup lug zup wif"", it represents blue.
- If ""lug"" appears after ""zup bluf lug dax"" or ""zup lug zup wif dax"", it represents blue followed by green. 
- If ""lug"" appears after ""zup bluf lug dax lug"", it represents blue followed by green followed by blue.
- If ""lug"" appears after ""zup bluf lug dax lug dax"", it represents blue followed by green followed by blue followed by green.
dax -> color. The color associated with the word ""dax"" changes based on the words that appear before and after it in the sequence. The mapping of words to colors is as follows:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> green
- walm -> red

Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" is determined by the colors associated with the adjacent words in the sequence.
wif -> color

Meaning: The word ""wif"" represents a color. 

Rule: The color represented by ""wif"" is determined by its position in the input, with each position corresponding to a specific color. 

Position 1 - red
Position 2 - blue
Position 3 - green

Explanation:
Based on the given examples, we can observe that the position of ""wif"" in the input determines the color it represents in the output. 

Example 1:
Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green
""wif"" is in position 1, so it represents the color red in the output.

Example 2:
Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
""wif"" is in position 1, so it represents the color red in both occurrences in the output.

Example 3:
Input: wif
Output: red
""wif"" is in position 1, so it represents the color red in the output.

Example 4:
Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red
""wif"" is in position 3, so it represents the color green in the output.

Example 5:
Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red
""wif"" is in position 6, so it represents the color red in the output.

Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule is that the word ""wif"" represents a specific color based on its position in the input.
zup -> color. The word zup seems to be associated with different colors in different examples. In the given examples, zup is associated with the colors yellow, blue, and red. Therefore, the general rule seems to be that zup is a placeholder for a color.

Meaning: bluf is associated with different colors depending on the context. The following rules can be observed:

Rule 1: If bluf is followed by another word, it is associated with the color green.
Example: ""bluf lug"" -> green green

Rule 2: If bluf is the last word in the input sequence, it is associated with the color red.
Example: ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> red red blue yellow

Rule 3: If bluf is preceded by a different nonce word (dax or zup), it is associated with the color yellow.
Example: ""zup bluf dax lug"" -> yellow yellow green blue

Based on the examples provided, these rules can be used to determine the meaning of the nonce word bluf in different contexts.
walm -> color based on the following rule:
- If walm appears after dax, its color is green.
- If walm appears after wif or zup, its color is red or yellow, respectively.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: Lug seems to represent different colors in each example. The meaning of lug is context-dependent. In the first example, lug means ""blue"" and ""yellow."" In the second example, lug means ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green."" In the third example, lug means ""green"" and ""blue."" In the fourth example, lug means ""blue,"" ""green,"" ""red,"" and ""blue"" again. In the fifth example, lug means ""yellow"" and ""blue."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug represents a color, with different colors assigned to lug based on the context.
dax -> color. The color associated with ""dax"" seems to vary depending on its position in the sequence. In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to the colors yellow, red, and green. In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to the colors green, blue, and red. In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to the colors green, yellow, blue, and red. From this, we can deduce that the meaning of ""dax"" is related to colors, and its specific color is determined by its position in the sequence.
wif -> color. Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to colors, where ""red"" corresponds to ""dax"", ""green"" corresponds to ""lug"", and ""blue"" corresponds to ""walm"" or ""lug"" depending on the context.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors based on the context. From the examples given, we can deduce the following rules:

Rule 1: When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by another instance of ""bluf"", the color is red.
Example: wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red

Rule 2: When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by another instance of ""bluf"", the color is blue.
Example: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow

Rule 3: When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and not followed by another instance of ""bluf"", the color is red.
Example: wif bluf lug -> red red blue

Rule 4: When ""bluf"" is preceded by a word that is not ""wif"" and not followed by another instance of ""bluf"", the color is the one mentioned in the example.
Example: dax wif bluf -> green red red

Rule 5: When ""bluf"" is not preceded by any word and not followed by another instance of ""bluf"", the color is yellow.
Example: zup bluf -> yellow yellow
walm -> color
Meaning: The word ""walm"" seems to represent a color. Based on the given examples, the color represented by ""walm"" can be determined by looking at the adjacent words. The following rules can be deduced:

1. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax"", the color is blue.
2. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""lug"", the color is green.
3. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax"", the color is yellow.
4. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax"", the color is red.

These rules are consistent with the provided examples, and they can be used to determine the color associated with the nonce word ""walm"" in new sentences.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" always translates to the color ""blue.""
dax -> color

Meaning: Dax seems to represent a color in the given examples. Based on the examples provided, the following rules can be deduced:

Rule 1: If ""dax"" is present in the input sequence, it corresponds to the color green in the output sequence.

Rule 2: The position of ""dax"" in the input sequence determines its position as a color in the output sequence. For example, ""dax"" in the first position corresponds to the first color in the output sequence, ""dax"" in the second position corresponds to the second color, and so on.

Based on this analysis, the word ""dax"" can be interpreted as representing colors, specifically the color green.
wif -> color. The color assigned to ""wif"" seems to vary based on the surrounding words. Here are the rules observed from the given examples:

1. If ""wif"" is preceded and followed by the same word, then ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
   - Example: ""wif zup lug wif"" -> red yellow blue red

2. If ""wif"" is the sole word provided, then ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
   - Example: ""wif"" -> red

3. If ""wif"" is preceded by a word and followed by a different word, then ""wif"" is associated with the color yellow.
   - Example: ""zup wif"" -> yellow red

4. If ""wif"" is preceded by a word and followed by the same word, then ""wif"" is associated with the color green.
   - Example: ""dax walm wif dax"" -> green green green red green

Based on these rules, the meaning of ""wif"" appears to represent different colors based on the context in which it is used.
zup -> color

Based on the given examples, it can be inferred that ""zup"" refers to colors. In the first example, ""zup"" is associated with the color sequence ""green green red blue yellow."" In subsequent examples, ""zup"" is consistently linked to specific colors such as yellow, blue, and green. Therefore, the rule deduced is that ""zup"" represents colors.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf refers to a color. The examples show that whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, it is associated with a specific color. The color changes based on the context, but there is a consistent pattern:

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" it is associated with yellow.
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" it is associated with green.
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" it is associated with blue.
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" it is associated with red.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf color associations:
- If bluf follows zup, it means yellow.
- If bluf follows dax, it means green.
- If bluf follows lug, it means blue.
- If bluf follows wif, it means red.
walm -> green

Meaning: The word ""walm"" seems to represent the color green in the given examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever ""lug"" is present, the corresponding output is always ""blue"".
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" in the given examples appears to be a color. The word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green in the outputs.
wif -> color. The color associated with ""wif"" changes based on the context:

Rule: 
- If ""wif"" is preceded or followed by other words (e.g. ""wif lug"" or ""dax walm wif bluf""), it corresponds to the colors mentioned in the output. For example, in the first input, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" and in the second input, it corresponds to the colors ""green"" and ""red"".
- If ""wif"" is used alone (e.g. ""wif""), it corresponds to a single color mentioned in the output. For example, in the fourth input, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""wif"" can also be used in combination with other words (e.g. ""wif dax bluf""), and in that case, the color associated with ""wif"" is mentioned after it. For example, in the fifth input, ""wif"" corresponds to the colors ""green"" and ""green"".
zup -> color

Meaning: The word ""zup"" seems to be associated with different colors in each example. In the first example, ""zup"" is correlated with the colors blue and yellow. In the second example, ""zup"" is correlated with the colors green and yellow. In the third and fourth examples, ""zup"" is only associated with the color yellow. In the fifth example, ""zup"" is connected to the colors yellow, green, and blue. Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" represents the concept of colors, and its specific meaning depends on the context in which it appears.
bluf -> yellow/blue/green.

From the examples given, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is associated with either the color yellow, blue, or green. It is not clear from the examples alone what determines the specific color association for ""bluf"", as there are instances of ""bluf"" being associated with different colors in different contexts.
walm -> color. 

Color is determined by the position of walm within the input sequence. The colors are assigned based on the following rules:
- If walm is the first word in the sequence, it is assigned the color red.
- If walm is the second word in the sequence, it is assigned the color green.
- If walm is the third word in the sequence, it is assigned the color yellow.
- If walm is the fourth word in the sequence, it is assigned the color blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning:

Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" is associated with different colors. The word ""lug"" seems to act as a color indicator, with each occurrence of ""lug"" specifying a different color. The color associated with ""lug"" is then used in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> color

Where ""color"" represents a specific color such as yellow, green, red, or blue.
dax -> color
Meaning:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" is associated with different colors. In particular, ""dax"" appears to be associated with the following colors:
- ""dax"" is associated with yellow in the first example (""zup wif zup dax"").
- ""dax"" is associated with red in the second and third examples (""wif dax"").
- ""dax"" is associated with green in the fourth and fifth examples (""wif dax lug"" and ""dax"").

Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of ""dax"" is related to colors. Without more examples or context, it is difficult to determine a more specific meaning for ""dax.""
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to represent different colors depending on its context. In the given examples, it consistently maps to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: zup refers to the color yellow.

Examples:
zup -> yellow
zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Therefore, the conclusion is: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the previous word in the sentence.
walm -> color. The color associated with ""walm"" appears to be based on the positions of other colors in the input sequence. Here is the rule:
- If ""walm"" appears after a color word, the color associated with ""walm"" is the same as the previous color word.
- If ""walm"" appears at the beginning or after non-color words, the color associated with ""walm"" is completely dependent on the context. There is not enough information to determine a specific rule for assigning the color in these cases.

However, it's important to note that ""walm"" is a nonce word, and its meaning may not be directly related to color in a real-world context. These rules are derived solely based on the examples provided.

bluf -> color coding based on the position in the input sentence

Meaning:
Rule: The word ""bluf"" is color-coded based on its position in the input sentence.

Explanation:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on its position relative to other words in the input sentence. The color coding in the outputs suggests that ""bluf"" is assigned a color based on its position.

- When ""bluf"" is the first word (e.g., zup wif bluf), it is assigned the color yellow.
- When ""bluf"" is the second word (e.g., wif bluf dax), it is assigned the color red.
- When ""bluf"" is the third word (e.g., zup bluf dax), it is assigned the color yellow again.
- When ""bluf"" is the second-to-last word (e.g., wif bluf dax lug), it is assigned the color red again.
- When ""bluf"" is the last word (e.g., lug bluf), it is assigned the color blue.

Based on these patterns, the rule for determining the color of ""bluf"" appears to be:
- If ""bluf"" is the first word, assign it the color yellow.
- If ""bluf"" is the second word, assign it the color red.
- If ""bluf"" is the third word, assign it the color yellow.
- If ""bluf"" is the second-to-last word, assign it the color red.
- If ""bluf"" is the last word, assign it the color blue.

Therefore, one possible interpretation is that ""bluf"" is color-coded based on its position in the input sentence.
walm -> color code

Explanation:
From the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" represents a color code. Each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input is followed by a specific color, and the output is a representation of the sequence of colors mentioned after ""walm"".

The possible color codes identified in the examples are:
- ""walm"" followed by ""lug"" represents the color blue.
- ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" represents the color red.
- ""walm"" followed by ""zup"" represents the color yellow.
- ""walm"" followed by ""dax"" represents the color green.

Therefore, we can conclude that the meaning of ""walm"" is a color code.

    Rules:
lug -> color (green, blue, red, yellow, etc.)

Rule:
Based on the examples, it seems that lug is associated with colors. The specific color associated with lug can vary from example to example, but it follows a pattern. The color associated with lug seems to be determined by the other words in the input sequence. So, we can infer that lug represents a color that is based on the surrounding context.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" seems to correspond to different colors based on the examples. In the first example, ""dax wif dax"" maps to ""green red green"", suggesting that ""dax"" represents the color green. In the second example, ""dax zup"" maps to ""green yellow"", reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" means green. The third and fourth examples further support this by mapping ""dax"" to ""green"" without any other words. Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" is an indicator for the color green.
wif -> red in the context of ""wif lug""
wif -> red, bluf in the context of ""wif bluf lug zup""
wif -> red in the context of ""wif lug""
wif -> yellow in the context of ""zup wif""

lug -> blue

Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to refer to the color blue. The examples consistently show that when ""lug"" is present, the subsequent word or words tend to be associated with the color blue.
dax -> color

Meaning: Dax seems to represent different colors in different contexts. From the examples provided, we can see that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in isolation (Input: dax, Output: green). However, when ""dax"" is mentioned within a sequence of other words, it represents different colors. For example, it represents ""green"" in the sequence ""dax zup dax walm"" (Output: green yellow green green green) and ""blue"" in the sequence ""lug zup dax lug dax"" (Output: blue yellow green blue green).

Rule: The color represented by ""dax"" depends on its position within a sequence of words. If ""dax"" is mentioned in isolation, it corresponds to the color ""green"". If ""dax"" is mentioned within a sequence of words, its color is determined by the context, possibly following a pattern that is not explicitly clear from the examples provided.

zup -> color

Meaning: zup represents a color, which can be either green, red, or yellow. The specific color represented by zup depends on its context within the examples. 

Rule: 
- If zup appears alone, it represents the color yellow. 
- If zup appears before another word, it represents the color red. 
- If zup appears after another word, it represents the color green.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents different colors based on the context. The following rules can be observed:

Rule 1: If bluf is preceded by a color word (e.g., dax, lug, wif), bluf represents the color that corresponds to that word in the output.

Rule 2: If bluf is the first word in the input, the meaning of bluf is red.

Overall, the exact color represented by bluf can vary, but it is dependent on the surrounding words in the input sequence.

When ""dax"" appears at the beginning, it corresponds to the color in the output. When ""dax"" appears after another word, it causes the word before it to change color in the output. Based on the examples, the following associations can be made:

- When ""dax"" appears at the beginning of the sentence, it means green.
- When ""dax"" appears after another word, it changes the color of that word to green. For example, ""lug"" becomes blue and ""walm"" becomes red when followed by ""dax"".
- The colors yellow and green are also associated with ""dax"", but they are context-dependent and the exact rule is unclear.
wif -> color

Meaning:
The word ""wif"" represents different colors based on its context. In the given examples, ""wif"" is used to indicate a color. For example, ""wif"" is associated with the color green in the first example, red in the second and third examples, and so on.

Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: 
If ""lug"" appears alone, it means ""blue"".
If ""lug"" appears in a sequence of words along with other words, it represents colors. The color assigned to ""lug"" depends on its position in the sequence. For example, if ""lug"" is the first word in the sequence, it represents ""green"". If ""lug"" is the second word, it represents ""yellow"". If ""lug"" is the third word, it represents ""red"".
dax -> color. 

Meaning: dax represents a color, and its meaning changes depending on its position in the input. 

Rule: 
1. If dax is the first word in the input, it represents the color green.
2. If dax is the second word in the input, it represents the color blue.
3. If dax is the third word in the input, it represents the color yellow.
4. If dax is the fourth word in the input, it represents the color green.
5. If dax is the fifth word in the input, it represents the color red.

Note: The meaning of dax is context-dependent, and its position in the input determines its meaning.
wif -> color. The color associated with 'wif' changes in each example, so it does not have a fixed meaning. Instead, it represents a variable that takes on different values based on the context.
zup -> color. The word ""zup"" appears in all the examples and is consistently associated with the color yellow in the output. Thus, we can deduce that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
bluf -> color

Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" is associated with colors. The color seems to be determined based on the word that precedes ""bluf"". Here are the observed patterns:

1. If the preceding word is ""zup"", then ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
2. If the preceding word is ""wif"", then ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
3. If the preceding word is ""lug"", then ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
4. If the preceding word is ""dax"", then ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

The general rule can be stated as follows:
- If the preceding word is one of the specified words (zup, wif, lug, dax), the color associated with ""bluf"" is determined by that word.

It is important to note that these conclusions are based solely on the given examples, and the full context or additional information may provide further insights or variations in the interpretation of ""bluf"".

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" represents different colors. The color associated with ""lug"" varies across different instances, suggesting that it could be a placeholder for any color.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, it can be observed that whenever the word ""dax"" appears, it is followed by a color word. The color word that follows ""dax"" determines its meaning. In all the examples provided, ""dax"" is followed by one or more color words (e.g., bluf, walm, zup, lug) and the corresponding output color is always green. Therefore, the rule can be formulated as ""dax"" is equivalent to the color green.
wif -> color (red, green, yellow, or blue). Rule: In the given examples, the word ""wif"" is consistently associated with colors.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, with each occurrence of ""bluf"" indicating a specific color in the sequence of outputs. The specific color can vary in different examples, but it is consistent within each example.
walm -> color. The color associated with ""walm"" seems to change depending on the order of appearance in the input. Specifically, when ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and ""dax"", it is associated with the color ""red"". When ""walm"" comes after only ""dax"", it is associated with the color ""green"". When ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and ""dax"", but before ""zup"", it is associated with the color ""yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,145
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Meaning: In all of the examples, the word ""lug"" is consistently associated with the color ""blue"". It can be inferred that ""lug"" means ""blue"".
dax -> color. The meaning of the word ""dax"" appears to represent a color, with the color being determined by the surrounding words. The following rule can be observed based on the provided examples:
- When ""dax"" is preceded by another word, the color corresponding to that word is assigned to ""dax"".
- If ""dax"" is the only word, then it represents the color green.

So, ""dax"" can be interpreted as an arbitrary placeholder for a color, depending on the context.
wif -> color code

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" is a color code. Each occurrence of ""wif"" is followed by one or more colors, and each color corresponds to an output in the same order. For example, the input ""zup wif"" produces the output ""yellow red"", where ""yellow"" corresponds to the first occurrence of ""wif"" and ""red"" corresponds to the second occurrence.

In general, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it assigns colors to subsequent words, forming a color sequence.
zup -> color

Rule:
The word ""zup"" seems to represent different colors in each example. In the given examples, ""zup"" is associated with the colors blue, yellow, green, and red. Looking at the examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color in the middle of the color sequence mentioned in the input. 

For instance, in the first example ""lug zup lug,"" the color sequence is blue-yellow-blue. So, ""zup"" in this context refers to yellow. Similarly, in the second example ""dax lug zup,"" the color sequence is green-blue-yellow. Hence, ""zup"" represents the color blue.

Based on this observation, the rule connecting ""zup"" to its meaning can be defined as follows:

Rule: The meaning of the word ""zup"" is the color in the middle of the color sequence mentioned in the input.
bluf -> color

Rule: bluf represents a color, with ""blue"" representing bluf in the first position, ""red"" representing bluf in the second position, and ""yellow"" representing bluf in the third position. The color assigned to bluf depends on the context and may vary in different positions.
walm -> color

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to refer to a color. The color is determined by the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. In each example, the word before ""walm"" indicates the color to be repeated, while the words after ""walm"" determine the number of times the color is repeated in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"".
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to correspond to different colors in the given examples. This conclusion is supported by the fact that in the examples where ""dax"" appears alone, it is associated with a specific color (green). Additionally, in the examples where ""dax"" appears in combination with other words, the resulting output contains color labels (red, blue, yellow). Therefore, it can be inferred that ""dax"" is a nonce word representing colors.
wif -> red. 

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, it is associated with the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" is a nonce word that consistently translates to the color yellow.
bluf -> color sequence

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" is representing a sequence of colors. Based on the examples, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a specific color sequence. The color sequence can be represented using specific colors such as red, yellow, blue, and green.

Rule: The color sequence represented by ""bluf"" follows a specific order, where the number and specific colors are determined based on the input. The following rules can be inferred from the examples:

1. If ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup,"" it represents a yellow-yellow-green sequence.
2. If ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" it represents a red-red-blue-yellow sequence.
3. If ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax,"" it represents a green-green-blue-red sequence.

Based on the given examples, the specific color sequence represented by ""bluf"" is dependent on the preceding words in the input, indicating a pattern or rule in the association between ""bluf"" and the corresponding color sequence.
walm -> color representation

Rule: The word ""walm"" is used to represent colors. Each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The specific color represented by ""walm"" is determined by the context and can be any color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: lug corresponds to a color. Based on the examples, it appears that ""lug"" can represent different colors, with each distinct occurrence of ""lug"" representing a different color. The following mappings can be inferred from the examples:

lug -> yellow
lug -> blue
lug -> green

Therefore, the general rule would be that ""lug"" represents a color, but the specific color depends on the context in which it appears.
dax -> color 

Meaning: The word ""dax"" represents different colors in different contexts. The color assigned to ""dax"" is determined by the position of ""dax"" in the sentence or the presence of other specific words. 

Rule:
- If ""dax"" is the only word in the sentence, it represents the color green.
- If ""dax"" is the first word in the sentence, it represents the color blue.
- If ""dax"" is the second word in the sentence, it represents the color red.
- If ""dax"" is the third word in the sentence, it represents the color yellow.
- If ""dax"" is preceded by the word ""wif"", it represents the color green.
- If ""dax"" is followed by the word ""bluf"", it represents the color green.
wif -> color. The color represented by ""wif"" seems to be dependent on the words that come before it in the input sequence. Here is a breakdown of the color associations based on the given examples:

- ""wif"" is associated with ""yellow"" when preceded by the word ""zup"".
- ""wif"" is associated with ""green"" when preceded by the word ""dax"".
- ""wif"" is associated with ""blue"" when preceded by the word ""lug"".
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" when preceded by any other word.

Based on this, the rule for the color association seems to be:

If the preceding word is ""zup"" then ""wif"" means ""yellow"".
If the preceding word is ""dax"" then ""wif"" means ""green"".
If the preceding word is ""lug"" then ""wif"" means ""blue"".
Otherwise, ""wif"" means ""red"".
zup -> color

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" is associated with colors. In the first example, ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green"" where ""yellow"" is associated with ""zup"". In the second example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" translates to ""green green red yellow red"", again associating ""yellow"" with ""zup"". In the fourth example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"". Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug zup dax lug dax"" translates to ""blue yellow green blue green"", once more associating ""yellow"" with ""zup"". Therefore, it can be concluded that in the given context, ""zup"" most likely refers to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> color. The color represented by ""bluf"" changes in each example, but it seems to correlate with certain patterns in the input. 

Rule: In the context of these examples, ""bluf"" represents a color that is the same as the color of the previous word in the sequence, unless the previous word is ""walm."" If the previous word is ""walm,"" then ""bluf"" represents the color red.
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" seems to correspond to different colors based on the context. In each example, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of other words, and each word corresponds to a specific color. The color associated with ""walm"" appears to be consistently repeated for the consecutive occurrences of ""walm"" within the same input, suggesting a rule that each instance of ""walm"" represents the same color.

zup -> color sequence. The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to a sequence of colors. Based on the examples, ""zup"" appears to be associated with the following colors:

- Yellow
- Red
- Green
- Blue

The specific order of the colors is given by the order in which ""zup"" appears in the sentence. For example, in the first example (""zup wif zup dax""), the colors are yellow, red, yellow, and green, corresponding to the occurrence of ""zup"" in the sentence. Therefore, the general rule seems to be that ""zup"" indicates a sequence of colors.
bluf -> color

Rule:
The word ""bluf"" is associated with colors, specifically the colors red, yellow, blue, and green. The first occurrence of ""bluf"" in each input sentence corresponds to the color red, the second occurrence corresponds to yellow, the third occurrence corresponds to blue, and the fourth occurrence corresponds to green.
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" seems to refer to different colors based on its position in a sentence. If ""walm"" is the first word in a sentence, it corresponds to the color yellow. If it is the last word in a sentence, it corresponds to the color blue. If it is in between other words, it corresponds to the color green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue.

Rule: In all examples, when the word ""lug"" is present, it corresponds to the color blue in the output.
dax -> color
Rule: The meaning of dax in this context is a color. The color is determined by the word that follows it. In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" which maps to ""blue"" and in the second example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" which maps to ""green"". The color mapping continues for subsequent occurrences of ""dax"" in the examples.
wif -> color

Meaning: wif is a word that represents a color. Based on the examples, it appears that wif is a code word for the colors red and green.
zup -> color

Rule: 
- When zup is followed by dax, the meaning is yellow.
- When zup is followed by lug, the meaning is blue.
- When zup is followed by wif, the meaning is green.
- When zup is followed by any other word, the meaning is red.
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors in different contexts. In the given examples, ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the following colors:

- Example 1: bluf -> blue
- Example 2: bluf -> red
- Example 3: bluf -> green
- Example 4: bluf -> yellow
- Example 5: bluf -> green

Based on these examples, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" in context refers to the color described in the corresponding output.
walm -> color

Meaning: The word ""walm"" seems to represent different colors based on its context. In all the examples, ""walm"" is consistently associated with certain colors. For example:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is associated with the color ""green"" for three out of four occurrences.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is associated with the colors ""green"" and ""red"" in a specific pattern.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is associated with the colors ""yellow"" and ""blue"" in a specific pattern.

Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" represents the color of the object it is associated with in the context. The specific colors associated with ""walm"" may vary in different contexts, but it appears to have a consistent meaning related to colors.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Meaning: In the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> color mapping. The color associated with ""dax"" seems to vary depending on the presence or absence of certain words in the input. The rules can be summarized as follows:

- If ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""wif"", then it corresponds to the colors ""green"", ""blue"", and ""red"" in that order.
- If ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""walm"", then it corresponds to the colors ""green"", ""blue"", ""blue"", and ""blue"" in that order.
- If ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"", then it corresponds to the colors ""green"" and ""red"" in that order.
- If ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"", ""walm"", ""lug"", and ""zup"", then it corresponds to the colors ""green"", ""red"", ""red"", ""red"", ""blue"", ""yellow"", ""yellow"", and ""yellow"" in that order.
- If ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"", then it corresponds to the colors ""yellow"" and ""green"" in that order.

These rules suggest that the meaning of ""dax"" is not fixed but rather context-dependent, representing different color associations based on the specific words present in the input.
wif -> color. The color associated with ""wif"" seems to change based on the words before it. The color is determined by looking at the first letter of the preceding word. If the first letter is ""l"", then ""wif"" is associated with the color blue. If the first letter is ""d"", then ""wif"" is associated with the color green. If the first letter is ""b"", then ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
zup -> color. The word ""zup"" seems to correspond to a color, specifically yellow. This can be inferred from the first four examples where ""zup"" is always followed by a color word (lug, walm, bluf) which gets translated into a specific color (blue, red, yellow) in the output. In the last example, ""zup"" appears twice and both times it is followed by a color word (dax, wif) which again gets translated into a color (green, yellow) in the output. Therefore, it can be concluded that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with colors. The associated colors are determined by the position of ""bluf"" in the input. 

In the first example, ""bluf"" is the third word from the left, so it corresponds to the color ""blue"". In the second example, ""bluf"" is the fourth word from the left, so it corresponds to the color ""blue"" again. In the third example, ""bluf"" is the second word from the left, so it corresponds to the color ""green"". In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is the third word from the left, so it corresponds to the color ""yellow"". In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is the fourth word from the left, so it corresponds to the color ""red"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that the position of ""bluf"" in the input determines the associated color.
walm -> color of the previous word

Meaning: The word ""walm"" seems to indicate the color of the previous word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color. Rule: The word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue in all cases provided.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors based on the context it is used in. From the examples provided, we can gather that ""dax"" corresponds to the following colors:

- ""dax"" with zup is yellow
- ""dax"" with walm is red
- ""dax"" with bluf is green
- ""dax"" with lug is blue

The color corresponding to ""dax"" seems to be dependent on the preceding and/or following words in the sequence.
wif -> red

From the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" has a consistent meaning of ""red"". In all the examples, whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is always ""red"". Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is that it corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: zup is equivalent to the color yellow in the given context.
bluf -> color. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be associated with colors. In general, ""bluf"" appears to represent the color blue.
walm -> color. The meaning of ""walm"" appears to be a color. In the provided examples, ""walm"" is associated with the colors green and red in the first example, green in the second example, and blue and yellow in the later examples. This suggests that the meaning of ""walm"" is related to colors, specifically green, blue, and red, depending on the context.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is always ""blue"".
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" appears to be associated with colors in the given examples. It seems that ""dax"" is used to indicate a color, with different colors being represented by different words in the output. The specific mapping of colors to words is as follows based on the examples:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""walm"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue

Therefore, in the context of these examples, the word ""dax"" seems to represent the color green.
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" always means ""red"" in this context.
zup -> blue
zup -> yellow

Meaning: zup could refer to the color blue or the color yellow, depending on the context. The rule seems to be that zup represents a color.
bluf -> color of the objects in the sequence.

Meaning: the word ""bluf"" represents the color of the objects in the given sequence.

Rule: The color assigned to ""bluf"" is based on the position of the object relative to ""bluf"" in the sequence. The color assignment follows the pattern:

- If an object comes before ""bluf"" in the sequence, it is assigned the color red.
- If an object comes after ""bluf"" in the sequence, it is assigned the color green.
- If ""bluf"" itself is the last object in the sequence, it is assigned the color blue.
- If ""bluf"" is the only object in the sequence, it is assigned a specific meaning depending on the context.

Please note that the given examples are specific to this problem and may not hold true in other contexts.
walm -> color
Meaning: walm represents a color. The color of walm can be determined by looking at the preceding words in the input sequence. Based on the given examples, it seems that the color of walm is related to the number and types of preceding colors. Here is a possible rule deduced from the examples: 

Rule: 
- If there is only one preceding color word, walm represents the same color as the preceding word.
- If there are multiple preceding color words, walm represents the color that appears the most among the preceding words.

This rule can be seen in action in the examples:
- In the first example, ""dax"" is the only preceding color word, which is green. So, walm is green.
- In the second example, ""zup"" and ""wif"" are the preceding color words. The most common color among them is red. So, walm is red.
- In the third example, ""dax"" and ""lug"" are the preceding color words. The most common color among them is blue. So, walm is blue. 

Based on these observations, the rule can be extended to handle cases with more complex input sequences as well.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: The word ""lug"" is associated with colors. The color assigned to ""lug"" depends on its position in the input sequence, following a specific pattern.

Rule:
If ""lug"" is the first word in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"".
If ""lug"" is the second word in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"".
If ""lug"" is the third word in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"".
If ""lug"" is the fourth word in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

This pattern repeats for subsequent occurrences of ""lug"" in the input sequence.
dax -> color (green, yellow, blue, red)

Rule: In the given context, ""dax"" represents different colors, including green, blue, yellow, and red, depending on the surrounding words.
wif -> color

Meaning: The word ""wif"" seems to represent different colors based on the context. It can be interpreted as follows:

Rule: If ""wif"" appears at the beginning of a sentence, it represents the color red.
Rule: If ""wif"" appears after another color word, it represents the next color in the sequence of blue, green, yellow, red (looping back to blue).
zup -> color sequence

Meaning: The word ""zup"" represents a sequence of colors. Based on the examples provided, the color sequence associated with ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

- In the first example (""wif zup""), ""zup"" is associated with the colors ""red"" and ""yellow"".
- In the second example (""dax zup dax""), ""zup"" is associated with the colors ""green"", ""yellow"", and ""green"".
- In the third example (""dax lug zup""), ""zup"" is associated with the colors ""green"", ""blue"", and ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example (""zup dax walm""), ""zup"" is associated with the colors ""yellow"", ""green"", ""green"", and ""green"".
- In the fifth example (""zup bluf dax lug""), ""zup"" is associated with the colors ""yellow"", ""yellow"", ""green"", and ""blue"".

Based on these examples, it can be inferred that ""zup"" represents a sequence of colors, where the colors may vary in each occurrence of ""zup"".
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent colors based on the given examples. The color corresponding to ""bluf"" can change depending on its position in the sentence. Here are the rules deduced from the examples:

1. When ""bluf"" is the first word in the sentence, it corresponds to the color yellow.
2. When ""bluf"" is the second word in the sentence, it corresponds to the color red.
3. When ""bluf"" is the third word in the sentence, it corresponds to the color blue.
4. When ""bluf"" is the fourth word in the sentence, it corresponds to the color green.

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as follows:
bluf (1st word) -> yellow
bluf (2nd word) -> red
bluf (3rd word) -> blue
bluf (4th word) -> green
walm -> color

Meaning: walm seems to represent different colors in the given examples. Based on the outputs, we can deduce that ""walm"" corresponds to different colors such as yellow, green, blue, and red.
