    Rules:
lug -> color

Rule:
The word ""lug"" represents different colors based on its context. In the given examples, the word ""lug"" is associated with the following colors:

1. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> blue blue blue green red blue red
2. ""zup lug dax"" -> yellow blue green
3. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. ""lug"" -> blue
5. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" -> yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

From these examples, it can be observed that ""lug"" is consistently associated with the color blue. However, there are also instances where ""lug"" is associated with the colors yellow and green, depending on the surrounding words. Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" can be deduced as a word that represents different colors based on its context.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to be used to represent different colors in different contexts. In the given examples, ""dax"" is used to represent the colors green, red, yellow, and blue.
wif -> color

Meaning: The word ""wif"" seems to represent colors. Based on the examples provided, the following rules can be deduced:

1. ""wif"" on its own represents the color red.
2. When ""wif"" is followed by another word, it represents the colors red and blue respectively.
3. In some cases, the appearance of ""wif"" can affect the order of colors provided. For example, if ""wif"" appears after other words, it changes the order of the colors to yellow-red-red-red-blue.

Overall, the word ""wif"" appears to be a marker for different colors, with specific rules for its usage depending on the context.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: In the given examples, whenever the word ""zup"" is mentioned, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

bluf -> color mapping based on the examples given

Rule: 
bluf maps to colors in the following order - red, green, yellow, blue

Explanation:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" is associated with colors. In each example, ""bluf"" is followed by a color. The order of the colors in the output corresponds to the order in which ""bluf"" appears in the input.

Example 1: ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
The word ""bluf"" is the third word in the input and is followed by the colors red, green, and green in the output.

Example 2: ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
The word ""bluf"" is the second word in the input and is followed by the colors yellow and yellow in the output.

Based on these patterns, we can infer the general rule that ""bluf"" maps to colors in the following order: red, green, yellow, and blue.
walm -> colors. The word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a color, specifically green, yellow, or red. The rule that can be deduced from the examples is that when ""walm"" is present, it is followed by the repetition of a color.

dax -> color, specifically green. Rule: When the word ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the color green.
wif -> color

Meaning: wif is associated with different colors in different contexts. The specific color associated with wif depends on the other words in the input. Based on the examples given, the color associated with wif can be determined as follows:

- If wif is preceded by zup and followed by zup, the color is yellow.
- If wif is preceded by dax and followed by lug, the color is green.
- If wif is preceded by lug and followed by zup and bluf, the color is red.
- If wif is followed by lug, zup, and walm, the color is blue.
- If wif appears alone, the color is red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent colors. Based on the given examples, the following rule can be deduced:
Rule: bluf is followed by colors, with each color corresponding to the position of ""bluf"" in the sentence.

Example 1: ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
Example 2: ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
Example 3: ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green""
Example 4: ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red""
Example 5: ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the given examples can be seen as a word representing a sequence of colors.
walm -> color 

Explanation:
From the given examples, it can be observed that the word ""walm"" is associated with different colors in different contexts. 

In the first two examples, ""walm"" is associated with the color blue and green respectively. 

In the third example, ""walm"" appears after ""zup wif"" and it is associated with the color red. 

Similarly, in the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" is associated with the colors red and green respectively. 

Therefore, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" seems to represent a color, with its meaning or exact color dependent on the context.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" always corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> color

Meaning: 
The word ""dax"" in the given examples seems to represent different colors. Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by another word (e.g., ""walm""), the output is always ""green"" (""green green green"").
2. When ""dax"" appears between other words (e.g., ""wif dax lug dax""), the output associated with ""dax"" is different for each occurrence, but always follows a specific sequence (""red green blue green"").
3. When ""dax"" is used alone, without any other words, the output is consistently ""green"" (""green"").
4. When ""dax"" is part of a sequence of words, but is not the first word (e.g., ""wif zup dax bluf""), the output is ""green"" for the ""dax"" occurrence(s) (""red yellow green green""). 

Based on these patterns, it can be concluded that ""dax"" represents a color, and that its specific color is context-dependent. The exact rules determining its color in different contexts are not explicitly given in the examples, but they appear to follow some identifiable sequence or pattern.
wif -> color

Rule: 
If the word ""wif"" is followed by another word, then it represents a color. The color is determined by the following words in the input examples.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: zup corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: bluf corresponds to a color, based on the given examples. The color associated with bluf can vary and is determined by the presence of certain words in the input. Specifically:

- If the input contains the word ""dax"", the corresponding color for bluf is green.
- If the input contains the words ""wif"" and ""zup"", the corresponding color for bluf is red.
- If the input contains the words ""zup"", ""bluf"", ""lug"", and ""zup"" (in this order), the corresponding color for bluf is blue.
- If the input contains the words ""dax"", ""lug"", ""wif"", and ""bluf"" (in this order), the corresponding color for bluf is red.
- If the input contains the words ""zup"", ""wif"", and ""bluf"" (in this order), the corresponding color for bluf is red.

Note: It is important to consider the order of the words in the input, as it influences the interpretation of bluf.
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" seems to be associated with different colors in the examples provided. The rules can be summarized as follows:
- ""walm"" is associated with the color yellow when it appears after the word ""zup"".
- ""walm"" is associated with the color blue when it appears after the words ""lug"" or ""wif"".
- ""walm"" is associated with the color red when it appears after the words ""wif"" or ""zup"" before another ""wif"".
- ""walm"" is associated with the color green when it appears after the word ""dax"".

Please note that without more examples or context, the specific meaning of ""walm"" cannot be determined with certainty. These rules are based solely on the given examples.

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"", it means ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"", it means ""yellow"".
- When ""dax"" is not followed by any other word, it means ""green"".
- The colors associated with ""dax"" can combine with other colors in the context. For example, ""zup bluf dax"" implies ""yellow yellow green"", where the color ""dax"" is combined with the colors ""yellow"" and ""blue"" from the surrounding words.
wif -> color

Meaning: The word ""wif"" refers to a color. 

Rule: 

1. The first occurrence of ""wif"" in a sequence is associated with the color red.
2. Subsequent occurrences of ""wif"" in the same sequence are associated with alternating colors in the following order: green -> yellow -> blue.
zup -> color.

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to correspond to a color. The color assigned to ""zup"" varies depending on the other words in the sentence. However, it appears that when ""zup"" is used alone without any other words, it consistently represents the color yellow.
bluf -> color coding of words in the input sentence. Rule: Assign a color to each word in the input sentence, where ""bluf"" represents yellow.
walm -> color. The color represented by ""walm"" seems to be consistent with the following mappings:

walm -> red
walm -> green
walm -> yellow

However, since there are conflicting mappings in the provided examples (e.g. ""dax walm"" maps to both green and red), it is not possible to determine a specific mapping for ""walm"" based solely on the given examples.

Therefore, it can be inferred that ""dax"" is being used to represent different colors, and the specific color it represents is determined by its adjacent words in the sequence.
wif -> color (red) 

Meaning: Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""wif"" is being used to refer to the color red. In the first example, the direct mapping of ""wif"" to ""red"" indicates a clear association between the word and the color. In subsequent examples, the presence of ""wif"" alongside different color words (green, yellow, blue) consistently results in a correspondence between ""wif"" and red. Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" is that it denotes the color red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is used as an input, the output is always ""yellow"".
bluf -> color sequence

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning:
The word ""lug"" seems to represent different colors depending on the context. Based on the examples given, the following rule can be inferred:

Rule:
When ""lug"" is preceded by another word and followed by another word, it represents a color. The meaning of ""lug"" is determined by the preceding word. The color represented can be one of the following: red, blue, green, or yellow.

Example Rule Applications:

1. ""wif lug"" -> red blue
   In this example, ""wif"" is the preceding word which corresponds to the color red, and ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

2. ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue blue blue
   The preceding word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. The subsequent occurrence of ""lug"" also follows the same rule.

3. ""zup dax lug dax"" -> yellow green blue green
   In this case, ""lug"" follows the same rule as the previous example, where it represents the color blue after the preceding word ""dax"". However, the subsequent occurrence of ""lug"" is preceded by ""zup"", which corresponds to the color yellow.

4. ""dax lug"" -> green blue
   Here, ""lug"" follows the same rule, representing the color blue, while the preceding word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

5. ""lug bluf zup lug"" -> blue blue yellow blue
   This example demonstrates multiple occurrences of ""lug"" following the rule. The color represented by ""lug"" is always blue, while the preceding words ""bluf"" and ""zup"" correspond to blue and yellow, respectively.
dax -> color. 

Based on the examples, it seems that ""dax"" represents a color. In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with the color green. In the second example, ""dax"" is associated with the color blue. In the third example, ""dax"" is associated with the color green again. From these examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" represents different colors depending on the context. So, the rule could be that ""dax"" represents a color in the sequence of words, where each occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color.
wif -> color. Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> color based on its position in the sentence

Rules:
1. If zup is followed by another word, the meaning of zup is yellow.
2. If zup is followed by a word and preceded by a word, the meaning of zup is blue.

lug -> color coding

Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to be associated with a color coding system based on the examples provided. The color coding appears to use specific words to represent different colors:

- ""red"" means the color red
- ""blue"" means the color blue
- ""green"" means the color green
- ""yellow"" means the color yellow

From the examples, it seems like the color coding system follows the pattern that:
- The word ""lug"" itself represents the color blue
- The word ""wif"" represents the color red
- The word ""walm"" represents the color green
- The word ""zup"" represents the color yellow

Rule: lug -> color coding
- lug = blue
- wif = red
- walm = green
- zup = yellow
Rule: In the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to represent the color green.

Explanation: From the examples, we can observe that whenever the word ""dax"" is present, it is associated with the word ""green"" or a sequence of ""green"" words. The other words in the examples seem to represent different colors, such as ""lug"" for blue, ""zup"" for yellow, and ""walm"" for green.

Therefore, based on the examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" generally means the color green.
wif -> color coding. The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to a color coding system, where each color is represented by a different word. Based on the examples, we can deduce the following color mappings:

- wif = red
- zup = yellow

Please note that the specific colors associated with ""lug"" may depend on the given examples provided and may not extend beyond the given context.
dax -> color. The meaning of the word ""dax"" seems to be indicating different colors based on the context it is used in. In the given examples, ""dax"" corresponds to the colors green (Output: green blue blue blue), red (Output: red green yellow red), and also appears independently without any other words (Output: green). Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" represents a color, with different colors being assigned based on the surrounding words.
After analyzing the examples given, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule:
wif -> color

Explanation:

Based on the examples, it can be observed that the word ""wif"" is always followed by a color. The output consistently assigns the color mentioned after ""wif"" to the corresponding position in the output sequence. 

For example:
- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""yellow"", which is assigned to the first position in the output sequence.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"", which is assigned to the third position in the output sequence.
- In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", which is assigned to the second position in the output sequence.

Hence, the rule can be generalized as follows: 

wif -> color

Where ""color"" represents any color mentioned after ""wif"".
zup -> yellow. Rule: In the given context, the word zup refers to the color yellow.
bluf -> color coding system

Meaning: bluf represents a color coding system, where each occurrence of bluf corresponds to a specific color. Based on the given examples, we can deduce that:

- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"" (yellow appears twice)
- ""wif zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow"" (red appears once, followed by two yellow)
- ""zup bluf wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red"" (yellow appears twice, followed by two red)
- ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red green blue"" (yellow appears twice, followed by red, green, and blue)
- ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow red red blue"" (green appears once, followed by yellow, red, red, and blue)

Based on these patterns, we can generalize that the meaning of bluf is a color coding system, where each occurrence of bluf represents a specific color.
walm -> color

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" in these examples appears to be a color. The color associated with ""walm"" is determined by the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence:

- When ""walm"" is the first word in the input, it corresponds to the color red.
- When ""walm"" is the second word in the input, it corresponds to the color blue.
- When ""walm"" is the third or later word in the input, it corresponds to the color green.

Note: It is important to note that without any further information or examples, it is difficult to definitively determine the meaning of ""walm"" beyond the context provided.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

- If lug is the third word, it represents the color yellow.

This rule can be used to consistently determine the meaning of the word lug based on its position in the input.
dax -> color. It seems that the word ""dax"" represents different colors based on its context. Here is the rule:
- If ""dax"" is surrounded by other words, then it represents colors in the order they appear.
- The mapping of ""dax"" to colors is consistent across examples.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" seems to correspond to different colors based on the context provided in the examples. Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input has a corresponding color in the output.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: In all given examples, the word ""zup"" is always associated with the color yellow.

dax -> color

From the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" is associated with different colors. Here is the deduced rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" represents different colors in the following order: green, blue, red, yellow.

This rule can be observed from the consistent patterns in the examples:

Example 1: ""dax lug dax lug walm"" ->
- ""dax"" is associated with green (first occurrence)
- ""dax"" is associated with blue (second occurrence)
- ""walm"" is not associated with ""dax""

Example 2: ""zup dax lug"" ->
- ""dax"" is associated with green
- ""lug"" is not associated with ""dax""

Example 3: ""dax lug wif bluf"" ->
- ""dax"" is associated with green
- ""bluf"" is not associated with ""dax""

Example 4: ""dax walm"" ->
- ""dax"" is associated with green (both occurrences)

The specific color assigned to ""dax"" in each example is determined by the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. 

Rule: The color assigned to ""dax"" is determined by its position in the input sequence. There is a specific mapping of colors to different positions of ""dax"". For example, when ""dax"" is in the 1st position, it corresponds to the color ""green"". When ""dax"" is in the 2nd position, it corresponds to the color ""blue"".
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to represent different colors based on the context of its usage. In the first example, ""wif"" is used in isolation and it corresponds to the color ""red"". In the second example, ""wif"" is used in the phrase ""zup wif"" and it corresponds to the color ""yellow"". In the third example, ""wif"" is used again in the phrase ""zup wif"", resulting in the color ""yellow"". In the fourth example, ""wif"" is used with the word ""bluf"", resulting in the color ""red"". In the fifth example, ""wif"" is used in isolation again and it corresponds to the color ""red"". Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" is determined by the context and represents different colors in different contexts.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
bluf -> color

Rule: 
Bluf represents a color, and the mapping from bluf to color is as follows:
- If bluf appears in isolation (without any accompanying words), it represents the color blue.
- If bluf appears before or after a word (or words) that are not bluf, it represents the color red.
- If bluf appears before or after another bluf, it represents the color green.
- Other words in the input are irrelevant to determining the meaning of bluf.
walm -> color

Meaning: The word ""walm"" refers to a color. The color associated with ""walm"" depends on its position in the input sequence. 

Rule: 
- If ""walm"" is the first word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color blue.
- If ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color green.
- If ""walm"" is the third word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color yellow.
- If ""walm"" is the fourth word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color red.

- If dax is the second word in the input, it represents the color blue.
- If dax is the third word in the input, it represents the color red.
- If dax is the fourth word in the input, it represents the color yellow.
- If dax is the fifth word in the input, it represents the color bluf.
- If dax is the sixth word in the input, it represents the color green again.
wif -> color coding
Meaning: The word ""wif"" seems to be representing some kind of color coding based on the given examples. The output colors can be yellow, red, green, or blue.

Rule: 
Based on the examples, the following color coding can be deduced:
- ""wif"" alone represents the color red.
- ""wif"" paired with another word represents a color combination, with the second word determining the additional color:
  - ""dax"" results in green.
  - ""bluf"" results in blue.

Note: It is possible that ""wif"" can have different meanings in different contexts. However, based on the given examples, the color coding interpretation seems most plausible.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears as an input, the corresponding output is always ""yellow"".
bluf -> color

Meaning:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" represents colors. In the first example, ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""red"" twice, while in the second example, it is associated with the color ""yellow."" Similarly, in the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is associated with the colors ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively. The fifth example also associates ""bluf"" with the color ""green."" Therefore, the word ""bluf"" appears to be a representation of different colors, possibly following a pattern in a given context.
walm -> color coding based on the position in the input sequence.

Rule:
The word ""walm"" is assigned a color based on its position in the input sequence. The color assigned to ""walm"" is then repeated for the subsequent words in the output sequence. The colors assigned seem to be in the order of blue, green, red, and yellow. Therefore, the rule could be stated as follows:

Rule: walm is assigned a color based on its position in the input sequence, starting with blue for the first occurrence, then green for the second occurrence, red for the third occurrence, and yellow for the fourth occurrence. The assigned color is then repeated for subsequent words in the output sequence.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: In the given context, lug always corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> color (meanings: red, green, blue, yellow)
Meaning: The word ""dax"" represents different colors based on its position and context in the examples. The rules underlying the examples seem to be:

- If ""dax"" appears alone in a sentence, it represents the color green.
- If ""dax"" is followed by another word, it represents a color based on the position of that word in a predefined color sequence. In the examples, the sequence seems to be red, green, blue, yellow.

Therefore, based on the examples, the rule for dax can be described as follows:
- If ""dax"" appears alone, it represents green.
- If ""dax"" is followed by a word, the color it represents depends on the position of that word in a predefined color sequence, starting with red and looping back to red if necessary.
wif -> color

Rule: The word ""wif"" represents different colors depending on its position in the sentence. The colors assigned to ""wif"" are determined in the following way: 

1. If ""wif"" is the only word in the sentence, it represents the color ""red.""
2. If ""wif"" appears after one or more words, it represents the color corresponding to the word that preceded it. For example, if the word before ""wif"" is ""lug,"" then ""wif"" represents the color ""blue."" 
3. If ""wif"" appears after multiple words, it represents a sequence of colors corresponding to each word that occurred before it. For example, if the words preceding ""wif"" are ""lug dax walm,"" then ""wif"" represents the sequence of colors ""blue green green.""
zup -> color yellow. 

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it is associated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: ""bluf"" seems to be a word that corresponds to different colors. It appears that ""bluf"" can refer to the color blue in most cases, but can also represent other colors such as green or red depending on the context. Therefore, we can hypothesize that ""bluf"" is a nonce word used to describe various colors.
walm -> color code (red, blue, yellow, green)

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to refer to different colors based on its position within the input. In all examples, ""lug"" is associated with the colors ""blue"" and ""red"". Therefore, the rule could be stated as follows:

Rule: If ""lug"" appears at the beginning or end of the input, it represents the color ""blue"". If ""lug"" appears in the middle of the input, it represents the color ""red"".
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" in this context seems to be related to colors. Based on the examples provided, the rule can be derived as follows:

Rule: 
If ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"", the meaning is green.
If ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"", the meaning is red.
If ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", the meaning is blue.

The order of the words does not affect the meaning of ""dax"".
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to be associated with different colors in each example. In the first example, ""wif"" is associated with the color sequence green red red red. In the second example, it is associated with the color sequence blue red blue blue. In the fourth example, ""wif"" is associated with just the color red. Based on this, it can be deduced that ""wif"" represents a color, and the specific color it represents may change depending on the context.

If ""lug"" is not followed by ""dax"" or ""walm"", the meaning is green.
If ""lug"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""bluf"", the meaning is red.
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to represent the color green. This is supported by the consistent association of ""dax"" with the color green in multiple examples. In the first example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" indicating that ""dax"" is a different color from ""lug"" (blue). In the second example, ""dax"" by itself implies green. In the third example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" is green like in the previous examples. In the fourth example, ""lug dax lug"" translates to ""blue green blue,"" further affirming the association between ""dax"" and green. Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" translates to ""blue green green red green,"" indicating that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to green.

Rule: dax is synonymous with the color green.
wif -> color

Meaning:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" is associated with colors. The following rules can be deduced:

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"", it represents the color ""red"".
2. When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", it represents the color ""green"".
3. When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"", it represents the color ""yellow"".
4. ""wif"" can occur multiple times in a sequence with different colors associated with each occurrence.

Based on this, the general rule for the meaning of ""wif"" can be defined as follows:
""wif"" -> color
zup -> color translation rule

Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" is a word that translates to different colors based on its position in the sentence. The color translations observed so far are:
- ""zup"" followed by ""wif"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""zup"" followed by ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" followed by ""dax"" translates to ""red"".

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule: 

Rule: When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"", it translates to ""yellow"". When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"", it translates to ""blue"". When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"", it translates to ""red"".
bluf -> yellow

Meaning: bluf refers to the color yellow.

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""bluf"" is consistently associated with the color yellow.
walm -> color associated with the number of occurrences of the word ""walm"" in the input. 

Meaning: The color ""walm"" represents a specific number of occurrences of the word ""walm"" in the input text. Each occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to a specific color. 

Rule: The color associated with the word ""walm"" is determined by the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input, with specific associations for each count. 

For example:
- If ""walm"" appears once, it represents the color yellow.
- If ""walm"" appears twice, it represents the color red.
- If ""walm"" appears three times, it represents the color green.

zup -> yellow

Based on the examples, it can be seen that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow. Hence, the rule is that ""zup"" means yellow.
bluf -> color 

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" represents a color. The color is determined based on the surrounding words. 

Rule: The color represented by ""bluf"" is determined by the adjacent words. Each unique word determines a unique color. The mapping of words to colors is as follows: 

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in a sequence of words, the output is a repetition of the word ""green"" for each occurrence of ""walm"", followed by any other colors that may appear in the sequence.

Therefore, we can conclude that the word ""walm"" most likely means ""green"" in this specific context.

    Rules:
lug -> color. Rule: lug corresponds to a color, where each occurrence of lug in the input corresponds to a specific color (blue, red, green, yellow) in the output.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" seems to correspond to colors in the given examples. The possible rules that can be derived are:

Rule 1: If ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""bluf"", it represents the color green.
Rule 2: If ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", it represents the color yellow.
Rule 3: If ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"", it represents the color blue.
Rule 4: If ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""zup"", it represents the color red.

These rules are derived from the patterns evident in the examples provided.
Wif -> red. The word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" in all of the given examples. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is that ""wif"" means the color red.
zup -> color based on the following rules:
- If zup is the only word, it means ""yellow"".
- If zup is followed by ""walm"", it means ""yellow"".
- If zup is preceded and followed by ""lug"", it means ""blue"".
- If zup is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""lug"", it means ""green"".

Meaning: lug represents different colors based on its context. The following rules can be inferred from the given examples:

Rule 1: When surrounded by two different words, lug represents the color ""blue"".
Example: Input: lug zup lug -> Output: blue yellow blue

Rule 2: When preceded by a word and followed by a different word, lug represents the color ""red"".
Example: Input: wif lug dax -> Output: red blue green

Rule 3: When surrounded by the same word, lug represents the color ""blue"".
Example: Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue

Rule 4: When preceded or followed by the same word, lug represents the color ""yellow"".
Example: Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue

Based on these rules, the meaning of lug can be determined as a representation of different colors depending on its context.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green

It appears that whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the output is always ""green"". Thus, based on the context provided, we can conclude that ""dax"" means ""green"".
wif -> color of an object or item. The color seems to vary based on the context and the placement of the word within the sentence. In some cases, ""wif"" corresponds to the color green, in other cases it corresponds to the color red. The rule seems to be that when ""wif"" is the first word in the sentence, it corresponds to the color green. In all other cases, it corresponds to the color red.
zup -> ""yellow"". 

Rule: The word ""zup"" always represents the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf seems to represent different colors, as indicated by the given examples. The word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to specific colors depending on its position in the sentence. The following rules can be inferred:

Rule 1: If ""bluf"" is the first word in the sentence, it corresponds to the color red.
Example: bluf zup -> red yellow

Rule 2: If ""bluf"" is in the middle of the sentence, it corresponds to the color green.
Example: lug dax bluf -> blue green green

Rule 3: If ""bluf"" is the last word in the sentence, it corresponds to the color blue.
Example: wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue

Rule 4: If ""bluf"" is not at the beginning, middle, or end of the sentence, it corresponds to the color yellow.
Example: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow

Based on these examples, it can be concluded that the word ""bluf"" represents different colors based on its position in the given sentence.
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" seems to represent different colors in different contexts. Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule: 
- If ""walm"" appears alone or after other words (e.g., dax walm, dax walm wif bluf), it represents the color green.
- If ""walm"" appears before other words (e.g., wif walm), it represents the color red.
- In some cases, the color represented by ""walm"" can also depend on the presence of other words (e.g., wif zup bluf lug walm), where it represents the color blue.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" depends on its position and context within a sentence, representing different colors such as green, red, or blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Rule: 

The word ""lug"" represents a color. The color assigned to ""lug"" depends on its position in the sequence of words. 

In each example, ""lug"" is always followed by a color word, such as ""dax"", ""wif"", ""zup"", etc. The color assigned to ""lug"" is determined by the color word following it.

From the given examples, we can deduce the following mappings:

1. ""lug dax"" -> blue
2. ""lug wif"" -> red
3. ""lug zup"" -> yellow

We can observe that the color assigned to ""lug"" is independent of the words that precede it. The color assigned to ""lug"" only depends on the color word that immediately follows it.

Hence, lug -> color, where the specific color is determined by the color word that follows ""lug"".
Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" has a specific meaning in each input-output pair. Let's analyze the examples to deduce the meaning of ""dax"":

Example 1: Input ""wif dax"" corresponds to Output ""red green"".
Example 2: Input ""zup lug dax"" corresponds to Output ""yellow blue green"".
Example 3: Input ""lug dax lug"" corresponds to Output ""blue green blue"".
Example 4: Input ""zup dax zup lug"" corresponds to Output ""yellow green yellow blue"".
Example 5: Input ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" corresponds to Output ""blue green green yellow blue red"".

Upon closer inspection, we can observe a pattern in the meanings of ""dax"" based on its position within the input. It appears that ""dax"" always corresponds to a color, and its meaning is determined by its adjacent words. 

From the given examples, we can derive the following rule: 

Rule: If ""dax"" is preceded by one word, its meaning corresponds to that word, and if it is followed by one word, its meaning corresponds to that word. Otherwise, if it is surrounded by two words, its meaning corresponds to the second word. 

Using this rule, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" in each example:

Example 1: ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"", so its meaning is ""red"".
Example 2: ""dax"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and ""lug"", so its meaning is ""green"".
Example 3: ""dax"" is surrounded by ""lug"" and ""lug"", so its meaning is ""green"".
Example 4: ""dax"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and ""zup"", so its meaning is ""green"".
Example 5: ""dax"" is surrounded by ""bluf"" and ""zup"", so its meaning is ""green"".

Therefore, the deduced rule for ""dax"" is:

dax -> The meaning of ""dax"" depends on its adjacent words. If there is only one adjacent word, the meaning is the same as that word. Otherwise, if there are two adjacent words, the meaning is the same as the second word.
wif -> red

Meaning: The word ""wif"" represents the color red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, it signifies the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents a color. The color it represents varies depending on the context, but based on the examples, it can be inferred that bluf can represent the colors green, blue, or red.

- Whenever lug is followed by dax, it corresponds to the colors blue, yellow, green, red, and yellow.
dax -> color.

Meaning: dax refers to a color. The specific color can vary depending on the context, but it is consistently associated with the color green in the given examples.
wif -> color. Rule: wif is a nonce word that means ""red"" when used alone, and when combined with other words, it represents a sequence of colors.
zup -> yellow

Meaning: In all of the given examples, the word ""zup"" is always associated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: ""bluf"" refers to different colors. In each example, the presence of ""bluf"" is followed by a sequence of color words (e.g., green, blue, yellow, red). The color sequence seems to vary in length and order, suggesting that ""bluf"" represents a color that can change from one example to another.
walm -> color. The color seems to be determined based on the position of walm in the input sequence. Initially, walm is associated with the color ""blue"". When walm appears at the beginning or in the middle of the sequence, it takes on the color of the previous word.

dax -> color

Rule: The word ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
wif -> color (blue, green, red, yellow)

Rule: wif represents different colors:
- The first occurrence of wif in any input maps to the color blue.
- If wif is preceded by the word lug, it represents the color blue.
- If wif is preceded by the word dax, it represents the color green.
- If wif is preceded by the word zup, it represents the color yellow.
- If wif is preceded by the word bluf, it represents the color red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors depending on its context. Based on the examples provided, it can be observed that ""bluf"" is associated with different colors:

1. When ""bluf"" appears after the word ""dax,"" it is associated with the color ""green.""
2. When ""bluf"" appears after the word ""wif,"" it is associated with the color ""red.""
3. When ""bluf"" appears before or after the word ""lug,"" it is associated with the color ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule deduced from the examples is that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on its positioning relative to other words, and the color associated with it may vary based on that position.
walm -> color code

In the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears in different contexts and is associated with different colors. The word ""walm"" seems to represent a color code where each color is represented by a specific word. The examples indicate that ""yellow"" corresponds to the word ""walm,"" and the other colors are represented by different words such as ""green,"" ""red,"" and ""blue.""

Meaning: ""lug"" seems to refer to colors. In each example, ""lug"" is followed by a color word (red, yellow, blue, green) that corresponds to the output in the same position. The meaning of ""lug"" can therefore be understood as representing a color.
dax -> color representation of the order of appearance of other words.

Meaning: dax represents the colors green, red, blue, and yellow and is assigned based on the order of appearance of other words in the input.

Rule: The color assigned to dax is determined by the order of appearance of other words in the input.
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow. 
Rule: The word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. 

Based on the given examples, it appears that whenever the word ""zup"" is present, it corresponds to the color yellow. This can be observed in all the given inputs where ""zup"" is always associated with the color yellow in the corresponding outputs. Therefore, the rule deduced is that the word ""zup"" means yellow.
bluf -> color. Meaning: The word ""bluf"" represents different colors depending on the context. The specific mapping of ""bluf"" to colors is as follows:

lug bluf -> blue blue
wif bluf -> red red
zup bluf -> yellow yellow
dax bluf -> green green

The word ""bluf"" seems to be indicating a color in each example.
walm -> color (specifically, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" or ""green"" in the given examples) Rule: The word ""walm"" is associated with a color, which is determined based on the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. 

- If ""walm"" is the first word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color ""green"". 
- If ""walm"" is followed by another instance of ""walm"" or by the word ""lug"" (in the next position), it corresponds to the color ""blue"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: lug represents a color, where each color is represented by a specific word. Based on the examples given:
- When lug appears after wif, it represents the color red.
- When lug appears after dax, it represents the color green.
- When lug appears after zup, it represents the color blue.
- Additionally, the examples suggest that when lug appears on its own, without any preceding or following words, it represents the color blue.

Therefore, the rule can be generalized as follows:
- If lug is preceded by wif, it represents the color red.
- If lug is preceded by dax, it represents the color green.
- If lug is preceded by zup, it represents the color blue.
- If lug appears on its own, it represents the color blue.
dax -> color. Rule: dax corresponds to different colors depending on its position in the sentence. In the first example, ""dax"" directly translates to ""green"". In the second and third examples, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" when it follows ""zup"" and ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"". In the fourth example, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" when it follows ""zup"" and to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"". In the fifth example, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" when it is the second word in the sentence and to ""red"" when it is the third word in the sentence.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to different colors in different contexts. In most cases, ""wif"" maps to the color blue, as seen in the first example where all instances of ""wif"" are followed by ""lug"" which is blue. However, in the second and third examples, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" which is red, indicating that ""wif"" can also refer to the color red. In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" which is green, suggesting that ""wif"" can represent different colors depending on the context. Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup"" which is yellow, indicating that ""wif"" can be associated with different colors in different positions within a sequence.
zup -> color

Rule: zup represents the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence.
bluf -> red

Rule: bluf represents the color red.
walm -> color

Meaning: The word ""walm"" seems to represent different colors based on its context. It can be assumed that ""walm"" refers to a specific color and each occurrence of ""walm"" represents the same color within the same input example. The color associated with ""walm"" is determined by the other words in the input example. Based on the provided examples, the following color associations can be observed:

- When ""walm"" is preceded and followed by the word ""lug"", the color associated with ""walm"" is blue.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""zup"" and followed by the word ""lug"", the color associated with ""walm"" is yellow.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""dax"" and followed by the word ""wif"", the color associated with ""walm"" is green.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""zup"" and followed by the word ""wif"", the color associated with ""walm"" is red.

It is important to note that the above associations are based on the given examples and may not hold true in other contexts or additional examples.

dax -> color

Rule: The word ""dax"" seems to be associated with colors. In the given examples, ""dax"" is always accompanied by other words that correspond to colors. The mapping between ""dax"" and colors is as follows:

- Input with ""dax"" and other color words:
   - If ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""green"".
   - If ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"", the output is also ""green"".
   - If ""dax"" is not followed by any other color words, the output is simply ""green"".

- Input with only ""dax"":
   - When the input consists of only ""dax"", the output is ""green"".

- In other cases where ""dax"" is not the only color word in the input:
   - If ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"".
   - If ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"", the output is ""blue"".

Based on this analysis, the word ""dax"" seems to be a placeholder for colors, with different color associations depending on the context.
wif -> color indicator

Meaning: The word ""wif"" seems to be a color indicator. It is used in conjunction with other words to specify a color. The color indicated by ""wif"" varies based on the context, but it appears that ""red"" is a common color associated with ""wif"".
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color. Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is determined by the preceding words in the pattern. If the preceding word is ""wif"", then ""bluf"" means ""red"". If the preceding word is ""lug"", then ""bluf"" means ""blue"".

Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to be associated with colors. In the provided examples, ""lug"" is consistently followed by other words that represent colors, such as ""zup"" (yellow), ""bluf"" (blue), ""dax"" (green), and ""walm"" (red). Therefore, the rule can be inferred as the word ""lug"" representing a particular color in each instance.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors based on the context it appears in. In all examples where ""dax"" appears alone, it corresponds to the color ""green"". However, when ""dax"" is accompanied by other words, it seems to represent colors that correspond to those words. For example, when ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" or ""zup"", it represents the color ""blue"". When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"", it represents the color ""red"". Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" can be understood as a representation of a color, with its specific value determined by the context in which it appears.
wif -> red if preceded by dax, otherwise green
zup -> color. 
The word ""zup"" seems to represent a color based on the context provided in the examples. In all the examples, ""zup"" is associated with a color word - either directly (e.g., ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow"") or indirectly through other words (e.g., ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green"").

lug -> color

Meaning:
According to the given examples, ""lug"" seems to represent different colors depending on its context. The following rules can be inferred:

Rule 1: If ""lug"" appears alone, its meaning is ""blue"".
Example: lug -> blue

Rule 2: If ""lug"" appears in a context with other words, each word has a corresponding color. The color of ""lug"" is determined by its position in the context.
Example:
- If ""lug"" is the first word in the context, its color is ""blue"".
- If ""lug"" is in the second position, its color is ""red"".
- If ""lug"" is in the third position, its color is ""green"".
- If ""lug"" is in the fourth position, its color is ""yellow"".
- And so on.

For example: 
- lug wif walm -> blue red red
  (lug -> blue, wif -> red, walm -> red)
- lug wif dax wif -> blue red green red
  (lug -> blue, wif -> red, dax -> green, wif -> red)
- dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
  (dax -> green, zup -> yellow, lug -> blue, wif -> red, lug -> blue)

Note: The color mapping for the words ""wif"" and ""dax"" is not explicitly defined in the examples, so we can assume them to represent different colors in each occurrence.
dax -> color

Meaning: dax represents a color. The color it represents depends on the context or the position of dax within the list of words.

Rule:
If dax is the first word in the list, it represents the color green.
If dax is the second word in the list, it represents the color blue.
If dax is the third word in the list, it represents the color yellow.
If dax is the fourth word in the list, it represents the color red.
wif -> color

Meaning: The word ""wif"" seems to represent different colors in each example. It appears that ""wif"" is used to indicate a color, with each occurrence representing a different color.
zup -> color

Meaning: The word ""zup"" represents different colors in the given examples. The color assigned to ""zup"" depends on the context in which it appears.
bluf -> color
Meaning: Bluf represents a color, specifically colors that correspond to ""red"", ""green"", or ""yellow"". The association of the color is determined by the position of bluf in the input sequence. Bluf is interpreted as follows:
- If bluf appears at the beginning of the sequence, it represents the color ""red"".
- If bluf appears in the second or third position in the sequence, it represents the color ""green"".
- If bluf appears at the end of the sequence, it represents the color ""yellow"".
walm -> color

Meaning: The word ""walm"" represents different colors based on its context. Here are the deduced rules:

1. When ""walm"" appears before or after another word, it represents the color green.
   Example: wif walm dax -> red red red green

2. When ""walm"" appears between two similar words, it represents the color blue.
   Example: zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue

3. When ""walm"" follows a word, it represents the color yellow.
   Example: wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

4. When ""walm"" precedes a word, it represents the color red.
   Example: zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

Based on these rules, ""walm"" can be inferred to represent different colors depending on its position relative to other words in the examples provided.

Meaning: Dax seems to represent different colors in the given examples. Based on the patterns observed, the following rule can be inferred:

Rule: 
- The word ""dax"" is associated with the colors green and blue.
- In some cases, ""dax"" is also associated with other colors like red and yellow.
- The appearance of ""dax"" in a sequence determines the color that follows it.

Example 1: 
Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
Explanation: ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"", which is associated with the color blue.

Example 2: 
Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
Explanation: ""dax"" is followed by a repetition of the word ""zup"", which is associated with the color yellow.

Example 3: 
Input: lug zup dax lug dax
Output: blue yellow green blue green
Explanation: ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" again. Both instances of ""lug"" are associated with the color blue.

Example 4: 
Input: dax
Output: green
Explanation: ""dax"" on its own is associated with the color green.

Example 5: 
Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
Explanation: ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"", which is associated with the color yellow, and then ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", which is associated with the color green.

Based on these examples, it can be concluded that the meaning of ""dax"" is associated with different colors, likely based on its position in the sequence of words.
wif -> color. It seems that ""wif"" represents different colors. Based on the examples, we can infer the following rule: 
- ""wif"" represents the color yellow when it appears after the word ""zup"" and before the word ""bluf"".
- ""wif"" represents the color red when it appears after the word ""bluf"".
- ""wif"" represents the color green when it appears after the word ""dax"".

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" in different contexts is dependent on the preceding words, indicating specific colors.
zup -> color

Meaning: zup seems to represent different colors based on the context.

Rule: 
If zup is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by any number of other words, then zup represents the color green.
If zup is preceded by ""dax walm"" and followed by any number of other words, then zup represents the color yellow.
If zup is preceded by any word other than ""dax"" or ""dax walm"" and followed by any number of other words, then zup represents the color blue.
If zup is not preceded by any other words and is followed by any number of other words, then zup represents the color yellow.

Note: The rule is based on the given examples, and it is possible that there may be additional rules or exceptions not captured in the given examples.
bluf -> color. Rule: bluf corresponds to a color, where ""red"" corresponds to the word ""wif"", ""yellow"" corresponds to the word ""zup"", ""green"" corresponds to the word ""dax"", and ""blue"" corresponds to the word ""lug"" or ""walm"".
walm -> green

Meaning: In all of the examples, when the word ""walm"" is present, it is associated with the color green. Therefore, the rule is that ""walm"" represents the color green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,155
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: The word ""lug"" represents different colors based on its position in the input.

Rule:
1. If ""lug"" is the first word in the input, it represents the color yellow.
2. If ""lug"" is the second word in the input, it represents the color blue.
3. If ""lug"" is the third word in the input, it represents the color red.
4. If ""lug"" is the fourth word in the input, it represents the color green.

Note: The meaning of ""lug"" is context-dependent and cannot be generalized beyond the given examples.
dax -> color
Meaning: dax seems to represent a color and can be deduced based on its association with other words in the examples. In the given context, the color associations for dax are as follows:
- ""dax"" is associated with ""bluf"" and ""wif"" in Example 1, where ""bluf"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""green."" Hence, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" in this example.
- ""dax"" is associated with ""zup"" in Examples 2, 3, and 5, where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Hence, ""dax"" is associated with ""yellow"" in these examples.
- ""dax"" is associated with ""lug"" in Examples 4 and 5, where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Hence, ""dax"" is associated with ""blue"" in these examples.

Rule: The meaning of ""dax"" seems to depend on its surrounding words and corresponds to the color associated with those words.
wif -> color. It seems that the word ""wif"" is being used to signify a color. It can refer to different colors in different contexts, as seen in the examples.
zup -> color. The word ""zup"" seems to represent different colors in different contexts. In the given examples, it is associated with the colors yellow, red, and green. However, we cannot determine a specific mapping between ""zup"" and color, as it changes depending on the other words in the sentence.
bluf -> color pattern

Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is related to a color pattern. In each example, the word ""bluf"" is surrounded by other words, with colors being the most common. The color pattern in the output seems to be determined by the colors of the words that appear on either side of ""bluf"". 

It can be observed that ""bluf"" follows these rules:
- If the word before and after ""bluf"" are the same color, the output color is the same as well.
- If the word before and after ""bluf"" are different colors, the output color is a combination of the two colors. 

For example, in the first example:
- Input: zup bluf
- Output: yellow yellow
Since ""zup"" and ""bluf"" are both yellow, the output is also yellow.

In the second example:
- Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
- Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
Since ""lug"" and ""wif"" are different colors (blue and red), the output is a combination of the two colors: blue and red.

Based on these rules, ""bluf"" can be understood as a word that determines the output color pattern based on the colors of the surrounding words.
walm -> color. The color associated with ""walm"" seems to vary depending on the presence or absence of other words such as ""lug"", ""wif"", or ""zup"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color. 

Rule: 

The word ""lug"" corresponds to a color. Based on the examples provided, the color associated with ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

- When ""lug"" appears with the word ""zup"", it corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- When ""lug"" appears alone, it corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- When ""lug"" appears with other words like ""walm"" and ""wif"", it corresponds to the color ""blue"" as well.

Therefore, the general rule can be stated as: 

If ""lug"" appears with the word ""zup"", it corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Otherwise, it corresponds to the color ""blue"".
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to represent a color in the given examples. Based on the inputs and outputs, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The color represented by ""dax"" is determined by its position within the input. If it is the first word, it corresponds to green. If it is the middle word, it corresponds to red. If it is the last word, it corresponds to blue.
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" is equivalent to the color red in this context.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" in this context corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: bluf represents a color. The following mappings have been established:
- bluf -> green
- bluf -> red
- bluf -> blue
- bluf -> yellow

It is unclear whether bluf always represents a specific color or if its meaning is context-dependent. Further examples would be needed to determine the exact meaning of bluf.
walm -> color

Meaning: walm represents a color, with the color assigned based on the words that appear before and after walm in the input sequence. The specific mapping can be determined by analyzing the examples:

- In example 1, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""wif"", and in the output, it maps to ""blue"". So, the rule can be deduced as follows: if ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""wif"", it represents the color ""blue"".

- In example 2, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax lug"", and in the output, it maps to ""yellow"". So, the rule can be deduced as follows: if ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax lug"", it represents the color ""yellow"".

- In example 3, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup wif"" and followed by ""dax"", and in the output, it maps to ""red"". So, the rule can be deduced as follows: if ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup wif"" and followed by ""dax"", it represents the color ""red"".

- In example 4, ""walm"" appears multiple times with different surroundings. It maps to different colors based on the context. The specific mapping rules can be derived by analyzing this example in conjunction with the others.

Based on the given examples, it is clear that ""walm"" represents a color, and the specific color it represents depends on the words that appear before and after it in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule:

1. ""dax"" appears alone → ""dax"" represents the color ""green"".
2. ""dax"" appears before another word → ""dax"" represents the color associated with the following word.

Examples: 
- ""dax walm"" → ""dax"" represents ""green"" because ""walm"" is the following word and is associated with the color ""green"".
- ""wif dax zup dax"" → ""dax"" represents ""green"" because it appears alone and in conjunction with ""zup"" which is associated with the color ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" → ""dax"" represents ""green"" because it appears alone.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule for the word ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> ""red""

Explanation:
- In example 1, the input is ""wif bluf"" and the output is ""red red"". This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- In example 2, the input is ""dax wif"" and the output is ""green red"". Here, ""wif"" is still associated with red.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Meaning: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue. Therefore, the rule is that ""lug"" is used to refer to the color blue.
dax -> color. The color associated with dax changes depending on the other words in the input. The rules seem to be as follows:
1. If dax is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"", then it is associated with the color ""blue"".
2. If dax is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by any word except ""wif"", then it is associated with the color ""yellow"".
3. In all other cases, dax is associated with the color ""green"".
wif -> color.

Based on the examples, it can be observed that ""wif"" is associated with different colors in different contexts. It appears that the color associated with ""wif"" is determined by the position of ""wif"" in the sequence of words. 

The rule can be summarized as follows:

- If ""wif"" appears as the first word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color red.
- If ""wif"" appears as the second word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color blue.
- If ""wif"" appears as the third word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color green.
- If ""wif"" appears as the fourth word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color yellow.
zup -> yellow. Rule: In the given context, the word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color. The word bluf in all the examples seems to represent a color. Each occurrence of bluf is associated with a specific color, as seen in the examples:

- In the first example, bluf is associated with red.
- In the second example, bluf is associated with yellow.
- In the third example, bluf is associated with green.
- In the fourth example, bluf is associated with blue.
- In the fifth example, bluf is associated with blue again.

Therefore, based on the examples, it seems that bluf represents different colors in different contexts.
walm -> color (red, blue, green, yellow)

Meaning: The word ""walm"" is a color indicator. The color associated with ""walm"" can vary based on the context, but it consistently appears before a sequence of words that represent colors. The first example indicates that ""walm"" is associated with the color ""red"". The second example indicates that ""walm"" is associated with the colors ""green"" and ""yellow"". The third example indicates that ""walm"" is associated with the colors ""blue"" and ""yellow"". The fourth and fifth examples provide further support for the association between ""walm"" and color, as the colors ""red"" are consistently mentioned after ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

dax -> color. The color can be determined based on the following rules:

1. If ""dax"" appears in the input by itself, it corresponds to the color green.
2. If ""dax"" appears after another word that is not ""dax"", it corresponds to the color blue.
3. If ""dax"" appears consecutively in the input, it corresponds to alternating between green and yellow.
4. If ""dax"" appears before or after the word ""wif"", it corresponds to the color red.
wif -> red. 

Rule: The word ""wif"" is used to represent the color red.
zup -> color. The meaning of ""zup"" seems to be a color, specifically the color yellow. It appears that whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, the output is always the corresponding color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors in different contexts. Based on the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" is associated with the following colors:

- In the context of ""wif dax bluf"", ""bluf"" is associated with the color green. 
- In the context of ""zup bluf"", ""bluf"" is associated with the color yellow.
- In the context of ""lug bluf"", ""bluf"" is associated with the color blue.

Therefore, the rule for interpreting ""bluf"" seems to be that it represents a color.

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- Whenever ""lug"" appears along with other words, the subsequent colors are assigned to the respective words in the given order of appearance (e.g., ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" maps to blue, red, green, green, red, blue).
- The colors assigned to words other than ""lug"" follow a specific order: yellow, blue, green, red.
Based on this pattern, the general rule can be stated as ""lug represents the color blue, while other words represent colors in the sequence yellow, blue, green, red.""
dax -> color (green)

Meaning/Rule: In the given examples, ""dax"" seems to be associated with the color green. It consistently appears in the output as green.
wif -> color. The color associated with ""wif"" seems to be determined by the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence. ""wif"" is always followed by another word, and the color associated with ""wif"" is the color associated with the subsequent word.
The rule for the word ""zup"" appears to be that it represents the color yellow. 

zup -> yellow
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, with each instance of ""bluf"" in a sequence representing a specific color. The color is determined by the previous word in the sequence, following these rules:

- If the previous word is ""zup"", then ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- If the previous word is ""dax"", then ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.
- If the previous word is ""lug"", then ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.
- If the previous word is ""wif"", then ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.

In the absence of a previous word, the meaning of ""bluf"" cannot be determined.
walm -> color coding based on the preceding words.
Meaning: The color of walm is determined by the preceding words. 

Rule: If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the color of walm is red.
Rule: If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the color of walm is yellow.

wif -> a color or a color code

Meaning:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" is related to colors. In the first two examples, ""wif"" is followed by another word, which corresponds to different colors, specifically ""lug"" and ""zup"". In both cases, ""wif"" is associated with the color red, but the following word determines the other color.

In the third example, ""wif"" appears alone and is associated with the color red.

In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears multiple times and each time it is associated with the color red. However, other words without ""wif"" are also associated with colors, such as ""zup"" with yellow and ""bluf"" with green.

In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears at the end and is associated with the color red, while the word ""zup"" is associated with yellow.

Overall, it seems that ""wif"" functions as a color indicator or color code, which is typically followed by words representing different colors.
zup -> color coding. The meaning of ""zup"" seems to be related to color coding. Based on the examples, the word ""zup"" is always followed by one or more words, and each of these words is associated with a specific color. In the given examples, ""zup walm"" is associated with the color yellow (yellow yellow yellow), ""zup wif"" is associated with the colors yellow and red (yellow red), ""zup bluf lug"" is associated with the colors yellow, yellow, and blue (yellow yellow blue), ""zup"" alone implies the color yellow, and ""zup dax"" is associated with the colors yellow and green (yellow green).

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it indicates a color coding and the specific color(s) to follow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents the color blue.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning

Meaning: color (red, yellow, blue, green)

Rule: 
1. The word ""lug"" corresponds to a color, which can be red, yellow, blue, or green.
2. The specific color assigned to ""lug"" depends on the context or surrounding words in the sentence.
3. The same context can yield different colors for ""lug"" in different examples.
4. In some cases, ""lug"" can be the only word in the sentence and its assigned color would still be valid.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors in each example. The examples suggest that the color corresponding to ""dax"" can be determined based on the position of ""dax"" in a sequence of words. From the examples, we can deduce the following rules:

1. If ""dax"" is the first word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color green.
2. If ""dax"" is the second word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color blue.
3. If ""dax"" is the third word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color red.

These rules can be used to determine the meaning of ""dax"" based on its position in a given sequence of words.
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" seems to consistently indicate the color ""red"" in the given examples.
zup -> color

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents a color.
From the examples, it can be observed that each occurrence of ""zup"" is associated with a different color - yellow, red, blue, and green. Therefore, it can be concluded that ""zup"" represents a specific color in each context it appears.
bluf -> color

Rule: 
The word ""bluf"" represents a color. The examples indicate that ""bluf"" can represent different colors such as green, blue, and red depending on the context.
walm -> color (red, blue, green, yellow)

Rule: 
The word ""walm"" corresponds to a color, with each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input corresponding to a specific color in the output. The specific color associated with ""walm"" may vary between different examples, but it consistently maps to a color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color. Rule: Depending on its position in the input, lug can represent different colors. Specifically, lug represents the color blue when it is the first word in the input, and represents the color green when it is preceded by a word other than wif.
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors based on the context. It can signify red, green, blue, or yellow depending on the other words in the sentence.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to different colors based on the context. It can represent the color yellow (as seen in the first example), or the color red (as seen in the second and third examples). The color green is also associated with ""wif"" when it is surrounded by other instances of the word ""dax"" (as seen in the fourth example). Additionally, ""wif"" is associated with the color blue when it is surrounded by other instances of the word ""lug"" (as seen in the last example). This suggests that the meaning of ""wif"" is directly linked to the colors mentioned in its surrounding context.
zup -> color

Meaning: The word ""zup"" seems to represent the color yellow in the given examples. In each example where ""zup"" appears, it is associated with the color yellow in the corresponding output.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf in the given context seems to refer to colors. Each occurrence of ""bluf"" is associated with a specific color in the output examples. This suggests that ""bluf"" is a representation or code for different colors.
walm -> color. 

The word ""walm"" seems to be associated with colors in the examples. In each example, ""walm"" is followed by a color word (e.g., ""walm zup"" or ""walm wif""). The corresponding output then includes the color that follows ""walm"".
