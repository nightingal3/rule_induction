    Rules:
lug -> color. Rule: The color associated with the word ""lug"" depends on its position in the sentence. If ""lug"" is the first word, it corresponds to the color ""blue"". If ""lug"" is the second word, it corresponds to the color ""red"".
dax -> color. The color associated with ""dax"" seems to vary based on its position in the input sequence. When ""dax"" is the first word in the input, it is associated with the color green. However, when it appears later in the sequence, it is associated with the color red.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to be associated with different colors in the given examples. Based on the pattern observed, the rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: wif indicates a sequence of colors, where each color is represented by a specific word.

Example:

wif -> color
yellow -> yellow
bluf -> blue
dax -> green
zup -> red
walm -> yellow
lug -> blue
zup -> yellow. Rule: zup is associated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color. The color is determined by the number of occurrences of the word ""lug"" before ""bluf"" in the input sequence. If there are no occurrences of ""lug"" before ""bluf"", the color is yellow. If there is one occurrence of ""lug"" before ""bluf"", the color is blue. If there are two or more occurrences of ""lug"" before ""bluf"", the color is red.
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" seems to represent colors in the given examples. The specific color that ""walm"" represents can be determined by looking at the other words in the input. Based on the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: If ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" or ""lug"", then it represents the color yellow. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" or ""bluf"", then it represents the color blue. If ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"", then it represents the color green. Otherwise, ""walm"" represents the color red.

Based on these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: If ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" in the input, then the mapping is yellow.
If ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" in the input, then the mapping is red.
If ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" or ""lug"" in the input, then the mapping is green.
wif -> color. The color associated with ""wif"" seems to be indicated by other words in the input examples. In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color green. In the second and fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be determined by the presence of other words in the input, possibly indicating a color.

1. If ""dax"" is the first word in the input, it represents the color green.
2. If ""dax"" is the second word in the input, it represents the color yellow.
3. If ""dax"" is the third word in the input, it represents the color red.
4. If ""dax"" is the fourth word in the input, it represents the color blue.
5. If ""dax"" is the fifth or subsequent word in the input, it represents the color blue.

Overall, the meaning of ""dax"" appears to be a color that varies depending on its position in the input.
wif -> red.

Rule: If ""wif"" is present, it represents the color ""red"".
zup -> color description. The word ""zup"" in the given examples appears to represent a color or color description. The following mappings can be observed:

- zup dax -> yellow green
- zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
- zup -> yellow
- zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- zup lug dax -> yellow blue green

Based on these examples, it seems that ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow. However, it is not always used alone; it is often followed by other words that correspond to different colors. So the general rule can be described as follows: ""zup"" represents the color yellow, and the subsequent words indicate additional colors.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf refers to the color of an object or item. 

Rule: 
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" is a nonce word used to represent different colors. From the examples, we can infer the following colors:

- ""bluf"" = yellow
- ""wif bluf"" = red
- ""dax bluf"" = green
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" = blue

Therefore, it seems that ""bluf"" is a placeholder for different colors, and its meaning can be determined based on the context in which it is used.
walm -> color. The meaning of ""walm"" in the given examples appears to represent different colors. The color assigned to ""walm"" depends on the presence or absence of other words in the input. Based on the examples, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule:
- If ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug"", then it represents the color yellow.
- If ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and not followed by ""lug"", then it represents the color red.
- If ""walm"" is not preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug"", then it represents the color blue.

The rule captures the pattern observed in the given examples and allows for generalization to other inputs.

Meaning: The word ""dax"" refers to different colors based on the context. It can represent the colors green, blue, and yellow depending on the surrounding words.
wif -> color

Meaning of wif: wif represents a color. The color is determined based on the other words in the sentence. From the given examples, we can infer the following rules:

Rule 1: If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then wif represents the color green.
Rule 2: If the preceding word is ""zup"" or ""walm,"" then wif represents the color yellow.
Rule 3: If the preceding word is ""bluf,"" then wif represents the color red.
Rule 4: If there is no preceding word, then wif represents the color blue.

Based on these rules, wif can be considered as a variable that takes on different color values depending on the context or preceding word.
zup -> color

Meaning: zup represents different colors based on the surrounding words in the sentence. In the given examples, zup translates to ""blue"" when surrounded by the words ""lug"" and ""lug"", ""green"" when surrounded by the words ""dax"", ""walm"", and ""wif"", and ""yellow"" when it is standalone or repeats consecutively. Therefore, zup can be interpreted as a word that signifies a color.
bluf -> color of an object or word in the context

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to be associated with the color blue in the given examples.
dax -> color

Meaning:
The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors based on the given examples. In the first example, ""dax zup"" is associated with ""green yellow"", indicating that ""dax"" represents the color green. Similarly, in the second example, ""dax lug"" is associated with ""green blue"", further confirming that ""dax"" represents the color green.

In the third example, ""zup lug wif dax lug"" is associated with ""yellow blue red green blue"". Here, ""dax"" is paired with the colors green, suggesting that ""dax"" consistently represents the color green.

The fourth example, ""dax"" by itself, is associated with ""green"", reconfirming our previous observation.

Lastly, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" is associated with ""red red green green green"". Again, ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green.

Based on these examples, we can conclude that ""dax"" consistently represents the color green. Therefore, the rule is:
dax -> green
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to different colors based on the examples given. These colors include green, blue, red, and yellow. However, without more examples it is difficult to determine a specific rule for each color association.
zup -> color of the following object/syllable in the sentence. Rule: The word ""zup"" indicates the color of the object or syllable that comes after it in the sentence.

The context of ""wif"" in other examples suggests that it can represent different colors in different contexts. For example, in the input ""zup wif"", ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"", indicating the color ""yellow"" in the output (yellow red). In the input ""wif"", ""wif"" is standalone and represents the color ""red"" in the output (red). In the input ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" is again followed by ""bluf"", indicating the color ""red"" in the output (green blue yellow red red green).

Overall, the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be associated with colors, and the specific color it represents depends on the context in which it is used.
zup -> color. Rule: When zup is followed by another word, it repeats the color of the previous word. If zup is not followed by any word, it is yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule:
The word ""bluf"" is representing different colors depending on its context. The color assigned to ""bluf"" is determined by the position of other words in the sentence.

If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", the color assigned is red.
If ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"", the color assigned is green.
If ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"", the color assigned is yellow.
If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"", the color assigned is blue.

Further context and examples may help improve the accuracy of the rule.
walm -> color

Explanation:
Based on the given examples, it seems like the word ""wif"" is associated with colors. In the first example, ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue"" as the output. Similarly, in the fourth example, ""lug dax wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue green red blue"" as the output. Therefore, it can be inferred that the word ""wif"" is being used to indicate colors.
zup -> color. The word ""zup"" in the given examples seems to be associated with colors. In each example, ""zup"" is followed by a color term such as ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" (yellow), ""bluf"" (yellow), indicating that ""zup"" represents a color.
bluf -> color of the word that comes before it.

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" represents the color of the previous word in the sequence. The color can be either red, yellow, or green, as indicated by the examples.
walm -> color (specifically, yellow or green)

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a color. It appears that whenever ""walm"" is present in an input, it is associated with the color yellow. Additionally, in some cases, the word ""walm"" is also followed by the color green.

In addition, the examples also mention other colors such as ""green"", ""blue"", and ""yellow"" in relation to ""bluf"". Therefore, the general rule appears to be that ""bluf"" represents different colors in context.
walm -> color

Meaning: The word ""walm"" seems to represent colors based on the following patterns observed in the examples:

1. If ""walm"" appears after another word, the color associated with ""walm"" is the same as the color associated with the preceding word. Example: ""wif lug walm"" maps to ""red blue blue blue"" - the color of ""wif"" (red) is repeated for ""walm"".
  
2. If ""walm"" appears before another word, the color associated with ""walm"" is the same as the color associated with the following word. Example: ""lug walm zup walm"" maps to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"" - the color of ""walm"" (blue) is repeated for the subsequent words.
  
3. If ""walm"" is the last word in a sequence, the color associated with ""walm"" is repeated for all subsequent words. Example: ""zup walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow"" - the color of ""walm"" (yellow) is repeated for all subsequent words.
  
4. If there is only one instance of ""walm"" in a sequence, the color associated with ""walm"" is repeated for all subsequent words. Example: ""wif walm"" maps to ""red red red"" - the color of ""walm"" (red) is repeated for all subsequent words.

Based on these patterns, it can be inferred that ""walm"" represents colors, where the specific color is determined by the context of its occurrence in the sentence.

Based on these rules, it seems that ""zup"" is used to represent different colors, such as ""yellow"", ""red"", and ""green"", depending on the specific context it is used in.
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent colors. Each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the examples is followed by a color word. The color word following ""bluf"" is then repeated based on the number of occurrences of ""bluf"" in the example. For example, in the first example ""wif bluf"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" and since ""bluf"" appears once, ""red"" is repeated once in the output. In the second example, ""dax bluf wif zup"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"", and since ""bluf"" appears once, ""green"" is repeated once in the output.
walm -> color
Meaning: ""walm"" seems to represent a color, and the color it represents seems to be context-dependent. In the given examples, ""walm"" has been associated with the colors blue, red, yellow, and green, depending on the order of surrounding words. The specific rule for determining the color represented by ""walm"" is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be influenced by the surrounding words in a sequential manner.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: Lug seems to represent a color in the given examples. Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:
- When ""lug"" is the only word in the input, it represents the color blue.
- When ""lug"" is preceded by another word, it represents a different color based on the preceding word:
  - If the preceding word is ""dax"", ""lug"" represents the color green.
  - If the preceding word is ""wif"", ""lug"" represents the color red.
  - If the preceding word is any other word, ""lug"" represents the color blue.

So overall, the rule for lug can be summarized as follows:
- lug -> blue (when it is the only word)
- dax lug -> green
- wif lug -> red
- any_other_word lug -> blue
dax -> color

Meaning: dax represents a color.

Rules: 
1. If dax appears alone, it represents the color green.
2. If dax appears in a sequence with other words, it represents a color based on the order of appearance. For example, the first occurrence of dax represents red, the second occurrence represents yellow, the third occurrence represents green, and so on.
wif -> color of an object. Rule: The word ""wif"" is used to indicate the color of an object, where red corresponds to ""wif"", green corresponds to ""dax"", blue corresponds to ""lug"", and yellow corresponds to ""zup"".
zup -> color
Rule: In the given examples, the word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color.

Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. Different instances of ""bluf"" in the examples can correspond to different colors. For instance, in the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green, in the second example it also corresponds to green, and so on. Therefore, it appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" is a color.
walm -> color

Rule: The word ""walm"" represents a color. The color of ""walm"" is determined by the words that come before and after it in the input sequence. 

Based on the examples given, the following color assignments can be deduced:

- If ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""lug"" and followed by the word ""wif"", then it represents the color ""blue"".
- If ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""zup"" and followed by the word ""bluf"" or ""wif"", then it represents the color ""yellow"".
- If ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""zup"" and followed by any word other than ""bluf"" or ""wif"", then it represents the color ""red"".
- If ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""lug"" and followed by any word other than ""wif"", then it represents the color ""blue"".
- If ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""lug"" or ""zup"" and followed by the word ""zup"" or ""wif"", then it represents the color ""blue"".
- If none of the above rules apply, then the meaning of ""walm"" is not clear.

It is important to note that the meaning of ""walm"" could change or have additional interpretations in a different context or with more examples provided.

bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" represents different colors depending on its context. The following rules can be deduced from the examples:

Rule 1: If ""bluf"" appears after a single word, it represents the color ""red"". Example: ""wif bluf"" -> red red.

Rule 2: If ""bluf"" appears after two words, it represents the colors ""yellow red"". Example: ""zup wif bluf"" -> yellow red red.

Rule 3: If ""bluf"" appears after more than two words, it represents a sequence of colors followed by ""red"". Example: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.

Rule 4: If ""bluf"" appears as the only word, it represents the colors ""yellow yellow"". Example: ""zup bluf"" -> yellow yellow.

Rule 5: If ""bluf"" appears between two words, it represents the colors of those words. Example: ""lug bluf dax lug"" -> blue blue green blue.

These rules provide a general understanding of the meaning of ""bluf"" in different contexts, which seems to represent colors based on its position relative to other words.
walm -> color

Meaning:
Based on the examples, it appears that ""walm"" is associated with colors. In each example, ""walm"" is always followed by a color word, indicating that ""walm"" represents a color itself.

Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" is associated with colors. Here are the observed mappings:

- wif zup -> red yellow
- wif -> red
- wif dax -> green
- wif dax zup dax -> red green yellow green
- zup dax lug wif dax -> yellow green blue red green

From these mappings, it can be deduced that ""wif"" represents different colors depending on the context. There is no consistent pattern for assigning colors to ""wif"" itself. Rather, the colors associated with ""wif"" depend on the other words in the input.

Therefore, the general rule for ""wif"" is that it represents a color, but the specific color it represents depends on the other words in the sentence.
zup -> yellow

Meaning: In all the examples, when the word ""zup"" is present, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents a color in the context of the given examples. The color associated with ""bluf"" is determined by the previous words in the input. Specifically, the color depends on the following pattern:

- If the previous word is ""dax"", then ""bluf"" represents the color green.
- If the previous word is ""wif"", then ""bluf"" represents the color red.
- If the previous word is ""lug"", then ""bluf"" represents the color blue.
- If the previous word is ""walm"", then ""bluf"" represents the color green or blue, depending on the previous word.

Note: Since ""bluf"" is a nonce word and the meaning is not explicitly defined, there could be alternative interpretations or additional rules that are not evident from the given examples.
walm -> color. 

Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" is representing colors. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" which is consistently translated as ""blue"". In the second example, it is followed by ""dax"" which consistently translates to ""green"". In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" again, which is translated as ""yellow"". In the final example, it is followed by ""wif"", which translates to ""red"". Thus, it can be concluded that ""walm"" represents the color itself.

zup -> yellow. 

Rule: In the given context, the word ""zup"" consistently represents the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent a color based on the given examples. It appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the second color mentioned in the input. For example, in the first input (zup bluf), the second color mentioned is ""yellow."" In the second input (dax bluf), the second color mentioned is ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" represents the color associated with the second position in the input. The word ""bluf"" serves as a placeholder for the actual color term.
walm -> color. 
Based on the given examples, ""walm"" seems to refer to different colors depending on its position in the sequence. In the first example, ""walm"" is surrounded by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and therefore ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue"". Similarly, in the second example, ""walm"" is surrounded by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", hence ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red"". In the third example, ""walm"" is surrounded by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"", therefore ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"". It follows the same pattern in the subsequent examples where ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding and succeeding words.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" is related to its position in the sequence, and it represents a different color in each position.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to correspond to specific colors based on the given examples. In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, in the second and third examples it is associated with both green and blue, and in the fourth example, it is only associated with green. Therefore, it can be inferred that ""dax"" represents different colors depending on the context, but specifically includes shades of green.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" seems to be related to colors. It is used in the context of describing various objects with different colors, such as lug (blue), walm (red), and zup (yellow).
zup -> yellow 

Rule: The word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow in these examples.
bluf -> color coding

Rule:
The word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with a color coding system in the given examples. Based on the examples, the following color codes are deduced:

- ""bluf"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""zup"" is associated with the color red.
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""walm"" seems to be another word that doesn't affect the color coding.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: lug refers to a color. The specific color appears to be determined by the context in which lug is used.
dax -> color

Rules:
1. If ""dax"" is the sole input, it means ""green"".
2. If ""dax"" appears in a list of words, the corresponding output color is determined by the order and repetition of the words in the input list. For example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"", indicating that ""dax"" represents the color green. Similarly, in ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" based on the ordering and repetition of the colors in the output.
3. The color represented by ""dax"" is not affected by other words in the input unless explicitly mentioned in the output. For instance, in ""dax lug wif"", ""dax"" still means ""green"" even though there are additional words in the input.
4. The color represented by ""dax"" can be combined with other words in the output, such as in ""yellow green"" for ""zup dax"". However, this combination does not affect the interpretation of ""dax"" itself.
5. The meaning of ""dax"" is specific to the context provided and may not have a universal definition.
wif -> red. Rule: wif corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow. 

The word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color yellow in all provided examples. Hence, based on the given examples, the meaning of ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
bluf -> color sequence. The color sequence appears to be related to the words that come before bluf in the input. The first word in the sequence corresponds to the word immediately before bluf, the second word corresponds to the word two positions before bluf, and so on. The colors themselves do not have any inherent meaning, but are used to represent the sequencing pattern.
walm -> color (meaning)
Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to a color, and the color can be determined based on the other words in the input example. If the input contains ""dax"" followed by ""walm"", the output will be ""green"". If the input contains ""lug"" followed by ""walm"", the output will be ""blue"". If the input contains ""wif"" followed by ""walm"", the output will be ""red"".

From the given examples, we can observe that the word ""bluf"" is always associated with a sequence of other words (e.g., ""bluf wif zup"", ""zup lug zup bluf lug"", etc.). The output for each example consists of colors that are seemingly assigned to each word in the given sequence. The color assigned to each word is consistent across all the examples.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:
- The word ""bluf"" functions as a signal to assign colors to the preceding words in the sequence.
- The assigned colors follow a specific pattern or code, likely based on the position of the word in the sentence.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be described as:

Meaning: Rule: The word ""lug"" represents different colors and each color corresponds to a specific position in the input sequence. 

By analyzing the examples, we can derive the following rules for the meaning of ""lug"":

- In the first example, ""lug dax"" maps to ""blue green"". This indicates that the first occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and the second occurrence corresponds to ""green"".

- In the second example, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" maps to ""red blue blue yellow yellow green"". Here, ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue"", but the sequence of colors suggests that each occurrence of ""lug"" maps to the color that comes after it. Therefore, the first ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", the second ""lug"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the third ""lug"" corresponds to ""green"".

- In the third example, ""lug wif dax wif"" maps to ""blue red green red"". Similar to the second example, each occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to the color that follows it. So, the first ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", the second ""lug"" corresponds to ""red"", and the third ""lug"" corresponds to ""green"".

- In the fourth example, ""lug zup dax walm"" maps to ""blue yellow green green green"". Again, each occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to the color that comes after it. The first ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", the second ""lug"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the third ""lug"" corresponds to ""green"".

- In the fifth example, ""lug dax"" maps to ""blue green"". This example is consistent with the first example, where the first ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and the second ""lug"" corresponds to ""green"".

Overall, based on the examples, the meaning of ""lug"" appears to be a representation of colors, and each occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to a specific position in the input sequence, indicating a particular color.

dax -> color

Meaning:
The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors in different examples. In the given examples, ""dax"" is associated with the color green. It is likely that ""dax"" represents colors in general, specifically the color green.
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the word ""wif"" appears to have two possible meanings. 

Rule 1: When ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by nothing, it corresponds to the meaning ""green"".
Example: ""dax wif"" -> ""green""

Rule 2: When ""wif"" is not preceded by ""dax"" and followed by nothing, it corresponds to the meaning ""red"".
Examples: ""wif lug wif"" -> ""red red"", ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow"", ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""

Therefore, the deduced rules for the word ""wif"" are:
- Rule 1: wif -> green (when preceded by dax and followed by nothing)
- Rule 2: wif -> red (when not preceded by dax and followed by nothing)
zup -> yellow. 

Meaning: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color yellow in the given examples.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents different colors based on the context. The exact mapping is as follows:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.
- The word following ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors based on its context:
    - If the word following ""bluf"" is ""wif"", it corresponds to the color red.
    - If the word following ""bluf"" is ""lug"", it corresponds to the color blue.
    - If the word following ""bluf"" is ""zup"", it corresponds to the color yellow.
walm -> color.

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to a color. The color changes based on the context, but it is consistent within each example.
zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples. Rule: zup means yellow.
bluf -> color. The color of bluf appears to be determined by the colors mentioned before it in the input. The rules can be summarized as follows:

1. If only one color is mentioned before bluf, bluf takes on the same color. For example, ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red"" and ""dax wif bluf"" yields ""green red red"".

2. If two colors are mentioned before bluf, bluf takes on the second color. For example, ""zup bluf wif bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow red red"" and ""dax zup bluf"" yields ""green yellow yellow"".

3. If three or more colors are mentioned before bluf, bluf takes on the color that appears two positions before it. For example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". In this case, bluf follows the appearance of ""walm"", which is two positions before it.

2. dax walm -> green green green
3. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. dax zup wif -> green yellow red

Rule:

It appears that the number of times ""green"" appears in the output directly corresponds to the number of occurrences of ""dax"" in the input. The additional colors in the output seem to be independent of ""dax"" and are determined by other factors in the input. However, without further examples or a clear pattern, it is difficult to deduce the exact rule for determining the other colors in the output.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to represent different colors based on the context in which it is used. The color associated with ""wif"" can vary, and it appears to be correlated to the other words in the input. For example, in the second example, ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"" when it is followed by the word ""lug"". However, in the fourth example, ""wif"" is associated with the color ""blue"" when it is followed by the word ""walm"". Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be dependent on the specific words it is paired with in each input.
zup -> yellow. 

The word ""zup"" seems to consistently refer to the color yellow in all the given examples.

    Rules:
lug -> color. The word ""lug"" seems to represent different colors in each example. Examples 1, 2, 4, and 5 show that ""lug"" can represent the colors ""blue"", ""red"", ""green"". In example 3, ""lug"" is used alone and represents the color ""blue"". From these examples, it can be deduced that ""lug"" is used as a label for different colors in different contexts.
dax -> color. It seems that the meaning of the word ""dax"" is associated with colors. The rule that can be deduced from the examples is as follows:

Rule: When ""dax"" appears alone as a standalone word, it represents the color green. 
However, when ""dax"" appears along with other words in a sequence, its meaning is determined by the colors associated with the other words in that sequence. The overall meaning of ""dax"" in those cases is the last color mentioned in the sequence.

For example:
- In the input ""wif zup dax bluf"", the colors mentioned in the sequence are red, yellow, green, and green. Therefore, ""dax"" represents the color green.
- In the input ""wif zup wif dax"", the colors mentioned in the sequence are red, yellow, red, and green. Therefore, ""dax"" represents the color green.
- In the input ""wif walm dax"", the colors mentioned in the sequence are red, red, red, and green. Therefore, ""dax"" represents the color green.
wif -> red. Rule: wif refers to the color red.
zup -> yellow, meaning that the word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. Rule: If ""zup"" is present, it corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: Bluf represents a color. In the given examples, ""green"" is represented by ""bluf"" twice, ""red"" is represented by ""bluf"" three times, and ""yellow"" is represented by ""bluf"" once. However, it is important to note that without more examples or context, we cannot definitively determine the exact meaning of ""bluf"" beyond it being related to colors.
walm -> color

Meaning:
The word ""walm"" seems to represent different colors based on the context it appears in. In the given examples, ""walm"" appears together with other words, and its corresponding meaning is determined by the surrounding words. Based on the patterns observed, we can make the following generalizations:

Rule:
1. If ""walm"" appears after a word, that word determines its color.
2. If ""walm"" appears at the beginning of a sequence of words, the color is determined by the word that follows ""walm.""

For example:
- If the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" then ""walm"" represents the color blue.
- If the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" then ""walm"" represents the color green.

However, if ""walm"" appears at the beginning of a sequence of words, the color is determined by the following word:
- If the word after ""walm"" is ""wif,"" then ""walm"" represents the color red.
- If the word after ""walm"" is ""zup,"" then ""walm"" represents the color yellow.

Note that these are specific rules deduced from the given examples, and it is possible that there are other possible meanings for ""walm"" in different contexts.

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to be associated with colors. In particular, it appears that ""dax"" represents the color green. However, the meaning of ""dax"" can vary depending on the context. In some cases, ""dax"" represents the color blue or is preceded by other colors.
wif -> color (meaning)

Rule: The word ""wif"" represents the color red.
zup -> color sequence
Explanation: Looking at the examples, we can see that the word ""zup"" always appears in between other words. The number of times ""zup"" appears determines the number of colors in the output. The colors in the output sequence correspond to the colors in the input sequence that follows ""zup"". For example, in the input ""dax bluf wif zup lug"", ""zup"" appears once and the output is ""green green red yellow blue"", which matches the colors in the input following ""zup"". Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" indicates a sequence of colors in the output.
bluf -> color

Meaning:
Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that ""bluf"" represents colors. The color assigned to ""bluf"" in each example seems to depend on the presence or absence of certain words in the input.

Rule:
1. If ""bluf"" is preceded by the word ""wif"" and followed by the word ""dax"", it represents the color 'red'.
2. If ""bluf"" is preceded by the word ""lug"" and followed by the word ""dax"", it represents the color 'blue'.
3. If ""bluf"" is followed by the word ""zup"", it represents the color 'yellow'.

These are just a few rules that can be inferred based on the given examples. There may be other rules or patterns that explain the color assignments to ""bluf"" in different contexts.
walm -> color

Meaning: Walm represents a color, and the color changes based on the context. In the given examples, walm is associated with the colors red, green, and yellow. The color assigned to walm depends on the order of appearance and surrounding words:

- If walm is followed by ""wif,"" then walm represents the color red.
- If walm is followed by ""dax,"" then walm represents the color green.
- If walm is followed by ""zup,"" then walm represents the color yellow.

This rule induction suggests that walm is a placeholder for a color, with specific colors assigned depending on its context in the sentence.

dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" in the given examples seems to be associated with colors. It appears that ""dax"" is a nonce word used to represent different colors in different contexts. The following rules can be deduced from the examples:

Rule 1: When ""dax"" is preceded by one word:
- If the preceding word is ""zup"", ""dax"" means ""yellow"".
- If the preceding word is ""lug"", ""dax"" means ""blue"".
- If the preceding word is ""wif"", ""dax"" means ""red"".

Rule 2: When ""dax"" is not preceded by any word, it means ""green"".

Rule 3: When ""dax"" is followed by one word:
- If the following word is ""zup"", the meaning of ""dax"" remains the same as the previous context.
- If the following word is ""bluf"", ""dax"" means ""yellow"".

Based on these rules, ""dax"" seems to be a placeholder for different colors depending on the context.
wif -> color. The color associated with the word ""wif"" depends on the context. In the given examples, ""wif"" is associated with the color red when it appears alone, with the color green when followed by the word ""dax,"" and with the color red when followed by the word ""bluf.""
zup -> yellow. Rule: When the word ""zup"" is present, the output is always ""yellow"".
bluf -> color based on the following rules:

1. If bluf is preceded by ""wif"", the color is red.
2. If bluf is preceded by ""lug"", the color is blue.
3. If bluf is preceded by ""zup"", the color is yellow.
4. If bluf is not preceded by any of the above words, the color is green.

Meaning: bluf indicates the color of an object or entity.
walm -> color
Meaning: walm appears to represent color based on the examples given. The color associated with walm is determined by its position in the input sequence. The first occurrence of walm in each input sequence corresponds to yellow.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"".
dax -> color.

From the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" represents colors. In each example, ""dax"" is associated with a specific color. Based on the patterns observed, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color of the subsequent word in the sentence.

Example:

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" which is associated with the color green in the output. Similarly, ""dax"" in other examples is followed by words associated with different colors.

Therefore, it can be concluded that ""dax"" has the meaning of color in the given context.
Given the examples provided, we can infer the following rule:

wif -> color

From the examples, we observe that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it is always associated with colors in the output. The specific associations between ""wif"" and colors are as follows:

- When ""wif"" appears with another word, the output color is always red.
- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output color is red.
- When ""wif"" appears multiple times in the input, the output colors are repeated in the order they first appeared in the input.

Therefore, the general rule governing the meaning of ""wif"" in this context is that it indicates a mapping to colors, specifically the color red.
Rule: 
Based on the examples, it appears that the meaning of the word ""zup"" is determined by the colors of the surrounding words. Specifically, the color of ""zup"" can be determined by looking at the colors of the adjacent words that are not ""zup"". The output color of ""zup"" is the most frequent color among the adjacent words. If there is a tie in frequency, the color that appears first in the sequence is chosen.

zup -> determined by the adjacent colors.
bluf -> color

Meaning:
The word ""bluf"" in these examples seems to represent different colors. Based on the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" is used to indicate the color blue. Each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the examples is associated with the color blue.
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" is used to indicate the color of an object or objects.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax bluf wif lug
    ",Output: blue green blue red blue,blue green green red blue,False,197
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: lug is a representation of the color blue in this context.
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to be associated with colors. 

Rule: 
If ""dax"" appears alone or before another word, it represents the color green. 
If ""dax"" appears after another word, it represents a color different from green (e.g., yellow, blue).
wif -> color

From the examples, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" represents a color. The colors associated with ""wif"" are as follows:

- Example 1: ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
- Example 2: ""wif"" is associated with ""green""
- Example 3: ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
- Example 4: ""wif"" is associated with ""red""
- Example 5: ""wif"" is associated with ""green""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is that it represents different colors depending on the context in which it appears.
zup -> yellow. 

Meaning: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in all the examples.
bluf -> color.

From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" maps to different colors in different contexts. The following rules can be deduced:

Rule 1: When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""wif"" or at the end of the sentence, it maps to the color ""yellow"".
Example: ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red""

Rule 2: When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""dax"", it maps to the color ""red"".
Example: ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow""

Rule 3: When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and after ""dax"", it maps to the color ""green"".
Example: ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green""

Rule 4: When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"", it maps to the color ""blue"".
Example: ""lug bluf zup lug"" -> ""blue blue yellow blue""

Based on these rules, it can be determined that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on its position in the sentence and it represents different colors in different contexts.
walm -> color

Meaning: walm represents different colors based on its context in the input examples. Specifically, when walm is adjacent to dax, it represents the color green. However, when walm is adjacent to wif or bluf, it represents the color red. Finally, when walm is used alone or followed by zup or lug, it represents the color yellow or blue, respectively.
