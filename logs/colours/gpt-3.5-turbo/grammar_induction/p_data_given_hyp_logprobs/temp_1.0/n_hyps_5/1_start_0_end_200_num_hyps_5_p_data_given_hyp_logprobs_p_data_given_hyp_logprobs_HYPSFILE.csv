"dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to refer to different colors based on its context. Below are the rules I deduced from the examples:

Rule 1: If ""dax"" appears alone, it corresponds to the color ""green"".
Example: dax -> green (5th example)

Rule 2: If ""dax"" is preceded by another color word, the color of ""dax"" is the same as the preceding color word.
Example: zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue (1st example)
Explanation: ""dax"" follows ""walm"" (yellow), so ""dax"" is also yellow.

Rule 3: If ""dax"" follows a non-color word, the color of ""dax"" is determined by the word that precedes it.
Example: zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> yellow green yellow green red red (2nd example)
Explanation: ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and ""dax"" follows ""wif"", so ""dax"" is yellow and green respectively.

Rule 4: If ""dax"" is followed by a non-color word, the color of ""dax"" is determined by the word that follows it.
Example: dax walm wif -> green green green red (3rd example)
Explanation: ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", so ""dax"" is green. Similarly, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"", so ""dax"" is green again.

Rule 5: When ""dax"" appears in the middle of two non-color words, its color is determined by both the preceding and following words.
Example: zup wif lug dax -> yellow red blue green (4th example)
Explanation: ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and followed by ""wif"" (red), so ""dax"" is green in this case.

Based on these rules, it seems likely that ""dax"" represents or refers to colors.",-0.21165279392257835,4,dax

"wif -> color

Meaning: The word ""wif"" seems to represent colors in the given examples. It is associated with different colors depending on its position and neighboring words in the sentence. The rule for determining the color associated with ""wif"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: 
- If ""wif"" is alone or at the beginning of the sentence, it represents the color ""red.""
- If ""wif"" is followed by another word, it represents the color ""green"" unless the following word is ""walm,"" in which case it represents the color ""red.""
- If ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and then another word, it represents the color ""red.""
- If ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and then ""zup,"" it represents the color ""yellow.""
- If ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" it represents the color ""blue.""

1. When ""dax"" appears alone, it means ""green"".
2. When ""dax"" appears after one or more words (e.g., ""lug dax"", ""lug walm dax""), the presence of each preceding word corresponds to a repetition of the word ""blue"" (e.g., ""lug dax"" implies ""blue green"", ""lug walm dax"" implies ""blue blue blue green"").
3. The order in which the words appear doesn't seem to affect the meaning of ""dax"". For example, both ""lug dax"" and ""dax lug"" result in ""green blue"".

Therefore, we can summarize the meaning of ""dax"" as follows: 

dax -> green",-0.6457849280718644,50,dax

Rule: ""walm"" means red.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup,"" ""walm"" is translated to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" is translated to ""green."" However, this seems to be an exception, and the color ""green"" here does not appear to be related to the meaning of ""walm"" in other examples.
- In the third example, ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" is translated to ""green,"" which again contradicts the previous translation of ""walm"" in the first example.

"wif -> color

Explanation:
Based on the given examples, we can observe that the word ""wif"" is associated with colors. In all the examples, the output consists of a sequence of colors, with ""wif"" playing a role in determining the color of the corresponding tokens.

However, the exact mapping between ""wif"" and the colors is not explicitly specified. To deduce this, we can create a table to analyze the color patterns in the examples:

| Input  | Output        |
|--------|---------------|
| bluf   | red           |
| lug    | red           |
| dax    | green         |
| walm   | blue          |
| zup    | yellow        |

We can see that ""wif"" is associated with the color red in the first example, green in the second example, blue in the third example, and so on. Therefore, it can be deduced that the meaning of ""wif"" is associated with colors, following the color pattern specified in the examples.

"dax -> color. The meaning of the word ""dax"" in the given examples appears to be associated with a color. The color associated with ""dax"" is determined by the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. Based on the examples, the rule for determining the color of ""dax"" is as follows:

- If ""dax"" is the first word in the input sequence, it corresponds to the color green.
- If ""dax"" is not the first word in the input sequence, its color is determined by the color of the previous word.

Applying this rule to the examples:

- Example 1:
  - ""dax"" is the third word in the input sequence.
  - The previous word is ""bluf"" which corresponds to the color red.
  - Therefore, the color of ""dax"" in this example is also red.

- Example 2:
  - ""dax"" is the third and fifth words in the input sequence.
  - The previous words are ""zup"" and ""zup"" which both correspond to the color yellow.
  - Therefore, the color of ""dax"" in this example is yellow.

- Example 3:
  - ""dax"" is the first word in the input sequence.
  - The rule states that in this case, the color of ""dax"" is green.
  - Therefore, the color of ""dax"" in this example is green.

- Example 4:
  - ""dax"" is the fifth word in the input sequence.
  - The previous word is ""walm"" which corresponds to the color yellow.
  - Therefore, the color of ""dax"" in this example is yellow.

- Example 5:
  - This example only consists of the word ""dax"".
  - According to the rule, the color of ""dax"" is green.
  - Therefore, the color of ""dax"" in this example is green.

Based on these observations, the rule can be summarized as follows: The color of ""dax"" is determined by the color of the previous word in the input sequence, except when ""dax"" is the first word, in which case it is green.",-1.2368026477303153,125,dax
