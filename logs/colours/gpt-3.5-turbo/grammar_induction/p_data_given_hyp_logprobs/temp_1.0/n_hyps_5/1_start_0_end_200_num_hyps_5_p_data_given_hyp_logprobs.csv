"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color. Rule: lug corresponds to the color blue in the examples.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green.
wif -> color. The color is determined by the previous word in the input. In the first example, ""wif"" represents ""blue"" after the word ""bluf."" In the second example, ""wif"" represents ""red"" after the word ""dax."" In the third example, ""wif"" represents ""green"" after the word ""dax."" In the fourth example, ""wif"" itself represents ""red."" In the fifth example, ""wif"" represents ""red"" after the word ""zup.""
zup -> yellow. 

Looking at the examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" is always associated with the color yellow. Therefore, we can conclude that ""zup"" generally means yellow in this context.
bluf -> color

Rule: bluf represents different colors in different contexts. Based on the examples, bluf can represent the colors blue, green, or red.
walm -> color

Meaning: ""walm"" seems to represent different colors based on the context. In the given examples, ""walm"" is associated with the colors yellow, red, blue, and green. Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" is a placeholder word for referring to different colors or a code word for representing color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color. Rule: In these examples, ""lug"" is associated with different colors depending on its position and surrounding words. When ""lug"" appears alone, it is associated with the color blue. When ""lug"" is preceded by the word ""wif"", it is associated with the color red. In other cases, ""lug"" is associated with the color green or yellow based on the surrounding words.
dax -> color

Rule: In the given context, ""dax"" represents colors. The color associated with ""dax"" can vary depending on the context, but it seems to correspond to the third word in the input. For example, in the first input ""wif bluf dax"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" since ""green"" is the third word in the input. Similarly, in the second input ""lug wif dax zup walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" because ""green"" is the third word in the input. So, the general rule would be that ""dax"" represents the color of the third word in the input.
wif -> red

Based on the examples, it can be deduced that the word ""wif"" is associated with the color red. This rule holds true in all of the examples provided, where ""wif"" is consistently followed by the color red in the output.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf seems to represent different colors based on the context in which it is used. 

Rule: 
1. When bluf appears with another word, the color associated with that word is repeated twice. 
Example: ""dax bluf"" -> green green

2. When bluf appears between two words, it represents the colors of the words on either side of it. 
Example: ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" -> yellow yellow red blue green

3. When bluf appears before a word, it represents the color of the word that follows it. 
Example: ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> blue yellow yellow green
walm -> red  
walm -> yellow  
walm -> green  

Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with the colors red, yellow, and green. There doesn't seem to be a consistent pattern in terms of the order or frequency of these colors, so it is likely that the meaning of ""walm"" is simply a representation of any color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to different colors depending on its position in the input. The first occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, the second occurrence corresponds to the color green, the third occurrence corresponds to the color yellow, and so on.
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors based on its context. In the given examples, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
wif -> color

Meaning: The word ""wif"" is associated with color in the given examples. It appears to represent different colors based on the context in which it is used. The following rules can be derived:

Rule 1: wif followed by other words

- If ""wif"" is followed by other words, the color associated with ""wif"" is determined based on the context in the following examples:

Example 1: wif zup -> red
Example 2: wif lug dax -> red
Example 3: wif -> red

Rule 2: wif without any words following

- If ""wif"" is not followed by any other words, it seems to represent the color ""red.""

Example: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" is used to represent different colors in the given examples. The specific color represented by ""bluf"" varies depending on the context, but it seems to be consistently associated with specific words (e.g., ""red"", ""green"", ""yellow"", ""blue""). Therefore, ""bluf"" is most likely a placeholder for color representation.
walm -> color blue in all cases except when it follows the word ""zup"" where it represents the color yellow

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue or a color associated with the concept of ""blue"" in this context

The rule seems to be that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue or a color associated with the concept of ""blue"" in the given context.
From the given examples, it seems that the meaning of the word ""dax"" is related to colors. Based on the provided outputs, we can derive the following rule:

Rule:
dax -> green

It appears that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output assigned to it is always ""green"".
wif -> color

Rule: wif represents a color, with blue represented as ""wif"", green represented as ""dax"", yellow represented as ""zup"", and red represented as ""bluf"".
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word zup always corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" is a nonce word that represents the color blue. The color blue is associated with the word ""bluf"" in all the given examples.
walm -> yellow

Meaning: The word ""walm"" is used to indicate the color yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: 
The word ""lug"" seems to represent different colors based on the context it appears in. In the given examples, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue in most cases. However, it is also associated with other colors like green and red in some instances. 

Rule:
Based on the limited examples provided, it seems that the meaning of ""lug"" is determined by the position it appears in a sequence of words. It is possible that ""lug"" represents a pattern or rule within the sequence, where it alternates between different colors (e.g., blue, red, green) or follows a defined pattern specific to the context. Further examples and context would be needed to confirm and generalize this rule.
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to refer to different colors based on its context. Below are the rules I deduced from the examples:

Rule 1: If ""dax"" appears alone, it corresponds to the color ""green"".
Example: dax -> green (5th example)

Rule 2: If ""dax"" is preceded by another color word, the color of ""dax"" is the same as the preceding color word.
Example: zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue (1st example)
Explanation: ""dax"" follows ""walm"" (yellow), so ""dax"" is also yellow.

Rule 3: If ""dax"" follows a non-color word, the color of ""dax"" is determined by the word that precedes it.
Example: zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> yellow green yellow green red red (2nd example)
Explanation: ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and ""dax"" follows ""wif"", so ""dax"" is yellow and green respectively.

Rule 4: If ""dax"" is followed by a non-color word, the color of ""dax"" is determined by the word that follows it.
Example: dax walm wif -> green green green red (3rd example)
Explanation: ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", so ""dax"" is green. Similarly, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"", so ""dax"" is green again.

Rule 5: When ""dax"" appears in the middle of two non-color words, its color is determined by both the preceding and following words.
Example: zup wif lug dax -> yellow red blue green (4th example)
Explanation: ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and followed by ""wif"" (red), so ""dax"" is green in this case.

Based on these rules, it seems likely that ""dax"" represents or refers to colors.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to be associated with colors in this context. It is consistently represented as ""red"" in isolation and as a part of different phrases (e.g., ""wif walm zup walm"" is associated with ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""). Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow 

Meaning: In all the examples provided, the word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as: zup represents the color yellow.
bluf -> color. Rule: The word ""bluf"" is associated with a color, and it can represent different colors depending on the context of the sentence.
walm -> color

Meaning: The word ""walm"" seems to represent different colors in the given examples. The color associated with ""walm"" is determined by its position in the input sequence. Based on the examples, the color sequence associated with ""walm"" is as follows:

1st occurrence of ""walm"" -> blue
2nd occurrence of ""walm"" -> red
3rd occurrence of ""walm"" -> yellow

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" is determined by its position in the input sequence, and it represents a color.

In the other examples, ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green"" except for the last example where it corresponds to ""yellow"". It's possible that ""dax"" represents a color and its specific meaning is determined by the context.
wif -> color pattern. The word ""wif"" appears to represent a changing color pattern. In each example, the color that comes after ""wif"" is repeated until the next occurrence of ""wif"". The color pattern starts from the beginning with each occurrence of ""wif"".
Based on the provided examples, the deduction for the meaning of ""zup"" is as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: In the given context, the word ""zup"" represents the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: 
The word ""bluf"" seems to represent colors. Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors depending on the context:
- When preceded by ""dax"", ""bluf"" represents the color green.
- When preceded by ""zup"", ""bluf"" represents the color yellow.
- When appearing in the middle of a sentence with other words before and after, ""bluf"" represents the color green.
- When preceded and followed by the same word, ""bluf"" represents the color red.
- When surrounded by the same word, ""bluf"" represents the color blue.

It is important to note that without additional examples or context, it is difficult to determine a precise meaning for ""bluf"". It could potentially represent any concept that follows a similar pattern or set of rules.

Example: ""wif dax zup wif"" -> red green yellow red

Rule 3: When dax appears at the beginning of a sequence and is followed by another non-color word, it represents the color green.
Example: ""dax walm zup"" -> green green green yellow

Rule 4: When dax appears at the beginning of a sequence and is followed by a color word, it represents the color green.
Example: ""dax bluf wif"" -> green green red

Based on these rules, dax can be interpreted as a color word that is contextual and depends on the words that come before or after it in a sequence.
wif -> color. The color associated with the word ""wif"" is indicated by the following examples:

- When ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"", the color is red.
- When ""wif"" appears before ""dax"", the color is red.
- When ""wif"" appears before ""lug"", the color is red.
- When ""wif"" appears before ""zup"", the color is yellow.

Based on the observed pattern, it can be concluded that the word ""wif"" is used to indicate a specific color in the given context.
zup -> color. The word ""zup"" seems to be associated with colors. In the first example, ""zup dax"" is associated with ""yellow green"", suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". In the second example, ""zup bluf"" is associated with ""yellow yellow"", further supporting the idea that ""zup"" represents ""yellow"". Additionally, in the fourth and fifth examples, ""dax zup"" is associated with ""green yellow"", indicating that ""zup"" can also represent ""yellow"" in different contexts.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors based on the context. In the given examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to the colors blue, red, green, and yellow. It can be inferred that the word ""bluf"" is used to refer to different colors in a specific pattern or sequence. The specific mapping of ""bluf"" to colors may not be determined solely based on the examples given, but it appears that ""bluf"" is assigned a color based on its position or neighboring words in the sequence.

- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug"", it corresponds to the color ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""bluf"", it corresponds to the color ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""zup"" and ""lug"", it corresponds to the sequence of colors ""yellow"", ""green"", ""yellow"" and ""blue"".
wif -> color

Meaning:
The word ""wif"" appears to represent colors. Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" maps to the colors red, blue, and green. It seems that ""wif"" behaves like a placeholder for color words, and different positions in a sentence might dictate the actual color being represented.
zup -> yellow

Meaning: In all examples, the word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> color

Meaning: bluf represents a color. The color associated with bluf can vary depending on the context, but based on the given examples, it appears that bluf represents the colors yellow, red, or green. The rules can be summarized as follows:

1. If bluf is preceded by zup and followed by zup, it represents the color yellow.
2. If bluf is preceded by wif, it represents the color red.
3. If bluf is preceded by dax and followed by zup, it represents the color green.

These rules can be seen in the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: zup bluf zup -> yellow

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Rule: wif bluf -> red

3. Input: dax bluf zup

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,26
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color. There seems to be a correlation between the presence of the word ""lug"" and colors. In most cases, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue. However, there are also cases where ""lug"" is not followed by any other words, in which case it is associated with the color blue. Additionally, there is one instance where ""lug"" is combined with another word, ""zup,"" and it is associated with the color yellow.
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" represents a color.

Rule: The color represented by ""dax"" is determined by the previous words in the sentence as follows:
- If the previous word is ""wif"" and the word before that is not ""walm"", ""dax"" represents the color red.
- If the previous word is ""wif"" and the word before that is ""walm"", ""dax"" represents the color green.
- If the previous word is ""lug"", ""dax"" represents the color blue.
- If the previous words are ""zup bluf wif"", ""dax"" represents the color yellow.
wif -> color code

Rule:
The word ""wif"" seems to be a color code, where each color is represented by a specific word. 

Examples:
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
- ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow red green""

Based on the provided examples, it appears that the color code has the following mappings:
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""bluf"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""

These mappings can be used to deduce the meaning of ""wif"" in other contexts.
zup -> green yellow red blue

Meaning:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" is associated with different colors. In the first example, ""dax zup"" is mapped to ""green yellow"", suggesting that ""zup"" represents the color combination of green and yellow. In the second example, ""dax zup wif zup"" is mapped to ""green yellow red yellow"", indicating a repetition of the color combination ""green yellow"" followed by ""red yellow"". The third example directly maps ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The fourth example is a duplicate of the third, further confirming that ""zup"" represents the color yellow. Lastly, in the fifth example, ""lug bluf zup lug"" is mapped to ""blue blue yellow blue"", revealing that ""zup"" can also be combined with the color blue. 

Rule:
The meaning of ""zup"" is the combination of colors it takes when present in the input sequence.
bluf -> color sequence in the output

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent a sequence of colors that appear in the output. Based on the given examples, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: The color sequence is determined by the position of ""bluf"" in the input.

Explanation: 
- When ""bluf"" appears at the beginning of the input, the following colors in the output are: red red green (Example 1).
- When ""bluf"" appears as the second word in the input, the following colors in the output are: yellow yellow (Example 2).
- When ""bluf"" appears in the middle of the input, the colors in the output are determined by the words before and after it. For example, if the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"" and the word after ""bluf"" is ""zup"", the following colors in the output are: red blue blue red yellow (Example 3).
- When ""bluf"" appears at the end of the input, the previous colors in the output are: green red red (Example 4 and 5).

Therefore, the inferred rule is that the word ""bluf"" is followed by a sequence of colors in the output, determined by its position in the input.

- ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue"" in all examples and contexts.
dax -> color

Rule: The word ""dax"" seems to correspond to colors in the given examples. It appears that ""dax"" represents the color green in this context.
wif -> color sequence

Rule:
The word ""wif"" seems to represent a sequence of colors. In each example, the colors in the output correspond to the position of ""wif"" in the input. Therefore, ""wif"" can be seen as a placeholder for a color sequence.
zup -> color. The meaning of ""zup"" in the given examples seems to be associated with colors. Based on the examples, the following rule can be derived:

Rule: If ""zup"" is followed by a single word, the meaning of ""zup"" is the color associated with that word. The color associated with each word is as follows:
- wif -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red
- walm -> yellow

If ""zup"" is not followed by any word, its meaning is simply ""yellow"".

- Blue: bluf is associated with ""blue"" in the fifth input example.

While the exact meaning of ""bluf"" is not explicitly specified, it appears to represent different colors based on the given examples.
walm -> color

Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" refers to a color. In the first example, ""lug walm wif bluf"", the word ""walm"" is placed in between words that are colors (""bluf"" is likely a misspelling of ""blue""). When ""walm"" is present, it is consistently repeated three times in a row in the output. For example, in the second example ""dax walm"", the output is ""green green green"", indicating that ""walm"" corresponds to the color green. Similarly, in the third example ""lug walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""walm"" represents the color blue. 

Therefore, it can be concluded that ""walm"" is a nonce word used to represent a specific color in the given examples.

dax -> color

Meaning: In the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors. Based on the patterns observed, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule:
- When ""dax"" appears alone, it represents the color ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears in a sequence with other words, it represents the color that corresponds to the position of ""dax"" in that sequence. For example, in the sequence ""lug dax lug,"" ""dax"" is the second word, so it represents the color ""green.""

Therefore, the word ""dax"" seems to have a contextual meaning related to colors.
wif -> color

Rule: In the given context, the word ""wif"" seems to refer to a color. In the first example, ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red,"" in the second example with ""yellow,"" in the third example with ""green,"" and in the fourth and fifth examples with ""blue."" Therefore, ""wif"" appears to represent different colors in different contexts.
zup -> color. The output examples indicate that the word ""zup"" is associated with color. In each example, the output contains one or more colors, and ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow. Therefore, it can be inferred that ""zup"" is a nonce word that represents the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors based on the context. It could be inferred that ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color based on the other words in the sentence. For example, ""bluf"" is represented as red in the first example, blue in the second and fifth examples, and green in the third example.
walm -> color coding system

Meaning: walm is a representation of different colors in a coding system. It appears that each color is represented by a specific word (green, red, yellow, blue) and walm is used as an indicator for different colors.

Rule 1: When ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Rule 2: When ""lug"" appears in the input, the specific color in the output may change based on the context of the other words in the input. For example, in the first example, ""lug"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which correlates to the color ""green"" in the output. In the second example, ""lug"" is not preceded by any specific word, so it represents the color ""green"" in the output.

Based on the available examples, it is not clear if the word ""lug"" represents a specific set of colors, or if its meaning can vary depending on the context.
dax -> color
Meaning: The word ""dax"" seems to represent colors. Based on the examples, it can be deduced that ""dax"" usually corresponds to the color green. However, there are instances where ""dax"" is used alone, implying that it can also stand alone as the color green.

- When ""dax"" is the only word in the input, it corresponds to the color green.
- When ""dax"" is preceded by the word ""zup"" and followed by the word ""lug,"" it corresponds to the color yellow.
- When ""dax"" is followed by the word ""bluf,"" it corresponds to the color green.
- When ""dax"" is followed by the words ""lug"" and ""wif,"" it corresponds to the color blue.
- When ""dax"" is followed by the words ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" it corresponds to the color blue.

These rules indicate that the meaning of ""dax"" is dependent on its context and corresponds to different colors.
wif -> color, where each color corresponds to a specific position in the input sequence. 

Rule: The first occurrence of wif corresponds to the first color in the input sequence, the second occurrence of wif corresponds to the second color in the input sequence, and so on.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" always translates to the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Rule: bluf indicates a color, with ""green"" representing the word ""dax"", ""blue"" representing the word ""lug"", ""yellow"" representing the word ""zup"", and ""red"" representing the word ""wif"".
walm -> color
Meaning: walm represents a color, and the color is determined by the previous words in the sequence. 

Rule: If the previous word is ""wif"", then the color represented by walm is ""red"". 
Rule: If the previous word is ""lug"", then the color represented by walm is ""blue"". 
Rule: If there is no previous word, then the color represented by walm is ""green"".

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: Lug seems to represent different colors. Based on the examples, the following rule emerges: 
- The first occurrence of ""lug"" is represented by the color blue.
- The second occurrence of ""lug"" is represented by the color red.
- The third occurrence of ""lug"" is represented by the color green.
- Any subsequent occurrences of ""lug"" are represented by different colors based on the context.

Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" can be inferred as representing colors in a sequential pattern.
From the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"".

Based on the provided pairs, we can observe that the word ""dax"" is associated with the color green. Here are the rules we can deduce:

1. When ""dax"" appears alone, it means ""green"".
2. When ""dax"" appears after one or more words (e.g., ""lug dax"", ""lug walm dax""), the presence of each preceding word corresponds to a repetition of the word ""blue"" (e.g., ""lug dax"" implies ""blue green"", ""lug walm dax"" implies ""blue blue blue green"").
3. The order in which the words appear doesn't seem to affect the meaning of ""dax"". For example, both ""lug dax"" and ""dax lug"" result in ""green blue"".

Therefore, we can summarize the meaning of ""dax"" as follows: 

dax -> green
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" appears to be associated with colors. Based on the examples, the following rule can be inferred:

Rule: When ""wif"" is followed by a sequence of words, each word corresponds to a color. The order of the words seems to determine the order of the colors in the output.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow in all the provided examples.
bluf -> color sequence

Rule: In the given examples, it appears that bluf represents a sequence of colors. The colors in the sequence are represented by their corresponding words: red, yellow, blue, and green. The position of bluf within the examples determines the starting point of the color sequence, and the subsequent words represent the colors in order. Each color is represented by its corresponding word.

The sequence of colors indicated by bluf in the examples is as follows:
1st occurrence of bluf: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
2nd occurrence of bluf: red red green
3rd occurrence of bluf: yellow yellow blue green blue
4th occurrence of bluf: green green red blue
5th occurrence of bluf: blue green green

Although ""meaning"" in this case is subjective, based on the given examples, it seems that bluf represents a color sequence.
walm -> color. The color associated with the word ""walm"" seems to change based on the position of the word in the sentence. Here are the observed rules:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or ""lug"", it represents the color ""yellow"".
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", it represents the color ""green"".
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it represents the color ""red"".
4. In the absence of any preceding words, ""walm"" represents the color ""blue"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Explanation:
From the examples, it can be observed that the word ""lug"" is associated with colors. In the first three examples, ""lug"" is followed by other words that represent colors such as ""bluf"" (blue), ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" (green), and ""wif"" (red). Based on this pattern, it can be concluded that ""lug"" is a representation of a color.

Rule: lug -> color
dax -> color
Meaning: The word ""dax"" refers to different colors based on its context. The following rules can be deduced from the examples:

Rule 1: If ""dax"" is the only word in the input, its meaning is ""green"".
Example: Input: dax -> Output: green

Rule 2: If ""dax"" appears multiple times consecutively, its meaning remains the same and corresponds to the previous meaning.
Example: Input: dax bluf wif zup dax -> Output: green green red yellow green

Rule 3: If ""dax"" appears in between other words, its meaning is determined by the word that follows it.
Example: Input: dax zup lug wif lug -> Output: green yellow blue red blue
In this example, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" which maps to ""yellow"".

Rule 4: If ""dax"" appears before other words, its meaning is determined by the word that follows it.
Example: Input: dax walm wif zup -> Output: green green green red yellow
In this example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" which maps to ""green"".

Rule 5: If ""dax"" appears after other words, its meaning is determined by the word that precedes it.
Example: Input: zup dax walm lug wif -> Output: yellow green green green blue red
In this example, ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug"" which maps to ""green"".

Overall, the meaning of ""dax"" is dependent on the color associated with the word before or after it, or if it is the only word in the input, its meaning is ""green"".
wif -> color
Meaning: The word ""wif"" refers to colors, specifically the colors blue, green, yellow, and red.

Rule: The mapping of ""wif"" to colors follows a specific order, where each occurrence of ""wif"" represents the next color in the sequence (blue, green, yellow, red).
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow.
bluf -> color
Meaning: ""bluf"" refers to different colors depending on its position in the sequence of words. In the provided examples, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color yellow when it is preceded by the word ""zup,"" to the color red when it is preceded by the word ""wif,"" and to the color green when it is preceded by the word ""dax.""
walm -> color coding

Based on the given examples, it can be observed that the word ""walm"" is associated with a specific color coding. The color coding follows the pattern where the first occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to the color green, the second occurrence corresponds to the color yellow, the third occurrence corresponds to the color blue, and so on. Therefore, the deduced meaning of ""walm"" in this context is a color coding system.

Therefore, the word ""dax"" seems to represent different colors depending on the context.
wif -> color

Meaning: wif seems to represent the color of an object or entity mentioned in the input sentence. Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: If wif is present in the sentence, it represents the color of the following noun or object.

This can be observed from the consistent pattern in the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" which can be interpreted as the color of ""bluf"" is red.
- In the second example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"" which implies that the color of ""bluf"" is red.
- In the third example, ""wif"" stands on its own and translates to ""red"" indicating that wif itself represents the color.
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"" suggesting that the color of ""wif"" is red.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow"" which suggests that the color of ""walm"" is red.

Therefore, based on the examples, we can determine that wif represents the color of the following noun or object in the sentence.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Meaning: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue. The rule deduced from the examples is that ""lug"" represents the color blue.
dax -> color. The word ""dax"" seems to correspond to different colors based on its context. From the examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears, it represents the color of the word that follows it.

For example, in the first example, ""dax"" appears before ""lug,"" so it represents the color blue. Similarly, in the second example, ""dax"" appears before ""bluf,"" so it represents the color green.
wif -> color

Meaning: ""wif"" seems to represent different colors based on its context. In the given examples, ""wif"" is associated with the colors: red, blue, green, and yellow. However, since ""wif"" is a nonce word and its meaning is not explicitly defined, it is difficult to generalize a specific rule for its use. It seems that the meaning of ""wif"" is arbitrary and can be assigned different colors in different contexts.
zup -> color based on the following rules:

Rule 1: If zup appears alone in the input, it means ""yellow"".
Example: Input: zup -> Output: yellow

Rule 2: If zup is followed by ""wif"" in the input, the meaning of zup depends on the color associated with ""wif"".
Example: Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red

Rule 3: If zup is followed by any other word, the meaning of zup depends on the color associated with that word. The color associated with zup is then determined by the sequence of colors associated with the previous occurrences of that word.
Example: 
- If the previous occurrence of the word is associated with ""red"", zup is ""yellow"".
- If the previous occurrence of the word is associated with ""green"", zup is ""blue"".
- If the previous occurrence of the word is associated with ""blue"", zup is ""green"".

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: lug seems to represent a color. The color associated with lug varies depending on the context in which it is used. The mappings between lug and color are as follows:

lug dax -> blue green
lug zup -> blue yellow
wif lug -> red blue

Based on these examples, it appears that lug takes on the color of the word that follows it. Therefore, the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: lug followed by a word represents the color of that word.
dax -> color

Rule: 
The presence of ""dax"" corresponds to a color. ""dax"" has the meaning of ""green"" when it appears alone or before another word, but the following word changes its meaning. For example, when ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"", it means ""red"", and when ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"", it means ""yellow"". Multiple occurrences of ""dax"" alternate between ""green"" and ""red"".
wif -> color

From the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to different colors based on its context:

Rule: wif is associated with colors based on the following mapping:
- wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
- zup wif -> yellow red
- dax wif walm -> green red red red
- wif lug dax -> red blue green
- zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be determined based on the context and represents a color.
zup -> color yellow

Meaning: The word ""zup"" in all the examples is always associated with the color yellow. Therefore, the rule is that ""zup"" means the color yellow.
bluf -> color. Rule: The color of ""bluf"" is determined by its position in the input sequence. The first occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to red, the second occurrence corresponds to yellow, the third occurrence corresponds to blue, and so on.
Based on the provided examples, I have deduced the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" means red.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup,"" ""walm"" is translated to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" is translated to ""green."" However, this seems to be an exception, and the color ""green"" here does not appear to be related to the meaning of ""walm"" in other examples.
- In the third example, ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" is translated to ""green,"" which again contradicts the previous translation of ""walm"" in the first example.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""walm"" is translated to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" is translated to ""blue.""

Given the inconsistencies in the translations of ""walm,"" it is challenging to determine a general rule for its meaning. However, based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" can be interpreted as the color ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue. In the third example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue again. In the fourth example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue once more. In the fifth example, ""lug"" is associated with the color green. 

Rule: Lug represents a color, and the specific color can vary depending on the context.
dax -> color

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents a color. The color associated with ""dax"" depends on its position relative to other words. When ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"", it represents the color green. When ""dax"" is preceded by ""bluf"", it represents the color red. When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"", it represents the color yellow.
wif -> color. The color varies in each example, but it seems to correspond to the position of wif in the input sequence. For example, in the first example, wif is the fifth word and its corresponding color in the output is red. This pattern holds true for all the examples.
zup -> color position in a sequence of words.

Meaning:
- yellow: the word following zup
- green: the word occurring two places after zup
- blue: the word occurring three places after zup
- red: the word occurring four places after zup

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: The word ""lug"" represents a color. Based on the examples, it seems that different instances of ""lug"" correspond to different colors. However, it is not possible to determine a specific mapping between ""lug"" and colors without further context or information.
dax -> color of an object. The meaning of ""dax"" appears to be associated with colors, specifically red, green, blue, and yellow. In the given examples, ""dax"" is always followed by another word (e.g., ""lug"", ""walm"", ""wif"", ""zup"") and the color of that object or concept corresponds to the output. ""dax"" seems to act as an indicator or label for colors.
wif -> color

Rule: In the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" is a word that represents the color ""red"".
zup -> color. The word ""zup"" seems to be associated with different colors in the provided examples. Based on the patterns observed, ""zup"" can mean different colors in different contexts, such as yellow in the absence of any other words or blue when paired with ""lug"" or ""bluf"".
bluf -> color
Meaning: The word ""bluf"" appears to represent different colors based on the context in which it is used. It can represent the color blue or red, depending on the presence or absence of other words in the input.
walm -> color
Meaning: walm represents different colors based on its position in the input sequence. The color assigned to walm is determined by the neighboring words in the sequence. The specific rules deduced from the examples are as follows:

1. When walm is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax"", it represents the color yellow.
2. When walm is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""wif"", it represents the color green.
3. When walm is preceded and followed by ""lug"", it represents the color blue.
4. When walm is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by any word other than ""wif"" or ""dax"", it represents the color yellow.
5. When walm is preceded by any word other than ""zup"" or ""lug"" and followed by ""lug"", it represents the color red.
6. There are no specific rules indicated for cases where walm is at the beginning or end of the input sequence.

Please note that these rules are based solely on the examples provided and may not represent the complete rule set. Further examples or context might be needed to refine the rules or identify additional patterns.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> color. 

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" is consistently associated with colors. The output for each example is a sequence of color words (e.g., blue, yellow, red) with ""lug"" determining the color for each output. Therefore, it can be concluded that ""lug"" represents a color.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" seems to be a color, specifically green. This can be inferred from the examples where ""dax"" is used in a sequence of other color words such as ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" (green), and ""bluf"" (blue). In all of these examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to represent different colors in each example. In the first example, ""wif"" is associated with the colors blue and red. In the second example, it is associated with the colors red and blue. In the third example, it is associated with the colors blue, red, and green. In the fourth example, it is associated with the colors blue and red again. In the final example, ""wif"" is associated with only the color red. Therefore, based on these examples, it can be concluded that ""wif"" represents different colors depending on the context in which it is used.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in this context.
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" refers to a color. The specific color associated with ""bluf"" is determined by the positions of the words in the input sentence.
walm -> color (based on the examples) Rule: 
- If walm is preceded by ""dax"", the meaning is ""green"".
- If walm is preceded by ""wif"", the meaning is ""red"".
- If walm is preceded by ""zup"", the meaning is ""yellow"".
- If walm is preceded by any other word, the meaning is ""blue"".

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color. Rule: The word ""lug"" is associated with different colors depending on its context. In most cases, it corresponds to the colors blue, red, green, yellow, and sometimes also ""yellow yellow yellow"" (which could represent a shade or variation of yellow).
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" seems to be associated with colors. The color assigned to ""dax"" is determined by the preceding words in the sequence. Based on the examples provided, the following rules can be inferred:

1. If the word immediately preceding ""dax"" is ""bluf"", then the meaning of ""dax"" is ""green"".
2. If the word immediately preceding ""dax"" is ""zup"", then the meaning of ""dax"" is ""yellow"".
3. If the word immediately preceding ""dax"" is ""lug"", then the meaning of ""dax"" is ""blue"".
4. If the word immediately preceding ""dax"" is ""wif"", then the meaning of ""dax"" is ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for determining the meaning of ""dax"" is that it corresponds to the color of the preceding word in the sequence.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" seems to correspond to different colors in the given examples. Specifically, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the second example and ""green"" in the fifth example. It also seems to have a position-based relationship with other words in the sequence. Thus, a possible rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: If ""wif"" is the first or last word in a sequence, it corresponds to the color ""red""; if ""wif"" is in any other position, it corresponds to the color ""green"".
zup -> yellow

Based on the examples, it seems that ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. Therefore, we can deduce the rule that ""zup"" represents the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors based on the context in which it is used. The rule for determining the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be as follows: 

1. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""walm,"" it represents the color green.
2. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup,"" it represents the color yellow.
3. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it represents the color red.

It is important to note that this rule is specific to the given examples, and the actual meaning of ""bluf"" may vary in different contexts.
walm -> color code (specifically the word for a color) based on the position of walm in the input sentence.

Rule: The word ""walm"" represents a color code, where the position of ""walm"" in the input sentence determines the corresponding color. The color codes are as follows:

- If ""walm"" is the first word in the input sentence, the color code is ""yellow"".
- If ""walm"" is the second word in the input sentence, the color code is ""red"".
- If ""walm"" is the third word in the input sentence, the color code is ""green"".
- If ""walm"" is the fourth word in the input sentence, the color code is ""blue"".

For example, when dax is preceded by ""wif"" it is always red, when it is followed by ""zup"" it is always green, and when it is preceded by ""lug"" it is always blue. Therefore, the meaning of dax appears to be dependent on its neighboring words and can be interpreted as a color.
wif -> color. 
Meaning: wif represents a color, specifically red in this context. The color assigned to wif is determined by the position of wif in a sequence of words. The first example shows that when wif is the only word, it corresponds to the color red. In longer sequences, wif takes on a different color based on its position.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""zup"" is always associated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" appears to represent different colors based on the context it is used in. It can represent the colors green, blue, or red. The following rules can be deduced from the examples:

Rules:
1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""dax"", it represents the color green.
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by a different word, it represents the color blue.

zup -> color. It appears that the word ""zup"" is representing different colors in each example. The color is determined by the position of ""zup"" in relation to other words in the input. For example, in the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", so it represents the color yellow. In the second example, ""zup"" is preceded by ""bluf"" and followed by another ""bluf"", so it represents the color blue. Similarly, in the third example, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and in the fourth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"". This pattern holds true for all the examples, indicating that the position of ""zup"" in relation to other words determines the color it represents.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" represents a color. 

Rule: The color represented by ""bluf"" is determined by the preceding words in the input string. The examples suggest that the color is determined by the position of ""bluf"" relative to other colors.

dax -> color

Meaning: dax is associated with different colors based on the context.

Rule: The color associated with dax depends on the position of dax in the input sequence. The first occurrence of dax corresponds to the color yellow, the second occurrence corresponds to green, the third occurrence corresponds to blue, and so on.
wif -> color. The color associated with wif seems to vary depending on its position in the sentence and the presence of other words. Based on the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

If wif is the only word in the sentence, wif means ""red"".
If wif is preceded by any word, wif means ""green"".
If wif is followed by any word, wif means ""blue"".
If wif is preceded and followed by words, wif means ""yellow"".

Based on this analysis, it seems that the meaning or color associated with wif depends on its position relative to other words in the sentence.

Position-color association:
1 -> yellow
2 -> green
3 -> blue
4 -> red

For example:
- In the first example, ""walm"" appears in the 3rd position, so its color is blue.
- In the second example, ""walm"" appears in the 1st position, so its color is yellow.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is ""color"", specifically determined by its position in the sequence.

- dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
- zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow

Therefore, the general rule can be:
- If ""wif"" is surrounded by only one word, then it represents the color of that word.
- If ""wif"" is surrounded by more than one word, the color assigned to ""wif"" depends on the surrounding words. The colors are assigned in the order they appear in the sentence, with ""red"" being the first, ""green"" being the second, ""blue"" being the third, and ""yellow"" being the fourth. If there are more surrounding words than available colors, the pattern repeats.
zup -> yellow

Meaning: The word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow in all provided examples. Therefore, based on these examples, the rule is that ""zup"" means the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors based on its position and neighboring words in the examples. Here are the observed rules:

Rule 1: If ""bluf"" appears after a color word, it represents the color red.
Example: wif bluf -> red red

Rule 2: If ""bluf"" appears after a color word and before another occurrence of ""bluf"" or a different color word, it represents the color red.
Example: zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red

Rule 3: If ""bluf"" appears after a word that is not a color or ""bluf"" itself, it represents the color red.
Example: lug wif bluf -> blue red red

Rule 4: If ""bluf"" appears after a color word and is followed by a different word which is not a color or ""bluf"" itself, it represents the color red.
Example: zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

Rule 5: If ""bluf"" appears after a non-color word and is followed by a color word or ""bluf"" itself, it represents the color red.
Example: lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue

Based on the examples, it can be concluded that ""bluf"" represents the color red in this context.

- If ""dax"" is the first word in the input sequence, it corresponds to the color green.
- If ""dax"" is not the first word in the input sequence, its color is determined by the color of the previous word.

Applying this rule to the examples:

- Example 1:
  - ""dax"" is the third word in the input sequence.
  - The previous word is ""bluf"" which corresponds to the color red.
  - Therefore, the color of ""dax"" in this example is also red.

- Example 2:
  - ""dax"" is the third and fifth words in the input sequence.
  - The previous words are ""zup"" and ""zup"" which both correspond to the color yellow.
  - Therefore, the color of ""dax"" in this example is yellow.

- Example 3:
  - ""dax"" is the first word in the input sequence.
  - The rule states that in this case, the color of ""dax"" is green.
  - Therefore, the color of ""dax"" in this example is green.

- Example 4:
  - ""dax"" is the fifth word in the input sequence.
  - The previous word is ""walm"" which corresponds to the color yellow.
  - Therefore, the color of ""dax"" in this example is yellow.

- Example 5:
  - This example only consists of the word ""dax"".
  - According to the rule, the color of ""dax"" is green.
  - Therefore, the color of ""dax"" in this example is green.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Meaning: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" appears to be a color, with different contexts indicating different colors. The following rules can be derived from the examples:

Rule 1: If ""dax"" is the only word in the input, it represents the color green.
Rule 2: If ""dax"" appears directly after a color word, it represents the same color. For example, ""wif dax zup dax"" implies that the color represented by ""dax"" is green (based on the previous occurrence of ""green"").
Rule 3: If ""dax"" appears after multiple words, it represents the color of the word preceding it. For example, in ""wif bluf dax,"" ""dax"" represents the color blue because it follows the word ""bluf"" which represents blue.
Rule 4: If ""dax"" appears before multiple words, it represents the color blue. For example, in ""wif dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" represents the color blue because it appears before the words ""lug"" and ""walm,"" which represent blue.

These rules suggest that the meaning of ""dax"" is dependent on the context and represents a color, most commonly green but also blue in certain contexts.

1. When ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" and ""bluf"", it corresponds to the color yellow.
2. When ""wif"" appears after ""lug"", it corresponds to the color blue.
3. When ""wif"" appears after ""dax"", it corresponds to the color green.
4. When ""wif"" appears after ""zup"", it corresponds to the color red.

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" is dependent on the preceding word and represents a specific color.
zup -> color sequence. The meaning of ""zup"" in the given context seems to indicate a sequence of colors. In each example, ""zup"" is associated with a specific color pattern or sequence, specifically yellow-red-red, blue-yellow-green-blue-green, green-green-green-yellow-blue-green, yellow-green-blue-yellow, and yellow-blue-red. Therefore, it can be inferred that ""zup"" represents a sequence of colors.
bluf -> color. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be associated with colors. It corresponds to the following color patterns in the given examples:

- bluf -> red
- bluf -> green
- bluf -> yellow
- bluf -> blue

Based on the examples, the rule for the meanings of ""bluf"" appears to be:

- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", it means ""red"".
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", it means ""green"".
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by any other word (not ""wif"" or ""dax""), it means ""yellow"".
- If ""bluf"" is not preceded by any other word, it means ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" can be defined as:

bluf -> color (based on the preceding word)
- If preceding word is ""wif"", color = red.
- If preceding word is ""dax"", color = green.
- If preceding word is anything else, color = yellow.
- If there is no preceding word, color = blue.

Meaning: The word ""lug"" seems to be associated with different colors based on the context in which it appears.

Rule:
If ""lug"" appears with other words in the phrase, it corresponds to the color mentioned in the output. The order of appearance of ""lug"" does not affect its meaning.

Examples:
- ""lug zup lug"" -> blue yellow blue
- ""dax zup lug"" -> green yellow blue
- ""wif lug"" -> red blue
dax -> color green. 

Rule: In the given examples, whenever ""dax"" is present, it is associated with the color green.
wif -> color

Meaning: The word ""wif"" seems to represent different colors depending on its position in the sentence. Based on the examples, ""wif"" appears to be associated with the following colors:

- When ""wif"" is the only word in the sentence, it represents the color ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by another word, it represents the color of the following word. For example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red blue"" indicating that ""wif"" represents the color ""red"" and ""bluf"" represents the color ""blue"".
- When ""wif"" is preceded by another word, it does not influence the color represented by the preceding word. For example, ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red"" indicating that ""wif"" does not change the color represented by ""dax"" and ""lug,"" but represents the color ""red"" for itself.

Hence, the rule can be stated as follows:

- If ""wif"" is the only word, it represents the color ""red.""
- If ""wif"" is followed by another word, it represents the same color as the following word.
- If ""wif"" is preceded by another word, it does not influence the color represented by the preceding word.

2. In the second, third, and fourth examples, the word ""bluf"" is associated with the color yellow.
3. In the fifth example, the word ""bluf"" is associated with the colors green, blue, and blue.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" is being used as a label or identifier for a specific color. Its meaning is dependent on the context and can vary, but in this particular scenario, it is associated with the colors yellow, red, green, and blue, representing some sort of color-coding system.
walm -> color. The word ""walm"" seems to represent the color yellow, as it consistently appears in the output as ""yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

    Rules:
lug -> color

Meaning: The word ""lug"" appears to represent a color in each of the given examples. It can take on different specific colors depending on the context. The following rules can be observed:

1. When ""lug"" is preceded by the word ""dax"", the corresponding color is ""green"".
2. When ""lug"" is preceded by the word ""wif"", the corresponding color is ""red"".
3. When ""lug"" is preceded by any other word, the corresponding color is ""blue"".
4. The color ""yellow"" can occur after ""lug"" if it is preceded by the word ""zup"".

These rules are based on the provided examples and may not cover all possible contexts or meanings of the word ""lug"".
dax -> color. The color associated with the word ""dax"" seems to be determined by the word that immediately precedes it. When ""dax"" follows ""zup"" or ""walm"", it corresponds to the color yellow. When ""dax"" follows ""lug"", it corresponds to the color green. When ""dax"" follows ""wif"", it corresponds to the color red.
wif -> color

Meaning: ""wif"" is a word that refers to a color. It can take on different colors based on context. From the examples provided, we can deduce the following rules:

Rule 1: If ""wif"" is followed by another word (e.g., ""wif lug""), the color associated with ""wif"" is ""red"". (Input: wif lug => Output: red blue)

Rule 2: If ""wif"" appears alone without any following words, the color associated with ""wif"" is ""red"". (Input: wif => Output: red)

Rule 3: If ""wif"" is preceded by another word (e.g., ""dax wif""), the color associated with ""wif"" is ""red"". (Input: dax wif => Output: green red)

Rule 4: If ""wif"" is followed by more than one word (e.g., ""wif zup dax""), the colors associated with ""wif"" are ""red yellow green"". (Input: wif zup dax => Output: red yellow green)

Based on these rules, we can conclude that ""wif"" is a word that corresponds to different colors depending on its context.
zup -> color. The word ""zup"" appears to represent different colors in different contexts. In the first example, it maps to the colors green, red, and yellow. In the second example, it maps to yellow and blue. The third example shows zup mapping to red and yellow, and the fourth example maps it to yellow, blue, and red again. Therefore, the general rule for zup seems to be that it represents a color depending on the context it is used in.
bluf -> color.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents different colors based on its context in a sentence.
walm -> color. walm seems to represent different colors in different contexts. In the first example, it represents the color yellow. In the second example, it represents the colors red and blue. In the third example, it represents the colors yellow, green, and blue. In the fourth example, it represents the colors yellow, red, and green. In the fifth example, it represents the color blue. Therefore, walm seems to be a nonce word used to represent different colors in each context.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax bluf wif lug
    ",Output: blue green blue red blue,blue green green red blue,False,197
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color. Rule: lug corresponds to a color, specifically blue.
dax -> color. The meaning of ""dax"" appears to be a color. The context suggests that ""dax"" can represent different colors depending on its position in the input sequence. 
Rule: When ""dax"" is the only word in the input, its meaning is ""green"". When ""dax"" is followed by another word, its meaning corresponds to the color of that word in the given context.
wif -> color

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to a color, with each example providing a specific mapping between ""wif"" and a specific color.
zup -> color

Rule: The word ""zup"" seems to represent different colors depending on its context. In the given examples, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
bluf -> color

Meaning:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" represents colors. The color assigned to ""bluf"" depends on the colors mentioned before and after it. The rules for determining the color are as follows:

1. If the word before ""bluf"" is mentioned as red, the color assigned to ""bluf"" is green. (e.g., ""wif bluf dax"" -> red red green)

2. If the word before ""bluf"" is mentioned as blue, the color assigned to ""bluf"" is red. (e.g., ""lug bluf wif"" -> blue blue red)

3. If the word before ""bluf"" is mentioned as green, the color assigned to ""bluf"" is yellow. (e.g., ""dax zup bluf"" -> green yellow yellow)

4. If there are multiple occurrences of ""bluf"" in a sentence, each occurrence follows the same color assignment rules based on the surrounding words and previous occurrences. (e.g., ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> red green yellow red green green)

Based on these examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be assigned a color based on the colors mentioned before it and follows a consistent pattern.
walm -> color

Meaning: ""walm"" seems to refer to a color. In each example, the output is a repetition of a color word. For example, in the first example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" refers to the color red. Similarly, in the second example, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" represents the color green. This pattern continues across the other examples, suggesting that ""walm"" is a nonce word used to represent various colors.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,198
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color

Rules:
1. If there is a sequence of three words with ""lug"" in between, the colors alternate between blue and red. (e.g., lug wif lug -> blue red blue)
2. If there are two words with ""lug"" in between, the first word is red and the second word is blue. (e.g., wif lug -> red blue)
3. If there are three words before ""lug"" and one word after, the colors are green, blue, and red. (e.g., dax lug wif -> green blue red)
4. If there is only one word after ""lug,"" the color is blue. (e.g., lug bluf -> blue blue)
5. If there are two words before ""lug"" and no word after, the colors are green and blue. (e.g., dax lug -> green blue)

Please note that these rules are based solely on the provided examples and may not capture the complete meaning of ""lug"" in all contexts.
dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" in the given examples appears to represent different colors. In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with the output ""red green"". In the second example, ""dax"" is associated with the output ""green green red yellow blue"". In the third example, ""dax"" is associated with the output ""green blue red red red"". In the fourth example, ""dax"" is associated with the output ""green"". In the fifth example, ""dax"" is associated with the output ""red red green green green"".

From these examples, it seems that the meaning of ""dax"" varies, but it consistently represents a color. Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: dax -> color
wif -> color of the previous word

Rule: The word ""wif"" refers to the color of the preceding word.
zup -> color

Based on the examples, it seems that ""zup"" is a word that represents a color. Its meaning changes in different contexts. For example, in the first example (""zup dax lug""), ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" while in the second example (""dax bluf wif zup wif""), ""zup"" corresponds to ""red."" The specific color associated with ""zup"" in each case appears to depend on the position of ""zup"" in the sequence of words.
bluf -> color. 

The word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with color in all of the provided examples. It appears that ""bluf"" maps to specific colors, such as yellow, green, and blue. It can be deduced that the different occurrences of ""bluf"" correspond to different colors depending on the context.
walm -> color

Meaning: In the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with colors. Each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input has a corresponding color in the output. The specific colors associated with ""walm"" in each example are:

- Example 1: walm -> green
- Example 2: walm -> yellow
- Example 3: walm -> blue
- Example 4: walm -> yellow
- Example 5: walm -> red

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" is a nonce word used to represent different colors in the given examples.
