"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> color.

Rule: lug is a word that represents different colors depending on the context. The color associated with lug can be determined by looking at the words before and after lug in the examples.

Example 1: ""dax lug bluf dax""
In this example, lug is surrounded by the words ""dax"" and ""bluf"". The colors associated with these words are ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively. Therefore, lug in this context represents the color ""blue"". The expected output confirms this by repeating ""blue"" for both instances of lug.

Example 2: ""lug zup dax wif""
In this example, lug is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax"" and ""wif"". The colors associated with these words are ""yellow"", ""green"", and ""red"" respectively. Therefore, lug in this context represents the color ""blue"". The expected output confirms this by assigning ""blue"" to lug.

Example 3: ""lug dax""
In this example, lug is preceded by ""dax"" and there are no words following it. The color associated with ""dax"" is ""green"". Therefore, lug in this context represents the color ""blue"". The expected output confirms this by assigning ""blue"" to lug.

Example 4: ""lug""
In this example, lug is not preceded or followed by any words. The expected output assigns ""blue"" as the color for lug.

Example 5: ""lug bluf""
In this example, lug is preceded by ""bluf"" and there are no words following it. The color associated with ""bluf"" is ""blue"". Therefore, lug in this context also represents the color ""blue"". The expected output confirms this by assigning ""blue"" to both instances of lug.

Based on these examples, the rule for determining the meaning of lug is that it represents the color ""blue"".
