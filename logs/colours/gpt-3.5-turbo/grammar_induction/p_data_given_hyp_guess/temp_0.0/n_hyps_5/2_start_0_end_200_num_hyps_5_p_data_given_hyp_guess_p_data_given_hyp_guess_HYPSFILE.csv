"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup is a color indicator. The color that zup represents is determined by the position of zup in the sequence of words in the input.

Explanation: 
- In the first example, zup is the first word in the sequence, and it corresponds to the color yellow.
- In the second example, zup is the second word in the sequence, and it corresponds to the color yellow.
- In the third example, zup is the first and third words in the sequence, and both instances correspond to the color yellow.
- In the fourth example, zup is the first and third words in the sequence, corresponding to yellow, and the fifth word corresponds to green.
- In the fifth example, zup is the first word in the sequence, corresponding to yellow, and the third word corresponds to blue.

Therefore, the rule for zup can be summarized as follows:

zup -> yellow if zup is the first or third word in the sequence.
zup -> green if zup is the fifth word in the sequence.
zup -> blue if zup is the second word in the sequence.

Meaning: ""wif"" refers to different colors depending on its context. Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" can refer to the colors blue, green, red, or yellow. The specific color seems to be determined by the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence and the surrounding words. Here are the rules inferred from the examples:

Rule 1: When ""wif"" is preceded by a color word, it takes on the next color in a predefined sequence. For example, in the input ""lug dax wif lug,"" ""wif"" follows ""dax"" (green) and takes on the next color in the sequence, which is blue. So, ""wif"" in this context means blue.

Rule 2: When ""wif"" is not preceded by a color word, it takes on the color that corresponds to its position in the sequence of inputs. For example, in the input ""wif walm zup walm,"" ""wif"" is the first word and corresponds to the first color in the sequence, which is red. So, ""wif"" in this context means red.

Rule 3: If ""wif"" occurs multiple times in the input, each occurrence inherits the color based on the rule above. For example, in the input ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" there are two occurrences of ""wif."" The second ""wif"" follows ""dax"" (green) and takes on the next color in the sequence, which is red. So, the second ""wif"" in this context means red.

"wif -> position of color in output

Meaning: The position of the color in the output is indicated by the presence of the word ""wif"" in the input. Specifically, ""wif"" determines whether a color is in the first, second, third, or fourth position in the output.",0.8,45,wif
"wif -> color

The word ""wif"" appears in various contexts with different colors associated with it. Based on the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When ""wif"" is the first word in a phrase, it is associated with the color ""red"". When ""wif"" is in any other position within a phrase, its color is dependent on the other words in the phrase.

- If ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"", the color is ""red yellow"".
- If ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""walm"", the color is ""yellow red red red"".
- If ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by the end of the phrase, the color is ""yellow yellow yellow red"".

In the last example, when ""wif"" is surrounded by other words (e.g., ""dax wif lug dax""), it does not follow the previous rule. Therefore, ""wif"" in this context is not associated with a specific color, so we cannot determine its meaning based on the given examples.",0.8,45,wif
"wif -> color

Meaning: The word ""wif"" represents a color. Based on the examples, it appears that ""wif"" can represent multiple colors. 

Rule: The color represented by ""wif"" is dependent on its position in the input. If ""wif"" appears at the beginning of the input, it corresponds to the color red. If ""wif"" appears at the end of the input, it corresponds to the color yellow. If ""wif"" appears in between other words, the color it represents is dependent on the position of neighboring words.

Rule: If ""dax"" appears alone (without any other words), it represents the color green.

Additionally, certain words that appear alongside ""dax"" provide clues about its color:

- When ""dax"" appears with the word ""zup,"" it corresponds to the color yellow.
- When ""dax"" appears with the word ""lug,"" it corresponds to the color blue.
- When ""dax"" appears with the word ""wif,"" it corresponds to the color red.

"dax -> color

Meaning: The word ""dax"" represents different colors based on the context.

Rule: The color associated with ""dax"" is determined by the word(s) that appear before and after it in the given examples. Below is the mapping observed from the examples:

- If ""dax"" occurs alone, it represents the color ""green"".
- If ""dax"" is preceded by the word ""zup"" and followed by the word ""bluf"", it represents the color ""yellow green green"".
- If ""dax"" is preceded by the word ""zup"" and followed by the word ""lug"", it represents the color ""yellow green blue"".
- If ""dax"" is preceded by the word ""wif"" and followed by any word(s), it represents the color ""red green"" (number of ""red"" repetitions depends on the number of words following ""dax"").
- If ""dax"" is surrounded by words (preceded and followed by words), it represents the color combination based on the colors of the surrounding words. For example, in the input ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"", ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""bluf"", which represents the color combination ""red green green red blue"".

Rule: The word ""dax"" is associated with different colors in different contexts. Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following associations:

- When ""dax"" is preceded by another word, the color associated with ""dax"" is determined by the last word. For example, in the input ""dax lug"", ""lug"" corresponds to green, so ""dax"" is also associated with green.

- When ""dax"" is the only word, it is associated with the color green.

- The number of times ""dax"" is repeated in the input determines the number of times the associated color is repeated in the output. For example, in the input ""dax walm"", ""dax"" appears twice, so the associated color green is repeated twice in the output.

Based on this, the inference can be made that ""dax"" represents a color, and the specific color is determined by the context in which it appears.",1.0,91,dax

Example:
Given an input phrase ""X bluf Y"", where X and Y represent other words, the output corresponding to ""bluf"" will be the same color repeated twice. The specific color is determined by the position of ""bluf"" in the input phrase.

Using this rule, we can explain the outputs from the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" appears in the second and fourth position, so it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" repeated twice: yellow yellow red red.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" appears in the second position, so it corresponds to the color ""green"" repeated twice: green green yellow.
- In the third example, ""lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" appears in the second position, so it corresponds to the color ""blue"" repeated twice: blue blue.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" appears in the second position, so it corresponds to the color ""red"" repeated twice: red red.
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif,"" ""bluf"" appears in the second position, so it corresponds to the color ""red"" repeated twice: red red. The rest of the words in the input do not affect the output for ""bluf"".
