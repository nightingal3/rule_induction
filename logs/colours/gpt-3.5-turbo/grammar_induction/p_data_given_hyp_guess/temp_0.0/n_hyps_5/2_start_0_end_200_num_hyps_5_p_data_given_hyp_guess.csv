- In the second example, ""zup dax bluf"" is transformed to ""yellow green green"". Here, ""bluf"" follows both ""dax"" and ""zup"", and it is associated with the colors green and yellow respectively.
- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug"" is transformed to ""red red blue"". Just like the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and represents the color red. However, this time it is followed by ""lug"" and assigned the color blue.
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" is transformed to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" twice and is assigned the color yellow each time. It follows ""dax"" twice and is assigned the colors green and blue respectively.
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" is transformed to ""red yellow yellow red green"". ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is assigned the color yellow. It follows ""wif"" again and is assigned the color yellow. Finally, it follows ""dax"" and is assigned the color green.
