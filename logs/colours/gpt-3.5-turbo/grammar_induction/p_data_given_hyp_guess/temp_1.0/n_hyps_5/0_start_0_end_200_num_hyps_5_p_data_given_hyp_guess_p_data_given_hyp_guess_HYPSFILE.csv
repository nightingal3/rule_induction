"zup -> yellow. Rule: Every occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.",1.0,19,zup
"zup -> color

From the given examples, it can be observed that the word ""zup"" is associated with different colors in different contexts. The meaning of ""zup"" seems to be dependent on the presence of other words in the input. Here are the general rules deduced from the examples:

1. If ""zup"" is the only word in the input, its meaning is ""yellow"".
   Example: Input: zup -> Output: yellow

2. If ""zup"" appears along with the word ""lug"" in the input, its meaning is ""blue yellow"".
   Example: Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow

3. If ""zup"" appears along with the words ""dax"" and/or ""walm"" in the input, the corresponding number of occurrences of ""green"" is added to its meaning, and ""blue"" is added once if ""lug"" is also present in the input.
   Example: Input: zup dax walm lug wif -> Output: yellow green green green blue red

4. If ""zup"" appears along with the words ""bluf"" and/or ""wif"" in the input, the corresponding number of occurrences of ""red"" is added to its meaning, and ""blue"" is added once if ""lug"" is also present in the input.
   Example: Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red

5. If ""zup"" appears along with the words ""dax"" and/or ""walm"" in the input, the corresponding number of occurrences of ""green"" is added to its meaning, and ""blue"" is added once if ""lug"" is also present in the input. Additionally, if ""dax"" appears after ""zup"", ""green"" is added again.
   Example: Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif -> Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"". Since ""walm"" is the second word in the sentence, ""wif"" is associated with the color green.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"". Since ""lug"" is the first word in the sentence, ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""wif"" appears alone without any following word. In these cases, ""wif"" is associated with the color red.

"walm -> color

Rule: The word ""walm"" represents a color. The color represented by ""walm"" can be determined based on its position in the sentence and the colors associated with the surrounding words.

1) When ""walm"" appears after one or more words, it corresponds to the color red. For example, in ""zup wif walm"", ""walm"" comes after three words and the output is ""red red red red"". Similarly, in ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""walm"" comes after four words and the output is ""red red red red red"".

2) When ""walm"" appears before one or more words, it corresponds to the color green. For example, in ""dax walm lug"", ""walm"" comes before one word and the output is ""green green green blue"". Similarly, in ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""walm"" comes before three words and the output is ""red red green green green"".

3) When ""walm"" appears in between two or more words, it corresponds to the color yellow. For example, in ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"", ""walm"" appears between two words three times, which corresponds to the output ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"".

- If walm does not follow a color word, the color added to the sequence is the color yellow.

Example:
- Input: zup wif walm

Meaning: dax represents different colors based on the context. The following rules can be observed:

Rule 1: If dax appears after another word, it represents a color. The color is determined based on the word that comes before it. For example, if dax follows ""zup"" or ""bluf,"" it represents the color yellow or red respectively.

Rule 2: If dax appears before another word, it represents a color. The color is determined based on the word that comes after it. For example, if dax precedes ""lug"" or ""walm,"" it represents the color blue or green respectively.

"zup -> color

Meaning: Zup is a word that refers to different colors depending on its position in the sentence. It seems that zup represents three different colors: red, yellow, and blue. The specific color is determined by the position of zup in relation to other words in the sentence. Based on the examples, we can infer the following rules:

1. If zup is followed by ""lug,"" it represents the color yellow.
2. If zup is followed by ""dax"" and not followed by ""bluf,"" it represents the color yellow.
3. If zup is followed by ""bluf"" and the preceding word is not ""lug,"" it represents the color yellow.
