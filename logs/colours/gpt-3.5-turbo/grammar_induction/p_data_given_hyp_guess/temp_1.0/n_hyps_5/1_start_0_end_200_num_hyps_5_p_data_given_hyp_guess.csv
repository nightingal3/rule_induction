    Rules:
lug -> color. Rule: lug corresponds to a color, with each occurrence of lug representing a different color.
dax -> color

Meaning: ""dax"" represents the color of an object mentioned in the sentence. Based on the examples, we can deduce the following rules:

Rule 1: If ""dax"" appears before or after a color word (e.g., zup dax walm), ""dax"" represents the color of the object being described.
Example: Input: zup dax walm zup wif  => Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Explanation: The first occurrence of ""dax"" is after ""zup"", which represents the color yellow. The second occurrence of ""dax"" is after ""walm"", which represents the color green.

Rule 2: If ""dax"" appears after another noun without any color word (e.g., dax bluf), ""dax"" represents the color of the last mentioned object.
Example: Input: dax bluf  => Output: green green
Explanation: ""dax"" is after ""bluf"", so ""dax"" represents the color of ""bluf"", which is green.

Rule 3: If ""dax"" appears after a color word and before another noun (e.g., lug dax zup), ""dax"" represents the color of the next mentioned object.
Example: Input: lug dax zup  => Output: blue green yellow
Explanation: ""dax"" is after ""lug"", so ""dax"" represents the color of the next mentioned object, which is ""zup"" (yellow).

Based on these rules, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" as representing colors mentioned in the sentence.
wif -> color/meaning

Meaning: Based on the given examples, wif seems to represent different colors. The color associated with wif can vary depending on its position within the sequence. The color assigned to wif can be determined by looking at the color of the word preceding it in the sequence. However, for the last word in the sequence, the color assigned to wif appears to be either red or green.

Rule:
- If the word before wif is green, wif is red.
- If the word before wif is blue, wif is yellow.
- In all other cases, wif is green.
zup -> color. The word ""zup"" seems to represent a color in the given examples. The color associated with ""zup"" varies depending on its position in the input. When ""zup"" comes before any other word, it represents the color yellow. When ""zup"" comes after another word, it represents the color green. However, when ""zup"" is in the middle of a sequence of words, it represents the color red.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent different colors in each context. Based on the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: Given the context, the color represented by ""bluf"" depends on the order in which it appears relative to other words. If ""bluf"" appears before another word, it represents the color green. If ""bluf"" appears after another word, it represents the color red. Additionally, ""bluf"" itself seems to represent the color blue.
walm -> color

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to represent a color. Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, it is associated with a specific color in the output. The following associations are observed:

- ""walm"" is associated with the color ""green"".

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: In all cases, the output for the input ""lug"" is the word ""blue"".
dax -> color. Rule: In the given examples, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green.""
wif -> red. 

Rule: wif represents the color red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: zup is mapped to the color yellow in all examples.
bluf -> color

Meaning: The word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to different colors depending on its position in the sentence. Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears as the first word in a sentence, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"". When it appears anywhere else in the sentence, it corresponds to the color ""green"".

Additional analysis:

- When ""bluf"" appears after the first word in the sentence, the color following ""bluf"" is often the same as the color before it. This can be seen in examples 1 and 3.

- The presence of other words before or after ""bluf"" does not seem to influence its meaning. For example, in example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by another word, but it still corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

- In example 4, there are multiple occurrences of ""bluf"". In all cases, it corresponds to the color ""green"".

- Example 5 further supports the rule that the position of ""bluf"" determines its meaning. ""bluf"" is preceded by a color word and followed by another color word, and it corresponds to ""red"" in both cases.

Based on the above analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be position-based, with it indicating ""yellow"" when it is the first word in a sentence and ""green"" when it appears anywhere else.
