Meaning: Lug refers to a color. The color assigned to lug depends on the neighboring words in the input sequence. Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following pattern:

- If lug is preceded and followed by the same word, it represents the color blue.
- If lug is preceded by a word different from the one that follows it, it represents the color red.
- If lug is followed by a word different from the one that precedes it, it represents the color green.
- If lug is not surrounded by any other words, it represents a color that is not specified in the examples.

These rules allow us to find the corresponding color for each instance of lug in the input sequences.
dax -> color (specifically, green)
wif -> color. We can see that in all the examples, the word ""wif"" is followed by colors (e.g., ""red"", ""blue"", ""green"", ""yellow""). Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be related to colors.

wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" seems to be related to color in the given examples. The color associated with ""wif"" is determined by the positions of other words in the sentence. Here is the rule underlying the examples:

Rule: If ""wif"" is followed by another word, the color associated with ""wif"" is determined by the position of the following word in the sentence.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"". Since ""walm"" is the second word in the sentence, ""wif"" is associated with the color green.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"". Since ""lug"" is the first word in the sentence, ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""wif"" appears alone without any following word. In these cases, ""wif"" is associated with the color red.

zup -> yellow. 

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""zup"" is consistently mapped to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> color

Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents different colors based on its position in the input. In the examples provided, the color assigned to ""bluf"" follows the pattern:
- If ""bluf"" is the first word, it represents the color yellow.
- If ""bluf"" is the second word, it represents the color blue.
- If ""bluf"" is the third word, it represents the color green.
- If ""bluf"" is the fourth word, it represents the color red.

Note: The specific colors may vary depending on the context, but the pattern of assignment remains consistent.

Meaning: In all examples, the word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
dax -> color. The meaning of the word ""dax"" in the given examples seems to represent different colors. Based on the examples, we can observe the following rule:

Rule: The position of ""dax"" in the input sentence corresponds to a specific color in the output.

Furthermore, we can see that specific colors are associated with certain positions of ""dax"" in the input. For example:

- When ""dax"" is in the first position, the corresponding output color is always yellow.
- When ""dax"" is in the second position, the corresponding output color is always blue.
- When ""dax"" is in the third position, the corresponding output color is always green.
- When ""dax"" is in the fourth position, the corresponding output color is always red.

Based on these patterns, we can generalize the rule as follows:

Rule: The relative position of ""dax"" within the input sentence determines the specific color in the output.
wif -> color. The meaning of ""wif"" in each example seems to correspond to a color: green, blue, red, yellow. The rule deduced from the examples is as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to a color and the output is determined by the order in which ""wif"" appears in the input.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: ""lug"" always represents the color blue.
dax -> color

Meaning: 
The word ""dax"" in the given examples seems to represent colors. Looking at the outputs, we can see that ""dax"" is associated with different colors such as green, blue, and red. Therefore, we can conclude that ""dax"" represents colors in this context.
wif -> red. 

Meaning: In all the given examples, whenever the word ""wif"" appears, it seems to indicate the color red. Therefore, the rule deduced is that ""wif"" means red.
zup -> yellow
bluf -> color

Rule: 
- When bluf is preceded by ""lug"", it means ""blue"".
- When bluf is preceded by ""wif"", it means ""red"".
- When bluf is preceded by ""zup"", it means ""yellow"".

walm -> color

Rule: The word ""walm"" represents a color. The color represented by ""walm"" can be determined based on its position in the sentence and the colors associated with the surrounding words. 

From the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1) When ""walm"" appears after one or more words, it corresponds to the color red. For example, in ""zup wif walm"", ""walm"" comes after three words and the output is ""red red red red"". Similarly, in ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""walm"" comes after four words and the output is ""red red red red red"".

2) When ""walm"" appears before one or more words, it corresponds to the color green. For example, in ""dax walm lug"", ""walm"" comes before one word and the output is ""green green green blue"". Similarly, in ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""walm"" comes before three words and the output is ""red red green green green"".

3) When ""walm"" appears in between two or more words, it corresponds to the color yellow. For example, in ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"", ""walm"" appears between two words three times, which corresponds to the output ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"".

Based on these patterns, it can be inferred that the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is a color that can be red, green, or yellow, depending on its position in the sentence and the colors associated with the surrounding words.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: lug refers to the color blue.
dax -> color
Since the word ""dax"" appears in multiple sentences paired with different words, it can be deduced that ""dax"" represents a color. The examples show that ""dax"" is associated with the color green in most cases, except in the last example where ""dax"" is used alone, suggesting that it can also stand alone as a representation of the color green. Thus, the rule is: 

dax -> green
wif -> color. The word ""wif"" seems to indicate a color in all of the given examples.
zup -> word indicating color. Rule: If zup is followed by ""wif,"" it corresponds to the color red. If zup is not followed by ""wif,"" it corresponds to the color yellow.
