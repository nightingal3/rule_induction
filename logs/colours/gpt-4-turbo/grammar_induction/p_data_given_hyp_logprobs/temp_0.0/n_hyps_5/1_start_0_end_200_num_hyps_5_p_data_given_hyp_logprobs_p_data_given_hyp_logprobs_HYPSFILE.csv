"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we should look at the patterns of the examples provided. 

Each example consists of a series of inputs and corresponding color outputs. The color green seems to be related to the presence of the word ""dax."" Let's analyze the examples one by one:

1. Input: ""dax bluf zup"" -> Output: ""green green yellow""
2. Input: ""dax walm wif zup"" -> Output: ""green green green red yellow""
3. Input: ""dax"" -> Output: ""green""
4. Input: ""dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""green blue blue blue""
5. Input: ""wif dax wif lug wif"" -> Output: ""red green red blue red""

Looking closely, we can make the following observations:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the first output color is green.
- ""dax"" alone results in ""green"" as the output.
- The presence of other words in the input doesn't affect the green output related to ""dax.""
- When ""dax"" follows another word, such as ""wif,"" it is still associated with a green output.
  
Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that the color green is assigned to ""dax"" regardless of the context in which it is used. None of the other words consistently result in a green output, nor does their presence before ""dax"" change the output associated with ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. 

Thus, dax -> green.",-0.10371651864396104,0,dax
"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax,"" we analyze the patterns in the provided examples. Here's what we notice:

- When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is a single ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears at the beginning of the sequence, the first output is ""green,"" and subsequent words have different colors based on their position or property.
- The word that follows ""dax"" directly influences the color output, such as ""lug"" causing a sequence of ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" before ""dax"" results in a red output for ""wif,"" but ""dax"" still yields a green output.

Given these observations, it appears that ""dax"" correlates consistently with ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. The color output for words following ""dax"" appears to be determined by their position or a specific property of the word itself, rather than ""dax.""

Rule: ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"" in the output sequence.",-1.542371422112987,0,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" correlates with a specific output color, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Whenever ""dax"" is present, the output consistently contains ""green."" 

However, we must note that ""dax"" is always the first word in the input when it produces a single ""green"" in the output. When it is not the first word in the sequence, as in the last example, it still results in a ""green"" in its corresponding position in the output. The position of ""dax"" does not affect its associated color.

Therefore, considering the consistencies across examples, the rule appears to be:

dax -> green

In the case where other nonce words are introduced alongside ""wif,"" such as ""dax"" and ""zup,"" they correspond to their respective colors, which are ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup"".

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" directly correlates to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in an input, the corresponding output includes ""red."" However, there are other words present in some examples (dax and zup) which correlate to other colors (""green"" for dax and ""yellow"" for zup).

Therefore, the meaning can be deduced as follows:

"Based on the given examples, the following rule can be deduced:

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- The presence of the word ""zup"" leads to a repetition of the color word that immediately follows it, up to three times.
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

Now let's confirm this with the inputs and outputs:

1. ""zup wif lug zup walm""
   - The first ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" which means ""red,"" and following our rule, it should be repeated. The output is ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" here does not correspond correctly with the rule.
   
2. ""lug zup lug""
   - ""zup"" is between two ""lug"" (blue). Following our rule, there should be a repetition, and indeed, the output is ""blue yellow blue,"" confirming our rule for this example.
   
3. ""lug bluf zup lug""
   - By the rule, the ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" translating to ""blue."" The output indeed shows a repetition: ""blue blue yellow blue.""
   
4. ""zup bluf""
   - Here ""zup"" is directly followed by ""bluf"" (blue), leading to the expected repetition shown in the output as ""yellow yellow.""
   
5. ""wif walm zup walm""
   - ""walm"" (yellow) is repeated after ""zup,"" and the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" did cause a repetition of ""walm"" (yellow) as per our rule, but there seems to be an additional red.

However, the first example diverges from this rule, which indicates a possible discrepancy. Re-analyzing, it seems that ""zup"" may lead to the next color word repeating, but the number of repetitions and the color that ""zup"" translates to is not clear from the inconsistent first example.

Thus, while the general rule seems to be that ""zup"" causes a repetition of the subsequent color word, the exact meaning of ""zup"" is not consistent with the rule according to the examples provided.

Possible rule considering all examples except the first one: 
Rule: ""zup"" causes the next color word to repeat two extra times, and ""zup"" itself translates to ""yellow.""

However, the first example contradicts this rule, as ""zup"" does not yield ""yellow"" there. We need more consistent data to refine the rule further correctly.",-0.11557576796395062,0,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to a repetition of the color immediately preceding it but with an alteration in the sequence.

Let's analyze the examples:

- In the first example, 'lug zup' translates to 'blue yellow', which suggests the meaning of 'zup' could be dependent on the color that comes before 'zup' (in this case, 'lug' being 'blue'), and 'zup' repeats it once as 'yellow'. 'Walm zup walm' corresponds to 'red red red yellow yellow yellow' with 'zup' causing the preceding 'red' (walm) to be repeated but with a switch to 'yellow'.

- In the second example, 'lug zup lug' becomes 'blue yellow blue', again supporting the idea that 'zup' repeats the preceding color once in the form 'yellow'.

- The third example, 'lug bluf zup lug', translates to 'blue blue yellow blue'. 'Zup' repeats 'blue' as 'yellow'.

- The fourth example, 'zup bluf', translates to 'yellow yellow', but since we established that 'zup' requires a precedent to alter, this suggests that without a preceding color word, 'zup' defaults to 'yellow'.

- In the fifth example, 'wif walm zup walm' is 'red red red yellow yellow yellow'. Similar to previous instances, 'zup' turns 'walm' into three times yellow'. 

Based on these observations, the rule for 'zup' could be: zup repeats the color of the word before it, but changes it to 'yellow', and the number of 'yellows' corresponds to the number of times the color before 'zup' is repeated. If there is no color word before 'zup', then 'zup' defaults to 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> Repeats the preceding color, changing it to ""yellow"". If there's no preceding color, defaults to ""yellow"".",-0.4067418776177778,0,zup
"Based on the patterns observed in the input-output pairs, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

- In every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, a repetition of the color that comes after ""zup"" in the output corresponds to the next color mentioned. For example:
  - ""zup wif lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" is yellow. After ""zup"", ""walm"" (yellow) is mentioned, and ""yellow"" is repeated 3 times in the output.
  - ""lug zup lug"" outputs ""blue yellow blue"", with ""lug"" meaning blue, and the appearance of ""zup"" leading to an additional ""yellow"" in between the two blues.
  - ""lug bluf zup lug"" yields ""blue blue yellow blue"", where ""bluf"" hasn't been defined in the output, but we can infer that it might be blue as well, with ""zup"" introducing a ""yellow"" before the next ""lug"" (blue).

Rule: ""zup"" indicates that the color word that follows ""zup"" should be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore, we can describe ""zup"" as a rule to triplicate the subsequent color:

"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to a repeated color in the sequence. Looking at the patterns:

- Wherever ""zup"" appears, it is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned.
- When ""zup"" appears first, ""yellow"" is repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> a repetition of the last color mentioned before ""zup""; if ""zup"" is the first word, it results in ""yellow"" repeated.",-1.581278038445185,0,zup

2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and following ""wif"" with ""walm"" results in repeating ""red."" ""Lug"" at the end changes it to ""blue.""

5. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
   ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug,"" which changes the color to ""blue."" ""Walm"" after ""lug"" results in repeating ""blue.""

From the patterns observed, it seems that ""walm"" acts as a repeater for the color designated by the word that immediately precedes it, persisting until a new color-inducing word appears. When ""walm"" follows a word that corresponds to a color, it means continue to output that color until a different word dictates a change.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must analyse the patterns from the examples provided:

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
- Here, ""walm"" follows the word ""dax"" and precedes the word ""wif,"" which produces three greens before it and three reds after it. It acts as a transition point, causing a change in the color pattern.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""lug,"" which seems to produce three reds after ""wif"" and then a blue after ""walm.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Only ""zup"" and ""walm"" are present here, and the output is three yellows, which suggests ""walm"" by itself after ""zup"" continues the color pattern initiated by ""zup.""

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- In this example, the presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to yellows, and then the colors alter with the introduction of new words, implying ""walm"" continues the prior pattern only when immediately following ""zup.""

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
- Here, ""walm"" does not continue the pattern initiated by ""zup"" as ""lug"" intervenes, resulting in blues instead.

Considering the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" often affects the sequence of colors produced by repeating or continuing the pattern of the word just before it, except when the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which seems to initiate a consistent red pattern. However, its influence can be overridden if a new word is introduced after it, suggesting its effect may be context-dependent.

Rule: walm -> meaning: When following ""zup,"" ""walm"" repeats the preceding color pattern (yellow). When following ""wif,"" ""walm"" produces a pattern of red. When placed between unique word pairs, ""walm"" may introduce or continue a color pattern, but its influence ceases with the introduction of a subsequent new word.

1. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red

3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
5. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue

Let's first analyze the consistent patterns:

- Every time ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color green is output thrice, followed by three reds, indicating that ""walm"" may be related to the repetition of a color set off by ""dax"".
- Every time ""walm"" follows ""zup"", we see the color yellow repeated thrice, indicating that ""walm"" may represent a repetition of a color set off by ""zup"".
- When ""walm"" follows another word, like ""wif"" or ""lug"", the immediately preceding color is repeated. (""wif"" yields a single red before ""walm"" makes it triple; ""lug"" yields a single blue before ""walm"" makes it triple.)

Given these observations, the word ""walm"" likely indicates the repetition of colors three times connected to the immediately preceding context or word. The rule can be summed up as ""repeat the previously mentioned color two more times.""

- ""wif"" corresponds to red, and then ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated.

2. ""zup wif walm lug""
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" repeats red before ""lug"" changes the color to blue.

bluf -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""bluf"".",-0.0968092396403855,1,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs.

From the examples, we observe that ""bluf"" is followed by a word in the output, often repeated:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red
3. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
5. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red

We notice that the word after ""bluf"" in the output matches the color associated with the word preceding ""bluf"" in the input:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"" where ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red"" where ""wif"" maps to ""red.""

However, in examples where ""bluf"" is at the end of the input string without a word immediately following, the output color is repeated, which seems to be the color that maps to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" In examples 3 and 4, ""bluf"" results in a double instance of the color corresponding to the word just before it: ""wif"" -> ""red"" and ""dax"" -> ""green."" 

The same pattern is observed in example five, where ""bluf"" at the end of the input results in the color ""red"" associated with the word ""wif"" being repeated.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears after a word in the input string, it causes the output to be the color associated with the word preceding ""bluf,"" repeated twice.

So,

bluf -> when following a word, duplicates the color output associated with the word that precedes ""bluf"".",-0.13722448186414457,1,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to result in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it. According to the pattern, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Every time ""bluf"" follows one of these words, the color word is doubled. Hence the rule seems to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color word that comes before ""bluf""

Promulgating this rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, it causes the output to consist of the color corresponding to the word preceding it repeated twice.",-0.7292779619344579,1,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to cause the output to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color mentioned in the input.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word in the output.",-1.2471361419332532,1,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding bluf.,-1.3390850495493982,1,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" we can look for patterns in the examples and how the occurrence of ""walm"" in the input affects the output. 

In all examples, the appearance of ""walm"" leads to a sequence of ""red"" in the output, with the number of ""red"" directly following a ""walm"" increasing by one with each additional occurrence of ""walm"" within the same input.

- Example 1 (""wif lug dax walm"") results in ""red blue green green green."" There is only one ""walm"" and it correlates with three ""green"" in the output. This example by itself does not seem to fit with the rest, possibly indicating that the output may be erroneous or that there is additional context we are missing.
  
- Example 2 (""dax lug walm zup wif"") results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" The single occurrence of ""walm"" here gives us two ""blue"".

- Example 3 (""wif walm zup walm"") results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Here we see two instances of ""walm"" and each one leads to an additional ""red"" in the sequence.

- Example 4 (""dax wif walm"") results in ""green red red red."" A single ""walm"" correlates with two subsequent ""red"".

- Example 5 (""lug wif walm"") results in ""blue red red red."" Again, a single ""walm"" is followed by two ""red"".

Given the inconsistency with example 1, but a consistent pattern in examples 2-5, it is reasonable to conclude that ""walm"" causes the subsequent word to be repeated at least once. The first example may simply not follow the same rule or it could be an error or exception.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the color word that immediately follows it in the output is repeated depending on the number of times ""walm"" has appeared in the sequence, increasing by one each time it is seen.

walm -> the following color word in the output is repeated, with the number of repetitions increasing with each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input sequence.",-0.09373865638179779,1,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the instances of ""walm"" in the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

From this example, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the word ""green"" being repeated three times.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Here, we see that after ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times, indicating that ""walm"" may cause the color of the previous word to be repeated three times.

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

Again, ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color from the previous word three times.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Here, ""walm"" repeats the color ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif,"" three times.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Once more, ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word ""wif"" three times.

From these examples, the pattern is that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated three times. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.12554903209694376,1,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first look at the commonalities between the inputs containing ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs:

- Input: wif lug dax walm
  Output: red blue green green green
  In this example, once ""walm"" appears, everything that follows turns green.

- Input: dax lug walm zup wif
  Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
  Again, once ""walm"" appears, the next colors are all blue until the next word that is not ""walm,"" after which it's yellow red corresponding to ""zup wif.""

- Input: wif walm zup walm
  Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
  The ""walm"" after ""wif"" turns the following colors to red, and after ""zup,"" ""walm"" turns the following colors to yellow.

- Input: dax wif walm
  Output: green red red red
  The appearance of ""walm"" after ""wif"" changes the following color to red and maintains it.

- Input: lug wif walm
  Output: blue red red red
  Just like in the previous example, after ""wif"" ""walm"" changes the subsequent color to red.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" affects the color outputted after its appearance, causing it to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" However, we need to observe more patterns to figure out the rule for different previous words as we have limited examples.

Based on the data provided, the color change applies to multiple outputs until another color word (non-""walm"") appears to change the pattern. We see this in the second example where ""walm"" is followed by ""zup wif,"" which then outputs yellow red.

Given the current data, the rule appears to be this:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the output color to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" for the following outputs until a new color word appears.",-0.15939222257692134,1,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's look at the examples provided where ""walm"" appears, and the corresponding color sequences that result. 

- In the first example, ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green."" Since ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green"" respectively, the appearance of ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color ""green"" two additional times.

- The second example, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" translates to ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" Again, ""dax"" and ""lug"" correlate to ""green"" and ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""walm"" here is followed by ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" corresponds to repeating ""blue,"" the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, and then continues with the sequence as normal.

- The third example, ""wif walm zup walm,"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" ""Wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Each occurrence of ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the previous word, ""red"" for the first ""walm"" and ""yellow"" for the second ""walm.""

- The fourth example, ""dax wif walm,"" gives us ""green red red red."" ""Dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" with ""walm"" causing ""red"" to repeat two additional times.

- Lastly, ""lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""blue red red red."" ""Lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" with ""walm"" again causing ""red"" to repeat two additional times.

Given these examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it two additional times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word two additional times.",-0.1653506006265618,1,walm
"Rule: walm -> a repeated color that is not initially stated, with the number of repetitions corresponding to the number of times walm is mentioned after the first instance.
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which equals green, and ""walm"" then is repeated twice, resulting in ""green green green.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which equals blue, so ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue,"" but there the previous color is green so the final output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which equals red, hence ""walm walm"" is ""red red yellow,"" but considering the previous color, it becomes ""red yellow yellow.""
- The fourth and fifth examples further support this rule by showing that ""walm"" equals ""red"" repeated three times after ""wif"" or ""dax,"" and after ""lug,"" ""walm"" remains as ""red"" repeated three times.

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look at the patterns presented in the examples and the resulting outputs.

In the first example, the presence of ""bluf"" results in ""blue red red"" at the end of the output:
Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output is ""red red yellow"":
Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow

In the third example, ""lug"" repeats twice, and after ""bluf,"" we see the pattern ""blue blue"" in the output:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is in the second position and results in ""yellow red"" in the output:
Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""blue red"":
Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:
- ""bluf"" results in ""blue"" followed by ""red"" and then one or more repetitions of the color corresponding to the word immediately following ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is the last word or not followed by a recognized color word (such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""dax""), then the pattern is simply ""blue red.""

Therefore, based on the examples given, the rule for ""bluf"" can be written as:
Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" followed by ""red"" and the color indicated by the word that comes after ""bluf"" (if applicable). If no color-indicating word follows ""bluf,"" ""blue red"" is the final pattern.",-0.06915800413929292,2,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the correlation between the inputs and their corresponding outputs in each example.

1. In the first example, we see ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" which translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Noticing that ""zup"" is consistently correlated with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red,"" we can infer a pattern that each word corresponds to a specific color. However, the presence of ""bluf"" yields both ""blue"" and ""red"" in sequence.

2. In the second example, the sequence ""zup wif bluf zup"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" yields ""red red"" just like in the first example.

3. The third example ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Once again, the presence of ""bluf"" follows with ""red"" immediately added, followed by the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""bluf,"" which is ""blue"" in this case.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" becomes ""yellow yellow red green red yellow."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" once again corresponds to ""red,"" followed immediately by the color related to the word that comes after ""bluf,"" which in this case is ""green.""

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup lug bluf wif"" is translated as ""yellow blue blue red."" Following our established pattern, after ""bluf"" we get ""red,"" followed by the color associated with the word following ""bluf,"" which is ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to create a sequence that includes ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to the next word in the input list.

Rule: bluf -> red followed by the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence. If there is no word after ""bluf,"" only the color ""red"" is added to the output.",-0.08953816857237373,2,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns of the given input and their corresponding output. The challenge is to understand how each input word translates to the output color.

By examining the outputs, it becomes evident that each output consists of color names. Let's break down the patterns linking the inputs to the outputs:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""
- ""walm"" seems to be the same as ""lug,"" also translating to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" seems to translate to ""green.""

Now, let's focus on ""bluf."" 

Looking at the context in which ""bluf"" appears:
1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by no other word. The output ends with two reds. However, since ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red,"" the next color ""red"" must be from ""bluf.""
2. In the second example, two occurrences of ""red"" follow ""bluf."" No other word is between ""bluf"" and the last ""red.""
3. The third example is the most telling because ""bluf"" produces two colors: a ""red"" followed by a ""blue."" 
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" only corresponds to one color, ""red.""
5. In the final example, ""bluf"" also results in two colors: ""blue"" and ""red,"" just like in the third example.

From these observations, we notice that ""bluf"" is often associated with the color ""red,"" but in certain contexts (after ""lug"" or ""walm""), it is followed by ""blue.""

Given the patterns, the most plausible rule linking ""bluf"" to the output seems to be that ""bluf"" by default translates to ""red."" Additionally, if ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""walm"" (both of which translate to ""blue""), it translates to ""blue"" and then ""red."" 

Thus, the rule could be stated as:
bluf -> ""red"" by default, but ""blue"" followed by ""red"" if it follows ""lug"" or ""walm.""

Rule: 
When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" or ""walm,"" output is ""blue red""; otherwise, the output is ""red.""",-0.9455687696986866,2,bluf
"Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" followed by the additional color associated with the preceding word.

Explanation:

1. In the first example, bluf follows wif, which translates to red. Thus, bluf results in ""red red.""

2. In the second example, bluf follows wif again, resulting in ""red red.""

3. In the third example, bluf comes after lub, which translates to blue. Consequently, bluf results in ""red blue.""

4. In the fourth example, bluf follows zup, which is associated with yellow. Thus, bluf renders ""red yellow.""

5. In the fifth example, bluf comes after lug, associated with blue again. Therefore, bluf translates to ""red blue.""

Based on these observations:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.",-1.3793554296272728,2,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can try to determine the meaning of the word ""bluf"" by looking at the patterns in the outputs. Here's the process of deducing the meaning:

- In every example, the word ""bluf"" is present.
- Following ""bluf"" in the output, there is at least one instance of ""red"".
- The word preceding ""bluf"" doesn't directly affect the color following ""bluf"" (as seen by different words preceding ""bluf"" and the color ""red"" consistently following it).
- There doesn't seem to be a direct one-to-one correspondence with ""bluf"" being a single color all the time, as ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red"" in the first example, ""red"" in the second, ""red blue blue"" in the third, ""red green red"" in the fourth, and ""red"" in the fifth.
- However, it can be observed that ""red"" always follows ""bluf"" immediately.

With this observation, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" may indicate that the next word or words will be ""red"" at least once. Given the information, ""bluf"" seems to signal a change to ""red"" and may indicate the start of a sequence of colors, but the total number of colors following ""bluf"" and their sequence seem to depend on the context which is not fully provided.

Rule: bluf -> the next color in the sequence will be red.",-1.667160833978484,2,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the examples given and look for patterns in the corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" correlates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" If ""walm"" meant a color on its own, we would expect a single color in the output; however, there are three ""yellow"" outputs after ""walm,"" indicating that ""walm"" might be affecting the color of the words following it.

2. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" correlates with green, and with ""walm"" following it, the green repeats, suggesting that ""walm"" might be a repeat function.

3. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" correlates with yellow, and again ""walm"" is associated with repeating that color.

4. ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue."" After ""lug,"" which correlates with blue, ""walm"" seems to repeat the blue.

5. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" ""Walm"" after ""zup"" appears to repeat the yellow.

Considering the consistent pattern across the examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat until a different color word appears or the sequence ends.

Input: wif dax lug walm

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Therefore: zup walm dax wif bluf

Second Example:
- dax -> green

Therefore: dax walm
- dax -> green
- walm -> green repeated twice because ""dax"" before it is ""green"" and there's one color before walm, resulting in two more greens

Output: green green green

Third Example:
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue
- lug -> blue

Therefore: zup bluf lug zup walm
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow repeated three times because ""zup"" before it is ""yellow"" and there are three colors before walm (yellow, blue, blue)

Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Fourth Example:
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Therefore: wif dax lug walm
- wif -> red 
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue repeated three times because ""lug"" before it is ""blue"" and there are three colors before walm (red, green, blue)

Output: red green blue blue blue

- In the second example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" supporting the repeat-rule as ""dax"" means ""green.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze its occurrences and the corresponding outputs:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Here ""bluf"" appears twice, and the outputs are ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

2. In the second example, ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow."" The presence of ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""zup bluf dax"" outputs ""yellow yellow green."" Here ""bluf"" is associated with the second ""yellow"" again.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" is associated with the second ""yellow.""

Observing these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" outputs a color based on its position or surrounding context. However, it is not entirely consistent. Alternatively, ""bluf"" could be outputting the color that matches the color word just before its position. To verify this, let's look at the given outputs when ""bluf"" appears:

- In the first example, before the first ""bluf,"" there is ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" but the output is ""green."" Before the second ""bluf,"" there is a ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" but the output is ""blue.""

- In the second example, before ""bluf,"" there is ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow.""

- In the third example, before ""bluf,"" there is also ""zup"" with the output ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, there's only ""zup"" before ""bluf,"" and it also translates to ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, before ""bluf"" there is ""zup,"" which correlates with ""yellow,"" and the output is again ""yellow.""

Given the inconsistency in the first example and the consistent matching of ""zup"" before ""bluf"" in other instances, it's challenging to determine an absolute rule for ""bluf"" without additional context.

However, based on the examples provided, the most consistent observation is that ""bluf"" follows the color of the word just before it, except when it follows ""dax."" It appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color ""yellow"" directly after ""zup."" Unfortunately, there is not enough information to understand why ""bluf"" results in ""green"" and ""blue"" in the first example, apart from the possibility that the context with ""wif"" and ""dax"" before ""bluf"" triggers different colors.

Given these observations, a tentative rule could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs the color word that directly precedes it, with a possible exception or different rule when following ""wif"" and ""dax.""

Since the rule is not conclusive, additional data would be helpful for a more accurate determination of the meaning of ""bluf.""",-0.15959523185424995,3,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow."" However, there's an inconsistency that needs to be addressed. In the first example, ""bluf"" is translated to ""green,"" while in all other examples, it translates to ""yellow."" To reconcile this, let's consider ""bluf"" as a contextual word whose meaning changes depending on its position or surrounding words.

Looking more closely at the examples, we observe a pattern: whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" In all other cases, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow."" This consistency allows us to induce the following rule:

- bluf -> ""yellow"" when it does not follow ""dax""

"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the pattern for the nonce word ""walm."" We'll look at the commonalities in each instance it appears.

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue,"" where the word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup."" We see three greens corresponding to the first two words then a shift in colors.

- In the second example, ""dax walm wif walm"" becomes ""green green green red red red."" Here ""walm"" is following ""dax"" and is both preceded and followed by ""wif."" This results in three greens again followed by reds for the ""wif walm"" sequence.

- In the third example ""lug walm wif lug bluf” transforms to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" The word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and again is followed by ""wif."" This maintains a consistent pattern of three similar colors corresponding to ""lug walm"" and then a shift for ""wif.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"" aligning with the previous pattern of three similarly colored outputs following the initial word.

- The fifth example is ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" which turns into ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Here, we have only two colors following ""dax zup"" before ""walm,"" and then after ""walm wif walm,"" we have three reds.

Putting these observations together, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule:
When ""walm"" follows a word, that word's color is repeated three times. When it follows other colors, it seems to induce a pattern or switch consistent with the word that follows ""walm."" If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" red follows. If it's at the end or not followed by ""wif,"" the original color pattern continues.

Hence, ""walm"" seems to mean a repetition of the previous color three times if it stands next to a color word or a switch in pattern/series if followed by certain other words (like ""wif"").",-0.09772426350985869,3,walm
"walm -> meaning. To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outcomes (Output) in relation to the Input where ""walm"" appears.

In the outputs, the color that appears three times in a row corresponds to the presence of the word ""walm"" in the inputs. When ""walm"" appears, the preceding non-walm word seems to be the one that determines the color that is repeated thrice. For instance:

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" which is then repeated three times following ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif walm"" gives us ""green green green red red red."" The words preceding ""walm"" (""dax"" and ""wif"") correspond to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, and those colors are repeated three times each following ""walm.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to signal a rule where the color corresponding to the immediately preceding non-walm word is repeated three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output color corresponding to that word is repeated three times.",-0.786579530676087,3,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the sequence of colors that follow it. Notably, it generates a sequence where the color repeats three times. Additionally, the subsequent color in the sequence seems to correlate with the word immediately after ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup"" follows ""walm"" resulting in ""green green green yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" follows ""walm"" twice, resulting in a series of six reds after the initial greens.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""wif"" and ""lug"" follow ""walm"" and thereafter we see a sequence of three reds or three blues accordingly.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow,"" while the subsequent ""wif walm"" pair leads to a sequence of reds.

This suggests that:

- ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated three times,
- the color after the repeated sequence depends on the word that follows ""walm.""

From the examples, we can try to assign meanings to the individual color-related words:
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the color correlated with the preceding word three times, and then follow with the color correlated with the word that comes immediately after ""walm"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the relationship between the input and output pairs. Let's line up each of the original input nonce words with their corresponding color outputs:

1. lug walm zup wif          -> blue blue blue yellow red
2. zup bluf wif dax wif zup  -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
3. wif dax wif bluf zup wif  -> red green red red yellow red
4. dax lug wif bluf          -> green blue red red
5. wif walm                  -> red red red

For each input, ""wif"" corresponds to different colors in the output:

- In input 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In input 2, ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" and the second ""red.""
- In input 3, ""wif"" corresponds to every ""red.""
- In input 4, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In input 5, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" represents the color ""red"" in the output. 

Rule: wif -> red",-0.11226187255468417,4,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's first find a pattern in each input-output pair:

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
2. zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
3. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
4. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
5. wif walm -> red red red

Now, let's analyze when ""wif"" occurs in the input and see if the output follows any discernible pattern:

- In example 1, ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, and the output is ""yellow red."" Every other word in the input maps to ""blue.""
- In example 2, there are two instances of ""wif."" After the first ""wif,"" the output is ""green red,"" and after the second ""wif,"" the sequence continues with ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""wif"" occurs three times. Following each ""wif"" instance, the output is always ""red.""
- In example 4, ""wif"" occurs once, and the output is ""red.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" occurs once, but the entire output is ""red,"" suggesting ""walm"" might also be related to the ""red"" output.

From the above points, we can notice that ""wif"" is consistently associated with the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: Thus, the rule seems to be ""wif"" maps to the color ""red."" Therefore:

wif -> red",-0.12146455996558939,4,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" indicates a color pattern that needs to be followed depending on the preceding word. Below, I will break down the possible rule by observing the patterns.

In the first input, ""wif"" is followed by no words, and ""wif"" is the last word. The output is ""yellow red,"" which does not give us much information on its own, and there are no preceding words to consider ""lug walm zup.""

In the second and third examples, ""wif"" is used multiple times amongst other words, and some patterns begin to emerge.

- In the second input, ""wif"" appears twice and is preceded by different words each time (""bluf"" and ""dax""). After the first ""wif,"" the color ""red"" follows, and after the second instance, it precedes another ""wif"" and the color ""red"" appears again.

- In the third input, ""wif"" appears three times and is preceded by ""dax"" and ""bluf"" (just as in the second example). The pattern of ""green red"" repeats after ""wif dax,"" and ""red"" repeats after ""wif bluf,"" which seems to be consistent with the second example. After the final ""wif,"" the color ""red"" follows just like in the first input, possibly because it is the last term.

In the fourth example, ""wif"" is only used once and is preceded by ""lug"" and ""dax,"" which would correspond to the colors ""blue"" and ""green,"" based on other instances. ""Wif"" then results in ""red,"" but without any word to follow, the rule is partly upheld by the ""red"" following ""wif.""

In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and based on previous patterns, ""walm"" tends to correspond with the color ""blue,"" shown by its solo appearance in the first example. The output of three ""red"" colors seems to break the pattern unless ""wif"" somehow means multiple repetitions of the color that would correspond to the word following it (in this case, ""red"" for ""blue"").

Based on these observations, it seems that ""wif"" might indicate the next color in the sequence should be ""red,"" but without more data, it's difficult to discern whether there's an additional rule that dictates when or how this applies, especially in the fifth example.

Rule: wif -> The next color in the sequence should be ""red."" Exceptions or additional rules may apply in certain contexts or when ""wif"" is followed by specific words or is the last word in the sequence.",-0.929169401152316,4,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look at the examples and see when ""wif"" appears and what the output is in those cases.

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears once and corresponds to the color ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears twice. The first ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and the second corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears three times. The sequence is ""red,"" ""green,"" and then ""red"" again.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears once and corresponds to the color ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears once and corresponds to the color ""red.""

It seems that every time ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is part of the output. However, there's also a ""green"" output that corresponds to ""wif"" in the second and third examples. Since ""green"" is not consistently associated with ""wif"" in the way that ""red"" is, we need to consider that ""wif"" could potentially be affecting surrounding words, or its output could depend on its position in the sequence.

Comparing all the examples, we can see that ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" when it is at the beginning of the sequence or following another ""wif."" When it occurs after ""dax"" specifically, it seems to result in the color ""green."" We only have two instances of this pattern, but if we treat this as a significant pattern, we can induce that the color ""green"" is not directly caused by ""wif,"" but rather by the combination of ""dax"" followed by ""wif.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

There is no instance where ""wif"" results in any color other than red in the output. This consistency across different sequences suggests ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red"".

Based on the above observations, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-0.17477207382891558,4,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can derive the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" The word ""walm"" is likely related to the repetition of the color ""yellow"" in the output. For each instance of ""walm,"" there seems to be a repetition of the word ""yellow.""

To corroborate this observation:

- When ""zup walm"" is the input, ""yellow yellow yellow"" is the output. This suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" is responsible for the repeated ""yellow.""
- This pattern repeats in the first three examples. In the second example, ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" the portion ""zup walm"" still translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and the other two words ""wif"" and ""dax"" correspond to the new colors ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""lug"" is introduced, and it seems to correspond to the color ""blue,"" as ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to find a consistent pattern from the given examples. Let's look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify the pattern.

1. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   
2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   
3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   
4. Input: zup dax wif zup
   Output: yellow green red yellow
   
5. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red

From examples 1 and 3, we can see that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red."" However, in example 2, ""wif"" appears towards the end of the input, yet ""red"" precedes the last word's output ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" is not just the word ""red"" but could potentially impact the positioning of colors in the output.

In examples 4 and 5, both contain the sequence ""zup dax wif"" which consistently translates to ""yellow green red."" This confirms our initial observation that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Additionally, there does not seem to be an impact on the word that follows ""wif,"" as seen in example 4 where ""zup"" following ""wif"" remains ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, we conclude that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red,"" and there is no evidence in the given examples of ""wif"" having additional contextual dependency.

"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""wif"" seems quite consistent:

- In every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is part of the corresponding output.

This consistency suggests that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red."" Additional context from the examples helps figure out the meanings of the other words:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" every time it appears.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" whenever it appears.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

- Moreover, 'wif' doesn't depend on the words around it to be translated to 'red'.
- Other words like 'zup' and 'dax' consistently translate to 'yellow' and 'green', respectively, indicating that 'wif' is consistently translated as well.
- There are no examples provided that contradict the hypothesis that 'wif' translates to 'red'.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the color ""red"". However, the number of repetitions of the color in the output seems influenced by the position of ""bluf"" in the input in conjunction with the words around it. Specifically, ""bluf"" produces a number of ""red""s equal to the total count of words following it.

Let's analyze each example following this observation:

1. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   ""Bluf"" is followed by no words, hence there are no reds following.

2. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   Repeat of the first example; same rule applies.

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   ""Bluf"" is followed by 2 words (""wif"" and ""zup""), thus there are 2 reds after ""green"".

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   ""Bluf"" is followed by 3 words (""dax"", ""walm"", and another occurrence of ""walm""), therefore there are 3 reds after the first red.

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   ""Bluf"" is followed by 3 words (""wif"", ""walm"", and another occurrence of ""walm""), hence there are 3 reds after the first two colors.

By these observations, we can formulate the general rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" repeated as many times as there are words following it in the input sequence.",-0.09327273121033708,5,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare input and output instances.

In each instance, the output is a series of colors, and ""bluf"" appears in each input.

In the first two examples:
- Input: lug wif bluf
- Output: blue red red

""bluf"" is the third word in the input and is associated with the third color in the output, which is red. Notice that both instances are the same, suggesting consistency in the color assignment.

In the third example:
- Input: dax bluf wif zup
- Output: green green red yellow

""bluf"" is the second word and corresponds to the second color in the output, which is green.

However, in the fourth example:
- Input: wif bluf dax walm
- Output: red red green green green

""bluf"" is the second word again but this time corresponds to red in the output, which aligns with the first two examples and contradicts the third example where it corresponded to green.

In the fifth example:
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
- Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

""bluf"" is the fourth word and corresponds to the first occurrence of the color yellow in the output. This introduces a new color correspondence that we haven't seen before.

Given the inconsistency when ""bluf"" takes various positions in the sentence, we might infer that the meaning of ""bluf"" is not dependent on its position within the sequence. It also isn't consistent with a single color output.

Nevertheless, every time ""bluf"" occurs, it is followed by ""red"" in the output sequence. Let's validate this with the examples:

1. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
2. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
3. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
4. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

In all cases, irrespective of the position of ""bluf"" in the input or the numbers or types of colors in the output, ""bluf"" is always followed by at least one ""red"" in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> is always followed by the color red in the output sequence.",-0.10185668286978651,5,bluf
"By analyzing the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red""
2. ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow""
3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green""
4. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red""

In examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" is translated to ""red red"". In example 2, ""bluf"" is translated as ""green"". In example 4, ""bluf"" seems to be responsible for the presence of two ""yellow"" outputs, as other examples don't contain ""yellow"" when ""bluf"" is not present. It might be not precise since ""zup"" could also potentially influence this output. However, ""zup"" is followed by a different color in example 2 (""green red yellow""), so the ""bluf"" presents between two ""yellow"" outputs seems to be the best clue.

Looking for a cohesive rule that explains these observations, it appears ""bluf"" represents the duplication of the color word that follows it in each sequence. 

Thus, the rule seems to be the following:
bluf -> causes the next color word to be duplicated.",-0.2114850128702247,5,bluf
"To decode the rule for ""bluf,"" let's analyze the outputs for patterns:

- In the first and second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to two instances of ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to a single instance of ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to a double instance of ""red"" again.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to a double instance of ""red"" once more.

Based on this information, one might initially think that ""bluf"" translates directly to ""red red"" due to its consistent double output of ""red"" in the examples provided. However, the third example contradicts this rule since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, ""bluf"" does not directly translate to ""red red.""

An observation that might lead to a rule is that ""bluf"" could correspond to the color mentioned right before it, duplicated in the output (except in the case of the third example, as noted previously).

However, given the results of the third example, we cannot establish a definitive rule based on duplication. It is also possible that ""bluf"" has a context-sensitive meaning which cannot be determined by these examples alone, or that the third example is an error or exception to the rule.

With only these data points and the conflicting evidence of the third example, we can't induce a consistent and definitive rule for the meaning of ""bluf.""

"Based on the provided examples, walm seems to lead to the output of three reds in a row, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Let's analyze the input and output sequences:

   Output: yellow red red red blue

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

5. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

In each case, the occurrence of ""walm"" correlates with the appearance of three consecutive red outputs, suggesting that ""walm"" translates to a rule causing this pattern.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the output will include three consecutive ""red"" regardless of other input words or their order.",-0.0726037668366667,5,walm
"Based on the given examples, it's clear that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" dictates the color ""red.""

The output pattern does not seem to be affected by the relative position of ""walm"" within the input sequence; ""walm"" always yields the output ""red"" regardless of where it appears in the sequence.

However, we should also look for a pattern associated with the nonce word in relation to the other words to establish if there's a more complex rule at play.

Here's what we can see:

1. ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" We'll need to see other examples to confirm these patterns.
   
2. ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red."" Again, ""wif"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""red.""

3. ""zup wif walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red red red blue."" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" and ""walm"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" This example seems to support the assumption that ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow."" This keeps consistency: ""wif"" and ""walm"" as ""red,"" ""dax"" as ""green,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

5. ""dax walm wif zup"" outputs ""green green green red yellow."" This example seems to suggest that ""dax"" typically corresponds to ""green."" However, since we have ""dax"" at the beginning and ""walm"" following, and both outputting ""green,"" the rule might be influenced by the position or interaction between ""dax"" and ""walm."" But the following ""wif"" after ""walm"" outputs ""red,"" staying consistent with the other examples.

From these examples, the clearest pattern points to ""walm"" invariably corresponding to ""red.""

Rule: walm -> red",-0.09253496115529758,5,walm
"From the examples provided, we can infer that the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input leads to the word ""red"" in the output. Furthermore, the position of ""walm"" within the input does not seem to alter the color it corresponds to in the output. For example, regardless of whether ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" or before it, the output is ""red"" following the same sequence of colors that appear before ""walm"" in the input.

Let's look at the evidence:

- Input: ""wif walm dax"" -> Output: ""red red red green""
- Input: ""wif walm"" -> Output: ""red red red""
- Input: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
- Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: ""red red red green yellow""
- Input: ""dax walm wif zup"" -> Output: ""green green green red yellow""

In all instances, we see ""walm"" translates to ""red"" in the output sequence. It's important to note that the color that follows ""red"" in the output is consistent with the word that follows ""walm"" in the input (e.g., ""dax"" -> ""green"", ""zup"" -> ""yellow"").

- ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red,"" so when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (or ""wif"" precedes ""bluf""), the output is ""red.""

When ""bluf"" follows two words, it takes the color of the immediate word before it; when ""bluf"" stands alone with ""wif,"" it duplicates the color of ""wif."" Consequently, the rule could be defined as:

Rule: bluf duplicates the color of the word that directly precedes it.

So we can write the rule as:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to duplicate the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf.""",-0.7128756155488889,6,bluf
"Based on the provided input-output pairs, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green when it follows the word ""dax"" and to the color red when ""wif"" follows it. When there is no other context, ""bluf"" defaults to the color red as shown in the example where ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red.""

However, there is a pattern here that suggests that ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word that immediately precedes it (except when ""wif"" follows ""bluf"", which specifically results in red):

- In the first three examples, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in green, mimicking ""dax."" 
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf lug wif,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and therefore results in green, and then it is followed by ""lug,"" which precedes ""wif,"" resulting in blue. 

To summarize:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it, with the exception that ""wif"" following ""bluf"" specifically results in red.

Thus:

bluf -> meaning:
When preceded by ""dax"" and no ""wif"" follows, means green.
When followed directly by ""wif,"" means red. 
If the preceding words do not provide context for a specific color, bluf defaults to red.",-0.9141843802672225,6,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each example and see what changes when ""bluf"" is present:

- In the first three examples, when ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is green.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" but is before ""lug,"" and its output is still green.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" comes directly after ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is red, the same as for ""wif.""

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes immediately before it. Therefore, the rule would be:

bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows another word, the output color for ""bluf"" will be the same as the output color for the word that precedes it.",-1.084261661276389,6,bluf
bluf -> the color of the preceding word. Rule: Bluf takes on the color representation of the word that comes immediately before it in the list.,-1.6087312737777772,6,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the presence of the word in each input and the corresponding output colors.

- When ""walm"" is present, the output is a sequence of three colors.
- The specific color in the output corresponds to the word preceding ""walm.""

Here's what we can infer from each example:

1. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green: ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by three ""yellows,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow: ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" which is followed by three ""blues,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow: Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and then ""wif."" Each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by three colors corresponding to the word before it: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by three ""greens,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by three ""reds.""

4. lug walm -> blue blue blue: ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is three ""blues.""

5. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow: ""Walm"" follows both ""wif"" and ""zup,"" with the output being three ""reds"" and three ""yellows"" respectively.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the output to be three repetitions of the color associated with the word that comes right before ""walm.""",-0.07943059963652745,6,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we first analyze its occurrence and the corresponding color in each output:

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
Here, ""walm"" is associated with the color yellow.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
Here, ""walm"" is associated with the color blue.

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
Here, ""walm"" appears twice and is associated with green the first time and red the second time.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Here, ""walm"" is again associated with the color blue.

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
In this case, ""walm"" is associated first with red and then with yellow.

From these examples, we notice that the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If ""walm"" is the second word, then it takes the color of the first word thrice. If ""walm"" appears again within the same input, it seems to take the color of the word immediately before its second occurrence thrice.

Rule: walm -> meaning: The meaning of ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the immediately preceding word three times. If ""walm"" appears again within the same input, it will again repeat three times the color of the word immediately preceding its new occurrence.",-0.0913710769486264,6,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine the outputs corresponding to the inputs that contain the word. By comparing the outputs to the inputs, we can try to isolate the effect of ""walm"" on the output.

Looking at the examples:

1. ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Here, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""dax"".

2. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"".

3. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green red red red yellow."" Here, ""walm"" appears twice, once after ""dax"" and once after ""wif"".

4. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"".

5. ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and after ""zup"".

In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the color associated with the preceding word is then repeated three times in the output. ""Zup"" is associated with yellow, ""dax"" with green, ""lug"" with blue, and ""wif"" with red. Where ""walm"" follows these words, it repeats their colors three times. Also, ""walm"" does not seem to have its own color, but rather, it causes a repetition of the color indicated by the previous word.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" could be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it repeats the output color associated with the preceding word three times. If ""walm"" appears twice in succession, it repeats the output color for the previous word three times for each instance of ""walm"".

Therefore:

walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.",-0.10311508402032965,6,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" dictates a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Below are the observations from each example:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green"". Here, ""yellow"" is repeated three times before a different color, ""green"".
- In the second example, when ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output shows ""green"" repeated three times.
- The fourth example again shows ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" with ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- The last example shows ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" and the output has ""red"" repeated three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times in the output. Based on this rule:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times in the output.",-0.8352126029604399,6,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" has no fixed color association. Instead, the color that follows ""walm"" depends on the word that precedes it in the sequence. Here's the observed pattern:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is yellow.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is green.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is blue.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is red.

The consistent rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word right before it and repeats it three times. Thus, the rule can be described as follows:

2. Input: dax

   Explanation: This is a repetition of the first example, reinforcing that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"".

3. Input: dax lug dax
   Output: green blue green
   Explanation: The word ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to ""green"" both times. The word ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue"". Since ""dax"" still maps to ""green"", the rule seems consistent.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once again. The word ""wif"" appears twice and maps to ""red"" each time. ""lug"" still maps to ""blue"". The word ""walm"" appears twice, and it corresponds to ""red"" the first time and ""blue"" the second time. ""zup"" appears once and maps to ""yellow"". We cannot derive a consistent rule for ""walm"" based on this information alone since it maps to two colors.

5. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   Explanation: ""dax"" once again corresponds to ""green"". The new word ""bluf"" is presented with the output ""green"", suggesting ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"". ""wif"" retains its mapping to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Based on these examples, we can induce the following rules:

- The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"",

- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"", and
- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must compare the outputs for each input and identify the relation between the word ""walm"" and the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze the given examples:

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" alone generates a single ""red,"" but when followed by ""walm,"" it results in two additional ""red."" It seems ""walm"" has repeated the color associated with the preceding word.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The ""green"" appears three times after ""walm,"" which follows ""dax."" The extra ""green"" could be because of ""walm."" ""Wif"" at the end goes back to a single ""red,"" which suggests ""walm"" affects only the word immediately before it.

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
- ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and results in triple ""green,"" and then the pattern continues normally with ""zup"" yielding ""yellow"" and ""lug"" resulting in ""blue."" This supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word right before it.

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- The sequence has ""dax"" twice, with ""walm"" after the second ""dax."" Again, the output is triple ""green"" following that ""dax,"" suggesting ""walm"" continues to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- The word ""wif"" generates ""red,"" and the sequence continues with different colors for the other words until ""zup walm,"" after which ""yellow"" is repeated three times. This is consistent with the idea that ""walm"" is repeating the color produced by the word just before it.

Based on the consistent pattern across all examples, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" two additional times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color output produced by that word is repeated twice more, resulting in a total of three consecutive instances of that color in the output.",-0.07659306797005322,7,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's look at the patterns in each example:

- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"". The repetition of ""red"" implies a pattern of repetition for ""walm"".
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow green green green blue red"". The pattern before ""walm"" shows an incremental change from yellow to green, and after it transitions to a new sequence (blue, red). ""walm"" seems to extend the green.
- ""dax walm zup lug"" gives ""green green green yellow blue"". Here ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats that green.
- ""dax zup dax walm"" provides ""green yellow green green green"". Both ""dax"" and ""walm"" result in green, with ""walm"" extending the sequence from a prior ""dax"".
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". In this case ""walm"" extends the last color before it which is ""yellow"".

Based on these examples, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the directly preceding word (not considering ""walm"" itself), extending the sequence of that color.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the directly preceding word.",-0.0955014639192553,7,walm
"To deduce the meaning or the rule behind the word ""walm,"" let's compare the input and corresponding outputs:

1. wif walm -> red red red
2. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
3. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
4. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
5. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

By examining the inputs and outputs, we can identify the following patterns for words other than ""walm"":

- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow""
- ""dax"" consistently results in ""green""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue""

Now, notice that every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output color that follows is ""green."" However, ""green"" is also the output for ""dax."" Therefore, ""walm"" may simply repeat the color output of the preceding word. 

To validate this rule, let's check each example where ""walm"" follows another word:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red."" The outputs following ""walm"" are all ""red,"" confirming the repetition of the ""wif"" color.
2. In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green."" The output following ""walm"" is also ""green,"" repeating the ""dax"" color.
3. In the third example, ""dax"" also precedes ""walm,"" and the output following ""walm"" is ""green,"" once again repeating.
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" with the output following ""walm"" also being ""green,"" continuing to repeat the ""dax"" color.
5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and the outputs following ""walm"" are ""yellow,"" repeating the color of ""zup.""

These observations lead to the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color output should repeat the color output of the word that immediately precedes it.

Based on this rule, we can articulate the meaning of ""walm"":

walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color output of the preceding word.",-0.10452189712293614,7,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will correlate the outputs with the respective inputs where the term appears.

1. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
2. Input: zup dax walm lug wif | Output: yellow green green green blue red
3. Input: dax walm zup lug | Output: green green green yellow blue
4. Input: dax zup dax walm | Output: green yellow green green green
5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm | Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

From examining the examples, we notice the following patterns:

- In examples 1 and 4, ""walm"" appears after a single color name is repeated three times.
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows after ""dax,"" and the sequence ""green green"" appears twice, followed by the color ""red.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" is at the end, and we have three ""yellow"" repeats at the end.

Based on these observations, we can rule out that ""walm"" corresponds directly to a static color because its presence results in repeated color names in the output, but not always the same color. Instead, ""walm"" seems to induce a pattern related to repetition of the previously mentioned color in some form.

Now, let's specifically look at the last colors before ""walm"" and the resulting sequence:

- In example 1, there's no color before ""walm,"" yet the output is ""red red red.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" and the output is ""green,"" repeated two times, and followed by ""red.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- In example 4, ""dax"" is the last word before ""walm"" twice, and the output is the color ""green"" repeated four times.
- In example 5, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output sequence ends with ""yellow"" repeated three times.

If we take into consideration the number of times the color is repeated, we can propose the following rule:

When ""walm"" follows a color-word pair, it induces a repetition of the corresponding output color. The number of repetitions seems to correlate with the number of times the preceding color word appears before ""walm.""

Testing our proposed rule with the available examples:

- Example 1 does not provide a preceding color word; thus, we might assume ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and it's repeated three times.
- Example 2: ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" once, leading to a double repetition of ""green"" and then ""red,"" which is--as per ""wif""--red again.
- Example 3: ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" once, and we get a triple repetition of ""green.""
- Example 4: ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" twice, hence the quadruple ""green.""
- Example 5: ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" twice, hence the triple ""yellow.""

However, the pattern is not fully consistent, and the last examples introduce a doubt, as the red at the end of the second output doesn't clearly fit the established pattern. The rule might need refining, but based on the examples provided and the repeating color patterns, a basic form of the rule might be as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears right before it, and the amount of repetition relates to how many times the word has appeared in the sequence before ""walm"".

Considering the inconsistencies and the incomplete data, further examples would be required to refine the rule.",-0.1438921304734042,7,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the input and their corresponding output. The word ""walm"" appears in each input, and we notice a specific pattern in the output when it appears.

Let's first identify the consistent mappings from the other words to colors:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Now let's look at how ""walm"" behaves in each input/output pair:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - Here, ""walm"" results in two additional ""red,"" following ""wif,"" which is also ""red.""

2. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and results in two additional ""green"" before proceeding to the next colors of ""lug"" and ""wif.""

3. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (""green""), resulting in two additional ""green"" before continuing to the next colors of ""zup"" and ""lug.""

4. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - ""walm"" follows the second ""dax"" (which is ""green""), resulting in two additional ""green.""

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (""yellow""), resulting in three additional ""yellow.""

From the examples, it appears that ""walm"" duplicates the color of the word before it a certain number of times. When ""walm"" follows a color once, it repeats that color twice more. When ""walm"" follows a color that has been repeated (like ""zup"" in the last example), it duplicates the repeating color as many times as it has appeared in sequence before ""walm."" 

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the color of the previous word in the sequence for as many times as that word has occurred consecutively.

So,

walm -> meaning: duplicate the preceding color for as many times as the word for that color has occurred consecutively before ""walm.""

Explanation of the rule based on examples:

1. Input: dax walm

   Rule application: The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and following ""walm"" it repeats the color ""green"" three times.

2. Input: zup wif walm

3. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   Rule application: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". The ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"", which is ""blue"", three times. Then ""wif"" is translated to ""red"".

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif

2. Input: zup wif walm

3. Input: lug walm wif

   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

5. Input: zup dax walm

Analyzing the outputs corresponding to the presence of ""walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color related to the previous word in the sequence. Here are the observations:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""wif"" and ""zup"" precede ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

The repetition of the color occurs immediately after the ""walm"" occurrence.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: walm causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.",-0.09718156710901164,8,walm
"The word ""walm"" seems to correspond with a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the input. For example, when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and since ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" results in ""green green green."" Similarly, when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" The number of repetitions of the color might be consistent, as evidenced by each instance resulting in three repetitions of the preceding color.

However, in the case of the input ""zup wif walm,"" we see ""red red red red,"" which is four repetitions of red. This is one more repetition than we saw with the ""dax"" and ""lug"" instances. Since ""wif"" is immediately preceding ""walm"" in this instance and ""wif"" corresponds to red, it seems that the preceding words might influence the number of repetitions.

If we analyze ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" where we have two occurrences of ""walm,"" we can infer the following:
- The first ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (consistent with the three repetitions observed).
- The first ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is then modified by a following ""wif"". Therefore, the count of colors represented seems affected by the words that follow ""walm"" as well.

To summarize, ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color word before it. However, the number of repetitions seems to be affected not only by the presence of ""walm"" but also by the words that surround it:

- After a color word, ""walm"" usually results in three repetitions of that color.
- If ""wif"" (which translates to red) follows after ""walm,"" then there is an extra repetition of the color, regardless of the color that ""walm"" is representing.

5. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

Now let's analyze:

- For the input ""dax bluf"", the output is ""green green"". Since ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" and it's the same before and after ""bluf,"" this suggests ""bluf"" may mean ""green.""
- However, for the input ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" also gets the output ""yellow,"" which contradicts the previous conclusion if we consider ""bluf"" as a fixed color.
- The post-""bluf"" inputs seem to affect the color output, too. After ""bluf,"" we have ""dax"" which matches its pre-""bluf"" color ""green."" The same pattern happens with ""zup"" where its post-""bluf"" color is again ""yellow.""
   
Based on these observations, it seems like ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it. In other words, ""bluf"" functions as a chameleon word – it assumes the color representation of the next word mentioned in the sequence.

- ""dax"" preceding ""bluf"" results in ""green green""
- ""lug"" preceding ""bluf"" results in ""blue blue""
- ""wif"" preceding ""bluf"" results in ""red red""
- ""zup"" preceding ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the color outputted for the preceding word to be repeated:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns in the presented examples. Analyzing the input-output pairs, here's the breakdown:

1. The word before ""walm"" in the input dictates the color repeated thrice in the output.
2. The word ""wif"" when present in the input, results in the color ""red"" being added to the output.

Given the examples:

- ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red,"" where ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" as a triplet and ""wif"" adds ""red.""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" meaning ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in threes.
- ""zup walm wif"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" again ""zup"" for ""yellow"" repeated and ""wif"" leading to a ""red"" addendum.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" indicating ""dax"" is responsible for the ""green"" triplet.
- ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow,"" which suggests the position of ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in ""red"" triplets, and ""zup"" following ""walm"" results in ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated thrice in the output. If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" an additional ""red"" is added to the end of the color sequence.

Hence, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is a placeholder that causes the preceding color word to repeat three times in the output, with the possibility of appending ""red"" if followed by ""wif.""

3. The position of ""dax"" in the sequence does not affect its associated color, which is consistently ""green"" in all provided outputs, irrespective of whether ""dax"" appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.

1. In every output where ""dax"" is present, the color green also appears.
2. ""dax"" never produces the same color output when it follows another word; it always produces green when it precedes another word.
3. There are instances where ""dax"" appears as the first and last word in the sequence, and they both correspond to the color green in the output, irrespective of their position in the sequence.
4. The color green is only present in the output when ""dax"" is in the input sequence, and ""dax"" does not correspond to any other colors.

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's look for patterns in the provided input-output pairs.

In the first example, ""lug walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"". Then, ""zup wif"" produces ""red yellow red"". It appears that in this context, ""zup"" is not modifying the color immediately following it, as ""wif"" on its own also translated to ""red"" when not following ""zup"". So this example does not offer a clear single translation for ""zup"".

In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and when ""zup"" is added, we see ""blue yellow"". In the third example, ""wif"" by itself means ""red"", but when ""zup"" is added, it again gives us ""yellow"". This pattern suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", as it is the added color in both cases.

Finally, in the last two examples, the input ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow"" for output. ""Bluf"" is not available in the first two pairs, so we don't have a translation for it, but the presence of ""zup"" still leads to ""yellow"" appearing as the first color.

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""walm"" translates to another instance of ""blue"".
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".

Now, looking at the outputs for inputs that include ""zup"":

- When ""zup"" follows ""lug"" (blue), the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output is also ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" (yellow), the output is ""yellow"" twice.

"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be discerned by looking at the output in the corresponding positions. It is clear that ""bluf"" does not always result in the same output color, which suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the context of its use, rather than representing a specific color itself.

2. wif bluf -> red red
3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red

Let's consider each example:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""lug"" with no other words in between, we get ""blue"" repeated 1 (for ""lug"") + 1 (for ""walm"") = 2 times in the output.

3. Input: dax walm

   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""dax"" directly, we get ""green"" repeated 1 (for ""dax"") + 1 (for ""walm"") = 2 times in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. Here is the rationale:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" indicates that ""blue"" should be repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" the output is ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" correlates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" means the ""green"" should be repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Following ""zup,"" ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be output three times; ""lug"" is unaffected by ""walm"" since it precedes it.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times. Then the sequence continues normally with ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.10385731002690479,11,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" might cause the next color word to be repeated a number of times corresponding to the number of colors mentioned before ""walm."" Let's examine the pattern:

- In the first example, ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" represents ""blue"" and it's the only color before ""walm,"" ""walm"" causes the word ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" the colors before ""walm"" are ""red yellow blue green yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we have ""yellow"" repeated three times, which corresponds to ""zup,"" the color mentioned just before ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm,"" we have ""green,"" represented by ""dax,"" repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" there's ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""yellow,"" represented by ""zup,"" is repeated a number of times equal to the total quantity of colors presented before ""walm.""
- In the last example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times following ""walm.""

Therefore, the general rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color word that immediately precedes it to be repeated once, plus an additional number of times equal to the total number of distinct color words present before ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Walm -> Repeat the color word that immediately precedes it according to the rule above.",-0.2822228884677381,11,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

- When the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- When the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When the word ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

   - Before and after ""bluf,"" there is ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively. ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: ""lug bluf""

   - ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

3. Input: ""wif dax zup bluf""

Output: green green green
Rule observed: The word ""dax"" translates to a single ""green."" When followed by ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated thrice.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
Rule observed: ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" Following them with ""walm"" causes the last color mentioned to be repeated two additional times, for a total of three.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Rule observed: As previously seen, ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in three greens.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
Rule observed: ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" gives us three greens, and then ""wif"" is introduced after ""walm,"" which gives us two reds.

Looking carefully at the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" is a modifier that causes the last color mentioned before it to be repeated two more times, giving a total of three repetitions of the last mentioned color. It does not appear to matter what other words come after ""walm""; it only affects the last color mentioned prior to it.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"" (dax -> green, dax has three letters, so ""green"" is repeated three times)

- In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red.""

"Based on the provided examples, we can try to induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

In every example where ""walm"" appears, the output is a series of the color ""red"" repeated multiple times.

- Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red  
- Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow  
- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue  
- Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red  
- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow  

Let's analyze the outputs with respect to ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, the color ""red"" appears multiple times at the end of the output string, corresponding to the position of ""walm"", with one ""red"" for each occurrence of ""walm"".

2. The number of ""red"" colors seems to correspond to the position of ""walm"" in the input list, starting from the right. For example: 

- In ""lug wif walm"", ""walm"" is the third word from the right, hence there are three ""red""s in the output.  
- In ""wif walm zup"", ""walm"" is the second word from the right, hence there are two ""red""s in the output. In this case, however, there is a ""yellow"" that follows because ""zup"" appears after ""walm"". This suggests that ""walm"" does not influence the word that comes after it in the sequence.  
- ""zup walm"" consists of two words only, and ""walm"" here is also the second word from the right, producing two ""red""s in the output.

Given the evidence, it seems that we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" produces a sequence of ""red"" in the output. The number of ""red"" colors corresponds to the position of ""walm"" when counting from the right side of the input list, with each occurrence of ""walm"" represented by one ""red"". 

However, we must note that there can be exceptions because we do not have information about what happens when ""walm"" is preceded or followed by specific words and if that could potentially change the output.

So our induction would be:

walm -> Outputs ""red"" for each position it holds from the right end of the input sequence.",-0.11908201351064931,14,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
2. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, it seems that the output after the word 'walm' is repeated three times and corresponds to the color associated with the word immediately preceding 'walm'. For instance:

- In the first example, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and after 'walm', the output is 'red red red'. The word 'wif' presents before 'walm' corresponds to 'red'.
- In the second example, 'wif' (red) comes before 'walm', and after 'walm', we again see 'red red red'.
- In the third example, 'lug' (blue) comes before 'walm', and after 'walm', we see 'blue blue blue'.
- In the fourth example, 'wif' (red) comes before 'walm', and after 'walm', we see 'red red red'.
- In the fifth example, 'zup' (yellow) comes before 'walm', and after 'walm', the output is 'yellow yellow yellow'.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the rule for 'walm':

Rule: The word 'walm' causes the next part of the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before 'walm' three times.

Therefore:

walm -> The output color is repeated three times based on the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.12592413290207793,14,walm
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. Each word seems to have a specific color associated with it, and when ""walm"" is used after a word, the output is the color of the preceding word repeated three times. Here's the analysis:

- ""lug wif walm"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red. ""Walm"" repeats red thrice.
- ""wif walm zup"": ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow. ""Walm"" repeats red thrice before ""zup"".
- ""dax lug walm"": ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue. ""Walm"" repeats blue thrice.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" apparently has no effect or corresponds to yellow as well, ""wif"" to red. ""Walm"" repeats red thrice.
- ""zup walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""Walm"" repeats yellow thrice.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-0.32672828459155845,14,walm
"Observing the examples, each non-walm word appears to be mapped to a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow

The word walm does not map to a single color like the other words. Instead, it repeats the color of the word that precedes it. For example:

- Following ""lug"" (blue), walm results in ""blue blue blue""
- Following ""wif"" (red), walm results in ""red red red""
- Following ""dax"" (green), walm results in ""green green green""
- When walm follows ""zup"" (yellow), it also results in repetition of ""yellow""

However, when walm is the second word after ""zup,"" it not only repeats the color of ""zup"" but also increases the repetition by one. This could be because ""zup"" is yellow, and when walm follows, it gives two ""yellow"" (as with other words), and then an extra ""yellow"" is added, totaling three.

Given these observations, the rule for walm seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""zup"" and walm is the second word, add an additional yellow.

"Based on the examples provided where the word 'bluf' is used, it is possible to deduce the following patterns:

1. The color words appear to relate to the input words, although not a one-to-one correspondence because single words in the input produce multiple colors in the output. 
2. Whenever 'bluf' appears in the input, the output repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding 'bluf'. 

For instance:
- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" gives the output ""yellow yellow"", implying 'bluf' caused the color associated with ""zup"" to repeat.
- In the second example, ""dax wif bluf"" leads to ""green red red"" – 'bluf' makes the red (associated with 'wif') repeat.
- In the third example, ""lug bluf wif"" generates ""blue blue red"" – 'bluf' doubles the blue from 'lug' before moving on to 'wif'.
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" becomes ""red green red red yellow red"" – 'bluf' repeats the red from the preceding 'wif'.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue"" – 'bluf' causes the blue from 'lug' to be repeated.

From these observations, we can form the rule for the meaning of 'bluf':

"To discern the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and the output:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the color produced mirrors the color coded for the word that precedes ""bluf"":

- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" codes for ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also produces ""blue.""

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it is consistently ""red"":

- However, this is likely due to the general rule, as ""wif"" codes for ""red,"" which is then mirrored by ""bluf.""

3. ""Bluf"" never contributes a unique color that has not been introduced by the preceding word.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look for patterns in the input and output pairs. Each input string contains the word ""walm"" followed or preceded by one or more words, which results in a corresponding color output. Let's analyze them:

2. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
5. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue

Now let's try to identify the rule by comparing the input word sequences adjacent to ""walm"" with their respective color outputs:

- When the word ""wif"" is adjacent to ""walm,"" the output is always red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue in the output.
- It is not clear what color ""walm"" specifically corresponds to, but we can note that ""walm,"" when used in the examples provided, seems to induce a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes or follows it.

Given this information, we can suggest a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is used, it repeats the color of the adjacent word (either the color of the word before or after ""walm"" if there's only one adjacent word, or the color of the word following ""walm"" if there are words on both sides).

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" there are three consecutive ""red"" in the output, which implies ""walm"" produces two additional ""red"" beyond the single ""red"" ""wif"" seems to correspond with, suggesting ""walm"" could represent a duplication or tripling of the color associated with the preceding word, in this case, ""red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output includes three instances of ""green"" before the ""red"" associated with ""walm"" and then another ""green."" Here, ""walm"" doesn't seem to affect the color associated with ""dax,"" but it does add a ""red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" there is a sequence of three ""blue"" before it breaks the pattern with a different color. This challenges the duplication theory from the first bullet as the color that corresponds to ""lug"" is not repeated.
- Finally, when ""walm"" precedes a different color word like ""zup,"" the pattern of the three same colors breaks with a ""yellow,"" corresponding to ""zup.""

From this analysis, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color from the previous word to repeat an additional two times before it allows the sequence to continue with the next color (which perhaps is indicated by the next nonce word).

However, considering the third example, ""wif walm,"" the rule doesn't quite apply as there's no deviation in the color pattern after ""walm."" It is possible that when ""walm"" is at the end or not followed by another color-indicating nonce word, it merely extends the last color by two more instances.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it two additional times, except when at the end or not followed by another distinct nonce word that changes the color, in which case it simply continues the color of the preceding word for two more instances without change.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: A repetition indicator for the immediately preceding color word, repeating the associated color two additional times, or if at the end or not followed by a distinct color word, continues the same color without change.",-0.14069991320426828,15,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the input-output pairs:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
2. ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""
3. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
4. ""lug walm zup"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow""
5. ""lug walm wif lug"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue""

Analyzing the input-output pairs:

- It seems that each word (zup, dax, lug, wif) has a corresponding color (yellow, green, blue, red).
- The word ""walm,"" when paired with ""wif,"" always results in multiple ""red"" colors in the output, potentially indicating a repetition of the color corresponding to ""wif.""
- ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red,"" and when ""walm"" is present, there is a repetition of the color red three times, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
- When ""walm"" follows another word, the color for that word seems to repeat three times before continuing with the sequence as normal.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, the color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> Causes the color corresponding to the previous word to repeat three times.",-0.1465331427984146,15,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to change its meaning depending on the word that immediately follows it. Let's look at the occurrences:

- When ""wif"" follows ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"".
- When ""dax"" follows ""walm"", the output is ""green red green"".
- When ""zup"" follows ""walm"", the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""lug"" follows ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".

Additionally, the words ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"" seem to have consistent outputs when they are not preceded by ""walm"":

- ""zup"" leads to an output of ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" leads to an output of ""green"".
- ""wif"" leads to an output of ""red"".
- ""lug"" leads to an output of ""blue"".

Noticing that each word translates to a specific color and that ""walm"" seems to modify the color output based on the following word while also repeating the color assigned to the following word three times, we can deduce the following:

Rule: ""walm"" followed by a word results in the output of the color associated with that word three times (repeat the color that corresponds to the following word three times). However, when ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" it seems to result in ""green red green,"" which breaks the otherwise consistent rule, implying that ""walm"" modifies the following word's pattern in some other unknown way or that there may be some special rule when ""walm"" is followed by ""dax.""

Upon further review of the data, the unique case of ""dax walm wif dax"" could be understood as ""green"" (dax) - ""green red green"" (walm wif) - ""green"" (dax), where ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" results in an insertion of ""red"" among the ""green"" associated with ""dax"" and ""wif"".

Hence, we might specify the rule for ""walm"" as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word changes the output so that the color associated with the directly following word is repeated three times, with the exception that when followed by ""dax,"" it inserts ""red"" between the repetitions of ""green."" 

However, we would need more examples to fully validate the exception for ""dax"" or refine the rule further.",-0.8000772135642682,15,walm
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the quantity but not the color of the output. A pattern can be observed where every other word corresponds to a specific color:

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""

In outputs with ""walm,"" the number of colored outputs increases by two, specifically for the color that precedes ""walm."" For instance, in the first example, one ""wif"" would produce one ""red"" output, but with ""walm"" following it, there are three ""red"" outputs.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" following a color-word is to triple the color output associated with that word.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Here is the evidence supporting this conclusion:

3. Input: dax wif -> Output: green red

Analyzing the inputs and corresponding outputs, here's what we can deduce:
- Whenever ""dax"" appears, there is a ""green"" in the output following the colors that correspond to other words.
- ""Green"" is positioned immediately after the colors that are associated with the words before ""dax,"" if there are any.
- When ""dax"" is the first word in the input, ""green"" is the first color in the output.

In all cases, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output of the word that immediately precedes it. It also appears to have no corresponding output if it is the very last word in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

2. In the second example, ""dax walm wif zup,"" the output is ""green green green red yellow."" This again suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and since ""walm"" comes directly after ""dax,"" ""walm"" too is translated to ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" the output does not provide a direct translation for ""walm"" by itself. However, ""walm"" follows the second ""wif"" which translates to ""red,"" and thus ""walm"" results in ""red"" as well.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Both instances of ""walm"" follow a color word – first ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and then ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" in both cases adopts the color of the preceding word.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" and again, ""walm"" adopts the color of the previous word ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

4. Input: dax bluf lug wif, Output: green green blue red – ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green""; ""bluf"" does not seem to influence the words following it, ""lug"" and ""wif.""

5. Input: zup bluf wif bluf, Output: yellow yellow red red – ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and both instances of ""bluf"" take on the same color as the word immediately preceding them.

"Based on the examples provided, each nonce word seems to correlate with a specific color:

Considering the above, we can observe the following pattern for bluf:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it turns into ""yellow"" (as seen in the third and last example).
2. In all other cases, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

From these observations, we can deduce a rule for bluf:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
   Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   
   In this case, ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" leading to ""red"" being repeated three times, and ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" which is not repeated because it follows ""bluf.""

3. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   
   The word ""lug"" (which equates to ""blue"") does not have ""walm"" right after it, but ""dax"" does, and the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
   Here, ""wif"" is the word before ""walm,"" and its corresponding color ""red"" is repeated three times in the output.

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   
   ""Wif"" comes right before ""walm"" thus causing the color ""red"" to be repeated three times in the output sequence.

From these examples, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" dictates repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. Let's analyze the examples to see the pattern:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": Here, ""lug"" must mean ""blue,"" and ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the previous word three times.
   
2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue"": ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which produces ""red red red."" This suggests ""wif"" means ""red."" ""Lug"" follows, meaning ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" does not have ""walm"" after it, but it still produces ""blue."" It could be that ""bluf"" also means ""blue"" or possibly triggers a duplication of the previous color without requiring ""walm.""

3. ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green"": ""Lug"" stands for ""blue,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" yielding ""green green green."" Therefore, ""dax"" likely means ""green,"" and ""walm"" again triggers the repetition.

4. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"": ""Zup"" precedes ""wif,"" which is followed by ""walm,"" producing ""red red red."" This suggests ""wif"" means ""red"" (which is consistent with example 2), and ""zup"" means ""yellow"" as it is the only color that appears once and does not have ""walm"" following it.

5. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red"": The presence of ""walm"" after the second ""wif"" again results in ""red red red."" ""Dax"" meaning ""green"" and ""zup"" meaning ""yellow"" are consistent with previous examples. ""Bluf"" produces ""yellow,"" which is the same color as the preceding ""zup,"" hinting that ""bluf"" might have a rule different from ""walm."" For now, let's focus on what ""walm"" does consistently.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color represented by the preceding word three times.",-0.11920527237611767,17,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" has a rule related to the number of times a color is repeated in the output. Let's analyze the examples given:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue
2. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
3. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

From these examples, we can see that every time ""walm"" appears in the input, there's a repetition of a color in the output. The number of repetitions corresponds directly to the number of words before ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

1. One word before ""walm"" (lug) leads to three repetitions of blue.
2. Five words before ""walm"" (wif walm lug bluf) lead to three repetitions of red.
3. Three words before ""walm"" (lug dax) lead to three repetitions of green.
4. Three words before ""walm"" (zup wif) lead to three repetitions of red.
5. Six words before ""walm"" (dax wif zup bluf wif) lead to three repetitions of red.

The rule that seems to govern the use of ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the immediately preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.

1. ""dax lug"" consistently translates to ""green blue"".
2. When ""dax"" appears by itself, the output is ""green"".
3. ""dax"" is followed by another color when it is in combination with another word, such as ""zup"" or ""walm"".

Given this information, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"". When it is combined with other words, it maintains its meaning while those other words correspond to other colors. The repetition of ""walm"" after ""lug"" followed by repeated ""blue"" suggests that ""walm"" may translate to ""green"" as well, especially considering that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", but that is less clear from the given input. Similarly, we can deduce that ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".

Rule: dax -> green",-1.0389613530910446,18,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Examples:

- When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is simply ""green.""
- ""dax"" in combination with ""lug"" produces ""green blue,"" suggesting ""dax"" is ""green"" while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In ""zup dax wif,"" the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" with ""zup"" and ""wif"" presumably translating to ""yellow"" and ""red,"" respectively.
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" gives us ""green green green yellow blue blue blue,"" where we see ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" twice, yielding ""green green green."" This might imply ""walm"" also represents ""green"" or perhaps it signifies a repetition of the previous color. ""zup"" as identified prior corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" with the last ""walm"" possibly repeating ""blue"" as well.

Given these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" appears to be consistent regardless of context:

Rule: dax -> green",-1.5898638131031957,18,dax
"Based on the examples provided where the word ""dax"" appears amidst other nonce words, we can observe the following instances:

2. When ""dax"" appears with ""lug"", it outputs ""green blue"".
3. In a longer sequence featuring additional words, ""dax"" still outputs ""green"".

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
Rule: ""wif"" leads to a single ""red,"" but when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" we get two additional ""red."" This suggests that ""walm"" may repeat the color of the word before it two more times.

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
Rule: ""dax"" leads to a single ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""green"" two more times.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" When ""walm"" is used after ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated two additional times. This again supports the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word.

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""blue"" two more times, then ""zup"" gives a single ""yellow."" This also aligns with the rule of ""walm.""

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""red"" twice. Then ""zup"" and ""lug"" translate to ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively. ""Zup"" before ""walm"" leads to three ""yellow,"" which once again indicates that ""walm"" repeats the color preceding it.

Based on the pattern observed in all given examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm"" as follows:

1. ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red"". Since ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and gives us ""red red red"", it seems that ""walm"" may mean ""repeat the prior color twice more"" (resulting in three occurrences of ""red"").

2. In ""dax walm wif walm zup"", ""walm"" following ""dax"" yields ""green green green"", and ""walm"" following ""wif"" yields ""red red red"". Again, it seems that ""walm"" means ""repeat the prior color twice more"".

3. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" contains ""lug walm"", and the output for this is ""blue blue blue"", reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" means to repeat the preceding color twice more.

4. ""lug walm zup"" confirms the pattern with ""blue blue blue"" following the ""lug walm"" sequence.

5. Lastly, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" includes two occurrences of ""walm"". The first one, following ""wif"", results in ""red red red"", and the second one, following ""zup"", results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".

5. Input: zup dax zup wif -> Output: yellow green yellow red

Analyzing the instances:

- When ""dax"" appears immediately after ""wif"" (examples 1 and 4), the output is ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" might correspond to ""green"" when following ""wif.""
- However, when ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" or stands alone at the beginning (examples 2, 3, and 5), it still corresponds to ""green.""
- Additionally, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words surrounding it.

Based on the above observations, the rule seems consistent and not dependent on the context or other words in the sequence:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.2554958388583502,19,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to a specific color in the output. Here are the observations:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input does not affect its corresponding output; it always maps to ""green"" regardless of its placement.

From these observations, it is reasonable to induce the following rule:

dax -> meaning. The meaning of ""dax"" is the color ""green"".

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the output is ""green"" at the corresponding position.",-1.6441507971500002,19,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" is associated with a specific color in the output. In each case, whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the color ""green"" is present at the corresponding position in the output. Here is a breakdown that illustrates this:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to the fourth position in the input and also corresponds to ""green,"" which is the fourth color in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is in the second position, which corresponds to ""green"" in the second position in the output.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is in the first position, which corresponds to ""green"" in the first position in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" again is in the first position, corresponding to ""green"" in the first position in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is in the second position, which corresponds to ""green"" in the second position in the output.

Thus, we can deduce that the rule is:

dax -> green",-1.6597893253666247,19,dax

Rule: wif -> red,-1.8839065618397053,19,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we can analyze the pattern of its occurrence and the corresponding output in the given examples. Here are the instances where ""zup"" appears and the related outputs:

1. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

3. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

5. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow

From the examples, we can observe that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Furthermore, it does not seem to alter the output of the words around it or follow a transformation rule. It is a standalone word that translates directly to an output without interaction. Therefore, based on the provided examples, we derive the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""",-0.07848564023184887,19,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to depend on the position of the word ""zup"" in relation to the other words. By analyzing the patterns, it looks like ""zup"" signals a sequence of colors that corresponds to each word present before ""zup."" Each word is associated with a specific color:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> green

Now let's analyze the role of ""zup"" in each input and output:

1. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   Here, ""zup"" follows ""wif"" so it outputs ""red yellow"" and ""dax"" after ""zup"" outputs its associated color, which is ""green.""

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   Before ""zup,"" we have ""dax walm wif walm,"" which translates to ""green green red green."" ""Zup"" then repeats the sequence of colors before it ""green green green red"" and adds ""yellow"" at the end.

3. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   Since ""zup"" is at the start, it outputs ""yellow"" and then we have ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   The first ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" ""dax"" and ""walm"" output ""green"" each, and the second ""zup"" repeats the color sequence ""green green"" then adds ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif,"" which outputs ""red.""

5. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow
   The sequence ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" and ""zup"" adds a ""yellow"" at the end.

Based on these observations, ""zup"" appears to generate an output where it repeats the sequence of colors defined by each word preceding it and then appends the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> Repeat the sequence of colors represented by the words before ""zup"" and add ""yellow"" at the end.",-0.08772550556602325,19,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a particular color:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to duplicating the color of the previously mentioned word.
- ""zup"" appears to insert the color ""yellow.""

Let's examine the outputs in relation to the inputs to verify the above deductions:

1. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   ""wif"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""dax"" -> green

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   ""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" -> green (repeating), ""wif"" -> red, ""walm"" -> red (repeating), ""zup"" -> yellow

3. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   ""zup"" -> yellow, ""dax"" -> green

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   ""zup"" -> yellow, ""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" -> green (repeating previous color), ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red

5. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow
   ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow

Based on this analysis, the rule induction for the nonce word ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.10759822422033721,19,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each input word corresponds to a color in the output.

- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- ""walm"" always corresponds to a doubled ""green,"" or ""green green.""
- ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow,"" but let's check this against all examples.

1. ""wif zup dax"" translates to ""red yellow green."" The word ""zup"" is between ""wif"" (red) and ""dax"" (green) and output as yellow.
2. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green red red green green yellow."" Here, ""zup"" produces yellow at the end, following the ""walm"" pattern which doubled the ""green.""
3. ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green."" Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" and ""zup"" produces yellow, ""dax"" green.
4. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" Both instances of ""zup"" translate to yellow, including when it appears at the beginning and between ""walm"" (green green) and ""wif"" (red).
5. ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow."" Here, ""zup"" follows ""dax"" and translates to yellow once more.

So the rule appears consistent across all examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-0.26954958144802327,19,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word 'zup' correlates with the word 'yellow'. It consistently corresponds to the output 'yellow', independent of position within the input sequence. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-1.4861672932230237,19,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the provided examples and see how they relate to the translation:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

4. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

From the examples above, we can try to deduce a pattern. We can see that ""bluf"" appears in all inputs, and ""blue"" appears in all outputs. Let's pair the input words with the corresponding color output:

1. wif - red
2. zup - yellow
3. bluf - blue
4. lug - blue
5. walm - blue

In each instance, ""bluf"" corresponds directly to one color in the output, and that color is ""blue."" Additionally, in example 4, ""bluf"" is immediately followed by a repeated color — ""red"" in this case. From these observations:

bluf -> meaning: blue",-0.08741587118171798,19,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color output that is a repetition of the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. 

In the first example, the word ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and is output as ""blue,"" which then leads ""bluf"" to also output ""blue."" In each case, the color that ""bluf"" outputs is a repetition of the preceding color.

Here's the rule breakdown based on each input and output:

1. ""lug bluf"" correlates to ""blue blue""
2. ""zup bluf"" correlates to ""yellow yellow""
3. ""dax bluf"" correlates to ""green green""

Therefore, the rule for bluf appears to be:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in how ""walm"" is used in the examples and how the output changes after it appears. Here are the examples with some analysis:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output changes from green to red.

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output changes from blue to blue, but since blue was already present, this doesn't tell us much.

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" again, and the output is still blue, repeating.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is a red turning into blue then back to red.

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output remains yellow, changing to red only after ""wif.""

From these analyses:

- After ""walm,"" the color of the next word changes, except when ""walm"" is at the end or is followed by ""lug,"" in which case the color repeats. 
- ""Walm"" does not seem to carry a consistent output color itself.

Considering these observations, it appears that ""walm"" indicates a change to the next color in sequence, but it also might indicate a repetition if followed by ""lug."" Let's focus on the change this time:

- ""Dax walm"" causes green to change to red.
- ""Wif walm"" causes red to change to blue.
- ""Zup walm"" causes yellow to stay yellow, then change to red after ""wif.""

Now let's propose a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""Walm"" signals the next color word to change to the next color in a sequence or repeat the last color if followed by ""lug."" The sequence appears to be red -> blue -> green -> (back to red), and ""zup"" seems to stay consistent as yellow before and after ""walm.""

Therefore:

walm -> causes the next word's color to shift to the next in a sequence or repeat if followed by ""lug""",-0.09941764251839053,19,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" is a rule or instruction that states to repeat the color of the previous word or sequence. Here is the induction based on the given examples:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""green,"" the color associated with ""dax."" Subsequently, ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green,"" once again the last ""green"" repeats due to ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""dax lug walm"" turns into ""green blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" creates a repetition of ""blue,"" which is the color for ""lug.""

- In the third example, the pattern ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue green blue blue blue,"" demonstrating that ""walm"" once again causes a repetition of ""blue,"" the color coded by ""lug,"" which precedes it.

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" The ""walm"" in this sequence causes the repetition of ""red,"" the color associated with ""wif,"" before ""lug"" changes the color to ""blue,"" followed by ""wif"" returning it to ""red.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" ""Walm"" makes ""yellow,"" which is linked to ""zup,"" repeat.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat. If the preceding color is not known, it appears to default to repeating the color of the current word associated with ""walm.""",-0.19807978454175224,19,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" refers to a sequence of the color ""blue"" repeated the same number of times as the immediately preceding word has appeared before ""walm"". If ""walm"" is the first word or the preceding word hasn't appeared before, then ""walm"" yields a single ""blue"".

Explanation:
1. In the first example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"", ""dax"" occurred once before ""walm"", so the output is ""green green green red"", then ""dax"" recurs resulting in two more ""green"", followed by ""walm"" which now outputs two ""blue"" because ""dax"" has appeared twice before the second ""walm"".

2. For ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and has appeared once, so the resulting output is three ""blue"" (one extra for ""dax"", and two for ""lug"").

3. In ""dax lug dax lug walm"", ""lug"" appears twice before ""walm"" hence the output of four ""blue"" (one for ""dax"", and three for ""lug"").

4. The sequence ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" shows ""wif"" appearing twice before ""walm"", leading to three ""blue"".

5. The last example, ""zup walm wif"", has ""zup"" as the only input before ""walm"" which suggests it has not appeared before, so ""walm"" outputs one ""blue"".

So, we can put forward the following rule definition:

walm -> meaning. A word that translates to the color ""blue"" repeated as many times as the immediately prior word has occurred in the sequence before ""walm"". If the prior word hasn't occurred before or if ""walm"" is at the beginning, it yields one ""blue"".",-0.6071092355695716,19,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rules associated with the nonce word 'walm,' we need to compare the outputs associated with the presence of the word 'walm' in various inputs. Let's evaluate the given examples.

The first and foremost observation is that the output is a sequence of color names. Looking closely, each word in the input is translating to a specific color in the output. Here's what we can infer from the examples provided:

1. Every time the word 'dax' is present, it corresponds to the output 'green.'
2. The word 'lug' corresponds to the output 'blue.'
3. The word 'wif' corresponds to the output 'red.'
4. The word 'zup' corresponds to the output 'yellow.'
5. The word 'bluf' has only appeared before the word 'walm' and has caused the output 'green' when 'dax' wasn't present, otherwise, it resulted in 'red.'

Now, let's analyze the sequence where 'walm' is involved and check the correlating colors:

a. In every instance, when 'walm' is present, the following conditions seem to apply:
   - The word preceding 'walm' repeats its color in the output when 'walm' is included, except for when 'walm' is the first word in the sequence.
   - When 'walm' is the first word, the color 'yellow' is repeated.

b. In the last given example, 'walm' comes after 'bluf' and the sequence 'red red' follows, which suggests 'walm' might cause the preceding color to repeat, which in this case, if 'bluf' was generating 'red,' it would follow the established rule we're creating.

Using these observations, we can deduce the general rule associated with 'walm':

Rule: When 'walm' appears in a sequence, it causes the following output to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes 'walm.' If 'walm' is the first word, the output color is 'yellow.'

walm -> meaning: repeat the preceding color in the output sequence, or 'yellow' if at the beginning.",-1.0682641507980952,19,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" in this context appears to influence the color output immediately following its occurrence. To determine the meaning, let's look at the patterns surrounding ""walm"":

1. In the first example, every time ""walm"" is used, the word ""green"" is repeated except for once where ""red"" is followed by ""blue"" and then ""green"" again. It could suggest that ""walm"" prompts repetition but changes the sequence when interrupted by another color (lug -> blue).

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which is blue), and then we see a sequence of ""blue"" repeated.

3. The third example is similar to the second, with ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" and ""blue"" repeated afterward.

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows a sequence of colors and then results in a repeat of ""red"" after its occurrence, despite the next word being ""lug"" (usually blue).

5. The fifth example shows ""walm"" following a new word, ""zup"" (yellow), and subsequently, ""yellow"" is repeated.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color represented by the preceding word to repeat in the sequence. When ""walm"" is preceded by a color word, that color repeats until a different color word interrupts the pattern.

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine its occurrence and the corresponding output in each example.

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""

2. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" alone results in ""green.""

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""green green green,"" but ""walm"" was shown to correspond to ""blue"" in the first example. This suggests that ""dax"" changes the color associated with ""walm.""

4. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - Consistent with the second input, ""dax"" alone leads to ""green.""

5. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red
   - ""wif"" appears to correspond with ""red.""
   - ""dax"" followed by ""wif"" leads to ""green red,"" but when ""wif"" is by itself, it corresponds to ""red."" Again, ""dax"" changes the color associated with the following word.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" as previously determined.

Based on these observations, ""dax"" could mean ""green,"" but it also seems to have a transformative effect on the following word, causing it to be represented as ""green"" rather than its usual color. However, since we see ""dax""'s transformative effect on ""walm"" and ""wif"" but not ""lug,"" it is not consistent. More examples would be needed to understand the full rules governing ""dax""'s interaction with other words.

Considering this information, the best rule we can infer from the given examples is:

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf zup"" corresponds to ""yellow red red yellow."" Given that ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow,"" when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it results in ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" Here ""wif"" results in ""red,"" ""bluf,"" right after ""wif,"" stays the same as ""red,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" gives us ""yellow yellow."" It indicates that when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow"" which is the same color as ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" as well.
- The fifth example, ""zup bluf,"" repeats the third example and reaffirms that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""

From these observations, the most consistent rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color value of the word that immediately precedes it, with the exception when it follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red."" So the rule induction for ""bluf"" would be:

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color value of the preceding word, except when preceded by ""wif"" where it is always ""red.""",-0.12225226514854669,20,bluf
"Given the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with a particular color in the output. To deduce the rule, let's compare the input containing ""bluf"" to the corresponding output.

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf zup"" becomes ""yellow red red yellow."" The word ""bluf"" comes between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" which correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively in the output. Here, ""bluf"" results in ""red.""

- In the second example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" Again, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red"" in the output.

- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" turns into ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue blue."" ""Bluf"" is in the last position here and corresponds to ""blue.""

- The fifth example, ""zup bluf,"" is the same as the third and has the output ""yellow yellow,"" with ""bluf"" producing ""yellow.""

From these examples, the rule seems a bit inconsistent, as ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in the first and second examples, but ""yellow"" in the third and fifth, and ""blue"" in the fourth.

However, a possible consistent rule is that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence. ""Wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" which would account for why ""bluf"" sometimes produces these colors. This rule, however, does not explain the ""blue"" in the fourth example.

Given the inconsistent nature of these examples, without further information, it is challenging to deduce a definitive and consistent rule. Therefore, based on the provided data, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it, unless it is preceded by ""lug"" (in which case it becomes ""blue"") or at the end (in which case it also becomes ""blue"").

3. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"".
4. ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"".
5. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"".

Here's what we can observe:

- ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue"".
- There is an additional word ""zup"" in the fifth example, which correlates with the color ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

"In analyzing the pattern between the inputs and the outputs, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. 

Here is how it breaks down:

- ""dax lug walm"" has the output of ""green blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""walm"" repeats the color blue as many times as the word ""lug"" occurs before the next word (""dax"" in this case).

- ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green,"" indicating ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats the color green in accordance with the prior word (""dax"").

- ""dax walm"" has the output ""green green green,"" showing that ""walm"" repeats the color green following the word ""dax.""

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" - again, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with ""lug.""

- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" repeats the color blue three times after the first ""lug,"" then ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by another ""lug walm"" sequence that repeats the color blue three times again.

From this, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it for as many times as that word has appeared since another color word has appeared.

Example 2: The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red red.""

Example 5: The word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green."" The output for ""bluf"" is ""green green.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let us look at the commonalities in its occurrences and the resulting outputs.

1. In the first example, bluf is preceded by different words and is followed by ""red red.""
2. In the second example, bluf is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""blue yellow."" However, when we compare this to other instances where ""wif"" occurs, the color ""red"" follows it, which suggests ""wif"" directly translates to ""red.""
3. In the third example, we have ""zup bluf"" resulting in ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""zup"" could mean ""yellow."" This is consistent with the first example, where each ""zup"" is followed by a ""yellow."" However, the ""bluf"" in this example is not followed by ""red red,"" hinting that bluf may affect the resulting colors differently depending on the context.
4. The fourth example is more complex and involves repetition of other nonce words like ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm."" The ""lug bluf"" is followed by ""blue red,"" ""lug wif"" by ""blue red,"" and ""lug walm lug"" by ""blue red blue."" Given that ""lug"" consistently precedes a ""blue,"" it might mean ""blue.""
5. In the fifth example, we see that ""wif dax bluf"" results in ""red green green."" However, we have seen before that ""wif"" and ""dax"" can both correspond to ""red"" and ""green"" respectively. Since ""bluf"" does not have any additional inputs to be paired with ""green,"" comparing it with previous examples, it seems that ""bluf"" on its own translates to ""green.""

Based on these observations, the inferred rule is:
Rule: ""bluf"" on its own translates to ""green."" In the context where it follows other words or is followed by specific words, it may not necessarily be ""green"" but could induce a repetition or continuation of the previously established colors for those words. The only consistent pairing directly attributed to ""bluf"" by itself, though, seems to be ""green,"" as seen in examples 1 and 5. 

bluf -> green",-1.0298027536213863,21,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the consistency of the output when ""bluf"" appears in the input. Comparing the input with its associated output each time ""bluf"" appears, we notice the following:

1. In the first input, where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is red.
2. In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the corresponding output is blue.
3. The third input places ""bluf"" after ""zup,"" and the output is yellow.
4. In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" again, producing blue in the output.
5. Finally, the fifth input once more has ""bluf"" after ""dax,"" resulting in green in the output.

Looking at the sequence, we observe that the output color corresponding to ""bluf"" is not fixed, indicating that ""bluf"" likely does not have a unique color mapped to it. Instead, its meaning seems to be determined by the word that precedes it. Accordingly, ""bluf"" takes the same color as the word before it:

- After ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is red, the same as for ""wif.""
- After ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is blue, the same as for ""lug.""
- After ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is yellow, the same as for ""zup.""
- After ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is green, the same as for ""dax.""

So, we can formulate the rule as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes the same color as the immediately preceding word.",-1.3019763391688122,21,bluf
"To deduce the rule, let's analyze the correlation between the input and output sequences.

1. In the first input, the term ""bluf"" corresponds to the sequence ""red red"". 
2. In the second input, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
3. In the third input, ""bluf"" corresponds to a single ""yellow"".
4. In the fourth input, ""bluf"" corresponds to two ""blue"".
5. In the fifth input, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

Given the inconsistency in the output, we can conclude that ""bluf"" does not translate to a consistent color. Instead, it might be associated with a rule that depends on its context in the sequence. Let's consider the possibility that ""bluf"" could change the rules of the sequence.

Looking closely at the fourth input where ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif lug wif walm lug,"" we see a repetition of blue and red until the sequence ends with blue. This could suggest that ""bluf"" sets up a pattern-switching rule. However, this rule does not consistently hold up against other examples.

The fifth input shows that after ""bluf"" is used, the color ""green"" is repeated twice. However, in other examples where ""bluf"" appears, there isn't such repetition.

"To deduce the meaning or the rule for ""dax"", we need to observe how the output changes in relation to the presence of the word ""dax"" in various positions within the input string.

Let's analyze:

1. When ""zup dax walm zup wif"" is the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow green green green yellow red"". We notice that ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in the output.

2. For the single occurrence ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

3. In the sequence ""dax lug wif,"" the word ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" once more.

4. When the order is shifted to ""lug wif dax,"" the output sequence ends in ""green,"" which corresponds to the placement of ""dax"" at the end of the input sequence.

5. Finally, in the input ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again, and all other words have consistent color associations across examples.

From these observations, it seems clear that the word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence. None of the examples rely on the surrounding context to determine the output for ""dax,"" suggesting that the meaning of ""dax"" is independent of other words.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color word that immediately precedes it.",-0.10512371467621516,22,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll analyze each pair of input and output by correlating the presence of the word ""bluf"" and the corresponding output pattern. 

- In the first input ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" is followed by two ""red"" outputs.
- In the second input ""zup bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" appears before ""wif"" and is followed by two ""yellow"" outputs before the ""red"" output from ""wif.""
- In the third input ""dax wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and there are two ""red"" outputs at the end, with ""green"" and ""red"" before that from ""dax"" and ""wif,"" respectively.
- In the fourth input ""dax lug bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" and there are two ""blue"" outputs following ""bluf"" before ending with ""red"" from ""wif.""
- In the fifth input ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" and the output then contains two ""yellow"" following the ""bluf"" in the sequence.

From these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" leads to a duplication of the color associated with the word just before ""bluf."" The rule for ""bluf"" therefore seems to be duplicating the output color that would be generated by the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf directly follows a color-inducing word and results in the duplication of the output associated with that word.",-0.470425841018228,22,bluf

- In the second example, ""wif,"" which again corresponds to ""red,"" is right before ""bluf,"" and ""red red"" follows.
- The third and fourth examples follow the same pattern with ""wif bluf"" leading to ""red red"" and ""lug bluf"" leading to ""blue blue.""
- The fifth example shows ""zup bluf"" leading to ""yellow yellow,"" adhering to the repeating pattern established in the previous examples.

"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we can study the patterns in Input and their corresponding Output. Let's analyze the available data:

In Input/Output pair 1:
- ""lug wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red blue,""
- ""walm zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue yellow yellow red.""

The change begins after the introduction of ""walm."" Following ""walm,"" blue becomes the dominant color up to the next ""walm,"" after which yellow is repeated, then it shifts back to red after ""wif.""

In Input/Output pair 2:
- The sequence ""zup walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue.""
- ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""Walm dax"" leads to an additional yellow before it switches to green for ""dax.""

In Input/Output pair 3:
- ""Zup dax walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green yellow red.""
- Once again, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red.
- ""Walm"" leads to a repetition of green before it goes back to yellow with the next ""zup.""

In Input/Output pair 4:
- ""Wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow.""
- ""Walm dax"" leads to a repetition of red before switching to green, and then to yellow for ""zup.""

In Input/Output pair 5:
- ""Dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow.""
- Again, ""walm"" causes a repetition of green before changing to yellow with ""zup.""

Based on the analysis, ""walm"" appears to cause the preceding color to repeat until a new distinct word (that is not ""walm"") occurs which correlates to another color. It's like a ""repeat"" marker for the last mentioned color, until it hits a new color instruction.

Rule: walm -> causes the last mentioned color to repeat until a new color word is encountered.",-0.18763191565093063,22,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the examples provided and identify any patterns. 

Notice that the word ""walm"" always yields a series of the same color which immediately follows it. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"": The first instance of ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which gives us ""blue blue blue,"" and the second instance of ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" corresponding to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

2. ""zup walm dax lug"": ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

3. ""zup dax walm zup wif"": ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" leading to ""green green green.""

4. ""wif walm dax zup"": ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" giving us ""red red red.""

5. ""dax walm zup"": ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" resulting in ""green green green.""

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color that corresponds to the subsequent word as many times as it appears before changing to the next color. In other words, if ""walm"" is followed by a word that translates to a color, that color is repeated three times (since ""walm"" appears once before it).

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the next color's term to be repeated three times.

Thus:
""walm"" -> meaning. Meaning: causes the next color word to be repeated three times.",-0.46593626401936616,22,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will look for patterns between the input and output sequences.

In the first input sequence, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" the corresponding output is ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" Focusing on where ""walm"" appears, it follows ""lug,"" and the corresponding color for ""lug"" is blue. After ""walm"" appears, the color sequence includes additional instances of blue. This suggests that ""walm"" is linked to the repetition of the previous color.

The same pattern appears in the second input sequence, ""zup walm dax lug."" Here, ""zup"" is linked to yellow in the output sequence, and after ""walm"" appears, there is an additional instance of yellow. Again, ""walm"" seems to signal repetition.

This pattern is consistent across all provided examples. After ""walm"" is used, the previous color repeats in the output sequence. It is also noted that after ""walm,"" there is a continuation of the previous color multiple times. The exact number of repetitions seems to be context-dependent, however, the general rule for a duplication effect remains consistent.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be the repetition of the color linked to the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> triggers the repetition of the preceding color in the sequence.",-0.6575619762226732,22,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can infer that the word ""walm"" has an effect on the color that follows it. Looking at the first example, after ""walm,"" the colors repeat the color of the word just before ""walm."" Here are the observations:

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (noticing that ""zup"" on its own is coded as yellow, and after ""walm"" it's repeated three times)
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red"", but in one case ""wif"" was followed by a sequence ""walm wif"" and resulted in ""red yellow yellow red"", which suggests that ""walm"" here might mean repeat the previous color twice and then continue with the original color sequence.

Combining the observations from all examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the previous color to repeat a number of times before proceeding with the usual color sequence. Specifically, ""walm"" repeated the color that comes before it one more time than the number of times ""walm"" is used in a sequence. 

For example:
- Once in ""walm wif"", repeating the previous color (""red"") twice before continuing.
- Twice in ""zup walm walm wif"", repeating the previous color (""yellow"") three times before continuing.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" in the sequence by one more count than the number of ""walm"" occurrences in a consecutive order, then proceed with the regular color sequence.",-1.0980123924524745,22,walm

Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing that the effect continues until a different color word appears or the sequence ends.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Other words in the input seem to correspond to different colors in the output. For example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" yields a sequence of ""blue"" repeated for the number of times ""walm"" appears in a row.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns and associations in the given examples. Let's first catalog the outputs associated with other words that we see repeated in the inputs:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""bluf"" has been used twice and corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when used with ""zup"" and to ""red"" when used with ""wif,"" indicating ""bluf"" might change its output based on adjacent words.

Now let's find the pattern for ""walm"" by comparing the output before and after including ""walm"":

1. ""zup wif walm"" has the output ""yellow red red red."" Without ""walm"" and looking at the patterns for ""zup"" and ""wif,"" the expected output would be ""yellow red."" Therefore, ""walm"" seems to add ""red red"" to the output.
   
2. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" has the output ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" We don't have another instance of ""lug"" to establish its color, but we do know the colors for ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif."" So, ignoring ""lug"" and ""walm"" the expected output for ""dax zup wif"" would be ""green yellow red."" The difference here is an additional ""blue blue blue"" which seems to correspond with ""lug walm,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might take on the color blue when paired with ""lug.""

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" has the output ""yellow yellow red red red."" If we remove ""walm,"" we'd expect ""zup bluf wif"" to yield ""yellow yellow red,"" indicating that ""walm"" adds ""red red.""

4. ""dax walm wif"" has the output ""green green green red."" Without ""walm,"" we'd expect ""dax wif"" to be ""green red."" So ""walm"" here results in ""green green.""

5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" Without ""walm,"" ""wif bluf dax"" would likely be ""red red green,"" implying ""walm"" adds ""green green.""

From the above observations, we can see that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color prior to its own occurrence in the input sequence. However, the number of repetitions varies:

- When following ""zup"" (yielding yellow) or ""wif"" (yielding red), ""walm"" creates a double repetition of the prior mentioned color.
- When following ""dax"" (yielding green), ""walm"" creates a triple repetition of the prior mentioned color.
- The example including ""lug"" with ""walm"" introduces ""blue,"" a new color, in triple repetition, possibly due to ""lug"" being an unknown word, or ""walm"" may add its own coloring rule with ""lug.""

Based on the information we have, we can't create a singular rule for ""walm"" because of the inconsistency with the example including ""lug."" With the current data, the best we can say is that ""walm"" seems to cause repetition of the preceding color in the output, potentially affected by the word that comes directly before it. More examples, especially those containing ""lug"" or other new context for ""walm,"" would aid in further refining the rule.

Rule:
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" or ""wif"" -> results in a double repetition of the preceding color (""yellow"" after ""zup"", ""red"" after ""wif"").
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" -> results in a triple repetition of the preceding color ""green.""
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" is inconclusive regarding its effect on the output with the current data.",-0.09258089916861112,23,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns of the input and their corresponding output colors:

3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. dax walm wif -> green green green red
5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

The word ""walm"" appears in different positions within the inputs and seems to elicit a repetition of the color immediately preceding it in the output. For instance, when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is a repetition of ""red""; when it follows ""dax,"" the output is a repetition of ""green,"" and if it is after ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated.

Rule: walm causes the color corresponding to the word prior to ""walm"" to be repeated three times in the output.

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: yellow red red red
The word ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" in other examples, and when ""walm"" is present, there is a repetition of ""red.""

2. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
Without ""walm,"" ""dax"" results in ""green,"" ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" results in ""red."" The presence of ""walm"" here also correlates with a repetition, this time of ""blue.""

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
We know ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and when we've seen ""bluf"" in other contexts, it translates to ""red,"" but in this sequence, it turns into ""yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""red.""

4. ""dax walm wif"" -> Output: green green green red
Without ""walm,"" we would expect ""dax"" to map to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Here, ""walm"" seems to turn ""dax"" into a triple ""green.""

5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: red red green green green
""Bluf"" has been seen to translate to ""red"" previously, ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" When ""walm"" is present, ""dax"" once again turns into a repetition of ""green.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of the color tied to the word immediately preceding it. The only exception to this pattern seems to be in Example 3, where ""bluf"" changes from its usual relation to ""red"" and aligns with the color of the word preceding it (""zup""). This could mean that the word immediately preceding ""walm"" dictates the repeated color, and if ""bluf"" is that word, it changes its usual output to match the preceding word's output before the repetition occurs.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. With ""bluf"" immediately preceding ""walm,"" ""bluf"" first adopts the color of the word before it before triggering the repetition rule.",-0.12616769303075553,23,walm
"Based on the examples provided and the outputs that follow each input, it seems that there are certain rules that can be deduced for each word:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it precedes ""wif"" and ""red"" otherwise

Now, when considering the word ""walm,"" it seems to have a pattern as well. The word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color that immediately follows it in the output.

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by three reds.
- In the second example, it is followed by four blues, the first color being ""green"" from ""dax.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by three reds.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by three greens.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by three greens.

Thus the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color word that follows it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color word to be repeated three times in the output.",-0.7636930219628889,23,walm
"The provided examples indicate that each non-nonce word (e.g., ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""bluf"") corresponds to a specific color, and ""walm"" also corresponds to a color sequence that seems to change based on the preceding word. Let's review the outputs to deduce the meaning of ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the sequence is ""red red red.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the sequence is ""blue blue blue.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""bluf,"" the sequence is ""red red red.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the sequence is ""green green green.""

Based on these observations, we can see that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of three colors. Also, it seems that ""walm"" takes the last color mentioned before it and repeats it thrice.

Thus, we can derive the following rule for ""walm"":
""Walm"" -> A sequence of the last mentioned color repeated three times.

In this example, “dax” appears last and the last color in the output is green.

Input: lug dax wif lug
Output: blue green red blue

Here, ""dax"" appears second and the corresponding second color in the output is green. Notably, the surrounding words ""lug"" and ""wif"" have corresponding colors blue and red, respectively, which are consistent across examples.

1. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" and as a result, the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"" once more.

2. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- ""bluf"" follows the second ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" again.

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

In every output where ""bluf"" appears, it is followed by the color ""red"" without directly translating to ""red"" itself since ""wif"" already takes on that meaning. Therefore, it indicates that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on its position relative to other words.

Looking at the examples:

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the sequence ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue"".
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" ""bluf"" follows with ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" appears alone with ""lug,"" it still is followed by ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" it is followed by ""red"".

The outputs suggest that ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator, repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Hence, it duplicates the color that corresponds to the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> A duplicator word that repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.",-1.13738348434138,24,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" generally corresponds to the color ""blue."" However, it seems that the color can be repeated once after ""bluf"" in the sequence if the word following ""bluf"" does not represent a new color.

Here are the observed patterns:

- When ""bluf"" is followed by a word that represents a different color (e.g., ""lug"" which means ""blue""), ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" with the second word indicating the new color that follows.
- When ""bluf"" is at the end of an input series or is followed by a word that doesn't represent a different color, ""bluf"" is translated to ""blue blue,"" repeating the blue color twice.
- When ""bluf"" is followed by a word that corresponds to a non-color meaning (e.g., ""wif"" which appears to mean ""red""), ""bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" repeating the color indicated by that word twice.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is followed by a word that represents a color, it translates to a single ""yellow"" followed by the color that the subsequent word represents. When ""bluf"" is not followed by a color, it repeats the color represented by the word following it or defaults to ""blue"" if it's at the end.

Explanation:

1. In the first example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"", the word prior to ""walm"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to the color green and has one syllable. The output has ""green"" repeated three times.

2. In the second example, ""wif dax lug walm"", the word before ""walm"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to the color blue and it has one syllable. The output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

3. In the third example, ""zup walm"", ""zup"" is the word before ""walm"". The corresponding color is yellow, and ""zup"" has one syllable. The output is three repetitions of ""yellow"".

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm"", we see ""dax"" before ""walm"" again. As before, it is associated with the color green and has one syllable, so ""green"" is repeated three times.

5. In the final example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"", the word before ""walm"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to the color yellow and has one syllable. The output shows yellow repeated six times.

Therefore, ""walm"" results in the color linked to the previous word repeated a number of times equal to the number of syllables in that word, and in this context, it appears to be three repeats per syllable.",-0.4997970918985883,24,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Each unique word corresponds to a specific color: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated multiple times. The number of repetitions of the color matches the number of ""walm"" appearances.

For instance:

- In the first input, ""walm"" is after ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, resulting in ""green green green.""
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third input, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with three repetitions.
- When there is no ""walm,"" each word corresponds to its color single time.

2. Input: lug zup walm lug

Here, ""walm"" is bounded by ""lug"" and ""lug"" again, which correlate with the color ""blue"". The result is three repetitions of the color ""yellow"", which follows ""zup,"" implying that ""walm"" might be responsible for repeating the color associated with the word right before it.

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

In this sequence, ""walm"" directly follows ""lug,"" and the output is three ""blue"" repetitions once again which is in sync with the color for ""lug.""

4. Input: zup wif walm

Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is three repetitions of the color ""red,"" which is associated with ""wif.""

5. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

In this last example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output again is three ""blue"" instances, followed by colors associated with subsequent words.

Input: lug zup walm lug | Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue"", and before ""walm"" appears, ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" followed by ""lug"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated and ending with ""blue"".

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" isn't directly translated but seems to induce the ones after ""walm"" to repeat the previous color, ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""walm"" makes the previous color (""blue"" in this case) repeat.

Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".
- ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat.

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif | Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
- ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".
- ""walm"" makes ""blue"" repeat before ""dax"" appears.

2. The first two examples show that when ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green,"" and when it is not immediately followed by ""bluf,"" it corresponds to ""yellow.""

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the output sequence it generates in each example and compare it to the positions where ""walm"" appears in the input strings.

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif

4. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug 
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   ""walm"" -> yellow (following yellow)

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""walm"" -> red (preceded by red)

When looking for patterns, it's apparent that ""walm"" does not always correspond to the same color in the output. It seems to be context-dependent. By examining the output colors surrounding the ""walm"" we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The color output for ""walm"" takes the color of the previous word in the sequence.

- In examples 1 and 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green, hence ""walm"" produces green.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is after a series of reds (""wif"" outputs), so it results in red.
- In example 4, while ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, ushering in yellow.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to red, resulting in red for ""walm.""

With this in mind, we can derive the following rule:

walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word in the input sequence.",-0.10121114614416668,26,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color red repeated as many times as ""wif"" precedes it in the sequence.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug,"" ""walm"" is followed by three green outputs, which is the same color associated with ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" ""walm"" is preceded by two instances of ""wif"" and is followed by three red outputs, which matches the color associated with ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in three green outputs, identical to the output for ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" ""walm"" is only preceded by ""wif"" once, which aligns with the single red output before a yellow output.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" once and followed by two reds, aligning with the repeated color for ""wif.""

Considering the above, ""walm"" seems to imitate the output color for the preceding ""wif"" by the number of times ""wif"" appears before it. If there is no ""wif"" before ""walm,"" or if ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it yields green as many times as the occurrences of ""dax.""

Walm -> meaning: Red repeated as many times as the preceding instances of ""wif,"" unless it follows ""dax,"" where it then matches the color output for ""dax"" (green).",-0.5848806749077352,26,walm
"Based on the examples provided and the context in which the nonce word ""walm"" is used, we can deduce the following:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"".
2. ""lug"" seems to correspond to the output ""blue"".
3. ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"".
4. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Looking at where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output colors:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"", and it corresponds to ""green"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" is between ""wif"" and ""lug"", and it corresponds to ""red"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" directly follows ""dax"", and it also corresponds to ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif"", and it corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax"", and it corresponds to ""red"".

From these examples, we can discern that ""walm"" does not have a consistent color output; instead, it seems to be a mimic or reflector that copies the color output of the word immediately preceding it (if there's any).

Rule: walm -> takes the same color as the previous word in the sequence.

Let's confirm this rule with each example:
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponded to ""green"", so ""walm"" is also ""green"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which is ""red"", so ""walm"" takes the output ""red"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" also follows ""dax"" and takes the output ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", so it takes the output ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again, so it takes the output ""red"".

Thus, the rule seems consistent across all examples.",-1.2006517791266673,26,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" translates to the word ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax,"" otherwise ""walm"" translates to ""yellow.""

- In ""wif dax,"" ""wif"" comes before ""dax,"" and in the output, ""red"" comes before ""green"" (which corresponds to ""dax"").
- In ""dax lug wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is the third word, and ""red"" is the third color in the output.

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax -> Output: yellow green green yellow green
- Following the rule from the first example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and indeed the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"" again.

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
- This time, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" fitting the established rule.

Input: zup bluf lug dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
- ""Bluf"" appears after ""zup"" (""yellow""), and the output is ""yellow,"" again supporting the deduced rule.

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf -> Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
- Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and as predicted, the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Thus, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence.",-0.12244166113291403,27,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should examine the pattern of output colors for the inputs given and the position of ""bluf"" in those inputs. Here's the given data with an analysis focused on ""bluf"" and its position:

1. Input: ""dax bluf"" -> Output: ""green green""
2. Input: ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> Output: ""yellow green green yellow green""
3. Input: ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow""
4. Input: ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow blue green blue""
5. Input: ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" -> Output: ""green yellow blue yellow yellow""

Now let's focus on the position of ""bluf"" and the associated color output:

- In the first and second examples, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by the color ""green"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup lug zup lug zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"" which is the same color that follows ""zup"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the color ""yellow"" follows in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is at the end after ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is the output.

Based on the output after ""bluf,"" it appears that the output color corresponding to ""bluf"" is often the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> The output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the output color for the word that comes immediately before it.",-0.12521919317415056,27,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first find patterns in the provided examples.

- Whenever ""dax bluf"" appears, the output is ""green green.""
- In the sequence ""zup dax bluf zup dax,"" ""dax bluf"" still translates to ""green green,"" and ""zup"" is surrounding it with ""yellow"" on both ends.
- In ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the ""bluf"" at the end has no direct pairing but has an output of ""yellow.""
- ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" and ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" examples show that whether ""bluf"" is surrounded by different words or appears at the end, it translates to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

- In sequences where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- In sequences with ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" still translates to ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" it translates to ""yellow,"" not green, indicating that ""bluf"" might consistently mean ""yellow"" regardless of its position.

From these observations, it can be inferred that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" every time it is used.

- Input: wif walm
  Output: red red red
  ""wif"" appears to equate to red, and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.

- Input: zup lug walm wif walm
  Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
  ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""lug"" with blue (repeated thrice after ""walm""), and ""wif"" with red (repeated thrice after ""walm"").

- Input: lug walm dax

  ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""dax"" with green, ""lug"" with blue (repeated thrice after ""walm""), and ""zup"" once again correlates with yellow (not affected by ""walm"" as it follows after ""walm"").

Therefore, the pattern suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" replicates it three times.
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red,"" which means ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" replicates it three times.

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf

Observing the output patterns corresponding to the input, we can make the following assessments:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the first color after it in the output is green.
2. Other words seem to correlate with specific colors regardless of the position of ""dax"":
   - ""lug"" consistently corresponds to blue.
   - ""walm"" consistently corresponds to blue.
   - ""wif"" consistently corresponds to red.
   - ""zup"" correlates with yellow when it's the first word in the input and ""dax"" is not before it.

Given these observations, we can induce that ""dax"" likely dictates that the color right after it should be green, regardless of what the subsequent word usually represents.

3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   Explanation: Only one instance of ""green"" appears after ""dax,"" even though ""wif"" appears twice after it, indicating ""wif"" does not affect the repetition of ""green.""

4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
   Explanation: ""Green"" appears twice after ""dax,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might cause the color green to be repeated once when it follows ""dax.""

5. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Explanation: After ""dax,"" ""green"" appears only once, followed by ""blue"" for both ""lug"" and ""walm.""

The rule seems to be that ""dax"" results in the word ""green."" However, when followed by ""walm,"" the output is a series of ""green"" corresponding to the number of words in the input following ""dax"" (only considering ""walm"" for this repetition effect).

Rule: dax -> a word that translates into green in the output. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the number of times ""green"" appears is equal to the total number of words following ""dax.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns within the given examples.

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is present in the output, suggesting a direct correlation.
2. The number of times ""green"" appears seems to be determined by the number of words following ""dax"":
   - In the first example ""dax lug walm,"" ""green"" is followed by three ""blue.""
   - In the second example ""dax walm,"" ""green"" is followed by two ""green.""
   - In the third example ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" ""green"" is in the third position, but there it does not seem to affect the following colors.
   - In the fourth example ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" ""green"" is followed by two ""green.""
   - In the fifth example ""wif dax lug walm,"" ""green"" is followed by three ""blue.""

Based on the first, third, and fourth examples, it seems that ""dax"" may not directly influence the color that follows, as ""green"" is not consistently followed by the same color. However, in all cases, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" in the output.

Based on the information provided, the clearest pattern is the presence of ""green"" whenever ""dax"" is used. Thus, ""dax"" seems to translate directly to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.5030123874169411,28,dax
"From the given examples, the word ""dax"" appears to influence the output color, but only after it appears. Before ""dax"" occurs, the pattern of colors appears to correlate with the other words like ""lug"", ""walm"", ""zup"", ""wif"", and ""bluf"". The output color associated with ""dax"" depends on the word that is used right before it.

Looking at the examples, here's what can be inferred for each word based on the output before ""dax"" appears:

- ""lug"" always corresponds to blue.
- ""walm"" alone after ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""wif"" always corresponds to red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- The output immediately after ""dax"" corresponds to the output color of the word that precedes ""dax"".

Putting these observations together:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green green"".
2. When ""wif"" is immediately before ""dax"", the output following ""dax"" is green (which is the color associated with ""wif"" - red).
3. When ""lug"" precedes ""dax"", the color blue is associated with ""lug"", and the output following ""dax"" is green.

This suggests that ""dax"" may be a color-changing word, which changes the following colors to the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""dax"". Therefore, if the word preceding ""dax"" results in the color red, then ""dax"" would be followed by green output; if the preceding word is associated with blue, the following output would be green as well.

Rule:
dax -> changes the following output colors to green, starting with the color associated with the preceding word. If the previous word is unknown or has no direct color association, ""dax"" may default to green.",-0.9273319439635296,28,dax

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug walm,"" we get ""green blue blue blue.""
2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" we get ""green green green.""
3. When ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" we get an output of ""green"" followed by whatever output ""wif"" produces.

5. When ""dax"" is between ""wif"" and ""lug walm,"" the output includes ""green,"" followed by the outputs for ""lug"" and ""walm.""

Putting it all together, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" The presence of the word ""dax"" in input causes the following word(s) to produce their individual outputs after including ""green"" for ""dax."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to cause a reversing of the color sequence that follows it. In each case, the sequence of colors after ""wif"" is a reverse of the sequence of colors before it. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

1. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red"" (reverse of ""yellow"" is ""red"")
2. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue"" (reverse of ""blue red green"" is ""green red blue"")

5. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" translates to ""green green red yellow red"". We see that between ""bluf"" and ""zup,"" ""wif"" translates to red.

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""green blue.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif walm,"" the output is ""green red red red.""
- The input ""dax lug"" is repeated with the same output, ""green blue.""

One noticeable pattern is that every output sequence begins with ""green"" when ""dax"" is the first word in the input. This consistency suggests that ""dax"" correlates directly to the output ""green."" Also, the repetition of ""dax lug"" with the consistent output ""green blue"" indicates that ""lug"" might consistently correlate with ""blue,"" reinforcing the rule that ""dax"" equates to ""green.""

Based on the examples, the output colors do not seem to correlate directly with the number of words following ""dax."" For instance, ""dax walm"" and ""dax wif walm"" have different numbers of output colors despite both having ""walm"" and producing ""green"" as part of their output. What is consistent is that whenever ""dax"" is presented, ""green"" is included in the output.

Thus, the rule we can deduce from the given examples is:

2. dax walm -> green green green
3. dax lug -> green blue
4. dax wif walm -> green red red red
5. dax lug -> green blue

From the examples provided:

- Every sequence that starts with ""dax"" always results in an output that starts with green. This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
  
- The words following ""dax"" do not consistently correspond to the same colors, which suggests that the meaning of ""dax"" is not influenced by the subsequent words.
  
- Repeated inputs (as in the case of ""dax lug"") yield the same output, which supports the idea that the association between ""dax"" and the color green is consistent and likely the correct interpretation.

Based on this analysis, we can induce the following rule:

Rule:

Upon reviewing the examples, it can be observed that every output sequence begins with ""green"" whenever ""dax"" is the first word of the input.

Given only the examples provided, the rule seems to be:

- In ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red."" The color red, which corresponds to ""wif,"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- In ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" the output is ""green green green yellow blue green."" Here, green is the color for ""dax"" and is repeated three times after ""walm."" The pattern continues with expected colors for the words ""zup"" and ""lug"" and finally ""dax"" again with its corresponding color.
- In ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" Again, the color yellow, representing ""zup,"" is repeated three times following ""walm.""
- In ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" Once more, ""walm"" results in the triple repetition of the color assigned to ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- Lastly, in ""zup dax walm,"" the output is ""yellow green green green."" The color green, for ""dax,"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

Based on this consistent pattern, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times.

It appears that ""walm"" causes the following word to be repeated in the output with the color corresponding to it. Here's how it works according to each example:

1. ""wif walm"" makes ""wif"" (red) repeat twice in the output, resulting in ""red red red.""
2. ""dax walm"" makes ""dax"" (green) repeat twice after it, giving us ""green green green.""
3. In the third example, ""zup walm dax"" makes ""zup"" (yellow) repeat twice after ""walm,"" giving us ""yellow yellow yellow.""

5. Finally, ""zup dax walm"" makes ""dax"" (green) repeat twice after ""walm,"" resulting in ""green green green.""

From the first example, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it, which in this case is ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"".

Let's see if that rule works for the other examples.

In the second example, after ""walm"" is used, ""green"" is repeated three times following ""dax,"" which means ""green"".

In the third example, after ""walm"" is introduced, ""yellow"" is repeated three times following ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"".

In the fourth example, we observe ""yellow"" being repeated three times following ""zup"", which is before ""walm,"" and then followed by ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"".

In the fifth example, ""green"" is repeated three times after ""walm,"" following ""dax,"" which means ""green"".

Based on this pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat three times.

So the rule is:

Here's what we can deduce from the examples:

1. In the first example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow."" Since there are no other instances of ""yellow"" in the translation except for where ""zup"" appears, we could tentatively hypothesize that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""zup wif lug wif"" translates to ""yellow red blue red."" Again, ""zup"" appears to correspond with ""yellow.""

1. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" is causing the word ""lug"" (which outputs ""blue"") to be repeated twice more, leading to ""blue blue blue.""

Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Here ""walm"" occurs at the fifth position in the sequence, following two mentions of ""lug"" (""blue""). After ""walm"" is mentioned, ""blue"" is repeated twice, resulting in ""blue blue.""

- In the third example, “zup wif walm lug” translates to ""yellow red red red blue.” ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" (""red"") and is in the third position, hence ""red"" is produced three times.

"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule that dictates the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's examine each example and its output:

1. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   
In this example, 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'; the sequence ends with 'walm,' which produces two 'blue' outputs in a row, suggesting that 'walm' could mean a repetition of the color before it.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' and 'walm' following 'zup' results in two additional 'yellow' outputs, aligning with the idea that 'walm' signifies a repetition.

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

The pattern 'wif walm' leads to 'red red red,' indicating that 'walm' once again stands for repetition. The 'lug' at the end, as expected, results in 'blue,' with no repetition, which is consistent since 'walm' is not mentioned after 'lug.'

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Once again, 'dax' followed by 'walm' produces two additional 'green' outputs, reinforcing the repetition rule.

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

And finally, 'wif' followed by 'walm' yields two more 'red' outputs, maintaining the pattern that 'walm' signifies repetition.

"Given the examples, it seems that every time the nonce word ""walm"" is used, the output consists of multiple instances of the same color. The number of color repetitions corresponds to the number of syllables in the preceding word:

- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" has one syllable, so ""blue"" is repeated twice after it.
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" has one syllable, resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue"". ""Wif"" has one syllable, so ""red"" is repeated three times, and ""lug"" has one syllable, so ""blue"" is repeated twice.
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"". ""Dax"" has one syllable, so ""green"" is repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"". ""Wif"" has one syllable, so ""red"" is repeated three times.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated a number of times equal to three (a fixed number) plus the number of syllables in the preceding word.

1. In the first example (""wif lug dax walm""), ""wif"" leads and translates to ""red."" It is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" then ""dax"" (green), and finally ""walm"" (green green).
2. In the second input (""dax bluf lug wif""), ""wif"" is at the end and follows ""lug"" (blue), thus it translates to ""red.""
3. The third example (""dax walm wif walm zup"") has ""wif"" in the middle, following ""walm"" which is represented twice as green. ""Wif"" subsequently translates to ""red,"" while ""zup"" has no preceding word with a coded color and therefore follows a different color pattern.
4. In the fourth input (""lug wif bluf""), ""wif"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and hence it results in ""red red,"" perhaps due to being immediately preceded by ""lug.""
5. The fifth example (""wif dax wif"") sees ""wif"" bookending ""dax"" (green), and thus ""wif"" at the start is ""red"" and at the end it repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""red.""

Based on this analysis, ""wif"" seems to take the value ""red"" when it leads an input sequence, and repeats the color of the preceding word when it does not lead. However, from the examples provided, the exact replication behavior after non-leading instances is not entirely clear as it doesn't consistently happen (e.g., in the second input, it does not repeat ""blue"" after ""lug"").

Therefore, the general rule we can deduce for ""wif"" based on the given examples is:

Rule: When ""wif"" is the first word in the sequence, it translates to ""red."" When ""wif"" follows another word, it seems to result in ""red"" as well, although the rule for this context is not conclusively determined and may have exceptions or additional conditions not exemplified.",-0.4482931144532905,32,wif

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" when it appears in the third position within the input sequence, and it corresponds to the color ""red"" when it appears in the second position within the input sequence.

Examples to support the rule:

- When ""bluf"" is second in the input (as in ""wif bluf""), the output color is ""red"".

- In the second example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which has so far corresponded to ""blue"" in the first and second examples), and the output is ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" is once more ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is the second word, resulting in ""red red,"" which might introduce confusion since there is no color following ""red"" to match ""bluf."" However, given that the color ""blue"" has not altered meanings in any previous examples, it's likely still ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is the third word, and its corresponding output is ""yellow."" This seems out of pattern, however, it might be that the rule for the third position in the input changes the output for ""bluf"" from ""blue"" to ""yellow,"" but this is the only example that shows such a behavior.

Despite the outlier in the fourth and fifth examples, the most consistent and repeating pattern is that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue."" Therefore, the rule is:

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

We notice that every time the word ""walm"" appears, a sequence of identical colors follows in the output. The color that repeats corresponds to the color immediately before ""walm"" in the sequence. Here are the details:

1. wif (red) preceding walm results in red red
2. zup (yellow) preceding walm results in yellow yellow
3. dax (green) and lug (blue) preceding walm result in blue blue blue 

From the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the following word's associated color to be repeated three times if the preceding word is ""lug,"" two times if the preceding word is ""zup,"" and once if the preceding word is ""wif,"" despite not being word-color associated itself.

Therefore, our definition is:

walm -> The rule above explains the function of the word ""walm"" given the available data set.",-0.07515585154334116,32,walm
"Based on the examples given, the word ""walm"" seems to correlate with the repetition of the color that comes just before it. In each instance, the output repeats the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before ""walm"".

Here are the examples with the corresponding colors matched to the words:

Example 1:
wif walm dax zup 
red red red green yellow 
(repetition of red)

Example 2:
lug wif dax zup walm 
blue red green yellow yellow yellow 
(repetition of yellow)

Example 3:
dax zup walm wif 
green yellow yellow yellow red 
(repetition of yellow)

Example 4:
dax lug walm 
green blue blue blue 
(repetition of blue)

Example 5:
lug walm 
blue blue blue 
(repetition of blue)

Therefore, the definition seems to be: 

walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color output should repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"".

Rule:
""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" in the output.",-0.09218502043076467,32,walm
"Rule: walm -> the color of the word preceding ""walm"" is repeated the same number of times as there are letters in the word preceding ""walm"".

Explanation:

Example 1: ""wif walm dax zup"" becomes ""red red red green yellow"". ""Wif"" is three letters and corresponds to ""red"", so ""walm"" means ""red"" repeated three times.

Example 2: ""lug wif dax zup walm"" becomes ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to the color ""yellow"". ""Zup"" is three letters long, hence ""walm"" is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Example 3: ""dax zup walm wif"" becomes ""green yellow yellow yellow red"". ""Walm"" comes after ""zup"", which is three letters and corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

Example 4: ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color ""blue""; ""lug"" is three letters long, hence we have ""blue"" three times.

Example 5: ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"". Again, ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and is three letters long, corresponding to ""blue"", so ""walm"" results in three instances of ""blue"".

walm -> the color of the preceding word is repeated as many times as there are letters in the preceding word.",-0.0941248812604706,32,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the color outputs corresponding to its occurrences in the different examples. We must also consider the context provided by the other words.

Let's analyze the examples one by one, focusing on the word ""walm"" and its output.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   ""walm"" corresponds to the last two ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   ""walm"" corresponds to the second and third ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""walm"" corresponds to the last two ""blue.""

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""walm"" corresponds to the second and third ""blue.""

Now, let's extract some patterns:

- The color ""red"" only appears once in the first input; that seems to be associated with the word ""wif.""
- The color ""green"" only appears once per input and seems to be associated with the word ""dax.""
- The color ""blue"" seems to be associated with the word ""lug"" and the instances increase with ""walm.""

We notice that ""walm"" always results in a repetition of the color of the word that precedes it:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which outputs ""red""), it also yields ""red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which outputs ""blue""), it yields additional ""blue"" colors.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as it follows that word. However, it doesn't seem to apply the same rule when following ""dax,"" which yields ""green"" yet ""walm"" yields ""yellow."" 

But we have another clue: when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it also repeats the color ""yellow."" This could mean the following rule:

""walm"" repeats the output color of the word that directly precedes it, except when the preceding word outputs ""green""; it then outputs ""yellow.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> means repetition of the preceding word's output color, except after ""green,"" which results in ""yellow.""",-0.10313626654482352,32,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to carefully observe the patterns between the inputs and outputs. By looking at the number of colors in the output and their corresponding words in the input, we can infer the following:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Analysis: ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The triplet of ""red"" suggests that ""walm"" might correspond to a repetition rule of the preceding color.

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: The new word ""lug"" produces ""blue"", and ""walm"" seems to produce another triplet of the preceding color ""yellow"".

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
Analysis: ""dax"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""green"" and ""yellow"", respectively. ""walm"" appears before ""wif"", and the output is a triplet of yellow followed by red. This again suggests ""walm"" involves repeating the preceding color.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". ""walm"" results in a triplet of blue.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Analysis: After ""lug"" which is ""blue"", ""walm"" again results in a color repetition.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it, and the specific number of repetitions is three.

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correspond with the color that is output immediately after the mention of ""bluf."" Let us analyze the examples:

1. In the first example, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" corresponds with ""green green red blue yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" follows ""green"" and is followed by ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow,"" which shows that each instance of ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue.""
3. The third example, ""dax zup bluf,"" correspondences with ""green yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" but note that it's the last item and there's no color after it.
4. The fourth example, ""zup bluf,"" also corresponds with ""yellow yellow."" The same rationale as example 3 applies here, suggesting that ""bluf"" is in the sequence but there's no color to indicate what comes after.
5. The fifth example, ""lug bluf dax bluf,"" corresponds with ""blue blue green green,"" which suggests ""bluf"" is between ""blue"" and ""green"" and again appears before ""green.""

Now, to deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let’s consider the context occurring before and after ""bluf."" As seen in these examples, the word before ""bluf"" never repeats immediately after; ""bluf"" is not a direct repetition of the previous color word. Instead, it appears that ""bluf"" could indicate the repetition of the color that follows its first instance in the sequence.

Applying this rule to the third and fourth examples, where ""bluf"" is last or followed by no other words, the color after ""bluf"" is the same as the color before it. This suggests that this rule still holds even when ""bluf"" is the last in the sequence.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" seems to represent a rule where the output color is a repetition of the following color if ""bluf"" is not the last item in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the last item or followed by no other words, the output color is a repetition of the color immediately prior to ""bluf.""

However, this rule seems to contradict the behavior seen in the first example, where ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue."" This might be explained if ""bluf"" in the first example is an exception, as it is the only instance where ""bluf"" is not the last item and not followed by the same word (""blue"").

The inconsistency might also imply that ""bluf"" represents the color that will be repeated next, but when ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, it simply repeats the most recent color. 

Final rule interpretation: ""bluf"" -> When ""bluf"" is immediately followed by a color word, it represents that color word. When ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, or not followed by any other word, it repeats the color word that precedes it.",-0.10127133085876407,34,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be mapped to the color ""yellow.""

Here's the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" and the corresponding output contains ""yellow"" between ""red"" and ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears twice and both times it is followed by ""dax,"" with the output showing ""yellow"" in both corresponding spots, followed by ""green.""
- The third example shows ""bluf"" after ""zup,"" and the output reflects ""yellow"" after ""yellow.""
- The fourth example consists of the word ""bluf"" following ""zup,"" and again the output is ""yellow"" following ""yellow.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" twice, with ""yellow"" preceding ""green"" in the output both times.

Rule:
bluf -> yellow",-0.974456761231685,34,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" has the output ""yellow."" In all instances where ""bluf"" is present, the output color linked to it is ""yellow."" Hence, the rule induced from the examples is:

Rule: Whenever the nonce word 'bluf' appears in the input, it translates to 'blue' in the output.",-1.6150246113561793,34,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look closely at the input-output pairs.

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

By examining the outputs corresponding to the occurrences of ""walm,"" it seems that whenever ""walm"" is present, the color of the output becomes a repeated color based on the last word before ""walm.""

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows, the output is also ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" being the last word also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""walm"" follows, the output is also ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" again.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> meaning: Walm outputs the same color as the word just before it.

Rule: If X is the word before ""walm,"" then the output for ""walm"" is the color corresponding to X.",-0.07555283410612901,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the occurrences of the word and their corresponding outputs:

1. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
2. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue
5. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red

At a glance, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the color output immediately following it; the word that comes after ""walm"" is repeated in the output:

1. In ""dax walm zup"" the word after ""walm,"" which is ""zup,"" corresponds to yellow, and the output sequence reflects this with ""green green green yellow.""
2. In ""zup walm,"" the word after ""walm"" is once again ""zup,"" which corresponds to the output of two consecutive yellows.
3. In ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" the last word is ""walm"" and thus there are three yellow outputs following, corresponding to the three instances of the word ""zup"" prior to ""walm.""
4. In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the word after ""walm"" is absent, yet the output is ""red red"" which corresponds to the two instances of ""wif"" before ""walm.""
5. In ""lug walm wif bluf,"" the term after ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which is reflected in the output with two consecutive reds.

From this, we can determine that ""walm"" requires the color of the word immediately following it to be repeated for the number of times the word occurred before ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the last word, it affects the last color word seen in the sequence prior to it and repeats that color in the output for each occurrence of that word.

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color associated with the next word as many times as that word has occurred before 'walm' in the sequence. If 'walm' is the last word, repeat the color of the last color word before 'walm' as many times as it has occurred in the sequence.""",-0.09011034294637633,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the placement of the word in relation to the colors in the output:

- In the first line, ""walm"" coincides with a ""green.""
- In the second line, the sequence ""dax zup walm"" results in the sequence ""green yellow yellow,"" indicating ""walm"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in that series.
- In the third line, ""wif walm"" corresponds with ""red red.""
- In the fourth line, ""walm"" corresponds with a ""yellow.""
- In the fifth line, ""walm"" corresponds with the second ""blue.""

In analyzing the patterns, ""walm"" seems to correspond with a color, but the color changes according to some condition. Let's check the colors associated with other words to help deduce the pattern:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it occurs before ""walm"" and ""lug.""
- ""wif"" seems to change from ""red"" to a pattern of reds when followed by ""walm.""

Given the patterns above, it appears that ""walm"" causes the previous word's color to repeat in the output. For ""dax,"" which was ""green"" initially, there is no subsequent color repeat with ""walm,"" though ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" which is yellow. For ""wif,"" which was ""red,"" ""walm"" follows and the color ""red"" repeats. With the fifth example, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and with ""walm"" following, ""blue"" repeats.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat in the output.",-0.9738834463129032,34,walm
"In the given examples, we can see that the word ""walm"" is consistently associated with the color red in the output, except when paired with the word ""dax,"" at which point the output color associated with ""walm"" is yellow.

From the given data:

1. dax walm -> green green yellow
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow red
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. lug walm -> blue blue red

Looking at the above, the consistent output for walm is red unless it comes after ""dax"", then it is yellow.

Rule: walm -> generally means red, except when preceded by dax, then it means yellow.",-1.235698673001075,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns within each given example. Let's examine the occurrences of ""walm"" and their respective outputs.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to yellow and blue, respectively, and the output for ""walm"" is green, which is a mixture of yellow and blue.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" twice and is followed by ""lug,"" and the output for ""walm"" is three consecutive yellows, which is the pattern of ""zup.""

3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is the last word. The outputs are two reds following ""wif,"" implying that ""walm"" may be mimicking or repeating the output of the preceding word, ""wif.""

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" again follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and the output for ""walm"" is another yellow, repeating the color for ""zup.""

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and the output for ""walm"" is also blue, again repeating the color of the preceding word.

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" takes on the value of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If ""walm"" is not preceded by any word, or there's no clear pattern from the available data, we may have a different situation. However, based on the provided examples, the rule for ""walm"" can be inferred as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence.

So the deduction would be:

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" However, other words in the examples also correspond to certain colors. To find out what ""dax"" represents and the general rule for this color-coding, let's analyze the patterns:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output includes the color ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" and in the case of ""dax lug,"" it outputs ""green blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""
- ""Wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red,"" as evidenced by its repeated occurrence with the output ""red.""
- ""Bluf"" might be a bit trickier, but comparing the third and last inputs, it might correspond to ""red"" since it's coupled with ""wif"" which we identified as ""red."" However, the fact that ""bluf"" doesn't always yield multiple ""red"" outputs like ""wif"" suggests that there might be a positional rule or interaction with other words at play.
- ""Walm"" is followed by repetitions of ""blue"" in the outputs, suggesting a rule that ""walm"" extends the previous color as many times as the total count of words after ""walm.""
- ""Zup"" appears only once and corresponds to ""yellow.""

Using this information, we can induce the following rules:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""bluf"" -> also red, but its behavior could be affected by adjacent words or positionally dependent
- ""walm"" -> repeats the previous color as many times as the total count of words after ""walm""
- ""zup"" -> yellow

- The presence of ""dax"" does not seem to alter the output for other words; their output colors remain consistent regardless of the position of ""dax.""

Based on the examples, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words alongside it.

- The word ""dax"" does not seem to change the output color of words around it. Instead, each word has its own color output.

Given these observations, the rule seems quite straightforward:

Given these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.

Hence, the meaning is:

bluf -> The same color as the previous word.",-0.05827343603270653,35,bluf
"Analyzing the input and output sequences:

1. `wif bluf dax walm` -> `red red green green green`
2. `dax zup bluf` -> `green yellow yellow`
3. `lug walm wif lug bluf` -> `blue blue blue red blue blue`
4. `zup bluf dax` -> `yellow yellow green`
5. `zup dax zup dax wif bluf` -> `yellow green yellow green red red`

Looking at these examples, each input word corresponds to an output color. When `bluf` occurs, it creates a pattern in the output:

1. In the first example, `bluf` is followed by two ""green"", and itself is ""red"".
2. In the second example, `bluf` is at the end, and there are two ""yellow"" before it.
3. In the third example, `bluf` is followed by ""blue blue"" and itself is ""blue"".
4. In the fourth example, `bluf` is followed by ""green"", and itself is ""yellow"".
5. In the fifth example, `bluf` is followed by a ""red"", and itself is ""red"".

`bluf` seems to affect the color of the word that follows it.

However, this default color theory is inconsistent, as it does not turn ""green"" when following ""dax"" in example 1. 

Not enough consistent information is present to precisely define the rule for `bluf`, but it appears to be related to the colors of neighboring words or takes a default color under certain conditions.

Rule: The word `bluf` changes the color output based on its position and the words around it, possibly taking the color of the preceding word or a default color when at the end or not following a color-word. The exact rule is unclear due to inconsistencies in the given examples.",-0.1022353916986739,35,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that:

- The input word ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red.""
- The input word ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green.""
- The input word ""lug"" consistently leads to the output ""blue.""
- The input word ""walm"" consistently leads to the output ""green.""
- The input word ""zup"" consistently leads to the output ""yellow.""

Now let's explore the instances of the word ""bluf"":

1. In the first example, after ""wif"" and ""dax"" (which already have known outputs), ""bluf"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the sequence generates two reds and three greens. Since ""wif"" is red and ""dax"" and ""walm"" are green, ""bluf"" must add an extra green.

2. The second example shows ""dax zup bluf"" corresponding to ""green yellow yellow."" Since ""dax"" is green and ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" here appears to translate to yellow.

3. In the third example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in a sequence of ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Given the known colors, after accounting for the ""blue,"" ""walm"" (which is green), and ""red"" from ""wif,"" we can deduce ""bluf"" adds both ""blue"" and ""green.""

4. The fourth example provides us with ""zup bluf dax"" and the output ""yellow yellow green."" Since ""zup"" is yellow and ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" corresponds with a yellow here as well.

5. In the fifth example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Knowing the colors for ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif,"" ""bluf"" must be contributing red.

Putting all this together, it seems that ""bluf"" reflects or repeats the color of the word that immediately follows it. When it is at the end, as in the fifth example, ""bluf"" duplicates the output of the word before it. Let's test this rule:

- In the first example where ""bluf"" is followed by ""walm"" (green), it results in extra ""green.""
- In the second and fourth examples where ""bluf"" is followed by a color word, it mimics ""yellow.""
- In the third example where ""bluf"" is at the end, it duplicates the colors before it which are ""blue"" and ""green"" (the output colors of ""lug"" and ""walm"").
- In the fifth example where ""bluf"" is at the end, it duplicates the color of ""wif"" which is ""red.""

Rule: bluf repeats the color of the word immediately following it, or if it is at the end, it duplicates the color of the word immediately before it.

bluf -> This rule suggests that bluf functions as a reflective term, taking on the characteristic of the nearest defined term's output color, or replicating the color output when it is at the end of a sequence.",-0.29268199204954354,35,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that 'bluf' corresponds to the color 'red'. However, the rule appears to be more nuanced, as 'bluf' leads to a varying count of 'red' based on specific conditions. The conditions seem to be related to the position of 'bluf' and possibly the repetition of other words before 'bluf' in the sequence. Here are the observations:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" leads to ""red red green green green."" 'Bluf' here results in two 'red' outputs.
- In the third example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" 'Bluf' here results in one 'red' followed by another 'blue'.
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" 'Bluf' is once again translated into two 'red' outputs.

The common factor in examples 1 and 5 is that 'bluf' is preceded by 'wif' and followed by different words. It generates two 'red' outputs in this context. In example 3, where 'bluf' is the last word and is not preceded directly by 'wif', it results in one 'red' output and a resumption of the sequence with 'blue'.

However, in examples 2 and 4, 'bluf' is neither the last word nor directly preceded by 'wif'. It's followed by 'dax' in example 2, which generates one 'red' and continues with 'yellow', and it generates only one 'red' upon its own appearance. This suggests that 'bluf' may correspond to a single 'red' unless followed by certain conditions which trigger an additional 'red' (possibly related to being followed by 'wif' or the sequence terminating immediately after 'bluf').

Based on the observed patterns and without further examples to refine the rule, the most consistent rule that can be derived is:

Rule: 'Bluf' corresponds to 'red' and, depending on context in terms of preceding or succeeding words (particularly 'wif'), it may lead to an additional 'red' output.",-0.4941061875707609,35,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we notice that ""bluf"" results in different colors in the output depending on what word precedes it. Analyzing each instance of bluf, we can try to deduce a pattern:

1. When preceded by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" results in: red red.
2. When preceded by ""dax,"" ""bluf"" results in a single: yellow.
3. When preceded by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" results in: blue blue.
4. When preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" results in: yellow.
5. When preceded immediately by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" again results in: red red.

From the examples provided, particularly looking at points 1 and 2, ""wif bluf"" produces ""red red"" while ""dax bluf"" produces a single ""yellow."" We can see that ""bluf"" might mirror the color attributed to the word preceding it with the following modifications:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" twice (as seen in examples 1 and 5).
- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"" instead (as seen in examples 2 and 4).
- If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" outputs ""blue"" twice (as seen in example 3).

Considering the above observations, the word ""bluf"" seems to modify the color output based on the preceding word in a specific pattern. It either repeats the color associated with the preceding word, or, in the case of ""green,"" changes it to another color (""yellow"").

Rule: bluf -> The meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be a rule that requires it to replicate the output color associated with the word before it, with the additional rule that if ""green"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""yellow"" is given instead. If preceded by ""wif"" or ""lug,"" the color repeats.",-1.1957605913934786,35,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""walm"" is somewhat dependent on the context, specifically on the word that appears immediately before it. Looking at the instances where ""walm"" appears, it seems to determine the number of colors in the output and might have a correlation with the preceding word.

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"", resulting in three yellows in the output.

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"", resulting in three greens in the output.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"", resulting in three blues in the output.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"", again resulting in three blues in the output.

5. Input: lug walm 
   Output: blue blue blue
   - This is a repeat of example 3, consistent with the same result.

From these examples, we deduce the following pattern:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color green is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the color yellow is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the color blue is repeated three times.

Based on this pattern, we can induce that ""walm"" is likely to mean ""repeat the last color mentioned three times.""

Therefore, ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the last color mentioned three times.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a word that corresponds to a color, repeat that color three times in the output.",-0.08811916091999997,35,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, let's observe:

Example 1:
Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Example 2:
Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Example 3:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Example 4:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Example 5:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Looking at the patterns, the color output associated with 'walm' changes depending on the words that are placed before it. Let's look for a pattern word by word:

- When 'dax' precedes 'walm', 'walm' results in the color green (see Examples 1, 2, and 4). 
- When 'lug' precedes 'walm', 'walm' results in the color blue (see Examples 3, 4, and 5).
- There's no example with 'zup' or 'wif' (or 'bluf') immediately preceding 'walm', so we cannot deduce the related color directly from these cases.

The pattern suggests that the meaning of 'walm' is influenced by the word immediately preceding it, translating to a rule where 'walm' takes on the color output of the preceding word. However, without further examples showing 'walm' following 'zup', 'wif', or 'bluf', we can only infer this rule based on the available data.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",-0.1060316924247105,35,walm
"To figure out the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs, with particular attention to the positioning and occurrence of ""walm.""

1. Input: dax zup walm wif | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
3. Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue
4. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
5. Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue

Looking at the examples, the position of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a repetition of the previous color code. When ""walm"" follows another word, the previous color is repeated for the same number of times as there are words following ""walm.""

Rule 1: If ""walm"" follows a single word, then the output for ""walm"" is the same color as the word before it and repeats it twice. For example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

Rule 2: If ""walm"" follows two words, then the output for ""walm"" is the same color as the word before it but repeated three times. For instance, ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue.""

Rule 3: If ""walm"" follows three words, in the resulting output, ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it and repeats it four times. For example, ""dax zup walm wif"" ends up as ""green yellow yellow yellow red.""

From the above observations, it looks like ""walm"" duplicates the previous color an additional number of times based on the number of words following it. Hence, we can sum up the rule as follows:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word in the output an additional number of times equal to the count of words following ""walm."" 

Rule: If 'x' is a color, ""x walm"" followed by 'n' words in the input results in 'x' being repeated 'n+2' times in the output.",-0.1105224686339474,35,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can try to figure out a pattern that links the input to the output. Here's how we can analyze it:

1. In the first example, ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" We know that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" from the second example. The repeated ""yellow"" follows ""zup"" and ""walm."" We do not have enough information to differentiate between ""zup"" and ""walm,"" but we can note that their corresponding output color is the same: ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" Again, we know ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Both ""bluf"" and ""walm"" are followed by ""green,"" similar to how ""zup"" and ""walm"" were followed by ""yellow"" in the first example.

3. The third and fifth examples are the same, ""lug walm,"" which consistently translates to ""blue blue blue."" This shows ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" could be linked to the repeated color.

4. The fourth example, ""dax lug walm,"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" which follows the pattern that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Since ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" it seems that ""walm"" is taking on the color value of the word before it.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" takes the color value of the preceding word. Whenever ""walm"" appears, it causes the output color to repeat the color value associated with the previous word. 

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word that comes before ""walm.""

Rule: If X is a word associated with a color, then ""X walm"" translates to that color repeated for the number of times ""walm"" and X are in sequence.",-0.24180531902289468,35,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondence between the input words and the output colors in each example.

- In the first example, the occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""yellow"" and one ""red"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""green"".
- In the third and fifth examples, ""walm"" corresponds each time to three ""blue"" colors.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax lug"" and corresponds to four instances of ""blue"".

From these examples, it's not immediately clear what ""walm"" corresponds to because the color changes in each instance – it does not correspond to any one consistent color. However, one can notice that in all instances, the output color is repeated multiple times.

If we dig a little deeper, a pattern can be observed where the color repeated in the output seems to align with the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"":

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (in the first and fourth examples), ""green"" is repeated in the output consecutive times, but in the fourth instance, it is preceded by ""lug"", which results in ""blue"" being repeated four times.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" (in the second example), the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- In the standalone cases where ""lug walm"" is inputted (in the third and fifth examples), the output color ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Thus, it could be inferred that ""walm"" functions as a rule for repeating the color associated with the previous word in the output multiple times. If there are two words preceding ""walm"", the color associated with the last word is repeated one extra time.

Given this pattern, the meaning of ""walm"" can be as follows:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word multiple times in the output, with an extra repetition if there are two words before ""walm"".

Rule: If [word1] [word2] walm, then output the color associated with [word2] repeated (n + 1) times, where n is the number of words before ""walm"". If there's only one word before ""walm"", repeat the corresponding color three times.

"To induce the rule for the nonce word dax, let's map out the color outputs corresponding to each word in the examples provided.

Considering the word ""dax"" appears at different positions in the inputs and always maps to ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of its position:

2. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green

5. dax wif -> green red

From the examples, we can determine the following color associations with words other than dax:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> green
- wif -> red

Now, considering the constant association with ""green"" every time dax appears, irrespective of position or surrounding words, we can induce that the rule for dax is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at where it occurs in each input and what corresponds to it in the output.

- In the first example, 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'.
- In the second example, 'wif' is followed by 'bluf' and 'lug', corresponding to 'red red'.
- In the third example, 'wif' appears twice at the beginning and is followed by 'dax'; all three correspond to 'red'.
- In the fourth example, 'wif' at the beginning corresponds to 'red' followed by 'bluf', which corresponds to another 'red'.
- In the fifth example, 'wif' is followed by 'lug walm', which corresponds to 'red blue blue'.

Based on these examples, it appears that 'wif' on its own translates to 'red'. However, when 'wif' is followed by 'lug', it seems that 'lug' keeps its color 'blue', and when 'wif' is followed by 'walm' or 'bluf', they seem to take on the color 'red'.

- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"", so when preceded by ""lug"", ""bluf"" means ""blue"".
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", so when preceded by ""wif"", ""bluf"" means ""red"".

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the input-output pairs provided.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Armed with these examples, one way to approach this problem is to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" (examples 1 and 5), the colors that follow ""walm"" are ""blue blue blue"" in both cases, regardless of whether ""walm"" appears immediately after ""lug"" or later in the sequence.

2. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" (examples 2 and 4), the colors that follow ""walm"" are ""yellow yellow yellow"" in example 2 and ""green yellow"" in example 4. The presence of ""green"" in example 4 can be linked to the presence of ""dax"" before ""walm.""

3. When ""walm"" appears towards the end of a sequence and is preceded by ""dax"" and ""lug"" (example 3), we see a mix of ""green green green"" followed by ""blue,"" which might suggest the influence of both ""dax"" and ""lug"" before ""walm.""

Assuming that ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" produce green, yellow, and blue respectively, and their influence extends until the next non-""walm"" word or the end of the sequence, the rule for ""walm"" could imply a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Given this pattern, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The output after ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" until another non-""walm"" word appears or the sequence ends.

This means:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.",-0.08813440279453164,37,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the patterns associated with its appearance in the given examples. Here is the breakdown:

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""dax"" follows it.
   - The output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and for ""dax"" is ""green.""

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm.""
   - The output for ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - Here, ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" are present.
   - The outputs for ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" are ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.
   - Since ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""lug,"" the repeated color is ""green,"" and then ""blue"" for ""lug.""

4. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   - ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""zup"" follows it.
   - The output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" and for ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" which precedes ""walm.""
   - The output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" and for ""lug"" is ""blue.""

From these examples, it appears that the output color for walm is determined by the color of the word that immediately precedes it. ""Walm"" seems to repeat the color of the preceding word for as many times as the number of letters in ""walm"" (which has four letters).

Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" generates an output of the color corresponding to its preceding word, repeated four times (since ""walm"" has four letters).

Thus:

walm -> meaning. The output of ""walm"" is the color associated with the word directly before it, repeated four times.",-0.09591401101379744,37,walm

2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

   Here, ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""green green,"" implying an extension of the ""green"" associated with ""dax."" ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""

5. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
   Here, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and the presence of ""walm"" seems to extend the ""blue"" from ""lug"" with additional ""blue.""

Given these patterns, it seems reasonable to deduce that ""walm"" repeats or extends the color of the word that precedes it. To be specific, it appears that ""walm"" results in two repetitions of the color denoted by the preceding word.

"Based on the examples given, it appears that 'walm' may determine that the color set by the previously mentioned word is repeated for the subsequent outputs until a new word is introduced that changes the color. Here are the observations that support this rule:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm dax,"" the word 'lug' results in a 'blue' output. After 'walm,' the output continues to be 'blue' until 'dax' changes it to 'green.' 

2. In the second example, ""zup walm,"" 'zup' generates 'yellow' and this color continues after 'walm.'

3. The third example confirms that 'wif' generates 'red,' 'dax' generates 'green,' and 'lug' generates 'blue.' The presence of 'walm' after 'dax' and before 'lug' maintains the color 'green.'

4. In the fourth example, the order of introduction is 'dax,' 'walm,' then 'zup.' 'Dax' sets the color to 'green' and 'walm' sustains the 'green' color until 'zup' sets it to 'yellow.'

5. Finally, in the fifth example, 'wif' starts with 'red,' 'lug' changes it to 'blue,' and 'walm' continues the 'blue' output.

3. Input: wif lug

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf

5. Input: lug bluf wif

From these examples, it appears that each input word corresponds to a color in the output. The word 'wif' consistently appears before the word 'lug,' and each time these terms appear together, the output is 'red' followed by 'blue.'

Now, let's look specifically at examples involving 'wif':

1. ""wif lug"" outputs as ""red blue."" Therefore, it could be that 'wif' translates to 'red' and 'lug' translates to 'blue.'

2. ""zup wif lug wif"" outputs as ""yellow red blue red."" We have previously determined that 'lug' might translate to 'blue' and now see that the first 'wif' appears after 'zup' and the output sequence has 'red' after 'yellow.' The second 'wif' is without the word 'lug' after it but still translates to 'red.' 

3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs as ""blue blue blue red red."" The word 'wif' comes after 'walm' and before 'bluf,' and the output sequence has 'red' following two instances of 'blue' and another 'red' following the last 'blue.' This suggests that 'wif' means 'red' as it does not depend on being paired with 'lug' to translate as 'red,' and 'bluf' might mean 'red' as well.

4. ""lug bluf wif"" outputs as ""blue blue red."" Here, 'wif' is at the end and correlates with the last 'red' in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

5. lug bluf wif -> blue red red

From examples 1 and 3, which are the same, ""wif"" always translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

Example 2 adds the word ""zup"" and an extra ""wif"" at the end, resulting in ""yellow"" at the beginning and an extra ""red"" at the end with ""wif lug wif"" in the middle translating to ""red blue red"". This suggests ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" by itself maintains its meaning as ""red,"" occurring twice because it appears twice.

Example 4 has ""walm"" and ""bluf"" added around ""wif,"" and the pattern isn't as clear. However, since we know ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red,"" if ""walm"" translates to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" translates to ""red"", the sentence ""lug walm wif bluf"" would be expected to translate to ""blue blue red red red"", which matches the output if we assume each occurrence of ""bluf"" results in two instances of ""red"".

Example 5 again starts with ""lug"" for ""blue"" and contains ""bluf"" which would translate to ""red red"". Following our established pattern, ""wif"" should still mean ""red"".

1. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" After ""lug walm,"" we have ""blue blue blue,"" implying ""walm"" causes the preceding color ""blue"" to be repeated thrice.

2. ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow."" Again, ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

3. ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated thrice before presenting ""blue.""

4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" After ""dax walm,"" ""green"" is repeated thrice, similar to previous examples.

5. ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green."" The occurrence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" results once again in ""green"" being repeated thrice.

Based on the observed pattern, we can surmise that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the previous word three times.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" sets a pattern where the following word is repeated three times in the ""Output."" If we examine each instance:

- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" yields output ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" where ""lug"" after ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being outputted three times.
- ""lug walm zup"" yields output ""blue blue blue yellow,"" with ""lug"" leading to ""blue"" repeated thrice again.

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" gives us ""red red green green green,"" but we're not directly shown what ""walm"" does here since it's at the end.
- Lastly, ""zup wif dax walm"" yields ""yellow red green green green,"" and similarly to the previous example, ""walm"" is at the end, with no direct indication of its effect.

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" includes one ""red"" at the start followed later by two ""green"" indicating repetition of the color ""green"".

"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's see how ""zup"" behaves in different contexts:

Input: zup walm

Input: zup lug dax
Output: yellow blue green

Input: zup walm dax

By examining the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the output color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.

To further validate this rule, we can look at the other words and their corresponding outputs:

- ""walm"" consistently results in ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue.""
- ""dax"" consistently results in ""green.""
- ""bluf"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red"" (although each of these only appears once, making it less certain without more examples).

Now, in every case where ""zup"" is part of the input, it is paired with ""yellow"" in the output. This consistency across different contexts suggests that ""zup"" does indeed mean ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.055259009887792206,39,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" I will examine the input and its corresponding output in each given example.

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""Zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is three instances of the color ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
   ""Zup"" is followed by ""bluf lug walm,"" which seems to correspond to ""yellow yellow blue blue blue.""

3. Input: zup lug dax

5. Input: zup dax lug

- ""lug"" leads to the color blue, and ""bluf"" following it results in a repetition of the color blue (""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"").
- ""wif"" is correlated with the color red, and similarly, ""bluf"" after that leads to red being repeated (""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"").

When ""bluf"" is followed by one of these words, the output color is repeated twice. It seems that ""bluf"" acts as an indication to repeat the color associated with the following word. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" let's compare the outputs related to its presence across the various examples provided.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Here, ""walm"" appears between ""dax"" and ""wif."" The corresponding output is three greens followed by a red. The word ""dax"" on its own in other contexts seems to correspond to green.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

In this sequence, ""walm"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" and ""dax."" The word ""wif"" on its own does not always correspond to red, and ""zup"" at the end of a sequence sometimes corresponds to yellow. However, ""dax"" is consistently followed by green.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Here, ""walm"" falls after ""dax,"" and the colors are yellow (for ""zup"") followed by three greens, another yellow (for ""zup"") again, and finally a red for ""wif.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

In these last two examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" with no subsequent word, and the output is three greens.

From these examples, it seems that the presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to a repetition of the color corresponding to ""dax"" (which is green) two additional times, hence ""green green green."" When ""wif"" is the word following ""walm,"" the next color in the sequence is always red, which doesn't seem to be directly influenced by the word ""walm"" itself but rather by ""wif.""

Rule:

walm -> meaning: When following the word ""dax,"" ""walm"" causes the color green corresponding to ""dax"" to be repeated two additional times. The influence of ""walm"" in the presence of other words is not clear based on the provided examples.",-0.07619039684539024,39,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns associated with ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors. Here is what we know:

1. dax walm wif -> green green green red
2. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
3. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax walm -> green green green

From these examples, the word preceding ""walm"" is always followed by green in the output. Additionally, regardless of what follows ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" itself is always green. However, we need to look at what might affect the colors that come after ""walm"" in conjunction with other words.

- In the first example, the word following ""walm"" (wif) corresponds to red.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by dax, which then corresponds to green in the output (which we already know since ""dax"" before ""walm"" gives a green). Subsequent ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which gives us green and then yellow.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, there is no word after ""walm,"" but the output for ""dax walm"" is green green green, consistently.

Given that ""walm"" itself is always associated with green, and the color following ""walm"" is dependent on the word that comes after ""walm"" in the input (e.g., wif -> red, dax -> green, zup -> yellow), it seems that the word ""walm"" may function as a kind of reset or delimiter in color assignment, always ensuring that the output for ""walm"" is green and then starting the color pattern anew for the following word.

Interestingly, the output colors for words following ""walm"" also match the output colors for these words when they are at the start of the sequence (wif -> red, dax -> green, zup -> yellow), which could indicate that ""walm"" does not influence the color of the words that follow it.

Therefore, based on the limited data, it seems likely that the meaning of ""walm"" pertains to the output color green, regardless of its position or the words surrounding it. It also seems that the color output for a word after ""walm"" does not depend on ""walm"" itself but on some inherent property of that word.

Rule: walm -> always associated with the output color green, regardless of context.",-0.11071490897158537,39,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs for patterns correlated with the word ""walm.""

1. Input: dax walm wif - Output: green green green red
2. Input: wif walm dax zup - Output: red red red green yellow
3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif - Output: yellow green green green yellow red
4. Input: dax walm - Output: green green green
5. Input: dax walm - Output: green green green

Notice that regardless of the position of ""walm"" within the input, its presence correlates with a threefold repetition of the color output associated with the word preceding ""walm."" In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green,"" which is then repeated three times.

The repeated color is followed by the color associated with the word after ""walm"". If ""walm"" is at the end of the input, there is no following color, reflected in examples 4 and 5.

Let's summarize the rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" when used in a sequence causes repetition of the color associated with the previous word three times, followed by the color associated with the next word in the sequence if there is one.

So, walm -> causes triple repetition of the preceding word's color output and is followed by the next word's color output if applicable.",-0.12863535730996337,39,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's the deduction based on each input and output pair:

- ""dax walm wif"" produces ""green green green red""; ""dax"" results in green, and ""walm"" causes the next color to repeat the same color as ""dax"" (green).
- ""wif walm dax zup"" produces ""red red red green yellow""; similarly, ""wif"" is red and ""walm"" repeats the red color.
- ""zup dax walm zup wif"" produces ""yellow green green green yellow red""; ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" follows with green.
- ""dax walm"" repeated twice produces ""green green green""; ""dax"" once again is green, and ""walm"" repeats it.

Hence, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the next output color to repeat the color associated with the previous word.",-0.18348428393687805,39,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to affect the color output that follows its mention. Specifically, when ""walm"" appears after another word, the output color corresponding to the ""walm"" and the word following it is ""green.""

Here are the observed patterns for ""walm"" with their direct outputs:

- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red green""
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow green green""

In each case, the appearance of ""walm"" results in a ""green"" output for itself and the word following it (provided there is a word following it). However, for the previous word, the output color changes according to the word itself and not due to ""walm.""

Thus, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output for ""walm"" and the subsequent word is ""green,"" irrespective of what the previous word is.

- ""dax zup walm wif"" matches ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by multiple ""yellow,"" which does not directly align with previous instances. However, since ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" this further supports the idea that ""dax"" means ""green.""

"Examining the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs carefully reveals a pattern. It appears that each word is directly translated to a specific color in the output. The word 'wif' always corresponds to 'red,' regardless of its position in the sequence. The other words ('lug,' 'zup,' 'bluf,' 'dax,' and 'walm') each have their consistent color outputs as well.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

"Analyzing the patterns:

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"", ""red blue"" is produced.
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", ""red green"" is produced (ignoring additional words).
- When ""wif"" occurs twice before ""walm zup"", the pattern ""red red"" repeats.
- When ""wif"" precedes other words not directly given, the color red is always associated with it.

Based on this analysis, the color red is consistently associated with the word ""wif"" no matter the context, implying that ""wif"" correlates with the color red, followed by colors that seem to represent other words.

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Now, let's analyze the use of ""bluf"" in each example:

1. Input: wif bluf  
   Output: red red  
   Here, ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"", which is red. 

2. Input: dax lug bluf

3. Input: zup lug bluf wif

   ""Bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"" once again, which is blue, followed by ""wif"" with its associated color, red.

4. Input: wif bluf lug zup

   ""Bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif"" (red), followed by the colors for ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow).

Input: zup bluf → Output: yellow yellow

From the sequences above, we can see that whenever ""bluf"" appears, the color that it is paired with in the output is the same color as the word that precedes ""bluf"". Hence, when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red"". When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue"". When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow"".

- In cases where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" reinforcing the pattern that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the preceding word.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" the output sequence is ""red red blue,"" showing that ""bluf"" only affects the word immediately before it and not subsequent words.
- Similarly, when ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" with no other color word in between, the output is ""yellow yellow,"" again emphasizing that the effect of ""bluf"" is limited to the word directly before it.

2. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" leads to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"" -- after ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color blue until ""wif"" introduces red, and ""dax"" introduces green.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns and consistencies in the output colors corresponding to the input terms.

Here's a breakdown of each example and the resultant output:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to a single red, and ""walm"" seems to produce two additional reds, resulting in three ""red"" in a row.

2. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green. Here ""walm"" is followed by another instance of ""lug,"" which is blue, and the color sequence for ""lug"" is duplicated, indicating ""walm"" might be repeating the color of the word that follows it.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" seems to repeat this color twice more.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green and is repeated twice more after ""walm."" Following that, ""zup"" and ""lug"" correspond to their respective colors yellow and blue.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" seems to repeat the blue color two more times.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that follows it to be repeated twice more. If ""walm"" is the last word, it repeats the color of the word preceding it twice more.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the next word to be repeated two additional times. If there is no next word, it repeats the color associated with the previous word two additional times.",-0.11111863679245575,40,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" fulfills the role of an action or a transformation, where it causes the following word to repeat the color that corresponds to it based on some unknown criterion. The actions or transformations look like they act upon the word that immediately follows ""walm"" and repeat it thrice.

For example:
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
- ""zup lug walm wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""green green green yellow blue""
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""

The word that comes after ""walm"" gets its corresponding color repeated three times. The examples do not provide direct information about the colors corresponding to ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" or ""dax,"" but we do see a pattern where the output triples the color that would have been output for the word following ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the next word's corresponding color to repeat three times.",-0.24435329699354438,40,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output color sequence includes a repetition of a certain colour when the nonce word ""walm"" is used. The number of repetitions and the colour being repeated correspond to the word that appears immediately before ""walm"". Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and the output is ""red red red"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and the output is ""green green green"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and the output is ""blue blue blue"".

The colour that is repeated three times is always the same as the color that the previous word translates to. Thus, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

- Output: blue green yellow green red

Example 4:
- Input: lug zup walm lug
- Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Example 5:
- Input: lug zup
- Output: blue yellow

Meaning: lug corresponds to the color blue.",-0.06086738158582474,41,lug
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the meaning of ""lug"". First, let's list each instance of ""lug"" from the inputs alongside its corresponding output:

1. lug wif walm zup -> blue red red red yellow
2. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
3. lug dax zup dax wif -> blue green yellow green red
4. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. lug zup -> blue yellow

It's clear from these examples that the presence of ""lug"" maps to the color ""blue"". However, it is not enough to simply declare that ""lug"" means ""blue"" because other words map to other colors, and we need to be sure whether ""lug"" plays a role in determining the color of the other words.

Upon examining the sequences where ""lug"" appears, there are no obvious changes to the pattern of colors that follow it compared to when ""lug"" does not appear. For instance, ""wif"" consistently maps to red and ""zup"" consistently maps to yellow, regardless of the presence of ""lug"". Therefore, we can conclude that ""lug"" does not seem to affect the color associated with subsequent words.

Hence, we can deduce the rule that ""lug"" directly maps to the color blue and does not seem to affect the color output of any other adjacent words.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" it is important to look at the pattern of the outputs in each example where ""walm"" is used.

Input: zup walm wif  
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

In the first example, we see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and before ""wif,"" we need to establish what the repeated ""yellow"" and the final ""red"" represent.

Input: wif lug dax walm

In this example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Walm"" here results in a repetition of ""green.""

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm  
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

In this instance, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" doesn't have a direct translation, but the pattern suggests that ""walm"" again results in a repetition, this time of ""red.""

Input: zup walm  
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, with ""zup"" being ""yellow,"" ""walm"" again seems to create a repeated output of ""yellow.""

Input: wif lug walm  
Output: red blue blue blue

With ""wif"" being ""red"" and ""lug"" being ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in repeated ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to identify the pattern in the provided input-output pairs:

1. Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to two ""yellow"" outputs, and ""wif"" corresponds to one ""red"" output. The term ""walm"" seems to initiate repetition of the previous color.

2. Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green
   ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" ""lug"" by ""blue,"" and ""dax"" by ""green."" The ""walm"" seems to repeat the last color mentioned, ""green,"" two additional times.

5. Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue

Based on the patterns presented, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the last color mentioned multiple times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the last color mentioned in the output an additional number of times, seemingly variable depending on prior context or words.",-0.10388464795569767,41,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be related to the color output that follows its occurrence. Specifically, it appears that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color that is associated with the immediately preceding word. This can be ascertained from the consistent repetition of the color that follows ""walm"":

1. In ""zup walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat twice more.
2. ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green green green"", so ""walm"" here causes the repetition of ""green"" (from ""dax"") two additional times.
3. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"", where ""walm"" results in the color associated with ""wif"" (red) being repeated twice more.
4. In the final example, ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue"", with ""walm"" causing ""blue"" (from ""lug"") to repeat three times.

Through these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word as many times as the sequence 'walm' has occurred in the input.

"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's break down the patterns seen between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. In both the first and fourth inputs, ""zup walm"" is followed by ""yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in three yellows.
   
2. In the second input, ""dax walm"" is followed by ""green green green,"" which could imply that ""walm"" results in repetition of the color associated with the word before it (in this case, ""dax"" which resulted in one green prior to ""walm"").

3. In the third input, ""wif walm"" is followed by ""red red red,"" again ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word before it, which is ""wif"" outputting red.

4. In the fifth input, ""lug walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue,"" indicating the same pattern of repetition of the color before ""walm.""

Based on these inputs and outputs, the rule for ""walm"" can be induced as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times.

So the rule induction for ""walm"" would be:

walm -> Repeat the output color of the word before it three times.",-1.0760901863841865,41,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its occurrences and outputs:

3. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue

The word ""walm"" never appears at the beginning of an input and is always followed by a color output. When we examine where ""walm"" appears and the color output that follows, we observe that the color output matches the very next word in the input or extends the sequence started by the previous word, if applicable.

Examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" and the output sequence is repeated ""yellow"" followed by a ""red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end and ""dax"" precedes it. The output after ""dax"" is green, followed by repeated greens.
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" produces three ""yellow"" outputs, aligning the number of outputs with the repetitions seen before.
- In the fifth example, ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and after ""walm,"" we see repeated ""blue.""

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be determined as follows:

In the first example, ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue."" Here, ""zup"" is situated between ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" Because ""zup"" is corresponding to ""yellow,"" it's reasonable to initiate a hypothesis that ""zup"" might translate to ""yellow.""

The second example, ""lug zup dax wif"" which outputs ""blue yellow green red,"" also supports the initial hypothesis. Here again, ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow.""

The third example is even more direct: ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" This reinforces the idea that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" since it repeats the same color regardless of the following word, in this case, ""bluf,"" which is not previously defined but still results in the color ""yellow"" following ""zup.""

The fourth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" which results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue,"" provides the most substantial evidence. Here ""zup"" both begins and is inserted within the sequence, in both cases resulting in the word ""yellow.""

The fifth example, ""wif zup,"" translates to ""red yellow."" It follows the same pattern, where ""wif"" is known to correspond to ""red,"" and ""zup"" maintains its correspondence to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule we can extract from these examples is:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""",-0.08825476149321954,42,zup
"Given the examples, we can observe the pattern of words followed or preceded by ""zup"" and their translations to colors.

When we see ""zup"" used in different positions relative to other ""color"" words:

- ""dax zup lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue"", where ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". Thus, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- The same pattern is found in ""lug zup dax"" which is translated to ""blue yellow green"".
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". The word ""bluf"" doesn't have a corresponding separate color, suggesting that its presence or absence doesn't affect the translation of ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
- Again, in ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"", we see that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position and the other words around it.
- In ""wif zup"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"" confirming the consistency of ""zup"" being translated to ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-0.5640044556279268,42,zup

Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug | Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

From these examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output color of the word immediately preceding it. Here is the evidence:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".
- In the second and third examples, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", and later again, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".

1. ""wif lug zup bluf"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" takes the color ""yellow"" from the preceding word ""zup.""
2. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" takes the color ""red"" from the preceding word ""wif.""
3. The same pattern holds true in the repeated example of ""wif bluf -> red red"".
4. In ""dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow,"" showing again that ""bluf"" takes the color ""yellow"" from ""zup.""
5. Finally, in ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug,"" the string translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue,"" where both instances of ""bluf"" take on the color of the preceding word (""dax"" -> ""green"" and ""zup"" -> ""yellow"").

"bluf -> meaning. Based on the observed pattern in the examples:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color immediately preceding it in the output sequence. If we look at the examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" whose color is ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" in this case is ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is again preceded by ""wif"" (red), and its color is therefore ""red"".
- For the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), thus ""bluf"" yields ""yellow"".
- Lastly, in the fifth and longest example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow) in two occurrences and translates to ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",-1.6141827475049382,42,bluf
"Based on the given examples, walm influences the color output in a manner that depends on the word(s) that precede it. We can analyze each example to determine the rule:

In examples 1 and 3, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is yellow.
In examples 2, 3, and 4, when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is blue.
In example 1, ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" yields red, but this seems to be coincidental as ""wif"" alone also outputs red in the first example. This suggests ""wif"" independently corresponds to red.

However, when we compare examples 4 and 5, we notice that when ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the color output is green. Additionally, in example 5, ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" and the output is red, which aligns with ""wif""'s standalone output from example 1. This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" may actually just carry on the color output associated with the word before it rather than having its own unique color.

By examining all the examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the previous word:

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
""Wif"" = red, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
""Dax"" = green, ""lug"" = blue, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug.""

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
""Zup"" = yellow, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" ""lug"" = blue.

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
""Dax"" = green, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" ""zup"" = yellow, ""lug"" = blue, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug.""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
""Dax"" = green, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" ""wif"" = red.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color output associated with the previous word.",-0.07085689762240216,42,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look at how it affects the output in each example:

1. Input: wif walm zup  
   Output: red red red yellow  
   The presence of ""walm"" results in the preceding words ""wif"" being repeated in the color sequence.

2. Input: dax lug walm  
   Output: green blue blue blue  
   The presence of ""walm"" results in the color of the word preceding ""walm"" (""lug"") being repeated.

3. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green  
   ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated until a new word (""lug"") appears after ""walm."" 

4. Input: dax walm zup lug walm  
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue  
   Again, the color of the word before ""walm"" (""dax"" -> ""green"") is repeated, and after a new word occurs (""zup""), its color sequence is maintained (""yellow"") until ""walm"" makes the previous color repeat again (""lug"" -> ""blue"").

5. Input: dax walm wif  
   Output: green green green red  
   ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and ""green"" is repeated.

From these examples, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it indicates the continuation of the previous color code until a new word appears after ""walm.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is:
walm -> Continue the previous color code until a new word follows.",-0.08246515352152176,42,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns associated with this word in the given examples:

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

It seems that the output color for ""walm"" varies depending on different contexts, but we can identify a pattern based on the other words and their corresponding colors in the sequences.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red,"" as seen in example 1 and 5.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it translates to ""green,"" as seen in example 3 and 5.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue,"" as seen in example 2.
4. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow,"" as seen in example 4.

From the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" takes the color of the word that directly precedes it in the sequence. Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" adopts the color associated with the word that precedes it in the input sequence. If no word precedes it, this rule does not stipulate the behavior, and more examples would be needed to determine the output color in that scenario.",-0.09002493558582605,42,walm
"To figure out the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the immediate output is a repetition of the same color.
2. ""Walm"" is preceded by different words in the input (wif, lug, dax, zup), but the output color does not seem to depend on the word that comes before ""walm.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule related to ""walm"":

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it changes the output to three instances of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it. 

walm -> When preceded by:
- ""wif,"" the output color is red, so walm causes a repetition of ""red"" three times.
- ""lug,"" the output color is blue, so walm causes a repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- ""dax,"" the output color is green, so walm causes a repetition of ""green"" three times.
- When following ""zup walm lug,"" we should see the repetition of ""blue"" since the output for ""lug"" is consistently blue.

   - ""bluf"" after ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

In the output, ""red"" only appears after ""wif"" is introduced, suggesting a possible correlation.

2. Input: zup lug zup lug wif
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" stands alone at the end and translates to ""red.""

3. Input: lug zup wif lug
   Output: blue yellow red blue
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" comes first, translating to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" follows the same translation.

5. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", ""wif"" with ""red"", ""walm"" repeats ""red"" thrice, and ""lug"" gives ""blue"".

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows any word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times.",-0.0939227190607407,43,walm
"Based on the examples provided where the word ""walm"" appears, it seems that the presence of ""walm"" results in the next color word being repeated thrice.

2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""

2. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green""
3. ""zup wif walm"" provides ""yellow red red red""

The word ""walm"" is always followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" it becomes ""blue blue blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" the ""red"" is repeated thrice.

Therefore, ""walm"" used in this context seems to stand for a repetition of the last color mentioned three times.

Rule: walm -> a rule that repeats the last color mentioned three times.",-0.772685741445679,43,walm
"To induce the meaning of ""walm"" from the examples provided, we have to find any patterns or consistency in the different inputs and their corresponding outputs. The term ""walm"" appears in each input, and we need to understand its impact on the output sequence of colors.

Let's examine the outputs to see if they give us any clues. In every output where ""walm"" is present, there is a sequence of three colors that are the same:

- Input ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- Input ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
- Input ""zup wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" immediately following ""wif""

We can note that the color that is repeated three times corresponds to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"":

- ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and results in ""green green green""
- ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" resulting in ""red red red"" following ""wif""

In the extended sequence of ""zup wif walm lug,"" ""lug"" is not directly followed by ""walm"" but instead follows the ""wif walm"" sequence, which results in ""red red red,"" and then ""lug"" simply translates to ""blue"" as it would independently.

Based on these observations, the likely meaning of ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times.

1. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
2. Input: dax walm zup lug | Output: green green green yellow blue
3. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm | Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
4. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
5. Input: zup bluf dax | Output: yellow yellow green

Analyzing the output patterns and their corresponding inputs:

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the immediate output color following it is ""green."" This pattern holds true across the examples provided, irrespective of the position of ""dax"" in the input.
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" when ""dax"" is also in the input.
- The word ""walm"" follows the word ""dax"" and results in repeated ""green"" colors except in the third input, where ""dax"" comes after ""walm"" and does not affect it.
- The presence of ""zup"" seems to correspond with the color ""yellow"" whether ""dax"" is present or not.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to red, but it does not seem to interact specifically with ""dax.""

Taking these observations into account, the rule seems to be: 

Rule: When ""dax"" is in the input, the output that directly follows ""dax"" will be ""green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the outputs. Additionally, ""dax"" appears to trigger a sequence of ""green"" outputs when followed immediately by ""walm,"" but it does not influence the color representation of the words that follow it unless it directly precedes ""walm.""

Therefore:

dax -> green",-0.09362531987648809,44,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" examine the commonalities and differences in each input and corresponding output.

- In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" The only word that appears once is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" However, we need more information to confirm this.
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue."" Here, ""dax"" is again the first word, and ""green"" is the first color. Since ""lug"" appears both as the second and the last word in other examples, it does not seem to contribute to ""green."" This supports the initial hypothesis.
- The third example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""dax"" appears only once and is followed by ""green,"" consistent across all examples.
- The fourth example, ""dax walm,"" becomes ""green green green."" Given that ""walm"" is the only other word, and removing ""lug"" from the first example also resulted in only ""green"" colors, this implies ""dax"" must be the source of ""green.""
- The fifth example, ""zup bluf dax,"" translates to ""yellow yellow green."" Each instance of ""dax"" is consistently followed by ""green,"" further reinforcing the rule.

Rule: dax -> green. Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.",-0.09683483377976192,44,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to a color output that is affected by the word or words that come after ""dax."" To deduce the rule for what ""dax"" means in this context, let's examine the color outputs in the presence of ""dax"" and the words that follow it:

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
2. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
3. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green

Analyzing these examples:

- When ""lug"" follows ""dax,"" it results in ""green"" followed by ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the next color is always ""green,"" and this green repeats for each ""walm"" that follows.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the result is ""green,"" then the color that corresponds to ""zup"" repeats.

It's important to note that the color output after ""dax"" doesn't depend on the presence or order of words not immediately following ""dax."" For example, ""walm"" following ""dax"" always results in ""green"" regardless of where ""dax"" appears in the sequence.

Based on these observations, we can derive the following rule:

dax -> meaning: When ""dax"" precedes a word, the output starts with ""green,"" and the color associated with the following word repeats according to the number of instances that word appears right after ""dax.""

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. By examining the consistency of the colors following each word, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"".

From the first and fourth examples:

Input: dax wif zup
Output: green red yellow

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

In both instances, ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""red"". ""Zup"" in the first example corresponds to ""yellow"".

From the second example:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

""Zup"" at the beginning is once again followed by ""yellow"". ""Bluf"" has not appeared in any prior examples, but since it is followed by ""yellow"", it is possibly synonymous with ""zup"" in terms of color output. ""Walm"" has also not appeared before, but it is followed by ""red"" twice, which might suggest that ""wif"" somehow repeats the color that follows it, except that doesn't follow with the ""red"" after ""wif"" at the beginning.

From the third example:

Input: wif dax wif
Output: red green red

Here, ""wif"" is both at the beginning and end and corresponds to ""red"" both times, confirming ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"". ""Dax"" is in the middle and aligns with ""green"", as seen in previous examples.

From the fifth example:

Input: wif zup lug
Output: red yellow blue

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, as previously identified, and ""lug"" is a new word that corresponds to blue.

Now we will analyze each example.

Input: zup walm

- The word 'zup' is followed by 'walm,' and the output is 'yellow' repeated thrice.

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green
- The word 'dax' is followed by 'walm,' yielding 'green' repeated thrice.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- The same as the first input, 'zup' followed by 'walm' produces 'yellow' repeated thrice.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- Here, 'wif' is followed by 'walm' giving 'red' repeated thrice, and later 'zup' is followed by 'walm,' resulting in 'yellow' repeated thrice.

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- In this case, 'dax' is followed by 'walm,' resulting in 'green' repeated thrice.

Therefore, it seems the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",-0.09326749805443182,44,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm."" To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's compare the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" and then ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellow"" words for a total of three ""yellow"" words.

2. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" After ""walm"" is used, there are two more ""green"" words in the output.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - This repeats the first example, further solidifying that ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" and ""walm"" adds two ""yellow"" words.

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue."" After ""walm"" is used, twice in this case, it appears to add two repeat colors of the word immediately preceding it.

5. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we see two additional ""green"" words; it repeats the color word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the input.

From these observations, we can propose the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, it duplicates the color word of the immediate preceding word (that has a color association) twice in the output sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" two times in the output.",-0.13719017391659094,44,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Each instance of ""walm"" in the input results in a repeated word in the output. Furthermore, we can identify a correlation between the prior word and the color that is replicated:

- When ""walm"" directly follows ""zup,"" the output color is yellow. 
- When ""walm"" directly follows ""dax,"" the output color is green.
- When there are other words between ""dax"" or ""zup"" and ""walm"" (e.g., ""wif""), the output color seems to be based on the most recent color word before ""walm"" (for ""dax"" green, for ""zup"" yellow) and repeated the number of times corresponding to the total number of words from the last ""zup"" or ""dax"" to the ""walm"" plus one for the ""walm"" itself.

We can formulate the following rule:

**Rule:** The word ""walm"" causes the color word preceding it to be repeated. The number of repetitions is equal to the count of words in between the last color word (""zup"" or ""dax"") and ""walm,"" plus one for the ""walm"" itself. If ""walm"" is directly preceded by ""zup,"" the output is yellow. If directly preceded by ""dax,"" the output is green.

To capture this:

walm -> Repeats the preceding color word based on the last mentioned color ('yellow' if following 'zup' and 'green' if following 'dax') and repeats the color output including the number of intermediary non-color words plus one.

Please note this induction is based on the limited data provided and assumes the rule is consistent for all instances of 'walm' given similar contexts.",-1.0512189836886363,44,walm
"walm -> repetitions of the last color mentioned.

Rule: The word ""walm"" in the input results in the repetition of the last color word mentioned in the output. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of syllables in the last color word mentioned before ""walm"". For instance, ""yellow"" has two syllables, therefore ""walm"" after ""zup"" (which represents ""yellow"") results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (three repetitions for the two syllables). ""Green"" has only one syllable, so ""walm"" after ""dax"" (which represents ""green"") results in ""green green"" (two repetitions for the one syllable).",-1.1349331559325,44,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a series of output colors with the number of repetitions based on the total number of words that are not ""walm"" before it in the input. The specific color associated with ""walm"" seems to be green. Here is the breakdown:

- Example 1 has one word before ""walm"" and outputs three yellows (not following the observed rule but possibly due to an unexplained context or error).
- Example 2 has three words before ""walm"" and outputs three greens, sandwiched between other colors that correspond to the words preceding ""walm"".
- Example 3 is identical to Example 1 and repeats the seemingly discrepant output pattern.
- Example 4 has five words before the first ""walm"" and outputs four reds, and one word before the second ""walm"", outputting three yellows.
- Example 5 has three words before ""walm"" and outputs three greens.

Let's consider that ""zup"" should output yellow based on the first and third examples but was incorrect in those instances due to an anomaly. This is further supported by the second occurrence of ""zup"" in Example 4, which outputs yellow correctly. Therefore, we will consider these as exceptions or errors.

With this adjustment, the pattern is the word ""walm"" outputs green colors, with the number of greens equalling the number of words that precede ""walm,"" excluding any other instances of ""walm."" This means we take into account only the words since the last ""walm"" or the start of the phrase if ""walm"" has not appeared yet.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the color outputs in correlation with the presence of ""walm"" and other words.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" also to red, ""dax"" to red, and ""zup"" to a combination of green and yellow.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

In this example, the presence of ""dax"" results in a green output, but ""wif"" and ""walm"" once again correspond to red.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here, both ""dax"" and ""walm"" result in the color green.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Similar to the first example, ""zup"" results in yellow, and ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to red.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

This example suggests that ""zup"" and ""walm"" both result in the color yellow.

From these observations, we can infer the following rule related to the color output for ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" is combined with either ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup,"" it changes its color output to match the color output associated with the accompanying word.
- Therefore, when ""walm"" is with ""wif,"" it turns red; when with ""dax,"" it turns green; and with ""zup,"" it becomes yellow.
- When ""walm"" is only with ""dax,"" the output is uniformly green, indicating that ""walm"" might also have a prioritization rule where its output color matches that of ""dax"" when they are together without ""wif"" or ""zup.""

This leads to a possible context-dependent rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" mimics the color output of the word it is paired with; if paired with ""dax"" without ""wif"" or ""zup,"" its output is green. 

Summary: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" takes on the color output of the word it accompanies, with a potential priority for green when paired with ""dax"" alone.",-0.08952248130447367,45,walm
"Based on the given examples, walm appears to function as some sort of modifier that changes the color associated with the subsequent word(s) to match the color associated with walm's preceding word. Notice in all instances the color mentioned after walm is repeated for as many words as follow it, including walm itself.

Here's the breakdown of the examples and their corresponding outputs:

- ""wif walm dax zup"" produces ""red red red green yellow"": Here, walm modifies both ""dax"" and itself to be the same color as the word before it, which is ""wif"" associated with red. However, ""zup"" after walm does not turn red, which might suggest that the effect of walm ends before the next 'unaffected by walm' word appears.
- ""dax wif walm"" produces ""green red red red"": Similar to the previous example, walm turns the following word and itself red, matching the color of ""wif"".
- ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"": walm turns itself green, matching the color of ""dax"".
- ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red"": Once again, walm turns the following word and itself red, matching ""wif"".
- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"": walm turns itself yellow, the same as ""zup"".

"Walm -> meaning. Rule:

Observing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, ""walm"" consistently associates with a colour that matches the previous non-""walm"" word's colour in the output.

Example analysis:
- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> red red red green yellow (Here, ""wif"" is red, and the ""walm"" following it is also red.)
- ""dax wif walm"" -> green red red red (Here, ""wif"" is red, and the ""walm"" following it is also red.)
- ""dax walm"" -> green green green (Here, ""dax"" is green, and the following ""walm"" is also green.)
- ""zup wif walm"" -> yellow red red red (Here, ""wif"" is red, and the ""walm"" following it is also red.)
- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow (Here, ""zup"" is yellow, and the following ""walm"" is also yellow.)

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes on the colour output of the previous word if there is a previous word. When ""walm"" is the first word, it defaults to green based on the third input, but there are no explicit examples to confirm this without seeing what happens when ""walm"" is the first word in a series with varying subsequent words.

Rule: ""walm"" assumes the output colour of the word that precedes it in the list. If ""walm"" is the first word, the available data suggests it may default to the colour green.",-0.15662383375973687,45,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" has an effect of repeating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow"". ""Walm"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", and the next color is also ""red"", repeating the color of ""wif"".
- In the second example, ""dax wif walm"" gives ""green red red red"", again ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and ""red"" is repeated after ""walm"".
- In the third example, where there is only ""dax walm"", we see ""green green green"", indicating that the color corresponding to ""dax"" is repeated by ""walm"".
- The fourth and fifth examples support this pattern with the word ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" resulting in repeated ""yellow"" colors.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax"", the output is green; if it's ""wif"", the output is red; if it's ""zup"", the output is yellow.

Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

By analyzing the given input-output pairs, we can discern the following:

1. ""bluf"" tends to be associated with the color mentioned immediately after the same color in the output. For instance, in the first example, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and the output color for ""wif"" is ""red,"" while the color following ""bluf"" is also ""red."" This is consistent across all the examples except for the last element in the output, which can interpret as being unable to look further for a consecutive color match.
2. There does not seem to be a direct one-to-one correspondence that would suggest that ""bluf"" translates to a specific color since in the last example, ""bluf"" corresponds to two occurrences of ""yellow,"" and in others, it produces a repeated color that came before it.

From these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color that is mentioned immediately before it, causing a repetition of that color in the output. If ""bluf"" is the last word in the input, it results in a repetition of the last color mentioned before it in the output, but no new color is assigned to it since there is no following context to compare.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

bluf -> causes the repetition of the previous color in the output sequence",-0.07564348358811263,46,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf"" from the examples provided, let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif  
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red  
   Here, we see that each ""bluf"" occurrence results in the output of a color that does not immediately follow a color from the previous word.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red   
   After ""bluf"" comes a red, prior to that ""wif"" was said, implying ""bluf"" could be ""blue"" given that ""wif"" likely means ""red"".

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup  
   Output: green green red yellow   
   ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is followed by ""wif"" (red) in the output, and ""bluf"" results in a second green.

4. Input: zup bluf  
   Output: yellow yellow   
   Here, ""bluf"" followed by ""zup"" (yellow) also generates yellow.

5. Input: dax zup bluf  
   Output: green yellow yellow  
   ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and continues the color code of yellow.

From these analyses, we can establish the following patterns:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""zup,"" the corresponding output color is repeated.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output color switches to a different color (in one case we see a switch from red to blue).

Based on this pattern, we can induce the following rule for ""bluf"":

""Bluf"" -> meaning: Bluf causes the repetition of the previous color in the output sequence, except when the previous word is ""wif,"" after which ""bluf"" becomes ""blue.""

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows any word that translates to a color, the output is the same color repeated, but if it follows ""wif,"" then the output color for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""",-0.08490024885585264,46,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" However, observing the patterns in the input and output suggests that ""bluf"" might not always translate directly to ""yellow."" Instead, it seems to affect the color sequence, duplicating the color that directly follows it in the output. 

To confirm the rule, let's analyze the inputs and outputs:

- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif 
  Output: red red green green red red red blue red
  Analysis: ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green) and the color is duplicated. Subsequently, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" (red), and the color is duplicated again.

- Input: zup walm lug wif bluf 
  Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
  Analysis: ""bluf"" comes last and is preceded by ""wif"" (red), and the color is duplicated.

- Input: dax bluf wif zup
  Output: green green red yellow
  Analysis: ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" (red), and the color is duplicated. 

- Input: zup bluf 
  Output: yellow yellow
  Analysis: ""bluf"" is followed by the end of the sequence, and ""yellow"" (corresponding to ""zup"") is duplicated, as if ""bluf"" carried over the preceding color.

- Input: dax zup bluf 
  Output: green yellow yellow
  Analysis: ""bluf"" is followed by the end of the sequence, and ""yellow"" (corresponding to ""zup"") is duplicated, as if ""bluf"" required a preceding color to affect and duplicated ""zup"" (yellow) since no new color followed.

Based on these examples, it seems that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce the rule as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.08115859628753332,47,dax
"To ascertain the underlying rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in the given examples. Let's examine how dax corresponds with the output results:

1. Input: dax walm wif dax

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif

4. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Note: dax corresponds to green at the beginning of the sequence.

5. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   Note: dax corresponds to green in the middle of the sequence.

From these examples, we notice that dax is associated with the color green when it appears at the beginning or the middle of an input sequence. When dax appears at the end of a sequence, the color changes. However, looking at the first and fourth examples, the position of dax at the end once generated a red and another time generated a green. This inconsistency suggests that being at the end is not the sole factor in the output color change.

Based on the limited examples, the most consistent rule concerning the word dax is that it generally corresponds to the color green, but this rule is not absolute. The last example where ""dax"" appears in the middle and is still green reinforces this observation, but does not give additional information about other conditions that can change its associated color.

Rule: dax -> green when it is not at the end of a sequence; when dax is at the end, the output color may vary (green or red, based on current examples).",-0.10291111579183333,47,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to correlate its use with the color output in each example. Here's an analysis of each instance of ""dax"" and the color that follows it:

1. First example:
- ""dax walm wif dax"" -> green green green red green.
In this case, ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" both at the beginning and within the sequence but is followed by ""red"" when repeating after ""wif.""

2. Second example:
- ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> green green red yellow red.
Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" but its presence doesn't seem to guarantee a ""green"" output.

3. Third example:
- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> green red green yellow yellow.
""Dax"" is followed by ""green"" again, but the ""wif"" that follows the first ""dax"" yields a ""red"" output, implying ""wif"" after ""dax"" changes the sequence.

4. Fourth example:
- ""dax walm wif"" -> green green green red.
""Dax"" is followed by ""green,"" but like previous examples, ""wif"" after changes the sequence.

5. Fifth example:
- ""zup dax lug"" -> yellow green blue.
Here ""dax"" is still followed by ""green,"" though it is not the starting word.

Based on these examples, it appears that ""dax"" does not specifically determine the next color itself. Instead, it seems like ""dax"" acts as a marker that indicates the color ""green"" should follow, but this rule is altered when ""wif"" immediately follows ""dax."" In that specific context, the output is ""red"" instead of the expected ""green."" Here is the potential rule:

Rule: ""dax"" signals that the color ""green"" should follow, except when followed by ""wif,"" which changes the output to ""red.""",-0.1030195899248,47,dax

3. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> green red green yellow yellow
4. ""dax walm wif"" -> green green green red

Examining the outputs, it seems that ""green"" corresponds with the word ""dax"" unless a certain condition is met. Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, the second ""dax"" is followed by ""red"" instead of ""green."" The common factor for ""red"" might be that it appears after a ""wif"" following a ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by a ""wif"" producing a ""red"" instead of a ""green."" This reinforces the initial observation above.
- In the second example, ""red"" corresponds with ""bluf"" right after ""dax,"" but in the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" so ""red"" after ""dax"" is not consistently tied to ""bluf"" alone.
- Lastly, ""zup"" consistently corresponds with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue.""

From this analysis, we can infer a rule for ""dax"" that might explain the given outputs:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" unless it is immediately followed by another word that changes the color rule or is part of a specific word sequence that changes the outcome (like ""wif"" after ""walm"" leading to ""red"").

Thus, the rule we can draw from here is:

dax -> means ""green,"" but the output can change based on the following word(s).",-0.11797982685277779,47,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the words and their corresponding colors in all the examples:

1. dax -> green
2. walm -> green
3. wif -> red, except when following dax where it's green
4. bluf -> yellow
5. zup -> yellow
6. lug -> blue

In all cases, ""dax"" correlates with the color green, with one exception: when ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" the word ""wif"" is also green, hinting that ""dax"" may influence the following word's color.

Given the examples, it seems that ""dax"" means green, but with an additional rule: when ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" the word ""wif"" also gets the color green instead of its usual red. 

Rule: dax -> green. When followed by ""wif,"" it also turns ""wif"" green.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the patterns in the input and the corresponding output.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Observation: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
Observation: ""Bluf"" still translates to ""green."" The presence of ""wif"" before ""dax"" adds ""red"" to the output, but doesn't change the meaning of ""bluf.""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
Observation: This is more complex, but ""bluf"" at the end still results in a final ""blue."" It should be noted that the presence of ""wif"" before ""bluf"" no longer affects ""bluf,"" as it did when ""dax"" followed ""wif."" It appears ""lug"" may be translating to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" consistent with previous examples, but the position of ""bluf"" is not directly before ""wif"" in this case.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
Observation: Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and translates to ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif."" It seems that ""bluf"" takes on the character or color immediately to its left when it's followed by a defined word (""dax"").

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Observation: This is a repeat of the first example and supports the initial observation.

Based on these observations, the rules for the nonce word ""bluf"" appear to be context-dependent:

1. When ""bluf"" follows a color word, it repeats the color of the preceding word.
2. When ""bluf"" precedes a color word, it does not affect the output color for that word following it, but itself takes on the color associated with the word to its immediate left.
   
Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> When following a color-associated word, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word. When preceding a color-associated word, ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with its immediate left word.",-0.10881095068630137,47,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll analyze its position and its effect on the output in each example provided. 

1. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green.""

2. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to the first ""green."" The second ""green"" comes after ""bluf.""

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" does not have a direct output given, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The last ""blue"" corresponds to ""bluf.""

4. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The second ""red"" is between them, associated with ""bluf.""

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green,"" and the second ""green"" follows after ""bluf.""

The occurrences suggest that ""bluf"" directly translates into the color that precedes its position in the input. However, this is perhaps too simple of a rule because it does not address why ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in two ""blue"" following a ""red"" when ""bluf"" is at the end.

Looking again closely:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- The complicated example with ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" seems to be the exception but may instead reinforce the rule if ""walm"" somehow does not produce a color or is irrelevant to the color pattern

With the information provided, we can tentatively formulate the following rule, taking the anomaly into account:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color word that corresponds to the word preceding it. If the preceding word does not have a corresponding color in the output, this may introduce complexity that requires additional examples to fully understand.",-0.12208292873273972,47,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""bluf,"" we need to first observe the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Notice that the word ""bluf"" always generates two of the same color in the output. Following this pattern, here’s the breakdown of how the word ""bluf"" impacts the output:

- dax bluf -> green green
- bluf duplicates the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Now let’s check this against each example:

- Input: wif dax bluf
  Output: red green green
  ""green"" comes from ""dax"" and is duplicated by ""bluf"".

- Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
  Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
  ""blue"" comes from ""lug,"" which is the word immediately preceding ""bluf,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates it.

- Input: wif bluf dax
  Output: red red green
  ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" as it comes immediately before ""bluf"".

- Input: dax bluf
  Output: green green
  ""green"" comes from ""dax"" and is duplicated by ""bluf"".

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.",-0.13469033076452058,47,bluf
"Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the output ""green"" and has a repeater function, duplicating the output color that directly precedes it. In other words, whenever ""bluf"" follows another word, the color that corresponds to that word is repeated once. 

For instance:
- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green,"" which means ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" once again.
- In the third example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green,"" which means ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word directly preceding it, which is ""wif"" in this case.

The rule then is that ""bluf"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated in the output sequence. When ""bluf"" is at the end of an input sequence, it doubles the last color mentioned; when it's in the middle, it causes the preceding color to be doubled at its position.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color output of the preceding word.",-0.23659958566698627,47,bluf
"Based on the given examples, there is a pattern where the output has one color word for each word in the input and each unique input word is consistently associated with the same color in the output. The word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green"" and the word ""wif"" with ""red"". It seems that ""bluf"" operates in the context of these examples as a duplicator of the preceding word's associated color. 

Here's the rule deduced:

- ""bluf"" -> meaning: When ""bluf"" follows a word, it results in the duplication of the color associated with the preceding word. 

Rule: When the word preceding ""bluf"" is output as a certain color, the word ""bluf"" causes that color to be repeated in the output.",-1.1537139518561643,47,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repeated output of the color that precedes it three times. Here is the breakdown according to each example:

1. ""lug dax walm"" maps to ""blue green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which maps to ""green,"" and the output associated with ""walm"" is ""green"" repeated three times.

2. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" maps to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which maps to ""yellow,"" and thus ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated three times.

3. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" maps to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" The first ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" mapping to ""red,"" resulting in ""red"" repeated three times, and the second ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" yielding ""yellow"" repeated three times.

4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" maps to ""red red green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color ""green,"" producing ""green"" three times subsequently.

5. ""lug zup dax walm"" maps to ""blue yellow green green green."" ""Walm"" again follows ""dax,"" mapping to ""green,"" and hence, we have ""green"" repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the repetition of colors in the outputs and the presence of the word ""walm"" in the inputs.

Observations:
1. Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is repeated with the color ""green"" multiple times.
2. ""walm"" does not correspond to a single instance of ""green"" but rather a series of ""green"" that follows certain other words.

Based on these observations, let's infer the rule:

Rule:
- ""walm"" seems to amplify or repeat the color ""green"" in the output multiple times when it follows any word associated with ""green."" The number of repetitions of ""green"" in the output corresponds to the number of words present in the input before ""walm"" that are mapped to ""green.""

With this rule in mind, the instances of ""walm"" in the inputs produce the following patterns in the outputs:

Input: lug dax walm
Associated Output: blue green green green
Rule Applied: ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""green"" once because ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Associated Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
Rule Applied: ""zup"" maps to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and since ""zup"" appears twice before ""walm"" and is associated with yellow, ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"" twice after these occurrences.

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Associated Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Rule Applied: The first ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and the ""walm"" immediately after it repeats ""red"" twice. The second part follows the same pattern described above where ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""zup"" maps to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" twice after the occurrences of ""zup.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Associated Output: red red green green green
Rule Applied: ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""bluf"" is likely another nonce word that maps to ""red"" (since it does not impact the count of green repetitions), ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""green"" once because ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

Input: lug zup dax walm
Associated Output: blue yellow green green green
Rule Applied: ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""zup"" maps to yellow, ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" once due to the presence of ""dax"" which is associated with ""green.""

The rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the reproduction of the color associated with the word that precedes it, to an extent reflecting the occurrences in the input sequence before it.

From these examples, it seems that the occurrence of ""bluf"" directly contributes to the repetition of the color directly preceding it (in terms of output). ""Bluf"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word before it. Hence, in the outputs, the color before ""bluf"" is doubled.

Example-based deduction:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and when ""bluf"" follows, another yellow appears in output.
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and when ""bluf"" follows, we see an additional green in the output.

4. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
5. dax bluf -> green green

Analyzing the patterns, we observe that the presence of the word ""bluf"" results in the following:

- After ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated (""green green"").
- When ""bluf"" is used at the end of any sequence (except when following ""wif""), the color word before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.
- Exceptionally, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it results in two ""green"" instead of repeating ""red.""

It appears that ""bluf"" causes the word before it to be translated into its associated color twice in the output, with the specific exception when following ""wif,"" which seems to default to ""green green"" instead of duplicating ""wif's"" associated color.

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" observed in multiple examples.
2. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" also seen in multiple examples.
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" similarly observed in more than one context.
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" indicated by its use in the third example.

Now, let's focus on the use of ""bluf"":

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""dax zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow,"" matching the color output for ""zup."" 
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""wif dax"" and corresponds to ""green,"" matching the color output for ""dax.""
- In examples 3 and 4, the sequence ""zup bluf lug"" and ""wif bluf"" respectively, indicates that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color output (yellow after zup and green after dax).
- In example 5, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" where ""bluf"" again repeats the color of the word it follows, which is ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

This suggests that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the previous color, with a special rule when followed by ""dax.""

Here's the reasoning:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), the color blue is repeated: ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""walm"" is after ""zup"" (yellow), and no ""dax"" (green) follows, the color yellow is repeated: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), ""yellow"" is outputted before the expected ""green"": ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green"".

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color that directly precedes it, with yellow inserted before green if ""dax"" follows ""walm"".",-1.2699875001198988,48,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: Whenever the word ""walm"" appears, it takes on the color value of the previous word referenced. If it follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue""; if it follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow""; if it follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""",-1.3675929583777777,48,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. To confirm this, let's review each example:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" might represent a repetition of ""blue.""
- In the second example, the pattern ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" again suggesting ""walm"" causes the preceding color to repeat.
- In the third example, only ""zup walm"" is mentioned without a color before ""zup,"" and ""walm"" again results in a repeat of ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow."" Also, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" is causing the word ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated twice.
- In the last example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" repeats the previous color twice because there is no other color after ""walm.""

Given this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color twice.

Therefore, ""walm"" means repeat the color that comes before it, two times.",-1.4203891659595953,48,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to correlate with the color blue. In each instance where ""walm"" is used, the color blue is repeated in the output. However, one must notice a pattern: when ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"", the output is blue repeated three times; when preceded by ""zup"", it results in two repetitions of yellow before the blue. Walm on its own translates to two repetitions of blue in the output.

The rule for ""walm"" appears to depend not only on ""walm"" itself but is also influenced by the word that comes before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present, output blue. The color blue is repeated once if ""walm"" appears without a preceding ""lug"". When preceded by ""lug"", output blue three times, and when preceded by ""zup"", output two yellows before the blue.

In precise terms:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow blue""
- ""walm"" alone results in ""blue blue""

"Based on the provided examples, bluf appears to be associated with colors. There is a pattern that relates the input words to specific color outputs. To deduce the rule for bluf, let's look at each example and identify the color that corresponds to bluf in each context:

It seems that the meaning of bluf changes depending on its position relative to other words. From these examples, the rule appears to be that bluf takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it:

- If ""dax"" is before bluf, then bluf is ""green"" because ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
- If ""zup"" is before bluf, then bluf is ""yellow"" because ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns and consistencies in the correlation between the input and output sequences. Let's analyze each example provided.

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

By examining the input and output sequences:

1. It seems that the output sequence always contains one more color compared to the number of words in the input sequence.
2. ""dax"" correlates with green, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, and ""wif"" correlates with red since those are consistent across all examples provided.
3. ""lug"" is associated with blue.
4. ""bluf"" does not have a direct correlation provided, which makes it harder to deduce with certainty (it could be an outlier, or could be associated with additional red since ""bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"").
5. The word ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the last color mentioned before it appears, up to the total number of times that ""walm"" appears consecutively, plus one. For example:

- In the first input, ""wif"" precedes a single ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red"" (one “red” for “wif” and two additional for ""walm"").
- In the third input, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"" (one “green” for “dax” and two additional for ""walm"").

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the preceding color in the output sequence an additional two times after the original appearance of that color.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns in which colors follow each given word. By comparing the sequences of words with the sequences of colors, we can try to associate each word with a corresponding color, including ""walm."" We then check for consistency across all examples.

Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
- ""dax"" appears to correspond to green, since it is followed by green in all instances.
- ""zup"" appears to correspond to yellow when it’s not following ""walm.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, as it is always followed by red in the output.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""bluf"" is a new word that we haven't seen in the previous example, and it corresponds to yellow here.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
- ""lug"" is new and corresponds to blue.
- The sequence ""dax walm zup"" gives ""green green green yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" here also corresponds to green since it follows ""dax,"" which is consistently green, but is followed by a yellow associated with ""zup.""

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- ""walm"" here is followed by a color that corresponds to the word after it. Since ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" and the colors are ""yellow yellow green,"" it seems like ""walm"" adopts the color of the word following it.

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" takes the color green after ""dax"" and takes the color yellow after ""zup."" This further supports the idea that ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the word that follows it.

From the above analysis, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the word that follows it (if there is a word following it). If ""walm"" is at the end or if there is no clear pattern for the following word, it may not be possible to determine the color, but within these examples, it always precedes another word, allowing us to apply the rule.

Hence:

"Rule: The word ""walm"" means ""repeat the previous color"".

Explanation: When examining the output in proximity to the usage of the word ""walm,"" we can see that the color preceding ""walm"" is repeated a certain number of times. Here is how ""walm"" is applied in the given examples:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
In this example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated twice. Then ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and upon the second occurrence of ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" wasn't in the output, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" appears three times in the output.

3. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
The color preceding ""walm"" is ""green,"" corresponding to ""dax,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""green"" is repeated three times in the output.

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
After ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" ""walm"" follows, and ""yellow"" is repeated twice more.

5. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated twice more. Then ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the following ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated twice.

If we systematically apply this rule to each instance where ""walm"" occurs, we can consistently predict the corresponding output.",-0.08963523992504001,49,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word 'walm' seems to be associated with the repetition of the color that follows the word that precedes 'walm'. The repetition occurs for the number of times that 'walm' is mentioned. To illustrate:

- In the first example, ""dax zup walm wif walm"", 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'walm' follows 'zup' twice, producing ""yellow yellow"". Then 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' and 'walm' follows it, resulting in ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"", 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'bluf' has no color associated so is not repeated, and 'wif' followed by 'walm' translates to ""red red red.""
- The third example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"", 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' and 'wif' to 'red'. Here 'dax' comes before 'walm' and translates to ""green green green,"" followed by 'zup', which is 'yellow'.

Considering this pattern, 'walm' causes the color of the word preceding it to be repeated in the output. The number of repetitions equals the number of times 'walm' appears after that word.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of occurrences of the word walm that immediately follow the preceding word.",-0.5609256108335998,49,walm

Example 2: ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green"" when in Example 1, ""dax"" by itself results in one instance of ""green"".

Therefore we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> causes the next color to repeat.

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green""
- ""walm wif"" leads to ""red red red""",-1.1292846483730001,49,walm

"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the given examples to see what output is consistently associated with this word. We will look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red."" Since ""wif"" is the last word and it corresponds to the last color ""red,"" it might indicate that it contributes to the color ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and both correspond to ""red red"" at the end of the sequence. This possibly means ""wif"" could contribute a ""red"" to the sequence, regardless of what follows it.
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" with ""wif"" at the beginning. This indicates that ""wif"" produces a ""red,"" and the rest of the sequence follows a separate pattern.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red,"" which supports the idea that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" translates to a single ""red"" in the sequence. Here is the rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output sequence.",-0.11235654441628572,50,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" I will look at the different input examples provided and the outputs associated with them. I will analyze the occurrences of ""wif"" and its contextual relationship with the outputs.

Here’s the analysis:

1. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
2. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
3. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
4. ""wif"" -> ""red""

Now I will try to construct the rule based on the examples:

For each occurrence of ""wif,"" output ""red."" If ""wif"" is followed by other words, output a ""red"" for ""wif"" and then continue coloring the subsequent words in the order they appear after it. If ""wif"" appears alone or is the last word in the sequence, output only one ""red.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" signals the end of a sequence with the previous color words being repeated followed by the addition of red. However, there's more to it than that, as the colors provided in the output do not simply repeat the color words from the input (such as ""green"" appearing for ""dax walm"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup""), but follow a pattern that depends on the specific nonce words before ""wif"". Therefore, without understanding the exact meaning or rule behind the nonce words ""dax"", ""zup"", ""walm"", and ""lug"", or how they correspond to colors, making a complete rule for ""wif"" is challenging.

However, based on the given data, we can formulate the following tentative rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" represents the transition point at which the output sequence repeats the color pattern derived from the words before ""wif"" and then ends with the color red. If ""wif"" is at the beginning or the only word in the sequence, the output is simply red. If ""wif"" comes after color-associated nonce words, each of those words corresponds to a color in the output, the sequence is repeated, and then red is added to the end.",-1.0747520963600004,50,wif

Rule: bluf -> yellow,-1.8438076754541854,50,bluf
"The word ""walm"" likely represents a rule for repeating the color associated with the word that follows it, three times. 

Let's examine each example to see how this applies:

1. lug walm dax → blue (from lug) blue blue (from walm applied to dax) green (from dax)
2. dax walm wif → green (from dax) green green (from walm applied to wif) red (from wif)
3. dax lug dax lug walm → green (from dax) blue (from lug) green (from dax) blue (from lug) blue (from walm replicated from the last color mentioned, which is lug = blue) blue (continued from rule)
4. lug walm zup walm → blue (from lug) blue blue (from walm applied to zup) yellow (from zup) yellow (from walm replicated from the last color mentioned, which is zup = yellow) yellow (continued from rule)
5. zup walm dax zup dax wif → yellow (from zup) yellow yellow (from walm applied to dax) green (from dax) yellow (from zup) green (from dax) red (from wif)

Based on these examples and the derived rule, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color denoted by the following word:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the following word three times.",-0.18033940864364892,50,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" acts as a repetition command for the color associated with the last mentioned word, except when the last mentioned word is ""wif,"" where it doesn't seem to affect the output which stays red. Here's the reasoning:

- In example 1, ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" the color blue is repeated twice more before changing to green for ""dax.""
- In example 2, ""dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" leads to green, and after ""walm"" green is repeated twice more before changing to red for ""wif.""
- In example 3, ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" the pattern repeats as green, blue, green, blue, and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated twice more.
- In example 4, ""lug walm zup walm,"" ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" repeats blue twice more, then ""zup"" changes it to yellow, and ""walm"" again repeats yellow twice more.
- In example 5, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" ""zup"" starts with yellow, which is then repeated twice more by ""walm,"" followed by a green for ""dax,"" then ""zup"" with yellow again, followed by ""dax"" with green, and finally ""wif"" produces red with no repetition even though ""walm"" preceded it.

Considering the above, the rule for ""walm"" appears as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color to be repeated two additional times, except when following ""wif,"" where it appears to have no repeating effect.

So, the meaning of ""walm"" can be described as:

walm -> Repeats the last mentioned color twice, except after ""wif"" where it has no effect.",-0.328271916772181,50,walm
"Based on the given examples, there seems to be a pattern where the word ""walm"" is followed by repetitions of a color. The color that is repeated after ""walm"" appears to correspond with the color that is associated with the word directly preceding ""walm."" For instance:

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" means to repeat that color thrice.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" means to repeat that color thrice.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" means to repeat that color thrice.

When ""walm"" follows a sequence of words, the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated thrice. For instance, in the third input ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" hence ""blue blue blue"" follows.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

- ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" the same as in the first example.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" but since ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow"" and no other color is output, this example suggests that ""bluf"" does not change color, rather, it repeats the color of the word before it.

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
- ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" which is a repetition of the color for ""dax"" before it.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" repeating the color of ""zup"" before it.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word that comes before it. 

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.",-0.07740546989688313,51,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correlation between the input and output in each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" sits between two words that have clear color outputs, and the output for ""bluf"" in this example is ""red""

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" does not have a corresponding color from previous examples, yet the output is ""red"", so ""walm"" seems to also correspond to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and ""walm"" which both output red, and follows ""zup"" which outputs yellow. The output for ""bluf"" in this instance is also ""yellow"", matching the word before it.

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - Consistently, ""zup"" produces ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"" which matches the preceding word.

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   - ""dax"" matches ""green""
   - Following the pattern from other examples, ""bluf"" also matches ""green"" directly after ""dax""
   - ""lug"" is a new word, corresponding to ""blue""

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - Once more, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" again matches the color of the preceding word, which is ""yellow""

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word directly preceding it.

Therefore:

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output, which implies that ""bluf"" itself does not directly translate to a specific color. What does appear consistent is that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. Here's the analysis:

1. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green"": ""bluf"" caused the color of ""wif"" which is ""red"" to repeat.
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"": ""bluf"" caused the color of ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", to repeat, and then ""wif"" repeated its own color, ""red"".
3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": Again, ""bluf"" resulted in repeating the color of ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".
4. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> ""green green red yellow blue"": ""bluf"" has the effect of repeating the color of ""dax"" which is ""green"".
5. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": Here once again, ""bluf"" makes the color of ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", repeat.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it, three times. Below are the deductions from the examples given:

1. In the first example, ""lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue red red red blue,"" implying that ""wif"" which corresponds to red, is repeated thrice when followed by ""walm.""

2. In the second example, ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" where both ""wif"" and ""zup"" are repeated thrice when followed by ""walm.""

3. The third example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" results in ""green green green red blue green green green,"" indicating that ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, is repeated thrice when followed by ""walm.""

4. In the fourth example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"" leads to ""blue red yellow red red red,"" meaning that ""wif"" is repeated thrice after ""walm.""

5. The fifth example, ""dax walm,"" is simply ""green green green,"" confirming that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""dax"" (green) to be repeated three times.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be written as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",-0.4488755308008737,51,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" triples the color associated with the previous word. This can be deduced as follows:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""red red red blue."" Since it's not three times blue, the rule that ""walm"" triples the color associated with ""lug"" may not be accurate. However, we see ""wif lug"" being ""red blue."" Since ""walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue,"" it could mean ""walm"" triples the last color seen before reverting to the initial color associated with ""lug"" which is blue in this case.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is red, then ""walm"" follows, and the output is ""red red red."" No other color precedes the first ""walm,"" but the second instance of ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" is green, and when ""walm"" comes after it, the output is ""green green green red,"" implying that ""walm"" has something to do with repeating the green from ""dax.""
- The fourth example can be confusing because it isn't immediately clear why ""walm"" results in ""red red red"" after a sequence of different colors. However, since ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and it's associated with red, we find that ""walm"" repeats the red color three times.
- The fifth example straightforwardly shows ""dax walm"" resulting in ""green green green,"" confirming ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" three times.

Given the examples provided, we deduce the following rule:

- ""lug"" consistently maps to blue.
- ""zup"" consistently maps to yellow.
- ""wif"" consistently maps to red.
- ""walm"" consistently maps to red.

Where ""dax"" appears, it maps to green. It happens regardless of its position in the sequence, suggesting that ""dax"" consistently represents the color green, and it does not seem dependent on other words in its context.

It appears that other words such as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" correspond to their own colors as well. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" also to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Here is the reasoning based on the input and output pairs:

- When the input is simply ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" (as in ""dax wif""), the output is ""green red,"" indicating that ""dax"" means ""green.""
- ""zup dax wif"" leads to ""yellow green red,"" which suggests ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
- In ""dax zup walm wif,"" ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" before ""red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" also means ""yellow.""
- In ""dax lug wif lug,"" the appearance of ""lug"" both before and after ""wif"" results in ""blue"" both times, suggesting ""lug"" means ""blue.""

The rule for each of the other nonce words appears to be:

- ""dax"" always precedes the color ""green.""
- ""zup"" always precedes the color ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" also precedes the color ""yellow,"" suggesting ""walm"" and ""zup"" may have the same color output or that the color output may depend on another aspect not distinguishable from these examples but coincidentally the same in these instances.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Additionally, it appears that other nonce words may correspond to other colors. Each usage of a nonce word translates to a specific color.

Here's the breakdown of what we can infer from the examples:

- ""wif"" always results in ""red.""
- ""dax"" always precedes ""green"" (when ""dax"" is mentioned, ""green"" is in the output).
- ""zup"" precedes ""yellow"" (when ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is in the output, and multiple ""zup"" result in multiple ""yellow"").
- ""lug"" precedes ""blue"" (when ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" is in the output, and it is not impacted by position since ""lug wif lug"" results in ""blue red blue"").

"Based on the examples provided, we will attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" We'll look at each example and the corresponding output, trying to establish a relationship between the input word sequence and the output color sequence. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

1. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   
   From this example, we can see that 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and it is followed by 'bluf' which also translates to 'green.'

2. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green

   In this sequence, 'wif' correlates to 'red,' 'dax' to 'green,' and 'zup' to 'yellow.' Notably, the sequence 'dax bluf' appears again, yielding 'green green' just as it did in the first example.

3. Input: dax bluf

   This is a repetition of the first example, reinforcing that 'dax bluf' corresponds to 'green green.'

4. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

   Here, 'zup' still corresponds to 'yellow' and 'dax' to 'green,' as previously established. 'Lug' corresponds to 'blue.' Importantly, 'bluf' follows 'zup' and also translates to 'yellow' which indicates that 'bluf' may simply be a repetition of the color associated with the word right before it.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

   The term 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' 'zup' to 'yellow,' and 'lug' to 'blue' again. The word 'bluf' follows 'zup' yielding another 'yellow.' It does not translate the same with 'lug,' indicating 'walm' might be affecting the output for 'bluf.' However, 'bluf' following 'lug' did not give us 'blue blue,' so 'walm' seems not to affect 'bluf' and we can disregard that point.

Upon reviewing these examples, 'bluf' appears to be consistently repeating the color of the word that comes directly before it. 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word",-0.07545132643591489,52,bluf
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in the given examples. Examining the input and its corresponding output, we can identify what color ""bluf"" might correspond to.

Here are the observations:

- ""dax bluf"" always corresponds to ""green green."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" (as seen in every instance ""dax"" is used), it is reasonable to assume that ""bluf"" might also mean ""green.""
- However, in the input ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" we notice that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the pattern ""dax bluf"" still results in ""green green."" This supports our initial assumption.
- In the input ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" despite ""zup"" and ""lug"" changing the pattern, the instance ""dax bluf"" still results in ""green green.""
- Finally, in ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" (which seems to correspond to ""yellow"") and the output is ""yellow yellow."" However, the pattern changes with the addition of ""lug walm,"" but ""bluf"" still resulted in ""yellow"" right after ""zup.""

Given these observations:

- ""bluf"" seems consistently associated with the color ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""
- When following ""zup,"" the output color is ""yellow,"" but this may be because of ""zup"" rather than ""bluf"" itself. 

Therefore, the most consistent rule we can induce from these examples is:

Rule: bluf -> green

While ""bluf"" appears to mean ""green,"" particularly after ""dax,"" there might be exceptions or additional context-specific rules that aren't apparent from the given examples. However, based on the information provided, ""bluf"" is most reliably translated as ""green.""",-0.6448681942833615,52,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to evaluate its occurrences in the input and the corresponding output:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
2. When ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""green"" for ""bluf,"" implying that ""bluf"" might have the same meaning as ""dax"".
3. In the presence of ""zup"" and ""bluf"" together, the output pattern for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" which is the output for ""zup"". This suggests ""bluf"" might adopt the output of the word it's paired with.
4. When ""lug"" is included before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" which is the same as for ""lug,"" further supporting the idea that ""bluf"" mimics the output of the preceding word.
5. In the last example ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" yielding ""yellow"", which is consistent with the output for ""zup.""

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the output color of the word immediately preceding it in the input. If there's no word before it, it seems to default to ""green,"" as seen in the last case where ""bluf"" preceded ""lug"" and followed ""zup,"" but the output for ""bluf"" still matched ""zup."" Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule can be inferred as:

Rule: ""bluf"" mirrors the output color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Given this rule, ""bluf"" can be interpreted in the context of these examples as:

bluf -> meaning: The output color associated with ""bluf"" changes to match the output color of the preceding word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word or no clear context is provided, it defaults to ""green.""",-0.9956348586007446,52,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" observe the patterns in the outputs corresponding to its appearance in the inputs:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" the output is always ""green green.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output starts with ""yellow"" and then ""yellow"" again when ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output starts with ""red"" and then ""yellow"" when ""bluf"" is followed directly by ""lug.""

Given these observations, it's apparent that ""bluf"" results in ""green"" when preceded by ""dax."" More generally, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the output color of the word that precedes it. The first color in the output sequence corresponds to the word that comes before ""bluf,"" and the second color is a repetition of that color:

bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word

For clarity, let's break down each example:

1. In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"", the sequence ""dax wif"" outputs ""green red"", then ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"", followed again by ""wif"", which gives a red. After ""walm"", the output is three reds, which matches the last color.

2. In ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", ""lug"" gives the first blue, then ""walm"" causes the repetition of blue twice. Then, ""wif lug bluf"" gives ""red blue blue"".

3. In ""zup walm"", the word ""zup"" outputs yellow, followed by ""walm"", which repeats the color yellow two more times.

4. In ""dax walm lug"", the word ""dax"" outputs green, followed by ""walm"", which repeats green twice. Then ""lug"" changes to blue.

5. With ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", the sequence starts with ""zup lug"" which is ""yellow blue"", then another ""zup"" giving yellow.

"Rule: The word ""walm"" when used in an input sequence, causes the following color's name to be repeated in the output three times. 

Thus, when ""walm"" precedes a color word in the input, the corresponding color word is repeated thrice in the output. Here are the examples:

- In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"", ""red"" follows after ""walm"", which turns into ""red red red"".
- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", ""walm"" precedes ""wif"", which maps to ""blue"", thus the output ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""zup walm"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow""; hence ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output.
- In ""dax walm lug"", ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""lug"", which are ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively. ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat thrice before a single ""blue"".
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", ""walm"" follows the second ""zup"" (yellow), causing ""yellow"" to appear three times in succession in the output before continuing with the rest of the pattern.

Let's look at the position of ""zup"" in the input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   ""zup"" is in the first position.

2. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

5. Input: lug zup wif
   Output: blue yellow red
   ""zup"" is in the second position after ""lug.""

From examples 1 and 2, ""zup"" at the beginning is consistently resulting in ""yellow"" at the beginning, which convolutes the direct association because, in example 3, when ""zup"" is not the first word, it still translates to ""yellow"" whereas ""dax"" is ""green"". The consistent association here is that whenever ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is part of the output.

Example 4 shows ""zup"" appearing at the end, and it translates to ""yellow"" at the end of the output. Example 5 reaffirms that the position of ""zup"" in the sequence is tied to where ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Therefore, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""green"" (implied from examples 1, 2, and 4 when repeated).
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".

Now let's analyze the placements of ""zup"":

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"" which is followed by ""dax"" and then ""walm"" (repeated three times), the output sequence begins with ""yellow"".
- In the second example, we see ""zup"" at the beginning again and followed by ""lug"" instead of ""wif"", but ""walm"" and ""wif"" still follow after and the sequence still starts with ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""dax zup"" leads to ""green yellow"", suggesting that ""zup"" by itself translates to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is at the end and is preceded by multiple other words but still translates to ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug zup wif"" leads to ""blue yellow red"", and we know that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", 'zup"" in the middle again translates to ""yellow"".

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by three instances of ""walm,"" which translates to the color green repeated three times.

By analyzing the outputs further:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": This shows that ""bluf"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated.

- The number of repetitions of ""green"" does not depend on the surrounding words. ""Walm"" directly after ""dax"" or before ""zup"" results in the same pattern of three greens.
- We can also note that ""lug"" consistently corresponds with ""blue"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" This consistency supports the idea that ""walm"" has a specific translation independent of context.
- Another word, ""zup,"" is associated with ""yellow"" in the outputs.

2. In ""dax lug walm"", ""blue"" is repeated four times after ""walm"" because ""lug"" has four letters.

2. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the sequence ""blue blue blue blue"" results, which is the color for ""lug"" being repeated three times.
3. The presence of ""walm"" without a preceding word leads to ""green green green,"" suggesting that in absence of a preceding word, ""dax"" might be the default preceding word for ""walm.""

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in total.

Hence, it can be deduced that the meaning of ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"" when present in an input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.10273655319871793,54,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the correlation between the input and output in each example.

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is the first in the output.
- The presence of other words after ""zup"" (""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""walm"") correspond to additional colors in the output.
  
From this, we can infer that ""zup"" being placed before other color-indicating words will always result in ""yellow"" being the first color in the output. The subsequent colors are related to the words following ""zup.""

Comparing the 1st and 5th examples,
- ""zup wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red red.""
- ""wif zup dax bluf"" result in ""red yellow green green.""

In the first example, ""zup"" is first, followed by ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" giving us ""yellow red red."" 
In the fifth example, ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red yellow."" This change suggests that ""zup"" does not affect the output of words that come before it but ensures that ""yellow"" follows immediately after it.

Given the above analysis, the rule for the word ""zup"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" triggers the color ""yellow"" to appear immediately next in the sequence.",-0.7255364989111538,54,zup
"After analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. When ""wif"" appears without ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""red.""
2. When ""bluf"" appears without ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""green.""
3. When ""lug"" appears without ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""blue.""
4. When ""dax"" appears without ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""green.""
5. The color ""yellow"" occurs only when ""zup"" is present.
6. The presence of ""zup"" seems to influence the subsequent word to translate differently than when ""zup"" is absent.
7. Furthermore, ""zup"" seems to result in ""yellow"" being added to the sequence of colors, implying that ""zup"" itself translates to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at each example:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
Here, the word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in an additional ""green"", indicating that ""walm"" might mean a repeat of the previous word or action.

2. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and yet again, an additional ""green"" is observed, consistent with the idea that ""walm"" could involve repeating the previous action.

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
In this sequence, ""walm"" occurs after ""wif"" and then it is followed by ""red"" twice, which again suggests that ""walm"" might be a command to repeat the action associated with ""wif"".

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and the result is additional ""yellow"", this supports the repeating hypothesis.

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and again we see the action associated with ""wif"" being repeated (red).

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can examine each example and see how the output differs when ""walm"" is added or absent from the input.

1. ""dax zup dax walm"" produces ""green yellow green green green"" compared to ""dax zup dax"" which would likely produce ""green yellow green."" The addition of ""walm"" adds two extra ""green."" 

2. ""dax walm lug"" gives us ""green green green blue."" If ""walm"" meant just ""green,"" the expected outcome would be ""green green green,"" but the presence of ""lug"" at the end turns the last ""green"" into ""blue."" 

3. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" results in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which correlates to ""red,"" and after ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which correlates to ""blue."" In this string, each occurrence of ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" precedes a color change to ""red"" repeating once.

4. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Without ""walm,"" we would expect ""zup"" to be just ""yellow"" based on previous patterns. The presence of ""walm"" seems to duplicate the ""yellow.""

5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" and appears to extend the count of ""red.""

- In example 3, ""bluf"" is situated after ""zup"" and produces ""yellow"" in the output. However, this is still consistent with the idea that ""bluf"" is causing a repetition because ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Careful examination of the provided examples suggests that ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator for the color immediately preceding it. To confirm this rule, we look for patterns across different examples:

In the first example, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"", indicating that ""bluf"" duplicates the ""blue"" that ""lug"" represents.
In the second example, ""lug bluf lug"" results in ""blue red red blue"", so ""bluf"" again seems to duplicate the color before it which is represented by ""lug"" (blue in this case).
In the third example, ""zup bluf lug"" results in ""yellow yellow blue"", further supporting the duplicator theory, with ""bluf"" duplicating the color represented by ""zup"" (yellow).
The fourth example reinforces this pattern, with ""dax bluf"" resulting in ""green green"", showing that ""bluf"" duplicates the color represented by ""dax"" (green).

- In the second example, ""bluf lug wif"" translates to ""red red"" and ""wif"" following ""bluf"" translates to ""red"", which was the color indicated by the previous word ""lug"".

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let us look closely at each input and output example, focusing on where ""walm"" appears.

1. Input: zup walm lug wif → Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
    - When ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" the color yellow follows.

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif → Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
    - ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" here and is followed by ""wif."" The color blue repeats three times before changing.

3. Input: dax zup dax walm → Output: green yellow green green green
    - After ""dax"" and ""zup"" comes ""walm,"" resulting in a repetition of the color green.

4. Input: lug dax walm → Output: blue green green green
    - When ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and ""dax,"" we see the color green repeated.

5. Input: lug wif zup wif walm → Output: blue red yellow red red red
    - Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" twice, and the output is repeated reds.

Now, based on these observations, let's deduce the rule:

When ""walm"" appears, it seems to cause the output to repeat the previously mentioned color. For example:
- After ""zup,"" which is yellow, there's ""walm,"" and the color yellow is repeated.
- After ""lug,"" which is blue, there's ""walm,"" and the color blue is repeated.
- After ""dax,"" which is green, there's ""walm,"" and the color green is repeated.
- After ""wif,"" which is red, there's ""walm,"" and the color red is repeated.

Therefore, the rule we can induce:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the immediately preceding color.

"By analyzing the input and output pairs, let's try to deduce the meaning of ""walm.""

First, we notice that ""walm"" is the only word that's not consistent in color output among the examples:

Input: zup walm lug wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

In the above example, ""walm"" leads to three yellow outputs followed by a color that corresponds to the next word, ""lug,"" which is blue, and then the last word's color, ""wif,"" which is red.

Input: lug walm wif zup wif | Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

In this case, ""walm"" results in three blue outputs (corresponding to ""lug""), followed by the color for ""wif"" which is red, and then ""zup"" which is yellow, followed again by the color for ""wif.""

Input: dax zup dax walm | Output: green yellow green green green

Here, ""walm"" produces four green outputs, corresponding to ""dax.""

Input: lug dax walm | Output: blue green green green

In this case, ""walm"" results in three green outputs, corresponding to ""dax.""

Input: lug wif zup wif walm | Output: blue red yellow red red red

Finally, here ""walm"" gives us three red outputs, corresponding to ""wif.""

From these examples, ""walm"" seems to produce a series of colored outputs that match the color of the word that follows it. However, in the first example, ""walm"" was followed by ""lug,"" yet the output sequence began with three yellows (which correspond with ""zup""), not blues.

Therefore, based on the examples, particularly where the subsequent color is repeated, one possible rule for ""walm"" is:

- ""walm"" repeats the color output of the subsequent word three times, followed by the actual color output of that word, and the color of the last word in the input series if ""walm"" is not at the end. If ""walm"" is at the end, the repeated color seems to correspond to the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the next word three times, followed by the sequence of color outputs corresponding to the immediate next word and the last word in the input series, or, if at the end, repeats the color of the preceding word four times.",-0.0915206169866237,55,walm
"Analyzing the given input-output pairs, I will inspect each word transformation to try to deduce the meaning of ""walm.""

Here's how the words translate from the input to the output:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Now, looking at the examples where ""walm"" appears:

1. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
2. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
3. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
4. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
5. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red

The position of ""walm"" in each input seems to repeat the color of the word directly preceding it for all instances that follow in the output sequence. For example:

- In example 1, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times in the output.
- In example 2, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times in the output.

Based on this pattern, ""walm"" seems to function as a replication command for the color output that corresponds to the word that comes directly before it. Wherever ""walm"" appears, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated until the end of the sequence or until a new color is introduced.

Hence, the rule could be defined as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word for the following words in the output until a new color word appears. If no new color word appears, continue repeating the last color output for the rest of the sequence.",-0.09269493535787099,55,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs, focusing on the position where ""walm"" appears and what output it generates:

1. Input: ""zup walm lug wif"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
   - Here, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""lug,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow.""

2. Input: ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
   - In this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is before ""wif,"" resulting in the output ""blue blue.""

3. Input: ""dax zup dax walm"" -> Output: ""green yellow green green green""
   - ""Walm"" appears after two instances of ""dax"" and one ""zup,"" to which the output sequence has ""green green"" at the end.

4. Input: ""lug dax walm"" -> Output: ""blue green green green""
   - ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is ""green green.""

5. Input: ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""blue red yellow red red red""
   - Here, ""walm"" is at the end after a sequence of ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif,"" with the last three outputs being ""red red red.""

From these observations, the outputs corresponding to ""walm"" are repetitions of the last color before ""walm"" appears. Let's summarize:

- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" results in a repetition of yellow.
- After ""lug"" (blue) and before ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" causes a repetition of blue.
- After ""dax” (green) and ""zup"" (yellow) twice, ""walm"" leads to repeating green.
- After ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" results in repeating green.
- After ""lug"" (blue), ""wif"" (red), ""zup"" (yellow), and ""wif"" (red) again, ""walm"" yields repeating red.

Rule: ""walm"" -> when followed by another word, the output color is the same as the last color mentioned before ""walm.""

1. In ""zup walm lug wif,"" the word prior to ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which correlates to the color yellow. The output following ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color yellow.

2. In ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which correlates to blue. The output after ""walm"" is ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the blue color.

3. In ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which correlates to green. The output is ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color green.

4. Similarly, in ""lug dax walm,"" ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" (green), and the output is ""green green green,"" reinforcing the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word.

5. Lastly, in ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the associated color of which is red. The output is ""red red red,"" showing the repetition of the color red.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the output ""red,"" regardless of the words that follow it. There is no example where ""wif"" is associated with any color other than red.

Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- When ""wif"" precedes other words, it still translates to ""red,"" but does not seem to affect the colors assigned to the words that follow. See ""wif lug dax lug"" resulting in ""red blue green blue"" and ""wif lug bluf"" resulting in ""red blue blue.""

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

To confirm this rule, we observe the consistent presence of the word ""zup"" in the input and the corresponding appearance of the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Here are the patterns exemplified:

1. ""wif walm zup"" leads to ""red red red yellow,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" possibly corresponds to ""yellow"" in this context and ""zup"" definitely corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. ""zup wif"" leads to ""yellow red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. ""wif lug zup bluf"" leads to ""red blue yellow yellow,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and although ""bluf"" seems like a variation of ""blue,"" in this context it corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. ""dax zup wif"" leads to ""green yellow red,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

There is a slight inconsistency in the second example, where ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" while in the first example it results in ""red."" This inconsistency could be due to a context-dependent meaning for ""walm,"" since ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to ""yellow."" 

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-0.08682978604104166,56,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's compare the input with the associated output.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- Here, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red"", and ""zup"" seems to add ""yellow"" to the sequence.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- In this case, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""zup"" preceding it appears to transform the output into all ""yellow"", indicating a repeater effect for the following color.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- Similar to the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The placement of ""zup"" before ""wif"" brings a ""yellow"" before the ""red"".

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow
- Here, ""wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""zup"" before ""bluf"" results in double ""yellow"".

Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red
- ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"". ""Zup"" is followed by ""wif"", which is ""red"", but there's a ""yellow"" Injected between ""green"" and ""red"".

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that, irrespective of its position in the sequence, ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" being added to the output sequence. When ""zup"" comes before a word, it adds ""yellow"" before the color associated with the following word, and when it comes after a word, it adds ""yellow"" after the color that corresponds with the preceding word.

Rule: zup -> adds ""yellow"" to the color sequence either before or after the color that corresponds to the word next to ""zup"".",-0.12344940242497222,56,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the occurrence of ""zup"" does not change the colors associated with the other words but rather adds an additional ""yellow"" to the output sequence. Therefore, we can infer that the presence of ""zup"" in the input leads to an additional ""yellow"" in the output without affecting the other color outputs assigned to the other nonce words. 

Here are the observations supporting this:

1. When ""zup"" is added to ""wif walm"" (which outputs ""red red""), the output is ""red red red yellow"" - adding a ""yellow"" to the previous output.
2. ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow"" - suggesting ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""
3. ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red,"" which implies ""wif"" means ""red"" and the additional ""yellow"" comes from ""zup.""
4. ""wif lug zup bluf"" produces ""red blue yellow yellow,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" likely corresponds to another ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" inserts an additional ""yellow.""
5. ""dax zup wif"" outputs ""green yellow red,"" where ""dax"" must correspond to ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" again adds a ""yellow"" to the sequence.

Therefore, based on the given information, we can formulate the following rule:

"Based on the given examples, we can infer that ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input sentence.

Thus, the rule can be written as:

zup -> yellow.",-1.8108407660604167,56,zup
"Looking at the provided examples, we can see that ""bluf"" is always translated to a color. To determine the specific meaning, let's look at the context in which ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. lug bluf -> blue blue
   This indicates that bluf could mean blue, but we need more examples to confirm.

2. wif bluf -> red red
   This suggests bluf could mean red; however, this conflicts with the previous example.

3. bluf dax -> yellow green
   This pair does not immediately suggest what ""bluf"" could mean.

Comparing all instances, we notice that ""bluf"" is not consistently translated to the same color. Therefore, ""bluf"" may depend on the context or the word that comes before or after it.

Here's the pattern we can deduce:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it is translated to blue.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it is translated to red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it is translated to yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows or precedes any other word, its translation does not seem to pattern with the deduced rule.

We can hypothesize that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word,"" as when it follows ""lug"" (blue), it is also blue, and when it follows ""wif"" (red), it becomes red. This rule does not account for the sequence ""bluf dax,"" where it becomes yellow, but if we assume an inconsistency or an error in the examples, the rule still holds in most cases.

"From the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" and to the color ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug"".

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" unless it follows ""lug"", in which case it means ""blue"".",-1.566373423374771,56,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red when preceding or followed by the word wif, otherwise bluf -> blue.",-1.6569548287348614,56,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" leads to ""green green green red blue green green green."" The word ""walm"" appears twice, and in both cases, the sequence ""green green green"" follows it.
- The second example, ""lug walm dax,"" results in ""blue blue blue green."" Again, ""walm"" is followed by a triple ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax zup dax walm,"" we see ""green yellow green green green,"" with the ""walm"" being followed by two additional ""green.""
- The fourth example, ""lug walm,"" has the output ""blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" being followed by a triple ""blue.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we have three ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, we can identify a pattern: the word ""walm"" is consistently followed by three of the same colors. The color that follows ""walm"" appears to be dependent on the word that precedes ""walm"":

- If the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" the following color is ""green.""
- If the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" the following color is ""blue.""
- If the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" the following color is ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" has not preceded ""walm"" directly, so we can't determine the specific color relation, but we know that when ""zup"" was the last word before ""walm,"" the color was yellow.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The output will be three of the same color corresponding to the last word before ""walm."" 

""Dax"" correlates with green, ""lug"" with blue, and ""zup"" with yellow. The color associated with ""wif"" before ""walm"" is undetermined within the given examples.",-0.0805732223770899,56,walm
"To decipher the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns regarding the color outputs and the positioning of ""walm"" in each of the input strings.

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green
- Here, ""walm"" appears twice and both times it is preceded by ""dax."" After ""walm,"" different words follow, yielding different colors. Therefore, ""walm"" itself may cause the repetition of the color corresponding to ""dax,"" which is green.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and is followed by ""dax,"" corresponding to green. The output after ""walm"" reverts to the color green presented by ""dax,"" but before ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated.

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- The pattern is similar here: ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" (green) and followed by nothing, but the output is an additional green following the color pattern for ""dax"" before ""walm.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and there's no word after ""walm."" The output is a repetition of blue.

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- Following a red, green, and yellow pattern for ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup,"" respectively, ""walm"" comes last and the output is a repetition of yellow, which is the color for ""zup.""

From these observations, a pattern emerges that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, except when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" where the preceding color is ignored and the output follows the color associated with ""dax"":

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, but if the preceding word is ""dax"", the color associated with ""dax"" (green) is repeated regardless of the color associated with the word before ""dax"".",-0.08608400582289888,56,walm
"The examples given suggest that each unique word corresponds to a color:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

Whenever ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the color that is outputted immediately after ""walm"" is the same color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm"". This is evidenced by the following:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" is followed by ""green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the second example, ""lug walm dax"" outputs ""blue blue blue green,"" again the color after ""walm"" is the same as ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" consistent with the earlier examples.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" following the established pattern.
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating again that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, which in this case corresponds to yellow.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word.",-0.6625839921544945,56,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" affects the output concerning the word that immediately precedes it. After considering the context in which ""walm"" appears and the effects on the output, the rule appears as follows:

When a word is followed by ""walm,"" the output repeats the color associated with that preceding word three times.

Let's confirm this by examining each example:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" and since ""dax"" by itself correlates to ""green,"" the pattern holds.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which aligns with ""lug"" correlating to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" once again results in ""green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" consistently leads to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the last example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which implies that ""zup"" by itself would relate to ""yellow.""

With this rule, we can conclude:

walm -> meaning: the tricolon repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

In every example, whatever color the word before ""walm"" represents, the output for ""walm"" is a series of that same color, repeating three times. Below are the details:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" we observe three greens in the output.
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Following ""lug,"" ""walm"" results in three blues.
- In the third example, once more ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" and thus the output for ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green, three times.
- The fourth example again shows ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" with the output being three blues corresponding to ""lug.""
- Finally, the fifth example has ""zup"" before ""walm."" ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and the output for ""walm"" is three yellows.

Input: lug
Output: blue
- Only the word lug is present and is translated as blue.

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- Here, lug again corresponds to blue, and we can see that it's repeated at the end with the same translation. Wif appears to correspond to red, zup to yellow, and walm seems to repeat the last color mentioned, since after wif is translated to red, walm repeats red, and after zup is translated to yellow, walm repeats yellow.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- In this example, lug is first, translating to blue, and walm appears to repeat the color before it for both occurrences.

Input: zup lug walm wif dax

- Again, lug corresponds to blue and walm repeats the color before it. Wif is consistent with red, and a new element dax is introduced, which translates to green.

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- Lug still translates to blue, wif to red, and dax to green. Walm again repeats the color before it.

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""

Let's check this rule against the examples provided:

- Input: zup walm

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can examine each case and the corresponding outputs.

1. We start with the first input ""lug walm wif zup wif"" and the output ""blue blue blue red yellow red"". Since ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" and repeats in the output three times, and ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" it could mean that ""walm"" is instructing us to repeat the previous color.

2. The second input ""dax walm"" and the output ""green green green"" again supports this rule, as ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and following it with ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""green.""

3. In the third input ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"", the output corresponding to ""walm"" after ""wif"" is ""red red red,"" which matches the color ""red"" produced by ""wif."" The sequence ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" maintaining the pattern of repetition.

4. The fourth input ""dax zup walm wif"" has the output ""green yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated thrice in the output.

5. Lastly, ""zup walm"" in the input leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output, which aligns with ""walm"" signaling a repetition of the preceding color ""yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" we can look at the patterns in each of the examples given.

From the first input-output pair:
Input: lug zup wif lug
Output: blue yellow red blue

Here, ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" both times, which is consistent. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From the second pair:
Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again, ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""bluf"" is not present in the previous example, but since it corresponds to ""red,"" it seems unrelated to ""lug,"" since ""lug"" has consistently corresponded to ""blue.""

The third and fourth pairs:
Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Each time, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" irrespective of the word that comes before it.

The fifth pair:
Input: lug dax zup
Output: blue green yellow

Again, regardless of its position, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Considering the evidence, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently means ""blue,"" independent of context.

- In the first example, the output replaces ""lug"" with ""blue"" both times it appears.
- In the second example, ""lug"" is again replaced by ""blue.""
- The third and fourth examples have ""lug"" directly followed by ""blue"" in the output.
- The last example includes ""lug"" at the beginning, followed by ""blue"" in the output.

Given this consistent pattern, the rule is:

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look at the consistent pattern in the examples provided:

Input: dax
Output: green

We see that ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup wif dax
Output: yellow red green

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

In this example, ""dax"" remains ""green,"" ""bluf"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

In this longer sequence, we can see that each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" is likely to correspond to ""yellow"" as well.

Based on these inputs and outputs, and the consistency across examples, we can induce the following rule:

- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is still ""green.""

Looking at the other words and their corresponding outputs:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""dax,"" but ""dax"" doesn't change and remains ""green.""
- ""bluf,"" when it follows ""dax,"" both words lead to ""green"" as an output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the provided examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. `zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup` -> `yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow`
2. `lug bluf wif` -> `blue blue red`
3. `zup dax zup dax wif bluf` -> `yellow green yellow green red red`
4. `wif bluf` -> `red red`
5. `dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax` -> `green blue blue blue green red red green`

By examining the patterns, ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. For example:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""lug"" stands for ""blue"", so the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"". The pattern repeats twice.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue), so it corresponds to ""blue"" again.
- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), hence it corresponds to ""red"".
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" also follows ""wif"" (red) and thus corresponds to ""red"".
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and so the corresponding output is ""red"". Notice that ""bluf"" does not affect the color output for ""dax"" that follows it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that precedes it.",-0.07787686158384019,58,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. The given colors include yellow, green, blue, and red. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the instances where ""bluf"" appears and the color that is output in response to it. Here are the mentions of ""bluf"" from the inputs and their corresponding output colors:

- zup bluf (yellow blue)
- lug bluf (blue blue)
- wif bluf (red red)
- bluf dax (blue green)
- wif bluf dax (red red green)

From these, we can deduce that each time ""bluf"" is mentioned, the color ""blue"" appears in the output. It does not depend on the preceding or following word in the input; ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of context. Based on this pattern, we can conclude:

bluf -> blue",-1.1411370458532348,58,bluf

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""red"". In each instance, whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output is ""red"".

"Based on the provided examples, it is possible to infer a rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"". We can analyze each example and look for patterns related to the presence of ""walm"" and the colors in the outputs.

- Example 1: ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
- Example 2: ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
- Example 3: ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- Example 4: ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
- Example 5: ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""

From these examples, we can infer a pattern where the word ""walm"" is tied to the repetition of the color immediately following its first occurrence. Here is a possible rule based on the provided examples:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the next word to be repeated three times.

Applying this rule to the examples, follow:

- In Example 1, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" since ""zup"" is associated with yellow.
- In Example 2, ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red"" since ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""wif"" comes after ""walm"", introducing the color red without repetition because there is no subsequent ""walm"".
- In Example 3, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- In Example 4, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"" since ""zup"" is associated with yellow and is followed by ""walm"", thus repeating yellow three times; ""lug"" is associated with blue but is not followed by ""walm"", so it's said once; ""wif"" introduces red, and ""bluf"" is followed, repeating red.
- In Example 5, ""zup dax lug walm zup"" results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"" since ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""dax"" with green, and ""lug"" with blue. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" blue is repeated three times. The final ""zup"" is said once as it does not follow ""walm"".

Thus, the definition we can derive for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Causes the color associated with the subsequent word to be repeated three times.",-0.10530192477912359,58,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the color sequences relative to each other in the examples provided.

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Given that ""dax"" precedes the first ""walm,"" it appears to correspond to the green color. Similarly, ""zup"" precedes the second ""walm,"" which appears to correspond to the yellow color. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to be related to a repetition of the color associated with the word before it.

- In the second example, ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red."" Again, ""dax"" is associated with green and is followed by ""walm,"" which again suggests the repetition of green. ""Wif"" is not preceded by ""walm,"" and corresponds to the color red directly.

- In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" is again causing the repetition of this color.

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here, ""zup"" again is followed by ""walm"" and leads to the repetition of yellow; ""lug"" is followed by ""wif,"" suggesting that ""wif"" does not cause color repetition but leads to a new color, which is red. ""Bluf"" is not preceded by a repeated color or ""walm,"" so its direct color association is not clear from this example, but it results in the repetition of red, implying that ""walm"" is not the only trigger for color repetition.

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""walm"" again follows ""lug"" and causes the repetition of blue, as previously observed.

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be:

Walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""walm,"" its color is repeated three times. If a word is not followed by ""walm,"" it is represented only by its associated color once.

"From the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm."" We see that each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a color repeated three times, associated with the word immediately before ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

- In example 1, ""dax walm zup walm,"" we see that ""dax"" precedes the first ""walm"" and the output is ""green"" repeated, whereas ""zup"" precedes the second ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated.
- In example 2, ""dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""wif"" that follows ""walm"" is not repeated but rather represented by ""red.""
- In example 3, ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" repeated.
- In example 4, ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" repeated, and ""lug"" by ""blue,"" while ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are not repeated but yield ""red.""
- In example 5, ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" the sequence of ""walm"" gives us ""blue"" repeated, which corresponds to the word ""lug"" before it, indicating that the last word before ""walm"" influences the color.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: When preceding a word, ""walm"" causes the color associated with that word to be repeated three times.

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and again, ""walm"" involves tripling the color.
- When ""zup walm"" is used, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" suggests tripling the color.

"To deduce the meaning or rule underlying the word ""bluf,"" let's break down the given examples and look for patterns associated with ""bluf.""

In the first input-output pair, we have:

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red

""Bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" which results in ""yellow"" and is followed by ""wif"" which results in ""red."" There's no direct connection to colors here yet, as ""bluf"" is associated with both ""yellow"" and ""red.""

In the second input-output pair:

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue

""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green,"" the same as ""dax."" Then ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which is ""red."" Flanked by ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it.

In the third input-output pair:

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and again results in ""green."" This reaffirms that ""bluf"" may take the color of the word before it if the pattern holds.

In the fourth input-output pair:

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and both ""lug"" and ""bluf"" result in ""blue,"" again supporting the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it.

In the fifth input-output pair:

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue

Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output color is ""blue,"" as with ""lug.""

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word. Applying this rule consistently explains all the provided examples.

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a relationship between the input words and the output colors. To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine each example and look for patterns.

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif

- Here, the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" both before and after ""bluf.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The presence of ""bluf"" doesn't seem to change the color associated with ""wif,"" but it appears in between, suggesting it could be ""yellow.""

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue
- Here, the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both before and after ""bluf.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- Again, we see ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" without changing the color associated with ""dax.""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" both before and after any other words.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when it appears before ""lug,"" ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""Walm"" isn't followed by ""bluf"" but still corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""Bluf"" comes at the end and is followed by another ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is at the end, again followed by ""blue"" for ""lug.""

From the examples, we see that ""bluf"" appears between or after other words without altering the color correspondence of the surrounding words. More notably, whenever ""bluf"" appears, it is followed by the color that corresponds to the word right before it, without affecting the natural color assignment of the other words.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that ""bluf"" is a rule repeat modifier that indicates the subsequent color output should repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> causes the next color to repeat the color of the word before ""bluf"".",-0.09648092021772946,59,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" is used to duplicate the color that the word preceding it represents. Here is the breakdown:

1. In ""wif bluf zup bluf wif,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" right after it leads to another ""red."" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" right after it leads to another ""yellow.""

2. In ""dax bluf wif lug,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" which leads to another ""green."" 

3. In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" immediately after it repeats the color ""green.""

4. In ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and at the end, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to an extra ""blue.""

5. In ""lug wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and at the end, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and repeats the ""blue.""

Given these observations, I deduce the following rule about the nonce word ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.",-0.43860699312364687,59,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color word that is equivalent to the last color word mentioned before bluf. If no color word was mentioned before it, then bluf represents green.

Examples supporting the rule:
- In ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"", ""wif"" has been established to mean ""red"", so both instances of ""bluf"" are replaced with ""red"".
- In ""dax bluf wif lug"", ""dax"" means ""green"", which comes before the first instance of ""bluf"", so ""bluf"" is ""green"". No color comes before the second instance of ""bluf"", so it follows the default meaning, ""green"".
- ""dax bluf"" has ""dax"" which means ""green"" before ""bluf"", so ""bluf"" is ""green"".
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" has ""lug"" meaning ""blue"" before ""bluf"", so ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
- Similarly, for ""lug wif lug bluf"", ""lug"" means ""blue"", and it is the last color mentioned before ""bluf"", so ""bluf is ""blue"".",-0.5027560673789411,59,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look for patterns in the examples provided. 

Firstly, it seems that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue"" (as seen in the fourth example)

Now by looking at the use of ""bluf"":

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" appears twice and ""yellow"" follows the first instance of ""bluf"" and precedes the second. 
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which we have ascertained to correspond to ""red,"" but in the output, ""green green"" follows ""dax bluf.""
3. The third example is simply ""dax bluf"" and the output is ""green green."" This hints that ""bluf"" may result in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word right before it.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is at the end and results in ""blue blue,"" which again supports the idea that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the preceding color.
5. In the last example provided, ""bluf"" again results in a repetition of the color ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug.""

Based on the patterns observed, we can induce:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated in the output.

So, if ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""bluf,"" the output will have an additional ""blue."" If ""dax"" (green) comes before ""bluf,"" the output will have an additional ""green,"" and so on.",-0.8146322188988238,59,bluf
"Observing the examples:

2. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
3. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
4. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Looking at these examples, there is a pattern that emerges with the use of the word ""walm"". Specifically, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes before it. Observing more closely:

- When ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (blue), the output becomes blue -> blue.
- When ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" (red), the output becomes red -> red.
- When ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow), the output becomes yellow -> yellow.
- If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" (red), an additional red appears.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows: 

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. If followed by ""wif"", it also adds an extra ""red"".",-0.08320588375594597,59,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can look for patterns that indicate what ""walm"" could signify. It appears that ""walm"" affects the output sequence of colors. By comparing inputs and outputs, we can attempt to find a consistent rule.

Analyzing the first input/output pair:

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. Immediately after ""walm"", there is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". In this case, the repetition counts are three times for both ""blue"" and ""red"".

Analyzing the second input/output pair:

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

The color blue corresponds to ""lug"" and is repeated three times after ""walm"".

Analyzing the third input/output pair:

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

The color red corresponds to ""wif"" and is repeated three times after ""walm"".

Analyzing the fourth input/output pair:

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

The color red is repeated three times after the first occurrence of ""walm"", and yellow (corresponding to ""zup"") is repeated three times after the second occurrence of ""walm"".

Analyzing the fifth input/output pair:

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Aside from ""walm"", a new word ""dax"" corresponds to green in the output, but it doesn't affect the rule related to ""walm"".

From these examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" makes the following color repeat three times, corresponding to the word right before ""walm"".

Therefore:

walm -> Causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-0.09948132810934235,59,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. In addition, the color associated with ""walm"" itself seems to be red when it precedes any color word, but when it follows, it replicates the last mentioned color.

Let's break down each example to observe the pattern:

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow""
- ""lug"" produces ""blue""
- ""walm"" following ""lug"" causes ""blue"" to repeat
- ""wif"" produces ""red""
- ""walm"" following ""wif"" causes ""red"" to repeat

Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
- ""wif"" produces ""red""
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" produces no color (nonce word, not affecting the sequence)
- ""lug"" produces ""blue""
- ""walm"" following ""lug"" causes ""blue"" to repeat

Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Input: zup wif walm lug
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow""
- ""wif"" produces ""red""
- ""walm"" following ""wif"" causes ""red"" to repeat
- ""lug"" produces ""blue""

Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
- ""wif"" produces ""red""
- ""walm"" following ""wif"" causes ""red"" to repeat
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow""
- ""lug"" produces ""blue""
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow""
- ""walm"" following ""zup"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat

Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
- ""wif"" produces ""red""
- ""zup"" produces ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" produces no color
- ""lug"" produces ""blue""
- ""walm"" following ""lug"" causes ""blue"" to repeat
- ""dax"" produces ""green"" (found in output but not in previous inputs, however, ""green blue"" pair tells us what ""dax"" results in)
- ""lug"" again produces ""blue""

Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: walm -> It repeats the color associated with the word that directly precedes it, and if ""walm"" is not preceded by a color word, it defaults to red.

Rule: If x is a color word and is followed by ""walm"", then the output includes the color associated with x repeated. If ""walm"" is not preceded by a color word, it outputs ""red"".",-0.1036867239090991,59,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" represents a sequence of color(s) that directly corresponds to the preceding color word mentioned, replicating that color in the output.

However, it duplicates one less color than the previous amount. Let's break down the examples:

Example 1: zup lug walm wif walm
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm follows lug, so we repeat ""blue"" one less time than the previous amount. Since ""lug"" is mentioned once, ""walm"" would result in no ""blue"" here, it seems there's an exception when the previous amount is 1, walm adds two instances of ""blue"".
- wif -> red
- walm follows wif, so ""walm"" should result in duplicating ""red"" one less time than before, but since ""wif"" was the first instance of red, it duplicates it twice.

Example 2: wif zup bluf lug walm
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm follows lug so it replicates ""blue"" twice since ""lug"" appeared once before walm.

Applying this pattern to all examples, we can induce the following rule:

Walm -> The rule for what ""walm"" means is that it repeats the color word immediately preceding it one fewer times than that color word was previously mentioned, with the additional nuance that if the color word before ""walm"" is mentioned for the first time, then ""walm"" outputs the color twice.

Rule: If the color word before ""walm"" appears \(n\) times, then ""walm"" outputs that color \(max(n - 1, 1)\) times, with a special consideration that if \(n = 1\), then the output is the color repeated twice.",-0.8800389272517114,59,walm
"Walm -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the examples provided:

- In example 1, the sequence ""walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue red red red."" The word ""wif"" means red, so the presence of ""walm"" before ""wif"" means blue, while the presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" causes the red to repeat twice more.
- In example 2, ""walm"" at the end of the sequence corresponds to three blue colors following one ""lug,"" indicating that ""walm"" again means repeating the blue color.
- In example 3, ""walm lug"" leads to ""red red blue,"" with ""walm"" before ""lug"" meaning that the color red is repeated.
- In example 4, the sequence ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" gives us reds followed by blues and then yellows, with ""walm"" seeming to cause the previous color to be repeated.
- In example 5, ""walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""blue green blue."" The new word ""dax"" is followed by green, indicating that ""dax"" likely means green, and since ""walm"" occurs before ""lug"" again, it repeats the blue.

The rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be repeated two additional times, with the exception of when it follows the word ""wif,"" where it appears only to repeat the color once more. Additionally, following a new color (like ""dax"" for green), ""walm"" still causes the repetition of the previous color (blue in this case).

"From the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" To determine what ""dax"" might represent, let's look at the input-output pairs:

1. When ""dax"" is added after ""lug"" (blue), the output color is green:
   - Input: wif lug dax lug
   - Output: red blue green blue 

2. When ""dax"" is added after ""walm"" (yellow), the output is yellow green:
   - Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   - Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

3. When ""dax"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output color is green:
   - Input: zup dax zup lug
   - Output: yellow green yellow blue
 
4. When ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" (red), the output color is green:
   - Input: zup dax bluf
   - Output: yellow green green

5. When ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" (red) and is before ""walm"" (yellow), the output string is green green green:
   - Input: wif bluf dax walm
   - Output: red red green green green

From these examples, we can infer that the word ""dax"" translates to ""green"" but is also affected by the color before it, causing a repetition of the color ""green"" for the number of times the previous color word is mentioned before ""dax"". The exception is if ""dax"" is preceded by either ""lug"" or ""zup"" where it is just translated to ""green"".

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the pattern of colors and words in the given input and output examples.

1. Input: wif lug dax lug
   Output: red blue green blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - Though ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" has repeated ""yellow"" before it, and after ""dax,"" there is an added ""red"" at the end compared to ""wif"" before it.

3. Input: zup dax zup lug
   Output: yellow green yellow blue
   - ""zup"" continues to correspond to ""yellow""
   - The placement of ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green""

4. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""green"" as well

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the ""dax"" again brings in ""green""

From these examples, we may infer that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" However, there is a complication with the second example where ""dax"" is followed by an additional color ""red"" not present in the input, which suggests that ""dax"" might not only mean ""green"" but also affect the next color.

Considering all examples there seems to be a stable rule that ""dax"" stands for ""green."" The anomaly observed in the second example might be due to an additional unstated rule or a potential input/output error. For now, based on the majority of consistent examples, the rule is:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""",-0.07654589596503227,60,dax

1. wif lug dax lug -> red blue green blue
2. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
3. zup dax zup lug -> yellow green yellow blue
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

From the examples, we notice that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. ""dax"" does not appear to depend on its position within the sequence, nor does it seem to alter based on surrounding words. Continuous repetitions of the word before ""dax"" correlate with continuous repetitions of ""yellow"" or ""green"" immediately preceding ""green"" in the output sequence. In example 5, the word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in repeated instances of ""green"" in the output.

With this in mind, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" possibly followed by additional instances of ""green"" if it precedes specific words such as ""walm"". 

Deduced meaning: dax -> green (potentially followed by additional repetitions of green, context-dependent)",-0.10930449433350536,60,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" does not correspond to a single color, but rather to a sequence or transformation rule within the context. Let's analyze the examples more closely:

1. If it follows ""lug"" it results in ""green"" (see example 1).
2. If it follows a repeating word (e.g., ""zup"") it's ""green"", suggesting that it might represent the sequence continuation or a repeat (see example 2 and example 3).
3. If it follows ""bluf,"" the outcome is green always (see example 2 and example 4). 
4. If it is followed by ""walm"" without a repeated color beforehand, it results in a series of ""green"" until another color breaks the pattern or the sequence ends (see example 2 and example 5).

As such, the word ""dax"" appears to induce a rule that influences the following words or interprets the previous pattern, rather than corresponding to a fixed color itself. 

The rule seems to be that ""dax"" induces a repetition of the next color in the sequence, except when following ""lug"" (always ""green"") or it denotes a sequence of ""green"" if it follows a double word or ""bluf."" If following a double word, it also requires the color represented by that word to have been immediately repeated prior to ""dax."" Additionally, in the absence of a color before ""dax"" or a pattern establishing a color before it, the default outcome is ""green."" When the previous color repeats, we have an added incidence of that color after ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> If following ""lug,"" output ""green."" If following a repeating pattern or ""bluf,"" continue the most recent color or pattern with at least one ""green.""

- The presence of other words such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax"" correspond to the colors ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green"" respectively.
- The word ""walm"" does not appear isolated; it is only included with ""wif,"" and the pair ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red red"" in the second example.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-0.07369118791571432,60,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can see that ""zup"" is always associated with a particular color in the output. Here are the inputs and corresponding outputs:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is in the same position in the output.
- Other words such as ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" are associated with their own specific colors as well: ""dax"" with green, ""wif"" with red, ""lug"" with blue, and ""bluf"" seems to have a repeat pattern or stutter associated with it, duplicating its output color.

To verify the rule for ""zup"":

- Every time ""zup"" is mentioned, the output color is ""yellow"".
- No other word in the inputs seems to have the output color ""yellow"" associated with it.

Therefore, the rule is:

"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the placement of ""zup"" in relation to the colors in its respective output:

- When ""zup"" appears, it is followed by ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""zup"" does not seem to influence the color that comes after yellow, which suggests that ""zup"" corresponds only to the color that immediately follows it in the output.

Based on this analysis, we can induce that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"" in the output, without affecting adjacent colors or being affected by context.

"Analyzing the examples:

1. `dax bluf` -> `green green`
2. `dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax` -> `green blue blue blue green red red green`
3. `zup wif bluf zup lug` -> `yellow red red yellow blue`
4. `zup lug bluf` -> `yellow blue blue`
5. `zup bluf dax` -> `yellow yellow green`

From these examples, we can see the following patterns:

- When `bluf` follows the word `dax`, the output for `bluf` is `green`.
- When `bluf` follows the word `zup`, the output for `bluf` is `yellow`.
- When `bluf` is between the words `zup` and `dax`, the output for `bluf` is the same color as the one that preceded it.
- When `bluf` follows `wif`, the output for `bluf` is `red`.

Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of `bluf` is context-dependent, and its color output mirrors the preceding word:

"Given the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red when it follows ""wif"" but otherwise corresponds to the color that would represent the immediately preceding word if it were repeated. 

To elaborate, when ""bluf"" appears, we need to look at the word immediately preceding it:

- If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is green, which is the same color assigned to ""dax.""
- If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is yellow, which is the same color assigned to ""zup.""
- If the preceding word is ""wif,"" regardless of preceding colors, the output for ""bluf"" is red.

Here's the breakdown:

1. In ""dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" is green.
2. In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" so it corresponds to red; ""wif"" itself has no color associated with it but seems to be a trigger for ""bluf"" to become red.
3. In ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" leading to the color red.
4. In ""zup lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" but ""lug"" has no color assigned. The output blue is from the color of ""zup,"" which directly precedes it and would repeat blue if it were repeated.
5. In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and takes its color, yellow.

Rule:

bluf -> follows ""wif"", takes the color red.",-0.5667999230605174,60,bluf
"After reviewing the provided examples, we can notice that the output associated with the word ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that precedes it. Let's analyze the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" gives ""green green."" ""Bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and both output as ""green.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax"" produces ""red red green."" ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" here, and both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" output as ""red,"" then followed by ""dax,"" which gives ""green.""
- In the third example, ""wif bluf zup"" gives ""red red yellow."" Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and outputs as ""red,"" and is followed by ""zup,"" which gives ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" gives ""blue blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and both output as ""blue.""
- In the final example, ""zup bluf dax"" gives ""yellow yellow green."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and both output as ""yellow,"" then followed by ""dax,"" which gives ""green.""

Based on these patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the same color output as the word that precedes it. So the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> The color output of the word that precedes it.

For instance:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" because ""dax"" outputs green.
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" outputs blue.
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" because ""wif"" outputs red.
- And when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it outputs ""yellow"" because that's the output for ""zup.""",-1.0842594888854022,60,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here are the details that lead to this conclusion:

1. When ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
2. In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and the output is ""red red.""
3. Similarly, in the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) again, resulting in ""red red.""
4. In the fourth input, ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""bluf,"" and again the output directly after ""bluf"" is ""blue blue.""
5. In the fifth input, ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow yellow.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-1.2554847778689655,60,bluf
"Given the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates the color of the preceding word to the color associated with that word. Let's examine the specific cases:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the color red is outputted.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the color red is outputted.
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the color blue is outputted.
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the color yellow is outputted.

So, based on these examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. If we were to express it as a rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated. 

Therefore:

"Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the patterns of inputs and outputs to deduce the meaning or rule for ""walm.""

- In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" results in ""green green green blue,"" where ""dax"" is consistently mapped to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

- In the second example, ""dax zup walm wif walm"" generates ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""dax"" remains green, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""wif"" is red. Notably, ""walm"" occurs twice at the end, resulting in ""red red red,"" suggesting that its meaning could be contingent on previously appearing words.

- The third example, ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" results in ""green green green yellow blue green."" The word ""dax"" still maps to ""green,"" ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue. Unlike the previous example, ""walm"" now maps to ""green,"" aligning with its position following ""dax.""

- Moving on to the fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup"" maps to ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" again follows ""wif"" and maps to ""red,"" similar to the second example.

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup"" produces ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and maps to ""blue,"" while still consistent with its preceding word.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it maps to the same color output as the word right before it.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color value of the preceding word.",-0.062407554582867356,60,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the provided examples and their outputs.

1. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"" since the second color in the output is ""green.""

2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   
""Dax"" is ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" ""Zup"" changes color in different contexts (from yellow to blue), but here it corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" in this context since it follows ""wif"" and aligns with the ""red red red"" output.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   
Here again, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   
""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue."" Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on the examples given and the output colors, ""walm"" seems to be a chameleon word, meaning that its output color changes depending on its position or the surrounding words. However, considering the second and fourth examples, ""walm"" following ""wif"" repeats the color for ""wif."" Given this inconsistency, it's challenging to deduce a single meaning for ""walm"" based on the available examples. There might be a need for more context or examples to precisely determine the rule for the word ""walm."" 

For the given examples, a plausible rule could be:

Rule: ""Walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word if the preceding word is a color-word repeated three times (as seen in examples 2 and 4 with ""wif walm"" leading to ""red red red""). When not following a color-word repeated three times, ""walm"" takes the color ""green"" by default, which aligns with examples 1 and 3. The fifth example poses a conflict as ""walm"" outputs ""blue"" following ""lug"" which also outputs ""blue"" but isn't repeated three times. This indicates that there might be another conditional rule influencing the output which isn't clear from the provided examples. More data is needed to fully understand the rule for ""walm.""",-0.07460413305685717,60,walm
"To determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let us examine the input and output patterns together, looking for consistent relationships.

Let's start by listing occurrences of ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. dax walm lug → green green green blue
2. dax zup walm wif walm → green yellow yellow yellow red red red
3. dax walm zup lug dax → green green green yellow blue green
4. wif walm dax zup → red red red green yellow
5. zup dax lug walm zup → yellow green blue blue blue yellow

In these examples, ""walm"" appears to consistently correspond to a sequence in the output.

From the first example, ""walm"" occurs after ""dax"" and relates to three green outputs. In the second example, ""walm"" occurs twice and relates to two sequences of three colors each (red red red). In the third example, ""walm"" occurs after ""dax"" again and produces three greens. In the fourth example, ""walm"" produces three reds. Finally, in the fifth example, ""walm"" results in three blue outputs. 

The appearances of ""walm"" consistently produce outputs of three colors in a row. However, the color itself seems to be dependent on the word that immediately precedes it.

Examining the input preceding walm:
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is green green green.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is red red red.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is yellow yellow yellow.
- When the word immediately before ""walm"" is not provided or is ambiguous, the output is dictated by the last clear rule applied or defaults to blue blue blue, as seen in example 1 and 5.

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it triggers a sequence of three colors in the output, and the specific color is determined by the preceding word. If ""dax"" is the previous word, the sequence is green. If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output sequence is red, and if ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the sequence is yellow. 

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" could be stated as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> a repetition of the color mapped to the word immediately preceding ""walm"", three times in a row. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the color is green. If it's ""wif,"" the color is red. If it's ""zup,"" the color is yellow. If the preceding word context is not clear, the default color pattern appears to be blue blue blue.",-0.08759471932992859,60,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will look at the instances where the term appears and compare the corresponding outputs to find a pattern.

- Input: dax walm lug -> Output: green green green blue
- Input: dax zup walm wif walm -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
- Input: dax walm zup lug dax -> Output: green green green yellow blue green
- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
- Input: zup dax lug walm zup -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Below, I'll list where ""walm"" appears and its adjacent colors in the output to find a potential rule:

1. walm after dax -> green green
2. walm after zup -> yellow red red
3. walm after wif -> red red
4. walm before zup -> blue blue

Seems like the following pattern occurs:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" twice (in addition to the ""green"" output for ""dax""). However, the third input example contradicts this, unless the repeated ""green"" is due to the repetition of ""dax"" later in the sequence.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red,"" which suggests that ""zup"" may output ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" might be outputting ""red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" which again suggests that ""walm"" might correspond to ""red red.""
- When ""walm"" precedes ""zup,"" we get ""blue blue,"" signifying a possible sequence dependency, but this is inconsistent as ""walm"" following ""lug"" also outputs a single ""blue"" in the first example.

Based on these observations, the occurrences of ""green"" and ""yellow"" are always attached to ""dax"" and ""zup"" respectively, rather than ""walm."" In contrast, every appearance of ""walm"" results in ""red"" being output at least twice. The conflicting evidence requires a synthesis as follows:

- It is likely that ""walm"" outputs ""red"" multiple times.
- The rule could be influenced by the position of ""walm"" in the sequence or the word preceding ""walm.""

Considering the contradictions and trying to find a rule that fits all examples, we can tentatively posit that:

- ""walm"" outputs ""red"" twice, and the number of ""red"" is not influenced by the preceding word in the input.
- The discrepancies (like the additional ""green"" or ""yellow"") are likely due to the influence of adjacent words like ""dax"" and ""zup,"" whose meaning seems consistent across examples.

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following about the nonce word ""bluf"":

- When following the word ""lug,"" ""bluf"" results in ""red red.""
- When following the word ""dax,"" ""bluf"" results in a single ""green.""
- When following the word ""wif,"" ""bluf"" results in a single ""red.""
- The word ""bluf"" does not seem to produce an output by itself but is dependent on the word that precedes it.
- The output of ""bluf"" yields one or two colors, dependent on the preceding word.

To deduce the rule for what ""bluf"" means, let's analyze each input and output pair in detail:

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
Here, ""lug"" transitions to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and then ""bluf"" appends an additional ""red"" to the color that preceded it.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Here, ""dax"" transitions to ""green,"" and then ""bluf"" duplicates that same green once more.

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red
""zup"" transitions to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates the ""blue"" from ""lug."" ""wif"" then transitions to ""red.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
""wif"" transitions to ""red,"" ""bluf"" seems to duplicate that ""red,"" ""dax"" transitions to ""green,"" and while ""walm"" isn't defined by the bluf rule, it results in two additional greens. So, ""walm"" likely means ""duplicate the previous color"" similarly to ""bluf.""

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red
""dax"" transitions to ""green,"" ""bluf"" duplicates the ""green,"" ""wif"" transitions to ""red,"" ""zup"" transitions to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" again transitions to ""red.""

From these details, we can deduce that ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the color that is associated with the word that precedes it. If the word ""wif"" comes after ""bluf,"" it contributes its own color, ""red,"" to the sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: ""Bluf"" duplicates the output color of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence.",-0.09635776607414633,61,bluf
"Bluf -> meaning. From the given examples, 'bluf' seems to be a rule that dictates that the output should be a repeated color word that corresponds to the immediately preceding word. The number of times the color word is repeated seems to be determined by a numeric value intrinsic to the preceding word.

Rule:
- 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue', and when followed by 'bluf', the output is 'blue' repeated twice (as seen in ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"" and ""zup lug bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue red"").
- 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green', and when followed by 'bluf', the color 'green' is repeated twice in the output (as in ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" and ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red"").
- 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red', and is repeated once following 'bluf' (shown in ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"" and ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"").

Based on this pattern, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' indicates the color word before it should be repeated a number of times that is one more than its intrinsic numeric value (possibly associated with each specific word), which can currently be hypothesized as:
- 'lug' has an intrinsic value of 1
- 'dax' has an intrinsic value of 1
- 'wif' has an intrinsic value of 0

Thus:

2. The color that is repeated corresponds to the color indicated by the word immediately preceding ""walm"": 
   - ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""
   - ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look at the examples provided and identify any patterns related to ""walm"" and the output colors. We will analyze each example one by one:

1. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - Before ""walm,"" we see ""zup,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""dax."" After ""walm,"" the sequence ""yellow green"" occurs, which doesn't match the preceding colors. Notably, the first color after ""walm"" is yellow.

2. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - ""Walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif."" The first color after ""walm"" is red.

3. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the first color after ""walm"" is blue, which is the color associated with ""lug.""

4. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   - ""Walm"" is followed by ""zup"" in this example. The first color after ""walm"" is yellow, which is the color associated with ""zup.""

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - The color sequence ""blue blue blue"" follows ""lug walm,"" suggesting ""walm"" might be associated with the color blue, similar to ""lug.""

Upon examining these examples, we can spot that ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat its associated color. For instance, after ""walm,"" the word ""dax"" makes a green repeat, ""zup"" leads to a recurring yellow, ""lug"" to a repeating blue, and ""wif"" to a repeating red.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" causes the color associated with the next word to repeat.",-0.07602412230531459,62,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
Notice that before ""walm"", there are two different words ""zup"" and ""wif"", and after ""walm"", the word ""dax"" is used. The output for ""walm"" here is ""yellow"".

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
Here, ""walm"" is surrounded by ""dax"" before it and ""wif"" after it. The output for ""walm"" in this case is ""green"".

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
Here, the words around ""walm"" are ""zup"" and ""lug"". The output associated with ""walm"" is ""yellow"".

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
In this input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""zup"". The output for ""walm"" is ""red"".

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
In this example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"". The output for ""walm"" is ""blue"".

From the examples, we can extract that the word ""walm"" takes its color based on the word that comes directly before it. The rule seems to be:

- If ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", then ""walm"" results in ""yellow"".
- If ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", then ""walm"" results in ""green"".
- If ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", then ""walm"" results in ""red"".
- If ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", then ""walm"" results in ""blue"".

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to adopt the color associated with the word that comes right before it:

Input: wif zup walm dax zup

- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""walm"" here leads to a yellow following zup.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green when it follows ""walm,"" but in other contexts, it corresponds to green.

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, but we can't infer anything about ""walm"" from this input since there is no color change before or after it.

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue when it follows ""walm.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""walm"" leads to red before zup, which corresponds to yellow.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- There's no conclusive color change associated with ""walm"" here as it is followed by the same color that precedes it.

From these examples, we can see that ""walm"" doesn't have a consistent color output associated with it. However, we can observe that ""walm"" often results in the repetition of the color that follows it.

For instance:
- After ""wif zup walm"" the color yellow is repeated.
- After ""zup walm lug"" the color blue is repeated.

Based on this pattern, we might infer that ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat its associated color.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- wif correlates with red.
- zup correlates with yellow.
- The output after ""walm"" is yellow, and the word following ""walm"" is ""dax"" which correlates with green.

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- dax correlates with green.
- The output after ""walm"" is green, and the word following ""walm"" is ""wif"" which correlates with red.

- zup correlates with yellow.
- lug correlates with blue, and ""walm"" appears before ""lug"" which corresponds with blue.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- dax correlates with green.
- lug correlates with blue.
- The output after ""lug"" is consistent with the color mapping of ""lug"" which is blue.

From the first and second examples:

We see that ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" in the first example and after ""dax"" in the second, leading to a repeated color (""yellow"" after ""zup"" and ""green"" after ""dax""). This might suggest that ""walm"" means to repeat the last color that appeared.

""Input: zup walm lug wif"" follows the same pattern, where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" leads to another ""yellow."" Below, ""lug"" breaks the pattern and introduces a ""blue,"" followed by ""wif,"" which results in ""red.""

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" leads to the output of a color being repeated three times. The color that is repeated is determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here are the word-color associations that can be inferred from the examples:

- ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue (indicating ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue)
- ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue blue blue (indicating ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, while ""lug"" still corresponds to blue)

Thus, 'walm' seems to cause a repetition of the color of the word or word sequence immediately preceding it, with the number of repetitions possibly being determined by the position or form of 'lug'.

- lug -> blue

Given these associations, we see that whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. This correspondence holds true regardless of ""zup""'s position in the sequence. So we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" as follows:

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce rules for how the nonce word ""bluf"" translates into a specific color in the output. One approach is to check for patterns in the input that consistently lead to the same color in the output.

Let's examine the discrepancies related to the occurrences of the word ""bluf"":

4. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""
5. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow red red""

Now let's try to find a pattern for ""bluf"":

- In the first and second examples, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output color is green, which matches ""dax"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is red, which matches ""wif"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and again the output is green, matching ""dax"".
- In the fifth, ""bluf"" first follows ""zup"" and then follows ""wif""; the output colors yellow and red correspond to ""zup"" and ""wif"", respectively.

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the preceding word.",-0.08636792712880202,64,bluf
"To determine what bluf means in this context, let's observe its association with output colors in each example.

1. zup dax bluf zup dax -> yellow green green yellow green

3. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
4. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
5. zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red

Here's what we can observe:

- In the first example, bluf is associated with the color green.
- In the second example, bluf is also associated with the color green.
- In the third example, bluf is associated with the color red.
- In the fourth example, bluf is associated with the color green.
- In the fifth example, bluf is associated with the color red.

The color corresponding to bluf is not constant; it changes depending on the context. To discern a pattern, let's assume bluf's meaning is influenced by the words that come before it. Here is what each bluf is preceded by:

1. zup dax bluf -> green
2. dax bluf -> green
3. wif bluf -> red
4. dax bluf -> green
5. wif bluf -> red

Now, we can see a pattern emerge:

- When bluf is preceded by dax, the output color is green.
- When bluf is preceded by wif, the output color is red.

So the rule seems to be that the meaning of bluf depends on the precedent word:

Rule: bluf -> changes color based on the preceding word. If preceded by dax, the color is green, and if preceded by wif, the color is red.",-0.09392064660870292,64,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine its relations to outputs in various positions and contexts.

1. In both the first example and the last example, the position of ""bluf"" corresponds to a color that is repeated. This suggests that ""bluf"" might mean to repeat the preceding color.
   
    - zup dax **bluf** zup dax -> yellow green **green** yellow green
    - zup **bluf** wif **bluf** -> yellow **yellow** red **red**

2. However, in the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" which doesn't follow the repeating pattern discerned earlier.

    - dax lug zup wif **bluf** dax -> green blue yellow red **red** green
    - lug wif lug dax **bluf** -> blue red blue green **green**

3. Taking a closer look, in the cases where ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" it is followed or preceded by the word ""wif,"" which generates ""red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might mean red only when in the context of ""wif.""

To synthesize, we can hypothesize the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" means to replicate the preceding color, except when in the context of the word ""wif,"" in which case it means ""red.""

Thus, bluf -> meaning is context-dependent:

- When following other words that are not ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means to repeat the previous color.
- When in the context of ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means ""red.""",-0.5293189846279208,64,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the pattern between the input and the corresponding output colors.

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or is the first word, the output is yellow.
   - zup bluf -> yellow yellow
   - bluf zup -> yellow

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" the output color changes.
   - dax bluf -> green red
   - wif bluf -> red red

3. When ""bluf"" is the last word, the output is always green, regardless of the preceding word.
   - lug dax bluf -> blue green green
   - lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
   - zup dax bluf -> yellow green green

Given the pattern in which ""bluf"" follows certain words, the output color changes. So it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" might be context-dependent or may act as a modifier to the preceding word.

Let's form a rule based on the above points:

- If ""bluf"" is the first word or follows ""zup,"" it outputs yellow.
- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" it affects the output color to become red.
- If ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence, it outputs green.

2. When it precedes ""zup,"" it produces ""yellow.""
3. When it follows ""wif,"" it produces ""red.""
4. When it is the last word, it produces ""green.""
5. When ""bluf"" stands between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" both outputs are ""red.""

Given this, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that immediately precedes it. If the preceding word is ""dax"" or it is the last word in the sequence, the output is ""green."" If ""bluf"" precedes ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the relationship between the input and the output in each given example.

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Examining the outputs, it seems that the presence of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a repeated color in the output. The number of repetitions of the color corresponds to the number of words between ""walm"" and the next instance of ""walm"" or the end of the input.

Let's check this hypothesis with some detailed analysis:

1. In the first example, ""lug"" is translated to ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows, the ""blue"" is repeated three times.
2. In the second example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" followed by ""walm"" gives us a repeated ""blue,"" so now we have ""green blue blue blue.""
3. In the third example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" follows, causing ""red"" to be repeated three times, then ""dax"" (which is ""green""), provides a sequence of ""red red red green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" then ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and it's followed by ""wif walm"" which results in another series of ""red red red"" before ending with ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""
5. In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat three times, then ""dax"" (green), ""zup"" (yellow), and ""wif lug walm,"" where ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" as the repetition.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, and the number of times the color is repeated depends on the number of words preceding the next ""walm"" or the end of the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" the number of times equal to the count of words until the next ""walm"" or the end of the input sequence.",-0.07281945019376532,64,walm

2. Input: dax lug walm

   ""Dax"" triggers a ""green"" output, followed by ""lug"" which again triggers a triple ""blue"".

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   ""Wif"" seems to trigger a triple ""red"" and ""dax"" a single ""green"".

4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   This combines the patterns we've identified: ""wif"" triggers ""red red red"", ""zup"" triggers ""yellow"", and ""lug"" triggers ""blue"".

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   The outputs remain consistent with the triggers: ""wif"" -> ""red red red"", ""zup"" -> ""yellow"", ""dax"" -> ""green"", ""lug"" -> ""blue"".

The word ""walm"" seems to be an indicator that amplifies or repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it. The rule can be expressed as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" induces a repetition of the color output generated by the preceding word. If the preceding word produces a ""blue"", ""green"", or ""red"" output, the presence of ""walm"" turns it into a triple instance of that color.

Therefore:

walm -> Causes the word directly before it to produce three instances of its corresponding color as an output.",-0.09228531317762242,64,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition in the output of the color that follows it in the input. Let's analyze the examples:

1. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" — ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is three repetitions of the color blue, associated with ""lug"".
2. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"" — ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" again and is tripled in the output following the single appearance of the color green, which is associated with ""dax"".
3. ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green""— ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" which causes ""red"" to be repeated thrice followed by the color associated with ""dax"", which is green.
4. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"" — ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" causes three reds, followed by ""zup"" which seems to correspond to yellow, then ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, another ""wif walm"" causing another three reds, followed by another ""zup"" yielding yellow again.
5. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" leads to ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue"" — ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" results in three reds, ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, followed by ""wif"" which is red and lastly ""lug walm"" leading to the color blue being tripled.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to cause the next color word in the sequence to be repeated three times. Considering that in examples 3 and 5, ""dax"" follows ""walm"", and the output is a single instance of ""green"", this indicates that ""walm"" only affects the output when followed by a color word, not by another input word like ""dax"". In situations where ""walm"" is not directly followed by a color-associated word, it does not repeat any colors (as shown in example 5 with ""dax"" following ""walm"").

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately following it to be repeated three times in the output. If the word that immediately follows ""walm"" is not associated with a color, there is no repetition.",-0.09523364763374491,64,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rules for the nonce word ""walm"" and how it maps to colors in the output:

1. ""walm"" on its own results in a repetition of a color.
2. The color that is repeated seems to be associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""
3. Each word other than ""walm"" corresponds to a specific color:
    - ""lug"" corresponds to blue,
    - ""dax"" corresponds to green,
    - ""wif"" corresponds to red, and
    - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

Therefore, we observe that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word right before it in the sequence. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of times ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" or ""yellow"" are produced by the preceding terms in the sequence plus one extra repetition. Here is the pattern observed:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (one ""lug"" gives us one ""blue,"" and ""walm"" adds two more ""blue"" to the output).
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"" (one ""dax"" gives us one ""green,"" one ""lug"" gives us one ""blue,"" and ""walm"" adds two more ""blue"" to the output).
- ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green"" (one ""wif"" gives us one ""red,"" and ""walm"" adds two more ""red"" before the sequence moves on to ""dax,"" giving us ""green"").
- and so on for the rest of the examples.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes a repetition of the color associated with the previous word, with the number of repetitions being equal to the total number of that color produced by the word preceding ""walm"" plus one additional repetition.",-0.7211898355367348,64,walm
"Considering the repeating patterns and consistent transformations from the input to the output, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color that follows its key word. The key words and their respective colors are:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

When ""walm"" follows one of these key words, it causes a repetition of the color associated with the specific key word. The number of repetitions seems to be dependent on the respective key word's position in the input relative to ""walm"". Specifically, one more repetition than the position of the key word before ""walm"". 

For example:
- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" is at position 1 before ""walm"", thus ""blue"" is repeated once (1+1 = 2 times in total).
- In ""wif walm dax"", ""wif"" is at position 1 before ""walm"", thus ""red"" is repeated three times (since there is one ""wif"" at the beginning and ""wif walm"" repeats it two more times for a total of three).

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous key word, where the number of repetitions is the position of that key word directly before ""walm"" plus one.",-0.7945063098811224,64,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's compare the input and the corresponding output in each example:

1. Input: dax lug wif

2. Input: lug bluf wif

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

4. Input: dax lug wif (repeated)

5. Input: lug wif

Analyzing the patterns, we can see that:

- The word ""lug"" always corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
- None of the example outputs contain any other translation for ""lug.""
- ""lug"" appears to be position-independent as it corresponds to ""blue"" whether it's in the middle or at the end of the input.

Based on the above examples, every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.08432804714782717,65,dax
"To induce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs. 

In the first example:
- There is one ""dax"" and the word ""green"" appears three times in the output.
- The word ""walm"" is also in the input and ""green"" appears again in the output.
- Lastly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

In the second example:
- There are two instances of ""dax,"" and the word ""green"" appears twice in the output.
- ""Zup"" is in the input corresponding to ""yellow""
- ""Wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".

In the third example:
- ""Dax"" leads to a ""green"" in the output.
- ""Lug"" leads to ""blue"".

In the fourth example:
- ""Zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""Dax"" leads to ""green"".
- ""Walm"" corresponds to ""green"".

In the fifth example:
- ""Dax"" leads to ""green"".
- ""Walm"" leads to an additional ""green"".
- ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, it translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" is not directly translated, but given that the output sequence always contains the same number of elements as the input, and that the output sequence for ""bluf"" is consistent with the colors already deduced, it can be assumed that ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""

From the examples:

- ""lug wif dax wif"" translates to ""blue red green red.""
- ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue.""

"Based on the given examples, we can analyze each instance where ""bluf"" appears and observe what color it is associated with in the output. 

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears twice. The first instance corresponds to ""green,"" and the second to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the last example, ""bluf"" appears twice. The first instance corresponds to ""blue,"" and the second to ""blue.""

It seems that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed output; instead, the output color associated with ""bluf"" can vary. However, taking a closer look, we see that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color word that appeared immediately before it. 

- In example one, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which resulted in ""blue,"" thus ""bluf"" also results in ""blue.""
- In example two, the first ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which yielded ""green,"" making the first ""bluf"" also yield ""green,"" and the second ""bluf"" follows the first ""zup,"" which yielded ""yellow,"" making the second ""bluf"" also yield ""yellow.""
- In example three, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" again, and so it yields ""yellow"" (the same output as ""lug"").
- In example four, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and thus results in ""red.""
- In the last example, both instances of ""bluf"" follow ""lug,"" which results in ""blue,"" thus both instances of ""bluf"" also result in ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule of ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the same as the color word before it. If no color word precedes ""bluf,"" it repeats the color of the closest prior color word.",-0.9913077452003064,65,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color. Looking closer, we can see that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" as shown by the third and fifth sets of input and output:

"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to change its associated color output based on its position relative to other words. The pattern indicates that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color output of the word that immediately precedes it. 

Put differently, when ""walm"" appears in the sequence, we repeat the color output of the word that comes directly before ""walm"" as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned. 

For example:

- In the first input, ""zup walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" meaning ""walm"" caused ""zup"" to be repeated twice more, for a total of three ""yellow"" outputs.
- In the second input, there is no repetition because ""walm"" is at the end and followed by ""dax,"" which has a green output.
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which has a blue output, resulting in two additional blue outputs.
- In the fourth input, ""zup walm"" again results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth input, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" cause ""wif"" to be repeated twice more.

Therefore, walm -> meaning is that walm causes the output color of the previous word to be repeated.",-1.0216198114211539,65,walm
"Analyzing the given examples where the nonce word ""walm"" appears, we can make some observations:

1. After the appearance of ""walm,"" the output color sequence includes additional repetitions of the color corresponding to the word immediately following ""walm"". 
2. The color that repeats is not inherently tied to ""walm,"" but rather to whatever word comes next. 

Looking at the examples:

- Example 1: ""walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" which means ""dax"" corresponds to color ""yellow"" and it repeats once.
- Example 2: ""walm dax"" appears again and ""yellow"" is repeated, confirming the pattern.
- Example 3: ""walm wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating ""wif"" corresponds to color ""red"" and the presence of a second ""walm"" reinforces the pattern of repetition.
- Example 4: ""walm"" alone leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that the absence of a word following ""walm"" defaults to repeating the color corresponding to ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- Example 5: ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" confirming ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""walm"" causes a repetition of red.

Rule: walm -> triggers a repetition of the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence. If no word follows ""walm,"" it triggers a repetition of the color corresponding to ""zup.""

"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" appears to add the color red to the output, and it may concatenate this color to the color before it, repetitively, depending on the number of times ""wif"" occurs in sequence. 

For instance, in the first example, after ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" we get ""blue red yellow red red red,"" which indicates that after ""lug"" which corresponds to blue and ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, the occurrence of ""wif"" twice adds two reds following the yellow and an additional red after the second ""wif."" Meanwhile, in ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" after ""zup"" adds two reds, likely because ""bluf"" is also present, which doesn't seem to correspond to anything on its own, but might affect the output of ""wif.""

However, in the example ""zup wif lug dax,"" we only see one red following ""zup,"" and this is followed by the colors corresponding to ""lug"" and ""dax."" This might be because ""wif"" only occurs once here, and there are words following ""wif"" that correspond to unique colors.

When ""wif"" occurs alone at the end, as in ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif,"" it appears to only add one red color, possibly because there is no word after ""wif"" to determine further repetition.

In summary, ""wif"" seems to mean that red should be added to the sequence, but the number of reds repeated depends on the context of the words that surround it, indicating that there might be a rule about the words following ""wif"" influencing the number of reds that should be added.

Rule: wif -> adds one or more repetitions of red, with the number of reds possibly dependent on the surrounding words or the position of ""wif"" within the sequence.",-0.5875530184932325,67,wif

- ""bluf wif"": ""bluf"" is not shown alone, but ""bluf"" followed by ""wif"" becomes red.
- ""walm wif"" is not given, but ""walm"" alone is yellow and could be presumed to become red if followed by ""wif"".

1. In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output includes a ""red"" following it.
2. The presence of ""wif"" does not seem to affect the colors that come before it; other nonce words retain their associated colors regardless of ""wif.""
3. ""Wif"" does not have any additional outputs associated with it beyond a single ""red,"" suggesting that it represents a single concept or entity.

Analyzing the patterns, it seems ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the outputs. Another pattern we can observe is that each word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output.

To confirm this, we see that regardless of position, ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" in the output. Also, other words like ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" consistently lead to ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""red"" respectively.

2. ""zup lug"" results in ""yellow blue"" - ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""
3. The fact that ""zup"" can be interchanged with ""lug"" to form ""lug zup"" and still consistently output ""blue yellow"" indicates that ""zup""s meaning is independent of its position.
4. In ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" where multiple colors are in the output (""blue red green green green yellow""), ""zup"" still corresponds to the last color, ""yellow.""
5. ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" seems to multiply the previous color, and ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" as the last color, unaffected by ""walm.""

The rule is consistent across all examples.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the commonalities across each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: dax bluf zup | Output: green green yellow

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug | Output: yellow yellow red green blue

3. Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red

4. Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green

5. Input: dax bluf wif | Output: green green red

Based on these inputs and outputs, we can observe:

- When the word ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is always ""green green"" for those two words, suggesting that ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" independently and dictates the color ""green"" for ""bluf"" when preceding it directly.
  
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" directly, the word after ""bluf"" tends to result in ""yellow,"" unless the word is ""wif,"" which correlates with ""red.""

- ""bluf"" results in different colors (""yellow"" in example 1 and ""green"" in examples 3 and 4) when followed by different words or sequences. It does not maintain a consistent output color, indicating that ""bluf"" may change its output based on the surrounding words.

- ""bluf"" yields red in the presence of ""wif,"" no matter its position, whether ""wif"" comes before or after it (as seen in examples 2, 3, and 5).

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" is a context-dependent placeholder that changes its output based on the adjacent word(s). Specifically, it seems to duplicate the color indicated by the word that immediately precedes it. However, when followed by ""wif,"" it dictates red, suggesting an exception to the preceding rule or an additional rule when paired with ""wif.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word preceding it, except when followed by ""wif,"" in which case it is ""red.""",-0.1058979140090633,67,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs of each example. 

Here's what we have:

1. Input: dax bluf zup | Output: green green yellow
2. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug | Output: yellow yellow red green blue
3. Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red
4. Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green
5. Input: dax bluf wif | Output: green green red

First, note that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in every instance. The colors appear to remain consistent for these words across all examples.

Now let's analyze the word ""bluf."" In the 1st and the 5th examples, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output for ""bluf"" in these cases is ""green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might mirror the color of the word immediately preceding it.

However, in the 3rd example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"". But the output for ""bluf"" this time is also ""red,"" which further supports the rule we are deducing that ""bluf"" could mirror the color of the preceding word.

In the 2nd example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" but the output for ""bluf"" is a different color, ""red,"" which contradicts the rule we proposed from the other examples.

In the 4th example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green"" and indeed ""bluf"" is also ""green"" in the output, which supports the mirroring rule.

Given that there is just one instance that contradicts the rule and all other instances support it, it is possible that the single contradiction could be an error, or there may be an additional rule at work in that example that we aren't able to deduce with the given data.

Based on the majority of the examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately before it in the sequence.

Therefore, we can tentatively propose:

bluf -> Meaning: Assuming the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",-0.11562584895258228,67,bluf
"From the given examples, we can deduce a possible meaning or rule for ""bluf."" Let's analyze the examples and their corresponding outputs.

In example 1, ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow."" Assuming ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"" (based on the other examples provided), we can infer that ""bluf"" may also translate to ""green,"" since it shares the same output color as ""dax.""

However, we need to confirm this hypothesis with the other examples.

In example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by a unique output ""red"" that is not repeated for other words in the sequence. This indicates that ""bluf"" might introduce a change or is not consistent with a single color.

In example 3, when ""bluf"" is at the end, the sequence ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red."" The new information here is that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" it also corresponds to ""red.""

Example 4, ""zup dax bluf,"" gives us ""yellow green green,"" further suggesting that when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it takes on the color green.

Finally, example 5, ""dax bluf wif,"" has the sequence ""green green red,"" which shows ""bluf"" being green again following ""dax.""

From this analysis, we can propose a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule:
""bluf"" takes on the color of the noun that immediately precedes it. If ""dax"" (green) comes before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is green. If ""wif"" (red) comes before or after ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" is red. If ""bluf"" stands alone after ""dax"" or before ""wif,"" it will maintain the color of the noun it is most immediately associated with in the sequence.

So:
bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding noun, or maintains a color when in close association with a noun that has a known color.",-0.6550662574324052,67,bluf
"Based on the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax."" However, when ""bluf"" is placed after ""wif,"" it translates to the color ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" however, there isn't enough data to establish a consistent rule for its color representation.

Therefore, the rule that can be deduced from these examples is that ""bluf"" takes on a color based on its position and preceding word in the string:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" its output is ""green.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" its output is ""red.""

In the absence of information about its behavior after ""zup,"" it's ambiguous and we cannot draw a definitive conclusion.

- ""dax lug walm zup wif"" includes a 'walm' after 'lug' (blue) resulting in ""blue blue blue"", and then 'zup' (yellow) and 'wif' (red) follow without repetitions.
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" which indicates that the color associated with 'zup' (yellow) is tripled due to 'walm'.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red"", where 'walm' triples the red color which is associated with 'wif'.

"Analyzing the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be associated with repeating the color corresponding to the preceding word multiple times. Here's how:

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and its associated color is blue. The output is blue repeated four times.
- In the second example, following this pattern, ""lug"" is again followed by ""walm"" and the output for ""lug walm"" maintains a repeated blue color. New words ""zup"" and ""wif"" have their own colors.
- In the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. The output is yellow three times.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which suggests ""walm"" is causing the most recent non-repeating color ('red' from ""wif"") to be output three times.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the color associated with ""dax"" is green. The output is green repeated three times.

So, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the last word mentioned before it a number of times, possibly dependent on the word that precedes it or a fixed pattern (three or four times in these examples). However, due to lack of enough variation with different words preceding ""walm"", it is not clear if the number of repetitions is dependent on the previous word or fixed.

"Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the relationship between the input and output as follows:

- Whenever ""walm"" follows a word, the output is a sequence of the color that corresponds to that word, repeated a number of times.
- The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the word sequence of the input.

For instance:

- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and since ""walm"" is the third word, ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" being the second word, ""yellow"" is repeated two times.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" is the second word, thus ""green"" is repeated two times.

Every instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs is directly translated to ""yellow"" in the corresponding outputs.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" influences the pattern of color names in the output, but its effect is dependent on the preceding word. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow

5. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

From these inputs and outputs, it can be noted that the output always contains a sequence of the same color, followed by a change in color after ""walm"" appears. This pattern can be observed in each case:

- In the first example, a sequence of ""blue"" is followed by ""yellow"" after the first instance of ""walm.""
- In the second example, after ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue"" when before that combination it was ""green"" and ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""blue blue"" turns into ""blue yellow"" following ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""red"" is repeated until ""walm"" where it turns into ""red blue.""
- In the fifth example, a string of ""red"" is followed by ""green"" after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" acts as a signal to change the color in the sequence to the next color. If we assume a color order of blue, yellow, red, and green in a cycle, then ""walm"" could be seen as a ""shift"" operation to the next color in this order. But we're also missing the conditions where ""walm"" would transition the color from red to blue, or yellow to red. There is no example with ""walm"" placed after ""red"" and only one example with ""walm"" after ""yellow,"" which leads to red. With the given data, it is best we can deduce without further examples.

So, the rule could be described as:
walm -> Shifts the current color sequence to the next color based on a set order (assumed order: blue, yellow, red, green).",-0.08022980219985718,68,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let us look at each example and figure out a pattern or rule.

Input: lug walm zup lug walm  
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""lug,"" before and after the occurrence of ""walm,"" we see ""blue blue blue"" and then ""yellow"" for ""walm,"" then ""blue blue blue"" again after the second ""walm.""

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug  
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Again, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and where ""walm"" appears in the sequence, the color ""yellow"" is switched for ""blue.""

Input: lug walm zup wif  
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Once more, ""walm"" leads into ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is the color associated with ""walm.""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup  
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the color for ""walm"" is ""red.""

Input: wif walm dax  
Output: red red red green

In this example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the color for ""walm"" is ""red.""

From these examples, we can notice that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color. However, what stands out is that ""walm"" takes the color of the word that follows it. If ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" the color is yellow; if ""walm"" is followed by any other word, the color is red. Although we can't confirm this with just these examples, as ""lug"" and ""dax"" we don't have examples directly after ""walm"", we can propose a rule based on the available data.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" takes the color of the word that follows it. If ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" the color is yellow; otherwise, the color is red.",-0.08767375454759184,68,walm
"Based on the input and output examples provided, where the nonce word ""walm"" is used, we can attempt to deduce a pattern or rule for what ""walm"" represents:

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
Pattern: The output has ""blue"" except after the word ""walm,"" which is followed by ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
Pattern: Same as before, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue,"" except for when it is preceded by ""lug"" and ""dax,"" in which case it is followed by a ""blue"" and then a ""yellow.""

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red
Pattern: ""Wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" is again followed by ""yellow.""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
Pattern: ""Walm"" is preceded by ""red"" and followed by ""red,"" then ""blue."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
Pattern: ""Walm"" is between ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""green"" for ""dax.""

Considering the above patterns, it seems that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color output, but its presence modifies the color that follows it. When ""walm"" occurs after ""lug,"" it is followed by ""yellow"" instead of ""blue."" When it follows ""wif,"" it intensifies the repetition of the color that ""wif"" represents, which is ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" affects the following color. When ""walm"" is used after ""lug,"" the pattern is that ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow."" Otherwise, ""walm"" repeats the color output that is generated by the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> modifies the following color or repeats the preceding color under specific conditions.",-0.09319235527795917,68,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the meaning of ""walm"" is dependent on its position relative to other words. Let's analyze the patterns:

In example 1, ""lug walm"" is consistently followed by ""blue blue blue,"" regardless of what comes before or after them. Notice that the sequence always starts with ""lug"" and is then followed by ""walm,"" suggesting that the pair ""lug walm"" translates to the triplet ""blue blue blue.""

However, in example 2, when ""lug walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup,"" the output sequence is ""green blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""lug walm"" still results in ""blue blue blue,"" but the surrounding words (""dax"" and ""zup"") influence the output to include ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

In example 3, ""lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow red."" The ""lug walm"" still translates to ""blue blue blue,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" The pattern holds that ""walm"" contributes to a sequence of ""blue"" colors when preceded by ""lug.""

In example 4, ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow,"" where ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug."" The ""walm"" here does not translate directly to ""blue"" colors. Additionally, ""lug"" after ""walm"" translates to a single ""blue.""

In example 5, ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" Thus, ""walm"" when preceded by ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Combining the insights from these examples, it appears that ""walm"" signals a repetition of the color associated with the previous word (either ""lug"" resulting in blue, ""wif"" resulting in red), extending for three repetitions. This rule seems consistent except when ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" where it is represented as one blue instead of three.

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the meaning is ""blue blue blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the meaning is ""red red red."" These repetitions, however, can be interrupted or altered by the following word, especially if that word is ""lug.""",-0.49594766258714285,68,walm
"Considering the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to change the subsequent word colors to blue until a different color is encountered. After ""walm"" appears, all ""lug"" are translated to blue and continue to do so until a new color word interrupts the sequence.

Here are the observed rules from the examples:

- ""lug walm"" always leads to ""blue blue blue""
- The sequence remains blue after ""walm"" until a different word for a color appears (for example, ""zup"" for yellow or ""wif"" for red).
- After ""walm"", words that are not ""lug"" are turned red until we hit a new color word (seen in the last two examples).

Based on this, we can deduce:

1. ""lug"" translates to blue.
2. ""zup"" translates to yellow.
3. ""wif"" translates to red.
4. ""dax"" translates to green.
5. ""walm"" seems to cause the word ""lug"" to repeat the color blue, and if the subsequent word is not a color indicator (lug, zup, wif, or dax), it becomes red until a new color word is mentioned.

With this in mind, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

5. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   Note: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" somehow changes the output to ""green green.""

Across all examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Hence, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.06972380501899998,69,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze its correspondence with the colors in each example:

1. ""wif walm dax"" maps to ""red red red green""
2. ""dax bluf zup"" maps to ""green green yellow""
3. ""dax lug dax lug wif"" maps to ""green blue green blue red""
4. ""zup bluf dax lug"" maps to ""yellow yellow green blue""
5. ""lug zup dax walm"" maps to ""blue yellow green green green""

Analyzing the patterns, we observe the following:

- When ""dax"" is the first word, the first color is green.
- ""dax"" is followed by different colors when it is preceded by different words.
- In the third example, ""dax"" occurs twice, both times followed by ""lug"" and resulting in the same sequence ""green blue.""

By inspection, it appears that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. The other words must then correspond to the other colors according to their position and following words. 

However, we need to check if there's any context-dependent aspect to ""dax"" that could affect its meaning:

- In the third input where ""dax"" repeats (""dax lug dax lug wif""), it consistently maps to ""green blue,"" which suggests ""dax"" indeed has a stable meaning.
- In the last input, ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" follows ""zup"" (which maps to ""yellow"") and precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" retains the meaning of ""green"" even when surrounded by other words.
  
The rule appears to be that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.08343410102680955,69,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns in each example.

1. The input ""wif walm dax"" leads to the output ""red red red green."" We notice that ""wif"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""red"". ""Dax"" is the only word that corresponds to ""green"".

2. In the input ""dax bluf zup,"" the output is ""green green yellow."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again, and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green,"" while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. For the input ""dax lug dax lug wif,"" the output is ""green blue green blue red."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in both instances, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. The input ""zup bluf dax lug"" results in the output ""yellow yellow green blue."" Here, both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" coincide with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" goes with ""blue.""

5. In the input ""lug zup dax walm,"" every ""lug"" and ""zup"" lead to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively, and the sequence ""dax walm"" produces the output ""green green green.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" irrespective of its position in the sequence. According to other examples given, no other word that translates to ""green"" appears. Therefore, ""dax"" seems to stand for the color ""green"" universally in these examples.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.10293260075416664,69,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems attached to a specific output color, green. However, examining the other words and their corresponding color outputs also suggests a pattern.

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" specifically results in green, because ""wif"" and ""walm"" produce ""red red.""
- In the second example, ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow,"" which could imply ""dax"" is green and ""bluf"" turns to green independently of ""dax,"" while ""zup"" is yellow.
- The third example, ""dax lug dax lug wif"" equates to ""green blue green blue red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" to red, with ""dax"" consistently leading to green.
- The fourth and fifth examples further showcase that ""dax"" consistently maps to green, while the other words map to their respective colors.

By comparing the input and output across all examples, the following color mappings can be deduced for the input words:
- wif -> red
- walm -> red
- bluf -> green (note that this might be green only following a ""dax,"" but there's not enough information to confirm this)
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

The rule seems to be that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output.

"Based on the examples provided and the outputs corresponding to each, a pattern can be observed, which suggests that the word ""bluf"" is associated with the color of the word immediately preceding it. Here's the pattern:

In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" means the color green when following ""dax."" However, in the same example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it means yellow.

In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" which means that when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color associated is red.

In the third example, ""wif bluf"" again translates to ""red red,"" but ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" indicating that when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it means blue.

In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""green green red red,"" which seems to break the pattern, but this can be rationalized if we consider ""walm wif"" as a combined term translating to ""green green,"" and then ""bluf"" follows meaning red, as previously determined.

In the final example, ""dax bluf"" once again translates to ""green green,"" reinforcing the rule from the first example.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word immediately before it. This is further supported by the last example where only ""dax bluf"" is present, and the corresponding output is ""green green.""

So the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color of the word directly preceding it.",-0.708507548303068,69,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the words and the colored outputs. The repeated occurrences of input words and their corresponding colors will be our primary hints.

1. The word ""dax"" consistently leads to ""green.""
2. The word ""wif"" consistently leads to ""red.""
3. The word ""lug"" consistently leads to ""blue.""
4. The word ""zup"" consistently leads to ""yellow.""
5. Whenever ""bluf"" appears between any two identical words (dax, lug) or before a word that has not appeared before (wif), it results in the color of the ensuing word (green in the case of dax, blue for lug, red for wif).
6. In the third example, the second ""bluf"" leads to ""blue,"" even though it follows ""lug"" which has already been associated with ""blue.""
7. In the last example with only two words ""dax bluf,"" it results in ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" matches the color of the preceding word.

From these observations, a pattern emerges for ""bluf"":

bluf -> meaning: When located between two identical words or directly before a word, ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the following or preceding word. When it follows a word that it has not directly preceded before, it induces a repeat of the color associated with the previous word.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to affect the output related to the word immediately before it. When ""bluf"" follows a word, the color of that preceding word is repeated in the output. Here is the observed pattern:

- In Example 1, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" twice, and both times the color ""green"" that corresponds to ""dax"" is repeated.
- In Example 2, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and its corresponding color ""red"" is repeated in the output after ""bluf"".

2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""

4. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
   - ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""blue"" three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with that word, repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.11139690157145352,69,walm
"To figure out the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each input and its corresponding output.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- Before ""walm"" we have ""lug,"" and after ""walm"" there's no word. The output gives us three instances of ""blue,"" which seems to correspond to ""lug.""

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
- Before ""walm"" we have ""wif,"" and after ""walm,"" the word is ""lug."" In the output, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Notably, after ""walm,"" the pattern of the color corresponding to the following word (""lug"" -> ""blue"") repeats one more time, suggesting that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the next color in sequence.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- The input has ""dax"" before ""walm,"" and no word after. The output is three ""green"" which seems to correspond to ""dax"" alone.

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
- The pattern here is more complex, but if we follow the rule suggested earlier, after ""walm"" the color corresponding to ""dax"" (""green"") is repeated once, indicating ""walm"" might cause the repetition of the next color. The rest of the sequence matches the color to the word that's given before each ""walm"" instance.

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red
- Prior to ""walm,"" we have ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Following ""walm,"" there's no word, but we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The output after ""walm"" repeats the color ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

Based on these observations, we can conclude that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color that corresponds to the following word to be repeated three times. If there's no word following ""walm,"" then the color that corresponds to the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times instead. Thus, we could say:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the following word thrice. If there is no following word, repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word thrice.",-0.12478339313569767,69,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first observe the examples and notice the relationships between the inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
5. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red""

Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can notice a pattern that each time ""walm"" is used, the output repeats the color associated with the word preceding the ""walm"" thrice.

Let's detail the pattern:
- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" follows, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red.""
- The third example features ""dax"" before ""walm,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" with ""walm"" producing ""green green green.""
- The fourth example is longer but follows the same pattern for ""lug walm"" and ""dax walm.""
- The fifth example contains ""wif walm,"" and since ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" the result is ""red red red"" after ""walm.""

Based on the observed patterns, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times.

So, the definition would be:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-0.1409352249963372,69,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" results in the output of a color repeated three times. The specific color that is repeated three times corresponds to the word that directly precedes ""walm."" Here are the associations:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
  
From the fifth example, we notice that ""lug wif zup wif walm"" results in ""blue red yellow red red red."" We can understand that ""wif walm"" must yield ""red red red,"" since we see this pattern from the second input and output pair. This means that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can conclude the rule as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.",-0.8972791887802329,69,walm
"Observing the outputs for each input containing ""walm,"" we can see a pattern where a specific color is repeated three times. The color that is repeated seems to tie back to the word that appears before ""walm"" in the input. Below I will list the observed associations:

    - lug -> blue
- ""wif"" appears before ""walm"" and yields the output ""red red red""
    - wif -> red
- ""dax"" appears before ""walm"" and yields the output ""green green green""

- A singular ""wif"" produced just ""red.""
- ""zup wif"" produced ""yellow red."" In this case, ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" again to ""red.""

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as:

1. Whenever the word ""wif"" appears by itself, the output is ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is ""green red.""

4. When ""wif"" appears twice within an input as in ""wif lug wif,"" the output associated with each ""wif"" remains ""red,"" with an additional color ""blue"" corresponding to the word ""lug"" in between. 

We can induce that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. It also seems that the word preceding ""wif"" (if any) adds another color before ""red.""

Therefore, the rule we can discern is: 
wif -> red

When ""wif"" is accompanied by another word, such as ""dax"" or ""zup,"" it produces an additional color corresponding to that particular word before the color ""red.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look at the instances where it appears and determine what is consistent about the output when ""bluf"" is part of the input.

Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: dax bluf zup

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

3. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

4. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

5. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red

In every example where ""bluf"" appears, the color directly after ""bluf"" is the same color that corresponds to the word before ""bluf."" This suggests that ""bluf"" functions as a word that duplicates the color associated with the previous word.

Let's verify this rule:

- In Example 1, ""dax"" gives green, followed by ""bluf,"" which also gives green.
- In Example 2, ""zup"" gives yellow, followed immediately by ""bluf,"" which results in another yellow.
- In Example 4, ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""bluf"" immediately afterward also translates to blue.

This pattern holds in all other examples provided.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the previous word.",-0.06482108586,70,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns that correlate with the appearance of ""bluf"" in the input and the corresponding word in the output. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" outputs ""green green yellow."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" also outputs ""green,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""dax."" Let's examine further examples to test this theory.

2. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" outputs ""yellow yellow red green red yellow."" Here, ""zup"" remains consistent with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""wif"" appears to mean ""red."" Notably, ""bluf"" in this instance is output as ""yellow,"" which previously aligned with ""zup,"" not ""green"" or ""dax"" as initially hypothesized.

3. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" ""Lug"" aligns with ""blue."" In this series, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" the color associated with ""zup.""

4. ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue."" In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""blue,"" which is associated with ""lug.""

5. ""zup bluf wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow red."" In this case, ""bluf"" takes on the color ""yellow,"" which once again is correlated with ""zup.""

Given these observations, it's clear that ""bluf"" corresponds not to a consistent word, but rather to a rule. The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Notice in each output where ""bluf"" is involved, its color corresponds to the color of the preceding word in the input.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-0.10017632521077112,70,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correlation between its presence in the input and the corresponding output:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
3. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red

Analyzing these examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to a color in the output that is the same color as the word immediately preceding it:

1. (dax) bluf -> (green) green
2. (zup) bluf -> (yellow) yellow
3. (zup) bluf -> (yellow) yellow
4. (lug) bluf -> (blue) blue
5. (zup) bluf -> (yellow) yellow

Based on these observations, the word ""bluf"" is used to produce an output color that repeats the color indicated by the word before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.",-0.10520178345096388,70,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule of ""bluf,"" we should look at the position of ""bluf"" within the inputs and the associated colors in the outputs. By comparing the color that represents ""bluf"" in each output with the rest of the output, we can attempt to determine the pattern.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by a word that has not appeared earlier (which is ""zup"") and the output is ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by a word that has appeared earlier (which is ""wif"") and the output is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by a word that has appeared earlier (which is ""lug"") and the output is ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is the second word and followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by a word not appeared before (which is ""wif"") and the output is ""yellow.""

The pattern isn't immediately clear, as ""bluf"" is followed by both new and already mentioned words, resulting in both ""yellow"" and ""green"" outputs. However, we can note that when ""bluf"" is the second word in the sequence, the color repeated is the same as the word before it. This suggests that perhaps ""bluf"" represents a repetition or copying of the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Based on the available examples, here’s a possible rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, the color associated with ""bluf"" in the output matches the color associated with the immediately preceding word. However, when ""bluf"" precedes a new word that’s not yet in the sequence (as in ""dax bluf zup""), the associated color might not adhere to this rule due to insufficient data to draw a definitive conclusion. For now, we will focus on its behavior when following a word.

Hence, the rule could be:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""bluf.""",-1.0945450406445785,70,bluf

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word 'walm' is connected to the repetition of the previously mentioned color.

In the first example:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- When ""walm"" is used after ""lug"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.

In the second example:
- ""dax"" is ""green""
- ""zup"" is ""yellow""
- ""wif"" is ""red""
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to two repeats of ""yellow""
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to three repeats of ""red""

In the third example:
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" again leads to repeated ""red""

In the fourth example:
- ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" is repeated three times

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at the patterns and context in which the word is used in the inputs and outputs. Based on the given examples, we can analyze the outputs and their corresponding inputs to find the rule.

Let's examine each example and its output:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" appears to translate to the first ""green"" 
   - ""walm"" following ""dax"" also translates to ""green""
   - ""wif"" breaks the ""green"" sequence and is followed by ""red""
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" continues with ""red""
   - ""zup"" changes the color again to ""yellow""

2. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - The initial ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   - ""walm"" following ""dax"" again translates to ""green""
   - ""wif"" changes the sequence to ""red""
   - The second ""dax"" returns to ""green"" 

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - ""lug"" is not followed by ""dax"" and translates to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" changes color to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" comes after a non-""walm"" word and starts a ""green"" sequence
   - ""walm"" right after ""dax"" continues with ""green""

4. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" by itself results in ""green""

5. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" is ""red""
   - ""dax"" following ""wif"" switches to ""green""
   - The subsequent ""walm"" thereafter continues with ""green""

From these observations, we can infer the following rules:

- The presence of ""dax"" indicates the start of a ""green"" sequence.
- ""dax"" directly influences the following word ""walm"" to also be ""green,"" creating a chain of ""green"" until a different word appears.
- Other words like ""wif"" and ""zup"" have their own colors, which are ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively, and they seem to reset the color sequence.
- The word ""lug"" has its unique color ""blue,"" and it does not immediately precede ""dax.""

1. Every time ""dax"" appears after a different word (not ""dax""), the output is ""green"" followed by repetitions of ""green"" for the word ""walm.""

2. When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is a single ""green.""

3. When ""dax"" follows itself, the pattern is ""green red"" for the first ""dax"" and ""green"" for the second ""dax.""

4. ""dax"" doesn't always appear at the beginning or end of the input sequence.

Considering these observations, it seems that ""dax"" signals the beginning of a sequence of ""green"" outputs, possibly resetting any prior pattern. The word that follows ""dax"" may determine the number of times ""green"" is repeated, especially if that word is ""walm,"" which is always followed by ""green"" outputs.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""dax"" indicates the output of ""green."" If ""dax"" is followed by the word ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated for each occurrence of ""walm."" If ""dax"" is followed by ""dax,"" the first ""dax"" results in ""green red"" and the second in ""green.""",-1.2978972566494258,71,dax

We can see that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds with the color ""red."" It does not seem to be dependent on position or the presence of other words since ""bluf"" always maps to ""red"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input string and independent of other words in the string.

Therefore, according to the examples given, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> ""red""",-0.0842269772623333,71,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine each occurrence and its output:

3. Input: zup wif bluf; Output: yellow red red
4. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax; Output: yellow yellow red blue green
5. Input: lug dax bluf; Output: blue green green

Based on examples 1 and 2, we can observe that whenever ""bluf"" appears directly after ""wif,"" the output is ""red red"", but in example 3, ""zup"" precedes ""wif bluf"" and the output includes an additional ""yellow"" at the beginning.

In example 4, ""bluf"" appears between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and the output for those three words is ""yellow yellow red,"" respectively.

Finally, in example 5, ""bluf"" is at the end after ""lug dax,"" and the output is ""blue green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" might correspond to the additional ""green"" at the end.

From the given examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" is likely a modifier that affects the word immediately following it. Specifically, it seems to repeat the color associated with that word. If ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" we get ""red red"". If ""bluf"" appears at the end of the sequence, it repeats the color corresponding to the previous word (from ""blue green"" to ""blue green green""). In every instance, ""bluf"" appears to duplicate the color it is associated with or that follows it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Let's verify this with each input-output pair:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

""zup"" is 'yellow', followed by ""walm"" which repeats 'yellow'. ""lug"" is 'blue', followed by another ""zup"" which is 'yellow', then ""wif"" for 'red' and ""dax"" for 'green'.

2. Input: wif walm

""wif"" is 'red', followed by ""walm"" which repeats 'red' twice more.

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the first color in the output is always ""green.""
- The color that follows ""green"" seems to be dependent on the word that comes after ""dax.""

Analyzing the individual examples:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""yellow."" Perhaps they are synonyms or contextually similar enough to generate the same color, yellow.

2. ""dax walm wif walm"" leads to ""green green green red red red."" The repetitions of ""green"" and ""red"" suggest that ""walm"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The repeated words result in repeated colors.

3. ""dax lug"" becomes ""green blue."" Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. ""wif dax"" turns into ""red green."" According to the pattern, ""wif"" is the first word and ""dax"" is second, so ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and confirms that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. ""zup dax lug zup"" produces ""yellow green blue yellow."" We have already established ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" as ""blue."" The presence of ""dax"" causes ""green"" to be the second color in the sequence, maintaining consistency with our previous observations.

"To deduce the meaning or rule of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples provided:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""

5. When ""dax"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug"" with ""zup"" repeated after ""lug,"" the output pattern reflects the input pattern with corresponding colors: ""yellow green blue yellow.""

From the above examples, it can be deduced that ""dax"" invariably leads to the output of ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every other word in the sequence that follows or precedes ""dax"" has a corresponding color output that matches in position, but does not appear to affect the output for ""dax"" itself.

In each example, when the word ""dax"" appears, the output seems to consistently contain the color ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence. This suggests that the word ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color ""green."" The other words in the input correspond to different colors in the output based on their position or relationship to ""dax.""

Here are the outputs associated with ""dax"" in different positions:
- When ""dax"" is at the beginning of a sequence (Examples 1, 2, and 3), the output always starts with ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is at the end of a sequence (Example 4), the output ends with ""green.""

""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and again, when followed by ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times. ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" makes ""blue"" repeat three times as well.
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat after ""dax."" ""Wif"" is red.
- In the last example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat for a total of three times.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the previous word to repeat three times. So, the rule seems to be: when ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.",-0.8215605064597697,72,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the word's occurrence and the corresponding outputs in the provided examples:

1) In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""lug,"" which corresponds to the outputs ""green green"" and then ""yellow blue blue blue."" Since ""dax"" leads to a single ""green"" and ""lug"" translates to a single ""blue,"" this suggests that ""walm"" might be a modifier that repeats the color of the previous word.

2) In the second example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" it appears that ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"" two more times.

3) In the third example, ""walm"" occurs at the end of the sequence after ""dax,"" which produced ""green."" The output is ""green green green,"" suggesting the repetition of the color associated with ""dax.""

4) The fourth example is identical to the second and confirms that ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

5) In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" Given that ""wif"" relates to a single ""red,"" this suggests again that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color of the previous word to be repeated two additional times. Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Causes the color of the previous word to be output two more times.

Rule: If a word translates to a specific color, then ""walm"" following that word causes the output to include that specific color two additional times.",-0.8354460354068967,72,walm
"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" indicates repeating the color associated with the previous word in the sequence as many times as the word ""walm"" follows without interruption. If ""walm"" follows a word associated with a color, it results in the color being repeated 3 times. If the word before ""walm"" is repeated before ""walm"" (like in ""wif walm""), the color is repeated 4 times.

- In the second example, ""lug wif lug"" translates to ""blue red blue."" The ""wif"" is again represented by ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" Only the first word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; the subsequent words ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""green green,"" respectively (since there are three ""green"" and only two other words, we can assume ""walm"" likely means ""green green"").
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue."" Here, ""wif"" is clearly represented by ""red"" as it is positioned before the last ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

2. When 'wif' appears adjacent to 'lug', 'wif' corresponds to 'red' while 'lug' remains 'blue' (Example: ""lug wif lug"" -> ""blue red blue"").
3. When 'wif' appears before 'bluf' and 'dax', it corresponds to 'red' while 'bluf' translates to 'red' and 'dax' to a sequence of 'green' (Example: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"").
4. When 'wif' appears after 'walm' and before 'lug', 'wif' still corresponds to 'red', 'walm' possibly corresponds to 'blue', and 'lug' is 'blue' (Example: ""lug walm wif lug"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue"").
5. When 'wif' is followed by 'walm dax', it translates to 'red', 'walm' to 'red' and 'dax' to 'green' (Example: ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green"").

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" changes the output color to one step back from the color associated with the last word before ""walm."" That is, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the previously mentioned color.

To substantiate this, let's break down the examples:

- Example 1: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm""
  - ""dax"" outputs green.
  - ""wif"" outputs red, and ""walm"" after ""wif"" outputs red again.
  - ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""zup"" changes the color to yellow.
  - ""walm"" after ""zup"" outputs yellow again.

- Example 2: ""zup lug walm""
  - ""zup"" outputs yellow.
  - ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""walm"" after ""lug"" outputs blue again.

- Example 3: ""wif walm lug bluf""
  - ""wif"" outputs red, and ""walm"" after ""wif"" outputs red again.
  - ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""bluf"" is assumed to output blue based on the relationship between ""lug"" and ""bluf"" in preserving blue output.

- Example 4: ""wif lug walm""
  - ""wif"" outputs red.
  - ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""walm"" after ""lug"" outputs blue again.

- Example 5: ""dax walm zup lug walm""
  - ""dax"" outputs green, and ""walm"" after ""dax"" outputs green again.
  - ""zup"" outputs yellow, ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""walm"" after ""lug"" outputs blue again.

- When walm is immediately preceded by 'dax', it and all following words until the next walm or end of input are green.
- When walm is not immediately preceded by 'dax', it and all following words until the next walm or end of input are red.
- The first walm following a 'dax' returns to red, along with any subsequent words until the next walm or end of input.
- 'zup' typically translates to yellow, and 'lug' to blue; however, their colors change according to the position of 'walm' as described in the rules above.

- In the first example, ""lug"" following ""walm"" resulted in ""blue"" being outputted three times.
- In the second example, the word ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and then ""blue"" is the output three times again.
- In the third example, ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and ""blue"" is the output three times.

2. In the second example ""dax walm wif,"" the output is ""green green green red."" Here we see ""walm"" produces ""green"" rather than ""red,"" as in the first case.

3. In the third case ""zup walm lug wif,"" the output ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"" suggests that ""walm"" produces a sequence of three ""yellow"" rather than a single color.

4. The fourth example ""lug wif zup wif walm"" generates the output ""blue red yellow red red red."" Here, the ""walm"" at the end again results in ""red red red,"" though the pattern includes other colors preceding it.

5. Finally, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting a pattern of three of the same colors.

The common factor in each of these examples is that ""walm"" generates a triplet of colors. Each time ""walm"" is used, it is followed by three of the same color in the output. Hence:

Rule: walm -> generates three of the same color in the output, and that color appears to be the one that would be generated by the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence.",-0.1749165164592684,74,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""blue"" in the Outputs. Here is the analysis for each Input and its respective Output:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to one ""blue"" in the Output.
   - ""walm"" appears to translate to two additional ""blue"" in the Output.

2. Input: lug
   Output: blue
   - ""lug"" by itself translates to ""blue.""

3. Input: lug zup lug
   Output: blue yellow blue
   - ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" both times.
   - ""zup"" appears once in between ""lug"" and translates to ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""zup"" appears twice, each translating to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
   - ""walm"" still appears to count for multiple yellows after ""lug,"" but the exact rule for ""walm"" is unclear. It seems to possibly produce a number of ""yellow"" outputs depending on its position or the preceding words.

5. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   - Again, ""lug"" corresponds to the last ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" which might suggest that ""bluf"" is treated differently than ""lug,"" since ""bluf"" doesn't result in ""blue."" However, without more examples, the rule for ""bluf"" is not clear.

With the given data, the rule for ""lug"" is consistent:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

2. Input: lug wif dax wif
   Output: blue red green red

3. Input: lug dax lug
   Output: blue green blue

4. Input: dax lug zup
   Output: green blue yellow

5. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue

From these examples, we can infer the following:

- Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
- This correspondence is consistent across all examples, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the length of the sequence.
- Other words (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"") correspond to different colors (yellow, blue, red, green), and these colors are consistent for the given words across different examples, implying that ""dax"" also consistently refers to a single color, which in this case is ""green.""

Therefore, based on the information from the examples provided, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green. Meaning that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""",-0.06980903066212327,75,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns where the word appears and what color is associated with it. We'll look for consistency in the outputs.

In the first example, ""dax"" appears twice and correlates with ""green."" The word ""zup"" appears once, corresponding to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" appears once, corresponding to ""green.""

In the second example, ""dax"" appears once and correlates with ""green"" again. The words ""lug"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively.

The third example has ""dax"" appearing once, also corresponding to ""green."" ""Lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

In the fourth example, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""yellow.""

The fifth example shows ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.7042205331528765,75,dax

Similarly, other words correlate with specific colors in a consistent manner:

- ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow""
- ""walm"" (from the first example) results in the output ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red""

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" has only appeared following ""dax"" and has always resulted in ""green""

Since ""walm"" only appears preceded by ""dax"" and the resulting color is always ""green"", it is not possible to definitively determine the color associated with ""walm"" independent of ""dax"". It could be suggested that the occurrence of ""dax walm"" is necessary to output the color green sequentially, or it could be that ""walm"" has no color association on its own but instead serves to extend the sequence of greens produced by ""dax"". However, based on the examples given, there is insufficient information to conclude a rule for ""walm"".

1. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

Here's what we can deduce from the examples given:

- In example 1, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it.
- In example 2, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" which supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color linked to ""dax.""
- Examples 3, 4, and 5 further support this observation, showing that ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, three times. Let's analyze the examples to reach the rule for ""walm.""

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" and ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" We see that the color the word represents (lug = blue, zup = yellow) is repeated three times.

- The second example is straightforward. ""Dax walm"" is ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times.

- The third example, ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" provides a sequence where ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow green green green blue red."" Following the established pattern, ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.

- In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""green red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""wif"" (red) to be repeated three times.

- The fifth example, ""wif lug walm,"" again shows that ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and repeats the color blue three times, as indicated by the output ""red blue blue blue.""

From the above analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> meaning. Meaning = Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: If a word precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" translates to the color associated with that word, repeated three times.",-0.15939440215561446,76,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the previous input word three times. Here's the breakdown according to each example:

Input: lug walm zup walm
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" causes the output to repeat ""blue"" three times
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" causes the output to repeat ""yellow"" three times

Input: dax walm
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" causes the output to repeat ""green"" three times

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" causes the output to repeat ""green"" three times
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: dax wif walm
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" causes the output to repeat ""red"" three times

Input: wif lug walm
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" causes the output to repeat ""blue"" three times

Based on the examples and the resulting patterns, the rule seems to be:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the output associated with each input that contains ""walm"":

- In each instance, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of three colors in the output.
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> In this sequence, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""dax walm"" correlates with ""green green green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" Here, ""walm"" again follows ""dax"" and precedes a triplicate of ""green.""
- ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red"" suggests that ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and is associated with three ""red.""
- ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" after ""lug"" is associated with three ""blue.""

From the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated three times.

- In the second input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is followed by ""walm,"" producing ""green green green.""
- The subsequent inputs further support this rule, with the color linked to the word before ""walm"" being repeated three times.

1. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug

"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""wif"" by its consistent association with a particular color in the output.

- In the first example, the word ""wif"" is followed by ""zup bluf lug"", which translates to ""yellow yellow blue"", and the corresponding output sequence includes ""red"" immediately after ""wif"".
- In the second example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"", and ""red"" is the color that follows ""wif"".

"Observing the provided examples and the corresponding outputs, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of colors that increase in count by one each time it appears in the input, and the specific color changes depending on the preceding word. 

Let's analyze each example:

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""walm"" following ""wif"" yields three reds, and ""walm"" following ""zup"" yields three yellows. It should be noted that the number of yellows matches the count of the preceding reds, suggesting that the first occurrence of ""walm"" sets a baseline for quantity that is then applied to subsequent occurrences regardless of the color change.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
In this case, ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in three greens, indicating that the presence of ""dax"" might be tied to the color green.

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
With ""lug"" we get blue, with ""zup"" we get yellow, and with ""dax walm"" we get three greens. It seems that each word has its own color, but ""walm"" is again determining the quantity, not the color.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
Here ""zup walm"" results in three yellows, and ""wif"" independently results in red. ""Walm"" does not appear to influence the color of the words that follow it.

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
""Lug"" gives blue, ""dax walm"" gives us three greens, and ""wif"" gives red. Just like in previous examples, ""walm"" controls the quantity following a specific word.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as:

Rule: When following a word, ""walm"" produces a sequence of the same color associated with the preceding word, and the quantity of the color output is determined by the number of times ""walm"" has previously appeared plus two (as the first instance produces three of that color).

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word, with the quantity increasing by one with each subsequent occurrence.",-0.09377982924596431,77,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we need to correlate the given input with the color outputs. Let's observe the patterns:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is three reds and three yellows. However, since ""wif"" alone leads to red, the three initial reds are due to ""wif"", which implies that ""walm"" in this context generates three yellows.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is one green followed by three greens. Normally, ""dax"" on its own results in a single green, thus ""walm"" here appears to be responsible for the additional three greens.
- Conversely, when ""lug"" precedes ""dax walm"", we get one blue, one green, and three greens in sequence. We understand that ""lug"" generates blue and ""dax"" produces one green, so again, ""walm"" seems to be responsible for an additional three greens.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" without any other context, we see three yellows. Since ""zup"" alone usually outputs one yellow, we can infer that ""walm"" in this sequence might again cause the output of an additional two yellows, similar to how it behaved after ""wif"".

Considering the consistent appearance of three colored outputs corresponding to ""walm"" in different contexts, and that each instance of ""walm"" following another word seems to add three repetitions of the color produced by the preceding word, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the previous color's output to be repeated three times. 

If the previous word outputs red, then ""walm"" leads to three more reds; if the previous word is ""dax"" that outputs green, then ""walm"" results in three greens; and if the previous word is ""zup"" that produces yellow, ""walm"" yields an additional three yellows.",-0.6572831218559524,77,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the colors associated with each example input and output pair.

- In the examples, each word appears to correspond to a specific color.
- The color red seems to be associated with the word ""wif,"" as seen in the first input-output pair.
- The color green appears to be connected to the word ""dax,"" which is confirmed across multiple examples.
- The color yellow is linked to ""zup,"" as seen in both the first and fourth inputs.
- The color blue is associated with ""lug,"" as shown in the third and fifth inputs.
- The word ""walm"" is always followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the previous word, and there are three occurrences of the color.

Now let's summarize the association of words to colors:
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Considering the word ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three times, we can deduce that:

walm -> causes the repetition of the preceding color three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, output the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.7322199894614286,77,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a series of colors, which in this context seem to be based on the word that precedes ""walm."" More specifically, the word before ""walm"" determines the color, and ""walm"" dictates that the color is repeated three times. Here is the observed pattern:

- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""

No other words dictate a repetition or a series of colors when combined with ""walm,"" and the words ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" each individually correspond to their own single color outputs (""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively).

Rule: walm -> when following a color-indicating word, outputs that color three times.",-0.7382672163269046,77,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns of the associated colors with each word.

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" (Example 1), ""walm"" results in ""red yellow yellow.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (Example 2), ""walm"" results in ""green green.""
- When ""dax"" is after ""lug"" but before ""walm"" (Example 4), ""walm"" again results in ""green green green.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" (Example 3), ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""dax,"" which precedes ""walm"" (Example 5), ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""

Interestingly, the word ""walm"" itself seems to take on the color immediately preceding it and extends it by two additional instances of the same color. More specifically:

- ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" we see two more ""red"" resulting in three reds, but with an extra ""yellow"" at the end.
- ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and following ""walm,"" we see two more ""green,"" creating three greens in total.
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and following ""walm,"" we observe two more ""yellow,"" making it three yellows in total.

However, there's a slight irregularity in the first pattern, where there's a mix of red and yellow, which is different from the other patterns, where the same color is repeated. This inconsistency could be because there are two instances of “walm” after “wif” in the first example, which is not present in the other examples. Therefore, I'll disregard that mismatch and focus on the repeating pattern.

Given this repeating pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color emitted by the previous word two additional times. This doesn't encompass the first example completely, where an additional yellow seems to appear after the pattern of red, possibly due to the repeated use of ""walm.""

In the third input ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""

In the fourth input ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red.""

In the fifth input ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""green.""

It appears that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent direct translation to a specific color in the outputs. Instead, its meaning must be dependent on other factors or the context within the input. Looking closer at the patterns, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word that precedes it:

- In the first and third examples, ""lug"" (which translates to blue) comes before ""bluf,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" (which translates to red) comes before ""bluf,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- In the second and fifth examples, ""dax"" (which translates to green) comes before ""bluf,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""

This pattern suggests that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

"walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" can be deduced as the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. If we look at the examples:

- Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red. ""dax"" generates ""green"", ""walm"" repeats it two more times, and then ""wif"" generates ""red"".
  
- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green. ""dax"" generates ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats it two more times.
  
- Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue. ""wif"" generates ""red"", ""lug"" generates ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
  
- Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red. This is a repeat of the second example and follows the same pattern.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, repeating it a number of times equal to the total number of words in the input minus one.",-0.13985474440944443,78,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and identify any patterns related to it.

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

2. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

5. Input: dax walm wif (repeated)
   Output: green green green red

Here's what we can deduce from these examples:

- When ""wif"" is present, the output includes ""red.""
- When ""dax"" is present, the output includes ""green.""
- When ""lug"" is present, we see the output includes ""blue.""
- ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" each correspond to a single color in the output.
- The repetition of the color in the output corresponds to the presence of ""walm""; for each instance of ""walm"" in the input, we see a repetition of the previous color.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" signifies that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated multiple times. The specific number of repetitions could be three, although it's not possible to be certain with the examples provided. Therefore, if ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" we see ""red"" repeated three times, and likewise for the other colors.

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word thrice. Rule: If the previous word corresponds to a color in the output, ""walm"" causes that color to be repeated three times.",-0.15965817278791666,78,walm
"Based on the examples given, it seems that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. We can infer the following associations:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Here's how the rule plays out in the provided examples:

- Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red (wif is red; walm repeats the color red three times)
- Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red (dax is green; walm repeats the color green three times, then 'wif' adds red)
- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green (dax is green; walm repeats the color green three times)
- Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue (wif is red, lug is blue, walm repeats the color of the word immediately before it, which is lug/blue, three times)

To encapsulate the rule:

Walm -> meaning. Rule: Walm causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.",-0.24777724748916663,78,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the provided examples, let's examine the output sequences in relation to the input sequences. 

- When ""wif"" appears alone with ""walm"" (Input: ""wif walm""), the output is ""red red red"".
- When ""dax"" appears with ""walm"" and without ""wif"" (Input: ""dax walm""), the output is ""green green green"".
- When ""dax"" appears with ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" (Input: ""dax walm wif""), the output is ""green green green red"".
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"" with ""walm"" (Input: ""wif lug walm""), the output is ""red blue blue blue"".

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" is related to the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. The preceding word determines the specific color to be used. Let's illustrate this association:

- ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"".
- ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"".
- ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue"".

Subsequently, the occurrence of ""walm"" appears to trigger the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes directly before ""walm"". Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times, with the exception of when ""walm"" follows ""wif"", in which case the color ""red"" is repeated three times regardless of whether ""wif"" directly precedes ""walm"" or not.

Considering the additional following words in the input doesn't seem to impact the repetition rule related to ""walm"", as the output is consistent with the rule deduced above except for the additional color added by the following word (e.g., ""wif"" adding a single ""red"").

Given the data provided, here is the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times (with ""wif"" directly preceding ""walm"" always producing ""red red red""), after which the normal sequence of colors continues if additional words follow.",-0.30191065849166676,78,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

5. Input: dax wif lug

Looking at the inputs and their respective outputs, we can make the following observations:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is in the output. This suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- The other words such as ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" seem to have consistent translations as well (""lug"" -> ""blue,"" ""walm"" -> ""yellow,"" ""wif"" -> ""red,"" ""zup"" -> ""yellow"").

- In the fifth example, ""lug wif walm,"" the output is ""blue red red red.” ""Walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" and hence ""walm"" results in ""red.""

"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the colors of the words that precede it in a specific way, such that each word is repeated in the output color sequence. To determine the rule for ""walm"", let's analyze the input and the corresponding outputs.

Here are the observations:

1. Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and is translated to ""green."" 
   - ""wif,"" which comes after ""walm,"" is translated to ""red.""

2. Input: wif dax zup walm | Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

   - ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and is translated to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and is translated to ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and is translated to ""blue.""

4. Input: lug walm zup | Output: blue blue blue yellow
   - ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and is translated to ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" is after ""walm"" and is translated to ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug wif walm | Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and is translated to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and is translated to ""red.""

Looking at the examples, it can be observed that each word preceding ""walm"" is translated three times in the output. Moreover, the colors that represent each word remain consistent: ""dax"" is always green, ""lug"" is always blue, and ""wif"" is always red, irrespective of their position relative to ""walm.""

Also, any word that comes after ""walm"" is translated to yellow regardless of what the word is. For instance, ""wif"" after ""walm"" is ""red,"" but it's ""yellow"" when it appears after walm, and ""zup"" is yellow when it comes after ""walm"" as well.

Thus the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the words before it to be repeated thrice in their respective color translations in the output, and any word that follows ""walm"" is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.

- In input 1, ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green.""

- In input 2, ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" is at the start, and we previously inferred that ""dax"" might correspond to ""green,"" if every word in this input corresponds to ""green,"" then ""walm"" might also correspond to ""green.""
- Input 3, ""zup lug dax"" maps to ""yellow blue green,"" and if ""dax"" is ""green,"" we can deduce that ""zup"" might be ""yellow"" and ""lug"" might be ""blue.""

- Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
- Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
- Input: zup lug dax | Output: yellow blue green
- Input: dax wif | Output: green red
- Input: lug dax | Output: blue green

From the above, it can be observed that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output sequence. This consistent correlation indicates that the rule is independent of the other words or factors.

Therefore, the deduced meaning is:

dax -> meaning. Rule: ""dax"" means ""green"".",-0.12342797754943749,80,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we shall look at the correlation between the input containing ""dax"" and the corresponding output color:

1. In ""wif bluf dax"" we have ""red red green,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
2. In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" appears at the beginning and the entire output is ""green green green.""
3. In ""zup lug dax,"" we have ""yellow blue green,"" and again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
4. For ""dax wif,"" the output is ""green red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
5. Finally, in ""lug dax,"" the output is ""blue green,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In every instance, regardless of position or surrounding words, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Thus, the rule we can derive is:

- When ""dax"" is the first word, as in ""dax walm"" and ""dax wif,"" the outputs are ""green green green"" and ""green red,"" respectively, where the first ""green"" corresponds to ""dax.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""zup lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue green.""

3. zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue

A closer look at these examples shows us:

- Every time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""yellow.""
- In each example, no matter the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence, ""yellow"" is always used in the same position in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> yellow",-0.06916659626208338,80,bluf

2. In the second example, ""wif lug zup bluf"" ends with ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. In the third example, ""zup bluf lug"" has ""bluf"" in the middle and corresponds to ""yellow"".

4. In the fourth example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" contains ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""blue"".

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in its position relative to the colors in the output:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is yellow.

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by nothing (end of input), and the output is yellow.

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is yellow.

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is yellow.

5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is yellow.

In all instances, the color following ""bluf"" is yellow, independent of the word that comes after ""bluf."" Thus, ""bluf"" might be correlated with the color yellow in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

"Observing the patterns of the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" always results in ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" without any change in the sequence of the output which is consistently three greens. This suggests that ""dax"" could mean ""green"" and ""walm"" might represent a repetition of the color mentioned before it.

2. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" has an output of ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" The ""walm"" after ""zup"" converts the single yellow into three yellows, and the ""walm"" after ""wif"" converts the single red into three reds. This again supports the idea that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the prior color.

3. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" results in ""blue red yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" is at the end and repeats ""red"" which is the color associated with ""wif,"" suggesting that ""walm"" continues the pattern of repetition.

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and we see a repetition of ""red"" three times before the pattern continues with new colors for ""dax"" and ""zup.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the previous color word to repeat two additional times (totaling three).

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color two additional times.",-0.19373075791231817,80,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs each time ""walm"" appears in an input.

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Since the word ""dax"" also precedes ""walm,"" it is not clear exactly what ""walm"" contributes to the output.

2. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Here, we observe that after the first ""walm,"" three yellow outputs appear, and after the second ""walm,"" three red outputs follow.

3. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" yields ""blue red yellow red red red."" We again see that following ""walm,"" there are three red outputs.

4. With ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" Similarly, after ""walm,"" we see three red outputs before any other colors influenced by other words.

From the above observations, it seems that ""walm"" is consistently followed by three instances of the same color in the output. In the second, third, and fourth examples, after ""walm"" is mentioned, the output color is red, regardless of the preceding words.

Hence, the rule we can deduce is:
- walm -> the appearance of three red in the output, regardless of preceding words.

Rule: walm causes the next three outputs to be red.",-0.20073554478159092,80,walm
"To induce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the examples and outputs systematically.

1. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". Since the output does not change with repeated inputs, ""walm"" likely does not mean 'repeat', but instead may add an output that is not straightforwardly related to 'dax'.

2. Repeated example of ""dax walm"" with the same output confirms the previous deduction and suggests consistency in the meaning of ""walm"" but doesn't provide new information.

3. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"". We previously identified ""dax"" as green and now we can try to deduce others:
   - ""zup"" is followed by three yellows, suggesting a transition or change in the output sequence.
   - ""wif"" precedes three reds. ""wif"" appeared twice, so it doesn't appear to be necessary to be repeated to maintain its output (unlike ""walm"" which is repeated).
   - ""walm"" appears twice at the end, and we see a repetition of the color red which is introduced by ""wif"". 

4. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" translates to ""blue red yellow red red red"". Here, ""lug"" is alone and translates to ""blue"". ""wif"" again translates to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The new information here is that following ""zup,"" ""wif"" is no longer producing three reds but one red, and then ""walm"" finishes the sequence with two additional reds.

5. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow"". ""Wif"" is consistently translating to ""red,"" but the appearance of ""walm"" after ""wif"" does not change the output from red. ""dax"" translates to green, followed by ""zup"" which translates to yellow.

Summarizing these observations, the rule appears to be as follows:

- ""walm"" on its own translates to a repetition of the color immediately preceding it. For instance, after ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" ""walm"" results in additional reds.

Based on this analysis, here is the rule:

Rule: walm -> duplicate the color that immediately precedes it.",-0.20123939270670463,80,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the following rule can be derived:

Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color red repeating three times.

Supporting evidence:
1. Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, ""red red red"" appears in the output.
2. The number of occurrences of ""walm"" in the input directly correlates to the number of ""red red red"" groupings in the output.

Applying this rule to the available examples:

- In the first and second examples, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" since the rest of the output is accounted for by the repetition of ""walm"" resulting in ""red red red"".
- In the third example, there are two occurrences of ""walm"" hence two ""red red red"" sequences in the output, with ""dax"" still corresponding to ""green"" and ""zup"" introducing a ""yellow"" before the sequence initiated by ""walm"".
- The fourth example demonstrates ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds with ""red,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" with the ""walm"" following its rule of producing ""red red red"".
- The last example reconfirms that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"" with the ""walm"" rule remaining consistent.

This consistency allows us to induce that:
walm -> repeating ""red"" three times (red red red)",-0.7149261264500001,80,walm
"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we observe the output colors corresponding to its instances across different inputs. It is noted that ""walm"" consistently results in multiple instances of the color ""red."" However, observing the third example, where ""walm"" appears twice, it leads to red being repeated three times, not just twice, which seems to suggest that the presence of ""walm"" correlates with repeated reds in the output, and the number may depend on the context or position in the input sequence. In contrast, other words like ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" are paired with only one color each time they appear.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at its position relative to the other words in each input sequence and the corresponding output.

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green."" Considering only this example, we can't yet deduce much about ""bluf"" other than it is not causing a change in the output. 

- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax"" results in ""red red green."" We see that the word ""dax"" is always producing ""green"" as the output, while the position of ""bluf"" has changed relative to ""dax,"" but it still produces ""red."" However, this might be because of ""wif"" rather than ""bluf.""

- In the third example, ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red."" The ""dax"" still gives ""green,"" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" and now ""bluf"" gives 'red"" as well. It might suggest that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before ""bluf"" in sequence. 

- The fourth example, ""dax lug bluf wif,"" results in ""green blue blue red."" Here, ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" which is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue"" again, while ""wif"" results in ""red."" This further supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it, as it followed ""lug"" and resulted in ""blue.""

- The fifth example, ""dax bluf lug wif,"" shows ""green green blue red."" Again, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" comes right after ""dax"" and also gives ""green,"" then ""lug"" provides ""blue,"" and lastly, ""wif"" results in ""red."" This is consistent with the idea that ""bluf"" will have the same color as the word before it.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""bluf"" reproduces the color of the word immediately preceding it. If this pattern holds true regardless of the position of ""bluf"" within the word sequence, we can generalize this as a rule.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.",-0.12714289215468,81,bluf
"Observing the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is associated with outputting a color, just like the other nonce words (""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""lug""). 

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green."" Here, ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color green, which follows ""dax.""
- In the second and third examples, ""wif bluf dax"" and ""dax wif bluf"" both include ""wif"" and ""dax,"" with ""bluf"" outputting the color red in the second example and the color red in the third example. This suggests that ""bluf"" might output the color that follows it when positioned before another word.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the color red follows ""bluf"" in both cases.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" produces the color of the word that comes after it. If no word comes after ""bluf,"" it defaults to green, which could be its inherent color. 

Rule: bluf -> outputs the color of the word that follows it; if no word follows, outputs green.",-0.5867570786585332,81,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. 

When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to green), the output is ""green green"". When it follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to red), the output is ""red red"". The repetition rule works regardless of the position where ""bluf"" appears in the input sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine each example and the corresponding output to identify patterns. Here's a breakdown of the examples provided:

1. Example: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" is echoed in the Output as repetitions of ""yellow.""

2. Example: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   Analysis: Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is mirrored by multiple instances of ""yellow."" It is important to note that ""walm"" doesn't directly translate to ""yellow,"" because the word following ""walm"" also changes to ""yellow.""

3. Example: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Analysis: In this example, the ""walm"" after ""zup"" is followed by an instance of ""green"" associated with ""dax.""

4. Example: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: The ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in repeated instances of ""yellow.""

5. Example: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: Similarly, ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to repeated instances of ""blue.""

Based on the examples and corresponding outputs, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. The Output following ""walm"" is not a single color but a repetition of the color representing the word that comes before ""walm."" If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the Output is three instances of ""yellow,"" if it's ""lug,"" it's three instances of ""blue,"" and so on.

"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it, for as many times as the preceding word is repeated. Thus, ""walm"" appears to function as a command for repetition.

Here is the breakdown of each example:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. Since ""zup"" appears twice before ""walm,"" the output is two yellows following the yellows for each ""zup."" Then ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which results in three reds, because ""wif"" appears only once before ""walm.""

2. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" then repeats the yellow. ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and then is repeated twice more because of ""walm."" ""zup"" is then yellow again, following with ""wif"" leading to another yellow, and ""dax"" results in green.

3. ""zup"" is yellow, followed by two more yellows due to ""walm."" ""dax"" is green and stands alone, as there is no ""walm"" after it to command a repetition.

4. ""zup"" is yellow, and since ""walm"" follows it without any other color mentioned, it simply repeats the yellow twice more.

5. ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and because ""walm"" follows it, the color is repeated twice more.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is: 

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as it has already appeared immediately before ""walm.""",-0.5680817736268968,81,walm

2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with the color green, there's no immediate output example, but it seems to follow the same rule, so we would expect three greens.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is associated with the color blue, the output is three blues.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs where ""walm"" appears:

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

Now, let's look for patterns relative to the placement of ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors:

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" it contributes to a sequence of blue followed by yellow, then red.
2. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup wif,"" it adds three reds to the output.
3. ""dax walm"" consistently leads to three greens regardless of subsequent words.
4. ""walm"" does not seem to have a fixed color output but rather affects the sequence of colors.

Considering the different inputs and outputs, ""walm"" seems to affect the output by repeating the color that comes directly before it in the sequence.

Let's test this hypothesis against the examples:

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue repeats three times, followed by yellow and red.
2. zup wif walm -> yellow followed by red, which then repeats three times.
3. dax walm zup lug walm -> green repeats three times, then yellow, blue, and blue repeats three times.
4. dax walm -> green repeats three times (no preceding color before ""walm"" to repeat further).
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green, red, yellow, yellow, red, and then red repeats three times.

Based on this analysis:

Rule: walm -> when appearing in an input sequence, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times.",-0.09663857758258065,82,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the words that precede and follow it and the output colors that correspond to its presence.

Let's consider each input and its output:

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

We can note the following patterns:

- In examples 1, 3, and 5, ""walm"" outputs a sequence of ""red"" words.
- ""walm"" consistently results in a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it:
  - In example 1, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we have three ""blue.""
  - In example 3, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after the first ""walm,"" we have two more ""green"" (the same pattern is followed after the second ""walm"" with two ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug"").
  - In example 5, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm"" we have three ""red.""
- In example 4, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- In example 2, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""red"" repeated three times.

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the previous color word to repeat three times afterward. This is consistent across all examples provided. 

Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should first observe the position and context in which it appears alongside the corresponding output colours.

1. ""lug walm zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow red""
2. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red""
3. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" results in ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
5. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""green red yellow yellow red red red""

Here are some observations:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, there is a repeating colour sequence that follows it.
- The repeating colour directly following ""walm"" corresponds to the colour that represents the word immediately preceding ""walm.""
- ""walm"" itself does not seem to have a fixed colour associated with it, instead, it seems to induce repetition of the preceding colour.
- The number of repetitions for ""walm"" is three, as seen after ""dax"" and ""lug.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to be an instruction for repeating the colour that corresponds to the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the colour corresponding to the previous word three times.",-0.0990891651570968,82,walm
"By examining the given examples, we can infer the following:
- There is a direct correlation between the input words and the output colors.
- The occurrence of 'walm' appears to correspond to a repeated sequence of colors in the output.
- The specific color or sequence of colors that 'walm' corresponds to seems to be linked to the word that precedes it.

Looking at the individual cases:
1. ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that 'walm' after 'lug' results in three repetitions of the color blue.
2. ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red"", suggesting that 'walm' after 'wif' results in three repetitions of the color red.
3. ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green"", suggesting that 'walm' after 'dax' results in three repetitions of the color green.
4. The sequence ""zup wif walm"" gives us ""yellow red red red"", which is a bit more complex as it suggests that 'zup' translates to yellow and 'walm' after 'wif' yields the triple red as observed in the previous examples. This indicates that 'zup' does not alter the effect of 'walm' when 'walm' is paired with 'wif'.

Based on these observations, the rule can be deduced as follows:

5. Input: wif dax zup

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""wif"" and try to correlate them with the outputs:

- The color red always follows the word ""wif,"" regardless of the word that comes after ""wif."" This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- Every other word seems to correspond with a different color. ""Dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""walm"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue. There is no instance of ""wif"" appearing without being followed by the color red in the output.

From these observations, we can determine:

3. ""dax wif walm"" -> green red red red
4. ""wif dax zup dax"" -> red green yellow green
5. ""wif dax zup"" -> red green yellow

In example 1, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" which translates to ""red,"" and in example 4, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and is followed by the term ""dax zup dax"" (green yellow green).

In examples 2 and 3, ""wif"" is present before ""red"" in the output. However, example 2 has only one word ""lug,"" which does not appear in any other examples and consequently translates to ""blue.""

A key observation is that ""wif"" always precedes the color red in the output, except in the case when it's simultaneous with the occurrence of ""dax"" after ""wif,"" which gives the output ""green."" Since ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" we can infer that ""wif"" may not influence ""dax.""

1. In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue.""

2. In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again is associated with repeated ""yellow.""

3. The third example ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue."" ""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows with ""blue.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" We can match ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" once again is associated with repeated ""yellow.""

5. Finally, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue green."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is associated with repeated ""green.""

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup -> Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax -> Output: green green green yellow blue green

Looking at the outputs, it seems that the presence of the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color immediately following it three times. To confirm:

- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" the corresponding color of which is ""blue,"" and the output of ""wif lug bluf"" is ""red blue blue."" Since the output ""blue blue blue"" immediately follows ""walm,"" it appears ""walm"" results in tripling the ""blue"" color.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by no other color terms, yet the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing a tripling effect.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by no other color terms, and we again see a triple ""blue"" in the output.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output includes ""yellow yellow yellow"" for ""walm,"" showing the triplet effect before returning to ""green"" for ""dax.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" the corresponding color of which is ""yellow,"" and the output includes ""green green green,"" which is a triplet of ""green"" for ""dax"" that comes before ""walm"".

4. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Looking at the examples given, we can observe the following:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows a ""wif"" and is followed by a ""dax,"" and the output is ""red red red green yellow."" 
- In the second example, ""walm"" is the last word, and the previous word is ""zup,"" and we see the output as ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows a ""lug"" which generally outputs blue, but here it is followed by two ""zup"" which correspond to yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" again follows ""wif"" and it's followed by ""zup,"" and the output corresponds to ""red red red yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows a series of ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and we see it produces a ""red red green green red red red."" After ""walm"" we have ""lug,"" which is normally blue, but in this context is red.

From these observations, we hypothesize that ""walm"" causes the next word's associated color to become ""red,"" unless the next word is ""zup,"" in which case the output color for ""walm"" itself is ""red.""

Rule: ""walm"" turns the next word's output color into ""red""; if the next word is ""zup,"" then ""walm"" is output as ""red.""

Now, we need to cross-reference this rule with the examples to verify it:

- In the first example, the word following ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which is normally green, but it has been turned red by ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end, followed by ""zup,"" suggesting that ""walm"" itself could be represented by the red color it forces upon the following word.
- In the third case, the rule seems to hold since ""walm"" precedes the change to red for ""lug.""
- The fourth example also follows the rule since ""walm"" is output as red and the ""zup"" remains its normal color, yellow.
- The fifth example holds the rule as well, turning the following ""lug"" red.

Thus, the rule proposed seems consistent across the examples:

walm -> The word ""walm"" modifies the color output of the following word to ""red."" If ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" then ""walm"" itself is output as ""red"".",-0.06286709151344039,84,walm
"To determine what ""walm"" means, we will examine the examples given. Specifically, we need to observe the patterns of the colors which represent 'walm' as well as their position relative to other words, and how the output changes when 'walm' is included versus when it is not.

From the examples given, the following observations can be made:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: red red red green yellow
2. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
3. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
4. ""wif walm zup"" -> Output: red red red yellow
5. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Looking at these examples, the word 'walm' corresponds to different colors in different contexts:

- In the 1st and 4th examples, 'walm' corresponds to the second instance of 'red'.
- In the 2nd example, 'walm' corresponds to three instances of 'yellow'.
- In the 3rd example, 'walm' corresponds to 'blue'.
- In the 5th example, 'walm' corresponds to 'red'.

If we look closely at the pattern that emerges, 'walm' seems to take on the color that represents the preceding word's color repetition:

- In the 1st example, 'walm' follows 'wif', which is represented by 'red'. Since 'red' is repeated, 'walm' also results in 'red'.
- In the 2nd example, 'walm' is preceded by 'zup' which is represented by 'yellow'. Since the pattern 'zup' 'yellow' is repeated, 'walm' takes on the color 'yellow'.
- In the 3rd and 5th examples, we see that whenever 'walm' immediately follows a word with an output color that is about to be repeated or has just started to repeat, it takes on and continues that color pattern.

However, we notice that in cases where a new color would be expected (such as after a single word/color like in the second position in example 3 or the last position in example 5), 'walm' does not introduce a new color but repeats the previous one (blue in the 3rd and red in the 5th cases).

With this in mind, we can hypothesize that 'walm' is a rule that dictates repeating the preceding color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",-0.08368166300969727,84,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between its occurrence in the input and the corresponding segment in the output.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""walm"" occurs after ""wif"" and before ""dax."" We see three reds, followed by green, then yellow. 

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm | Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" is at the end, after ""zup."" We see a pattern of colors, but ""walm"" results in three yellow outputs.

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup | Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - Here ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""zup,"" resulting in a blue followed by a yellow, indicating ""walm"" may be linked to a blue since ""zup"" appears to be linked to yellow.

4. Input: wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow
   - ""walm"" occurs between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" similar to the first example, leading to red outputs before it and a yellow after.

5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif | Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""walm"" is in the middle and followed by ""lug,"" which correlates to a blue output, and it's after ""wif,"" which has been consistently colored red.

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following potential rule for ""walm"":

- ""walm"" after ""wif"" and before ""dax"" or ""lug"" leads to a red output before it and influences the color of the output immediately following it. This influence appears to result in a blue output when followed by ""lug.""
- ""walm"" at the end of an input sequence (as seen in the second example) seems to produce a string of yellow outputs following it.
- ""walm"" between ""lug"" and ""zup"" (third example) resulted in an output of blue followed by yellow, which fits the pattern seen with ""lug"" and ""zup"" individually. Here, it's not entirely clear what influence ""walm"" has.

Considering the evidence above with the limitation that there might be a broader context not provided by the examples, we can say with reasonable confidence:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it leads to red preceding it and potentially blue after it if followed by ""lug."" There's not enough consistent information about its position relative to other words to determine a complete rule, but we see a pattern of red linked to ""wif"" and yellow to ""zup,"" with ""walm"" potentially modifying the output based on its position.

Walm -> meaning: The exact meaning is unclear, but it modifies the output color depending on its position and surrounding words.

Please note that if we had more examples, we could refine this rule or provide a more accurate definition of ""walm.""",-0.10707458803494493,84,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is directly followed by ""dax"" and both are followed by ""zup."" This results in ""red red red green yellow.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug dax zup."" The corresponding output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""zup."" The output is ""blue blue blue yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""zup,"" with the output being ""red red red yellow.""
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which is followed by ""lug wif."" The associated colors are ""red red red blue red.""

From the outputs, we notice the following pattern:
- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the color ""red"" appears consecutively before it one or more times.
- The color that follows ""red"" after ""walm"" seems to depend on the word that follows ""walm."" 

Let's summarize the observations:
- ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" when it comes after ""walm.""
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and if it comes directly after ""walm,"" it leads to a sequence of ""blue.""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" but when preceded by ""walm,"" it's just ""yellow"" regardless of what came before ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" might be that it acts as a reset point in the output pattern, causing the preceding color to repeat up until ""walm"" and then the following word determines the next color.

Rule: walm -> acts as a reset point causing the preceding color to repeat up to the point of ""walm,"" and the next color is determined by the word following ""walm.""",-0.9767008262578892,84,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the given examples. Looking at the color outputs associated with each sequence, we can attempt to match each word with a corresponding color:

Consider the following associations observed from the examples:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""
- ""zup"" often corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" but not always.
- ""dax"" seems to correspond to the output ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it is present.

Now let's analyze the usage of ""walm"":
- In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is placed after ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

From these observations, we can infer the following pattern:
- ""walm"" tends to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

However, there is a notable exception in the second example, where ""walm"" follows a ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow"" instead of the expected ""red"" if it were to repeat the color of ""zup.""

Based on this inconsistency, a possible pattern is that the word ""walm"" could be interpreted as a modifier that changes the output color to the color following the pattern of the previous words, except in cases where the pattern is broken (such as the second example).

Given the limited examples and the exception observed, the safest rule we can derive is:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word that precedes it, except when a fixed pattern change is observed.

Since the pattern change is not clear due to insufficient information or inconsistency (as shown by the second example), the most consistent rule we observed is:

From the provided examples, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output has the color ""green."" Moreover, different non-dax words (lug, wif, zup, bluf, walm) correspond with other colors. It seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the list. There is no apparent variation or context-dependence in the meaning of ""dax."" It can be inferred as a static rule.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green",-0.05960843331707316,85,dax
"To deduce the meaning or the rule for ""dax,"" let's analyze the sets of inputs and outputs given in the examples.

Example 1:
Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green

Example 2:
Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red

Example 3:
Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue

Example 4:
Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

Example 5:
Input: zup lug dax
Output: yellow blue green

Now, let's try to correlate each word in the input with the colors in the output to detect patterns:

- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" in examples 1, 3, 4, and 5.
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" in examples 1 and 3.
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" in examples 2 and 5.
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"" in example 3 and with ""green"" in example 1 when following ""dax.""

Upon closer observation of ""dax,"" it seems to associate with ""green"" in the outputs:

- After ""lug dax"" in example 1, ""green"" appears.
- After ""dax"" in example 2, ""green"" appears.
- After ""bluf dax"" in example 3, ""green"" appears.
- After ""zup dax"" in example 4, ""green green"" appears. The double occurrence of ""green"" might be due to the following word ""walm,"" which does not appear in any other examples – perhaps it means ""green"" as well.
- After ""lug dax"" in example 5, ""green"" appears.

From these observations, we can induce that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""

Rule:
dax -> green",-0.06428578414403657,85,dax
"Analyzing the examples given and the corresponding outputs, I will try to figure out the underlying rule for what ""dax"" means in each context:

1. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
2. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
3. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
4. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
5. zup lug dax -> yellow blue green

The word ""dax"" appears in different positions and with different preceding words. Here's what stands out:

- In every instance where ""dax"" is present, the word ""green"" appears immediately in the output.
- ""Dax"" does not seem to depend on its position in the sequence or the specific words that come before or after it.
- Regardless of the context, ""dax"" always results in ""green.""

Considering the above observations, the rule for ""dax"" can be deduced as:

Rule: dax -> green

This means that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" every time it appears in the input.",-0.09304821810947561,85,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the patterns:

1. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
2. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
3. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
4. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
5. zup lug dax -> yellow blue green

Looking at the inputs and corresponding outputs, it seems ""dax"" may have a dependency on the word that comes before it. Let's compare:

- In example 1, ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" and the corresponding output is ""green,"" which has not appeared before ""dax.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""green"" which is a new color for that sequence.
- In example 3, ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" and the output is ""green,"" which is not repeated from the previous colors.
- In example 4, ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" and the output again is ""green,"" and this ""green"" is then repeated after ""walm.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""green,"" which is a new color for that sequence.

A possible rule is that ""dax"" translates to the word ""green,"" independent of context, as ""green"" follows every occurrence of ""dax"" in the output. Furthermore, ""dax"" itself doesn't seem to affect the translation of the words around it, as those translations are consistent with instances where ""dax"" doesn't appear.

"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the consistent pattern where the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. However, the color following 'wif' appears to be contingent on the word that comes after it.

In the examples:

- When 'wif' is followed by 'lug', the output is 'blue'.
- When 'wif' is followed by 'dax', the output is 'green'.
- When 'wif' is not immediately followed by another word that is recognized in the examples ('lug', 'dax', 'bluf'), it defaults back to the color 'red'.

Also, 'wif' seems to be able to appear more than once in the input sequence, with its meaning persisting as 'red', unless it directly precedes other known words ('lug' or 'dax'), which changes the succeeding color.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

- ""wif bluf dax"" → ""red red green""

1. In the first example, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" might output a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word right before it. Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow green green green red."" Directly before the first ""walm,"" we have ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so again ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated thrice.

3. In the third example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" has the output ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Directly before ""walm,"" we have ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we see ""yellow"" repeated thrice after ""walm.""

4. In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow.""

However, directly after ""lug,"" we have ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by another walm, which results in three ""yellow.""

5. In the last example, ""dax wif walm"" yields ""green red red red."" Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated thrice.

- In the second example, ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow green green green red."" When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the word ""green"" is repeated twice.

- In the third example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" We see ""walm"" following two instances of ""zup,"" resulting in two additional repetitions of ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" After ""walm"" appears once, ""red"" is repeated twice, and when it appears again after ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice.

- In the fifth example, ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red."" Here ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated twice.

- The fourth example includes ""wif walm"" and ""zup walm"" where ""wif"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, so ""walm"" results in ""red red red"" and ""yellow yellow yellow.""

**Rule:** ""zup"" produces an output of ""yellow."" Additionally, when a word appears immediately after ""zup,"" the output for that word changes to repeat the color corresponding to ""zup"" (yellow) for as many times as that word appears consecutively.

1. In ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" we see that 'lug' is 'blue' and is followed by 'walm,' which also results in the color 'blue.' The word 'zup' following 'walm' turns the color back to 'yellow.'
2. In ""lug zup walm lug,"" the word 'zup' precedes 'walm' and both have the output 'yellow,' and 'walm' is followed by 'lug' which turns the next color back to 'blue.'

In this example, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" correlates with ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" which is consistent with the color that ""zup"" translates to.

Again, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red."" This supports the idea that ""bluf"" may adopt the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Input: lug wif bluf

Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red."" This further supports the pattern we have observed.

- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green red.""
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red.""

Now, examining the occurrences of ""bluf"" and their outputs:

- In the first instance, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

- In the fourth instance, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" yet again, and the output is also ""red.""
- In the last instance, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""red.""

From these observations, it seems ""bluf"" yields the output ""red"" regardless of what precedes it. The only variance seen is in the second example where ""bluf"" yields ""yellow"" when it is at the end of a sequence, but since there's only one such occurrence, this isn't enough to draw a conclusion for a different rule when ""bluf"" is at the end.

4. When ""dax"" appears after ""walm,"" it translates to green. (Example 4)

Based on all the examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to green, regardless of the context. Therefore, we can conclude the rule is:

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Here is the evidence for this conclusion:

- In every occurrence of the word ""dax,"" the output is always ""green.""
- Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sentence, its output remains ""green.""
- The word ""dax"" does not appear to depend on context for its meaning; its translation to ""green"" is consistent.

"Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs to find a consistent pattern.

- In the first example, ""zup dax zup"" corresponds to ""yellow green yellow"". The word ""zup"" appears twice and both times it is translated to ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""zup dax wif"" maps to ""yellow green red"". The word ""zup"" appears once and is translated to ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""lug dax zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow blue red"". In this example, ""zup"" is again translated to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"" turns into ""yellow red red red"". The word ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" once more.
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" is represented by ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". The word ""zup"" appears twice: once it is translated to ""yellow"" and another time it appears as ""yellow yellow yellow"", which might suggest a pattern of repetition or emphasis when ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"".

Given these examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"", despite some contextual variations which may not be fully explained with the given data (specifically the ""yellow yellow yellow"" outcome in the final example).

- ""wif"" always translates to ""red""

- ""walm"" translates to ""red"" and seems to repeat the ""red"" for the number of times it is mentioned in a sequence 

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is: zup -> yellow.",-0.779205811714773,88,zup

- ""zup"" is related to the color yellow.
- ""dax"" is related to the color green.
- ""wif"" is related to the color red.
- ""lug"" is related to the color blue.
- ""walm"" seems to have a rule that differs from the others, as it corresponds to red when following ""wif"" but produces a repetition of the preceding nonce word's color otherwise.

Specifically for ""zup,"" we see a consistent pattern: whenever ""zup"" is used in the input, the color yellow is produced in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context provided by adjacent words. This suggests that ""zup"" directly translates to the color yellow.

The rule for ""zup"" would, therefore, be: zup -> yellow.",-0.8516163722896589,88,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we will look at the consistent output across different inputs:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is produced in the output.
- ""zup"" maintains a strict one-to-one correspondence with the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words.

Hence, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-1.5484340063826139,88,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Consequently, it seems that zup independently signifies the color yellow without depending on the context.

"From the provided examples, we can determine a pattern for the word ""bluf"" by looking at its position in the sentence and the corresponding output in each case.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""red"" since it is producing an additional ""red"" in the output. But we need more examples to confirm this.

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

In this sequence, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" again, and once again, the word preceding ""bluf"" appears twice in the output.

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" appears twice, which implies that ""bluf"" could mean a repetition of the color linked to the word that precedes it.

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated. Next, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated. This further supports the idea that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Once more, ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word, ""wif,"" so we get ""red red"" before moving on to the next word, ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",-0.0662710222915909,88,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs:

1. When ""wif bluf"" is presented, the output is ""red red."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red,"" it's possible that ""bluf"" also means red, resulting in a repeated color.
   
2. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Here, we can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" In the end, ""wif bluf"" again results in ""red red,"" consistent with our initial observation.

3. ""zup dax bluf"" results in ""yellow green green."" This is intriguing because the ""bluf"" here leads to a single ""green,"" which is the same as ""dax."" This challenges our initial theory that ""bluf"" always translates to ""red.""

4. ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" produces ""red blue blue yellow yellow green."" Here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Noticing the pattern, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in another ""blue,"" and when it follows ""zup,"" two ""yellow"" appears. Lastly, when it follows ""dax,"" two greens appear in the output.

5. ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green."" According to our initial observation ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red,"" but now the appearance of ""dax"" after ""bluf"" results in a single ""green.""

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator of the color word that comes right before it:
- After ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" results in another ""red.""
- After ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" results in another ""blue.""
- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow.""
- After ""dax"" (green), the output is still a single ""green,"" this might indicate an exception to the rule or a mistake in the pattern.

However, example 3, where ""bluf"" after ""dax"" results in a single ""green,"" deviates from this pattern. If we treat this as an exception, we could stipulate that ""bluf"" duplicates the previous color except following ""dax.""

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color that precedes it, except when following ""dax,"" where the output remains a single instance of the preceding color (in this case, ""green"").

Example 2: ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" Here ""red"" repeats after ""wif"" when ""walm"" follows it, until the sequence is broken by ""dax.""

Example 3: ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" The ""red"" repeats following ""wif"" due to ""walm.""

Example 4: ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" The ""yellow"" repeats following ""zup"" with ""walm"" afterward.

3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf

""walm"" follows ""yellow"" again, resulting in an additional two occurrences of ""yellow"".

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and following it, ""walm"" again causes repetition, this time of ""red"".

5. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and following ""dax"", ""walm"" leads to additional occurrences of ""green"".

From these examples we can deduce that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color given before it, for a total of three times (including the initial mention). If ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes three occurrences of the color corresponding to the word that comes before it.

3. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
4. wif walm -> red red red
5. lug dax walm -> blue green green green

Next, let's take a look at the color before and after ""walm"":

1. In the first line, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") and followed by ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""). The three ""yellow"" in the output indicate that ""walm"" doesn't directly translate to a single ""yellow"". Instead, it is associated with multiple yellows.
2. In the second line, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") and there is nothing after it. All three output colors are ""blue,"" showing a similar pattern to the first line.
3. In the third line, ""walm"" is again preceded by ""zup"" (yellow) and followed by ""dax"" (green). The output shows multiple ""yellow"" again after ""walm"".
4. In the fourth line, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" (red), and there is nothing after it. The output is all ""red,"" following the same pattern.
5. In the fifth line, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue). The output is three ""green"" after ""walm"", the same pattern as before.

From these observations, we can see that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it. Specifically, it seems to replicate the previous color three times, regardless of what comes after ""walm"".

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" results in the word immediately preceding it being repeated in the output as many times as there are letters in the word ""walm"" (which is four letters). Here are the observations supporting this:

1. ""dax zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow yellow"", with ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"" and being repeated four times.
2. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", where ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug"" and is repeated three times (note that the rule seems to break here since ""walm"" has four letters, but ""blue"" is only repeated three times—this could be a data error).
3. ""zup lug zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow yellow"", repeating ""yellow"" (for ""zup"") four times after ""walm.""
4. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", with ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"" and repeated three times (which also seems to break the rule given the presence of the four-letter ""walm""—so this could be another data error).
5. ""lug dax walm"" leads to ""green green green green"", with ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"" and repeated four times.

However, one possibility could be that these are meant to be exceptional cases, or there is another rule that defines when the repetition is less than four times.

Assuming there are no exceptions and there is no additional information to explain the inconsistencies, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule:
- ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" four times.

"Walm -> green

Rule: When the nonce word 'walm' is used in the input, all following words, up to but not including the next appearance of a word that appeared earlier in the input, take the color 'green'. If 'walm' is the last word or no word repeats after 'walm', all remaining words are 'green'.

"From the examples provided, we can induce that the outputs are sequences of colored words, and that the presence of ""lug"" in the input correlates with ""blue"" in the output.

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
2. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
4. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
5. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""

From the first example, we see that including ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""blue."" This pattern is consistent across the examples — whenever ""lug"" precedes another word, the output has a corresponding ""blue"" for each instance of ""lug"" and for each instance of the following word.

The second and third examples further indicate that ""lug"" doesn't just result in one blue, but rather a number of blues equal to the number of words following ""lug"" (plus one for the ""lug"" itself).

The fourth example introduces more words and a second instance of ""lug"" within the string. Still, this instance of ""lug"" is followed by only one word, therefore only one ""blue"" follows in the output.

Based on the observations, we derive the following rule for ""lug"":

Rule: ""lug"" translates to repeated instances of ""blue"" in the output, with the number of blues equal to the number of words following ""lug"" in the sequence, plus one for the ""lug"" itself.

So, lug -> meaning:

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""green.""

Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule:
dax -> green",-0.08046404838857694,90,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here are the examples provided:

1. wif dax zup wif -> red green yellow red
2. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
3. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
4. wif bluf dax -> red red green
5. dax bluf -> green green

By examining the example inputs and outputs, we can infer the following:

- When ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red.""
- When ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" shows up once or twice in succession in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"" repeated the same number of times (""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""green"").

Now let's look at ""dax."" It appears in the examples both alone and adjacent to other words. Here are the patterns we can deduce:

- In the first example, the word ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" and corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and end. It corresponds to ""green"" each time it appears and is followed by ""walm wif,"" which leads to ""green red.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" is at the end and follows ""lug walm,"" which corresponds to ""blue blue blue green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" follows ""wif bluf"" and results in ""red red green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and results in ""green green.""

- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"", as seen in the fourth and fifth examples.
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""
- The word ""lug"" and ""walm"" correspond to the color ""blue"" based on their usage in the third example.

Now, we need to deduce what ""dax"" corresponds to. It seems that ""dax"" appears before colors that have already been mentioned: ""green"" and ""red"". More specifically, it appears to precede the color that is going to be the next in the sequence. Let's review the examples to see if this holds up:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" (yellow) and then later precedes ""wif"" (red).
2. In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by the color green every time (matching ""walm"" and ""wif"").
3. In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by green after ""lug walm"" (both blue).
4. In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green,"" so ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" (green).
5. In the fifth example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" so again ""dax"" precedes the color green.

From this, we can determine that ""dax"" is not a color by itself, but rather a rule that makes the next color in the sequence be ""green."" It is worth noting that there’s not enough data to fully understand the mechanics of ""dax"" when it leads the sequence, as in the second and fifth examples, but given the evidence, the simplest interpretation is as follows:

- The fifth input has ""dax"" as the first word and ""green"" as the first color in the output.

With this pattern, there is a consistent rule that whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",-1.7525379776505892,91,dax
"From the provided examples, we can infer a correspondence between each unique word and a color. Each instance of the word ""dax"" maps to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",-1.8226475731311769,91,dax
"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the given examples.

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

3. Input: wif
   Output: red

4. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

5. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green

First, note that in every instance where the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" follows.

From example 1, ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" and the output is ""red"" followed by ""red red,"" which seems to indicate that ""wif"" may mean ""repeat the next color twice.""

Additionally, in example 5, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""red"" followed by ""yellow,"" not repeating the color ""yellow."" However, we should note that the word ""dax"" appears on both sides of ""wif zup,"" and is represented by the color ""green"" on both sides. This suggests that ""wif"" may not be related to the word after it, but rather, ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"" itself—regardless of the word that follows.

The second example further confirms the idea that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" independent of the following word. Each instance of ""wif"" yields a ""red"" in the output. Even when ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is still red, followed by the corresponding color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

Examples 3 and 4 show standalone instances of ""wif"" leading to the output ""red"" or ""red yellow"" when followed by ""zup.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" independent of any subsequent words.

Rule: wif -> red",-0.06753582704671765,91,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following associations between the input nonce words and the output colors:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> red
- dax -> green

Now, let's focus on the word ""wif"". It's consistent across the examples that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is included in the output. For instance, when ""wif"" appears alone (Example 3: ""wif""), the output is simply ""red"". When ""wif"" appears alongside other words (""zup lug walm wif walm"" or ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug""), ""red"" is included in the output for each occurrence of ""wif"".

However, we also need to note that in the examples provided, ""wif"" does not always produce a singular ""red"" in the output. When ""wif"" is followed by another word that has a color associated with it, that color follows ""red"" in the sequence corresponding to the appearance of ""wif"". For example,

- In the second input (""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug""), ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""walm"", so after each ""red"" a ""blue"" and another ""red"" follow, respectively.

To distill this into a rule:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". 

The first example gives us a repetition of ""walm"" after ""wif"" which also repeats the color ""red"". This might indicate that ""wif"" can repeat its associated color.

The second example shows ""lug"" both before and after ""wif"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" and again, the color ""red"" is repeated after ""wif"".

The third example is straightforward: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

The fourth example again shows that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

The fifth example demonstrates that regardless of the surrounding ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") or ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), ""wif"" remains ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.",-1.0538388407056472,91,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color red each time it is used.

Rule: wif -> red",-1.7930749910152943,91,wif

- bluf -> red

It appears that regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence, the output always contains the color ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" maps directly to the color ""yellow."" The order of colors in the output corresponds to the order of associated words in the input.

"Analyzing the provided examples and matching each ""bluf"" occurrence with its respective output, we observe the following pattern:

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue."" The last ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it, which is ""lug"" for blue.
- In the second example, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" becomes ""red blue blue yellow yellow green."" Each ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word: the first ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" for blue, and the second ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" for yellow.
- In the third example, ""dax zup bluf"" turns into ""green yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" is yellow, following ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" becomes ""blue yellow yellow green."" The ""bluf"" in this case is yellow again, taking the color of ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue."" The ""bluf"" takes the color red from the preceding ""wif.""

From the examples, it appears that 'bluf' results in the repetition of the color word before 'bluf' being duplicated in the output:

2. wif bluf -> red red
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. dax bluf -> not explicitly shown but can be inferred

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is said immediately before it. Here are the observations supporting this rule:

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug bluf"", the word that comes before ""bluf"" is ""lug"", which has been translated as ""blue"", so ""bluf"" also becomes ""blue"".
  
- In the second example, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" first time and ""zup"" second time, translating to ""blue"" and then ""yellow"", which matches the color stated before each ""bluf"".

- In the third example, ""dax zup bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"".

- In the fourth example, ""lug zup bluf dax"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again, leading to the translation as ""yellow"".

- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which results in the translation to ""red"".

"Observing the provided examples, we can see that each word corresponds to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> ?

Now, to deduce the meaning of the word 'walm', we can look for patterns in the output relative to the input.

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, the word ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and results in three ""yellow"" instead of one.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red red"", or three reds.

3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   In this instance, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and we see ""red red red"" once again after it.

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and we get ""yellow yellow yellow"".

5. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Finally, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".

From these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. For example, if ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to yellow), the output is three instances of ""yellow"". Similarly, if ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output is three instances of ""red"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.06423420839741345,91,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the output of each sentence relative to its input:

1. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
4. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow

If we break this down:

- In Example 1, ""walm"" appears at the end after ""zup"" and translates to three ""yellow"" in a row.
- In Example 2, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and translates to three ""red"" in a row.
- In Example 3, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and before ""lug,"" and translates to red followed by two ""red"" and then a ""blue.""
- In Example 4, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and translates to three ""yellow"" in a row.
- In Example 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and translates to three ""yellow"" in a row.

Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of three of the color corresponding to the word that comes right before it:

- After ""zup"" (which is ""yellow""), ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- After ""wif"" (which is ""red""), ""walm"" translates to ""red red red.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the pattern of words before and after ""bluf"" and their corresponding outputs:

- In every input where ""bluf"" appears, the resulting output contains a duplicated color word corresponding to the word that precedes ""bluf.""
- After the duplicated color, there is a new color that corresponds to the word following ""bluf"" (if any).

Let's look at the examples to understand this pattern:

1. Input: ""wif bluf lug""
   Output: ""red red blue""
   
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color ""red."" Since ""red"" is repeated after ""bluf,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" causes the preceding color to duplicate. The word after ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" corresponding to the color ""blue.""

2. Input: ""zup bluf dax""
   Output: ""yellow yellow green""
   
   Here, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" which is then duplicated. Afterwards, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

3. Input: ""dax wif dax zup bluf""
   Output: ""green red green yellow yellow""
   
   There is no word after ""bluf"" in this case, but we can still see the preceding word ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" is repeated after ""bluf.""

4. Input: ""wif bluf""
   Output: ""red red""
   
   Only the word ""wif"" is before ""bluf,"" and the corresponding color ""red"" is duplicated. No words come after ""bluf"" to give us another color.

5. Input: ""zup bluf dax lug""
   Output: ""yellow yellow green blue""
   
   Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is duplicated after ""bluf,"" and the following words correspond to their respective colors.

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be duplicated in the output, followed by the color corresponding to the word immediately after ""bluf"" (if there is one).

Therefore, the rule is: bluf -> duplicate the preceding color word, then add the following color word if available.",-0.08608245128815385,92,bluf

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".",-0.12945639897039474,93,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns and correlations within the examples provided and the resulting outputs. 

Let's look at the occurrence of ""bluf"" in the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
2. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

Observing these examples:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the word that immediately follows in the output is a repetition of the output for the word that precedes ""bluf"". 
- For instance, in example 1, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""red"" in the output. Similarly, in example 2, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"", and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"", which is repeated after ""bluf"".

Based on this pattern, we can induce that ""bluf"" causes the color word corresponding to the previous word to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> causes a repeat of the color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".",-0.13140589535855268,93,bluf
"Observing the examples:

- Input: zup lug bluf | Output: yellow blue blue
- Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
- Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
- Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow

A rule can be induced from the input-output pairs by comparing the words and their colors:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Given that ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color word that precedes it in the sequence, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that comes before it in the input sequence. If ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"", it outputs ""yellow"". If ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"", it outputs ""red"". If ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"", it outputs ""green"". If ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"", it outputs ""blue"".

Thus:

"Based on the given examples, the translation of each word is consistent across different sentences. Here's the word-to-color mapping that can be deduced:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Using this mapping, we can deduce what ""bluf"" means by looking at the outputs assigned to inputs that include it. Considering that the output lists have one more occurrence of a given color than expected from the other words, ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the input.

To test the rule, let's take the second input provided: ""zup lug bluf."" We know ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""lug"" to blue. According to our rule, ""bluf"" would replicate the color of the word before it, which in this case is ""lug""/blue. Observing the output ""yellow blue blue"" confirms that ""bluf"" did indeed become blue, matching ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> Replicates the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: If a word X precedes ""bluf"" in the input, then the output for ""bluf"" takes the color associated with word X.",-0.7558700166899999,93,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color output that matches the color output of the word directly preceding it. To confirm this, we can look at how the output changes in each example:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" so the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" whose output is ""blue,"" so the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue.""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" again produces a color that matches the color output of the word preceding it.
- In the last example, ""bluf"" is directly after ""zup,"" whose output is ""yellow,"" so the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes the color of the word immediately before it. Therefore:

- In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" ""Zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. Again, ""walm"" takes the color ""red,"" matching the color associated with the word immediately before it, ""wif.""

- In the third example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" it takes on the color ""green,"" the same as the following word ""dax.""

- In the fourth input, ""zup walm dax lug,"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Here ""walm"" again matches the color of the word immediately before it, ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Again, ""walm"" takes on the color ""red,"" which corresponds to the color of the preceding word ""wif.""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately before it.

"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs given to determine the meaning of ""walm.""

- In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" corresponds to ""green green green blue."" Both ""dax"" and ""lug"" are represented by ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively in other examples. Therefore, ""walm"" in this context also represents ""green.""

- In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red blue."" We can see ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"" from other examples. The double occurrence of ""red"" suggests that ""walm"" here means ""red.""

- The third example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" ""bluf"" is the only new word here, and it corresponds to ""yellow."" Since we have established the colors for the other words from previous examples, the remaining color ""blue"" is repeated three times, and ""walm"" is followed by ""dax lug,"" which gives us ""green blue."" Since ""dax"" is ""green,"" it appears ""walm"" is the cause of the additional ""blue"" here, suggesting that ""walm"" means ""blue.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" With ""zup"" already known as ""yellow"" and ""dax"" and ""lug"" as ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively, it seems again that ""walm"" is represented by the color ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red."" Since ""wif"" is known to be ""red,"" the additional ""red"" here would be attributed to ""walm.""

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. In other words, ""walm"" copies or repeats the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: walm -> copies the color of the preceding word.",-0.08169499296764042,93,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns related to the examples provided:

1. Input: ""dax walm lug"" | Output: ""green green green blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to the ending ""blue."" Thus, ""walm"" in this context seems to generate a repetition of the color associated with ""dax.""

2. Input: ""zup wif walm lug"" | Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red."" ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue"" again. Here ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with ""wif.""

3. Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" | Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
   - ""wif"" results in ""red,"" ""zup"" in ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" in ""blue,"" and ""dax"" in ""green,"" with ""lug"" consistently mapping to ""blue."" ""Walm"" occurs before the second ""dax."" In this case, ""walm"" is associated with repetition but it's preceding the indication of color (""dax"") for tripling.

4. Input: ""zup walm dax lug"" | Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Walm"" in this context seems to triplet the color associated with ""zup.""

5. Input: ""wif walm"" | Output: ""red red red""
   - With ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" ""walm"" without any following color indicator is causing a triplet of ""red.""

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in total in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> Triplet the preceding color word in the output.",-0.11191811210123599,93,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine its usage across the different examples and the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze the patterns:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" results in ""green.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" still results in ""green.""
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""lug,"" which yield ""blue"" and ""blue"" respectively. The output for ""walm"" alone here cannot be directly determined, as there are multiple ""blue"" in the sequence. Hence, we will need further analysis.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is immediately followed by ""dax"" which results in ""yellow green."" Based on previous examples, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" presumably corresponds to ""yellow.""
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" results in ""red.""

When we focus on instances where ""walm"" is the only variable, the corresponding colors change depending on the word that comes before it. This suggests that ""walm"" likely takes on the color of the preceding word, or repeats the output color for the word just before it.

Given these examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The output color of ""walm"" corresponds to the output color of the word preceding it.

If the word preceding ""walm"" is not given, then it might default to ""red,"" as shown in the last example where ""walm"" is at the end with no preceding context, resulting in ""red.""

"Based on the provided examples, we will try to establish a pattern for the word ""lug"" and its corresponding output.

From the given examples:

- ""lug"" by itself produces the output ""blue,"" so it suggests that ""lug"" maps directly to ""blue.""
- In sequences where ""lug"" appears with other nonce words, it consistently results in ""blue"" being part of the output sequence, such as ""lug zup"" mapping to ""blue yellow,"" and ""wif lug"" mapping to ""red blue.""
- The position of ""lug"" among other nonce words does not seem to influence its output; it consistently maps to ""blue,"" whether it's at the beginning, middle, or end of a sequence.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its placement in the input sequence or the other nonce words present.

Looking at the last example:

Based on all examples, the word ""wif"" precedes the color red, except in the scenario when it is followed by ""lug,"" where it precedes yellow instead. However, this anomaly could be a typo, as ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" in other examples.

"Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" does not represent a consistent word each time. Instead, its meaning changes depending on the context, particularly the word that precedes it. Here's the rule deduced from the examples:

When the word preceding ""bluf"" (the preceding word will be designated as ""X"") is repeated, the output is the color associated with ""X"" repeated twice. In the case of ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax,"" which yield ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green"" respectively, when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is the same color word repeated.

When ""bluf"" is followed by other words without it immediately following the aforementioned color words (""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""dax""), the output is the color associated with ""bluf"" repeated once, followed by the colors associated with the following words.

Rule:
- If the input is ""X bluf"" without any other words after ""bluf"", and ""X"" is a word that represents a specific color, then the output is the color associated with ""X"" repeated twice.
- If ""bluf"" is surrounded by words, without fitting the previous pattern, the color associated with ""bluf"" is ""yellow"", and it is placed in the output sequence according to its position after ""bluf"".

Therefore, ""bluf"" represents the previous color word (such as ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""green"") repeated when it directly follows such a word. Otherwise, ""bluf"" represents the color ""yellow.""

Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be outputted three times total. If a color word is mentioned once before ""walm,"" it is repeated twice more after that. If ""walm"" is at the end following a non-color word, it defaults to ""red.""

Given the outputs corresponding to each input sequence, the word ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color word that directly precedes it in the sequence. The color word is repeated as many times as ""walm"" indicates. The following explains the pattern:

- For ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", or ""zup"" repeated three times.
- In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"", the sequence ends with ""wif walm"". ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the output is ""red red red"", or ""wif"" repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" gives the output ""yellow yellow yellow"", again repeating ""zup"" three times.
- ""lug walm wif"" has ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and the output is ""blue blue blue red"", ""lug"" is repeated three times followed by the color for ""wif"".

- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it's the final word and ""red"" if followed by another word
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in every instance it appears. The position of ""dax"" in the sentence and the words it is combined with do not appear to affect its corresponding output. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" based on these examples.

Example 3: ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" -> Output: ""green green yellow yellow green""
Example 4: ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow red green blue""
Example 5: ""wif lug dax lug"" -> Output: ""red blue green blue""

From these examples, we can infer that:

1. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" as it always results in ""yellow"" in the output.
2. ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" but translates to ""green"" when it does not follow ""zup"" or is preceded by ""dax.""
3. ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
4. ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
5. ""walm"" has no direct translation given, but since the output is ""green"" and it follows ""dax,"" it may follow the same pattern as ""bluf"" after ""dax.""

2. In the sequences without 'zup,' 'dax' consistently translates to 'green.' Regardless of its position in the sequence, this color association seems consistent.

3. In all examples provided, 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green.' There is no instance where 'dax' translates to any color other than green, which implies that the context does not change its meaning within the given examples.

Input: wif zup wif dax
Output: red yellow red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

- bluf -> blue (since it produces two blue outputs, similar to ""lug"")

Now, we analyze the sequence of words and their color outputs to determine the meaning of 'wif':

- dax wif walm -> green red red red
- wif walm -> red red red

From these two examples, we can see that without ""dax,"" the output for ""wif walm"" lacks the first ""green."" This suggests that ""wif"" on its own does not produce ""green.""

- dax lug dax lug wif -> green blue green blue red
- lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue red blue blue

2. Input: ""wif zup bluf"" -> Output: ""red yellow yellow""

3. Input: ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> Output: ""blue green green yellow blue red""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs to find patterns.

Looking at the examples:

1. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
2. dax wif walm -> green red red red
3. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
4. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. dax walm -> green green green

Based on these examples, the following patterns are noticeable:
- Every time ""walm"" appears, we see a repetition of the color that precedes its appearance:
  
  Example 1: zup walm - yellow yellow yellow
  Example 2: wif walm - red red red
  Example 3: dax walm - green green green
  Example 4: zup walm - yellow yellow yellow

- The occurrences of ""walm"" are not just repetitions, but they also seem to repeat the color of the last mentioned word before ""walm"" as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the sequence:
  
  Example 1: ""walm"" is the second word, so ""yellow"" is repeated twice after the first instance.
  Example 2: ""walm"" is the third word, so ""red"" is repeated three times total.
  Example 3: ""walm"" is the fourth word, so ""green"" is repeated three more times after the first instance (four times total).
  Example 4: ""walm"" is the sixth word, so ""yellow"" is repeated five more times after the first instance (six times total).
  Example 5: ""walm"" is the second word, so ""green"" is repeated twice after the first instance.

From this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the word sequence.",-0.0829539283307191,95,walm

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" turns out to correspond to ""green"" once again

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""bluf"" is unknown, but outputs another ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow

Input: dax walm Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green""

Based on the outputs, the following pattern appears: Whenever the word ""walm"" is used, it replicates the color output of the word that comes immediately before it. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color output of the word that directly precedes ""walm"".",-0.12237633507662929,95,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the outputs that correlate with the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs.

In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to three occurrences of ""yellow.""
In the second example, ""walm"" corresponds to three occurrences of ""red.""
In the third example, ""walm"" corresponds to three occurrences of ""green.""
In the fourth example, ""walm"" gives us three occurrences of ""yellow.""
In the fifth example, ""walm"" is associated with three occurrences of ""green.""

It appears that ""walm"" results in a triple repetition of the color that is represented by the word just before it. So, in each instance, ""walm"" produces three outputs of the color that follows the preceding word's color:

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow (since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"")
Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red (since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")
Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green (since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"")
Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue (since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"")
Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green (since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"")

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the next word's color to be repeated three times.",-0.3575567597807863,95,walm
"Based on the patterns observed in the given examples, one possible rule that can be deduced is that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color of the word immediately preceding it multiple times.

To illustrate:

1. In the first example, ""zup walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" caused the output to be ""yellow"" repeated three times.

2. In the second example, ""dax wif walm"" resulted in ""green red red red."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" caused the output to be ""red"" repeated three times.

3. In the third example, ""dax walm"" resulted in ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" caused the output to be ""green"" repeated three times.

4. The fourth example complicates the analysis as ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" resulted in a sequence where ""walm"" led to the word ""yellow"" being repeated twice instead of three times like in the previous examples. This may suggest that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word a variable number of times, potentially depending on context, such as the position in the sequence or the specific color words that appear before ""walm.""

However, based on majority and ignoring the fourth example as an outlier, the general rule seems to be: 

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times. (In the aberrant fourth example, it only repeated twice, suggesting there may be a more complex rule that is not discernible from the given examples alone.)

Taking into account all the examples provided, including the fourth one, a more comprehensive rule might be:

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat multiple times, with the specific number of times possibly depending on context or position in the sequence. The exact mechanism determining the number of repetitions remains unclear with the given data.",-0.7391266748510116,95,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will look at each instance of the word and the corresponding output.

From the examples provided:

1. In the first and fifth examples where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the word after ""walm"" is green (except for the end of a sequence, where there is no word following ""walm"").

2. In the second example, the presence of ""walm"" results in the output red repeated for the number of words preceding ""walm.""

3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is green for the number of words preceding ""walm.""

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by another ""lug,"" and both outputs are yellow.

Analyzing these patterns, we can deduce the following:

- ""walm"" seems to produce an output color that repeats for the number of words that have preceded ""walm."" The specific color primarily depends on the word immediately before ""walm."" If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the output color is green. If it's any other word, ""walm"" generates red. However, when ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" we see yellow instead.

- Since the color changes with the context, ""walm"" probably means to repeat the color of the previous word's output (or have some contextual output based on the surrounding words), with an exception for ""lug"" following which leads to yellow.

walm -> repeat the output color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for the number of times equal to the count of words before ""walm,"" with an exception that if ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" the output is yellow instead.",-1.5702883270865169,95,walm

Rule:

- If ""bluf"" is followed by another word, it indicates that the color associated with that following word should be also repeated.",-1.4590670661791667,97,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the color outputs corresponding to its occurrences and see if there's a consistent pattern.

From the examples given, we can see:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm  
   Output: red red green green green
   
2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug  
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

3. Input: wif walm dax  
   Output: red red red green

4. Input: zup walm  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug  
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

In every example where ""walm"" appears, the color sequence always ends with multiple instances of the last color mentioned:

- In the first example, walm is followed by two ""green"" which is the color corresponding to ""dax.""
- In the second example, walm is followed by three ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
- In the third example, walm is followed by one ""green"" which is the color corresponding to ""dax"" since it is at the end of the sequence.
- In the fourth example, walm is followed by three ""yellow,"" again corresponding to ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, walm is followed by two ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif"" since ""walm"" precedes it.

From this pattern, we can infer that ""walm"" results in repeating the color output of the last color word mentioned before it, the number of times appears to equal the number of times ""walm"" has been used in the sequence counting from the backwards.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color word an increasing number of times.",-0.10864056534707371,97,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug

   Output: red red red green

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

From the examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"". Here are some observations:

- Whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the initial series of colors are repeated in the output.
- The color corresponding to ""walm"" itself matches the color that was immediate before it in the sequence.
- The repetition includes the color corresponding to ""walm"" as part of the sequence that’s repeated.

Example analysis:

- In example 1, ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green,"" which is immediately followed by ""green green"" after ""walm"". Thus, ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the previous series including its own corresponding color ""green"".

- In example 2, ""wif lug zup"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow,"" followed by ""yellow yellow"" after ""walm"". Again, ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the previous series including its own corresponding color ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, we can induce a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is encountered, it triggers the repetition of the color sequence that directly precedes it, including the color that ""walm"" itself contributes to the sequence.

Thus, we can deduce:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" as well (in the first example)
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

The word ""walm"" appears to cause a repeated output of the last color mentioned before it until the color changes due to another word. For example:

- In the first input, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" so the output is ""green green green"" after ""walm.""
- In the second input, ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") precedes ""walm,"" so the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""walm.""
- In the third input, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" so the output is ""green.""
- In the fourth input, ""zup"" alone precedes ""walm,"" so the output is three ""yellow"" after ""walm.""
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" so the output is ""red red red"" after ""walm.""

Rule:

The meaning of ""wif"" is consistently ""red"" across all examples.",-0.08279409131816438,98,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" as well as the meaning of the other words provided. Here's what we can deduce:

- Each time ""wif"" appears on its own, the output is ""red.""
- Each time ""wif"" appears in combination with other words, it still translates to ""red.""

We can further notice that whenever other words appear, such as ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup,"" they seem to have their own corresponding color outputs.

- ""wif"" always results in ""red.""
- ""walm,"" when it appears, results in instances of ""red.""
- ""lug"" always results in ""blue.""
- ""dax"" always results in ""green.""
- ""zup"" always results in ""yellow.""

However, there are some anomalies we should consider before formulating the rule. For instance, in the second example, ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" which suggests ""walm"" may somehow multiply the output of ""wif"" instead of having a color of its own. Additionally, ""lug"" does not output multiple ""blue"" in the third example, suggesting it does not multiply its output either.

With this in mind, here's a tentative rule:

- ""wif"" represents the color ""red.""
- Other words might have consistent color translations or could influence the repetition of the color outputs in some way.

1. Input: ""wif"" / Output: ""red""

2. Other inputs involve more words, and the output is a list of colors. For these inputs, without knowing the meaning of other words like 'walm', 'lug', 'dax', 'zup', and 'bluf', we can focus on instances where 'wif' appears and see what is constant in the output.

3. Every time 'wif' appears in the input, 'red' appears in the output. Even when there are other words, that direct translation doesn't change.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" let's look at the patterns surrounding its use and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   
3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   
5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

Analyzing the outputs:

- When ""walm"" is present after ""wif,"" the following output is ""red red red green"".
- When ""walm"" is present after ""dax,"" the following output is ""green green green"".
- When ""walm"" is present at the end of the input (after another word), the immediate output is ""green"".

Based on the observed patterns, it seems that ""walm"" translates to a sequence of ""green"" outputs with the number of greens potentially dependent on the position of ""walm"" within the input or the words that precede it. Specifically:
- ""wif walm"" leads to three ""red"" followed by one ""green"".
- ""dax walm"" leads to three ""green"" irrespective of the number of times ""dax"" appears before.
- ""zup walm"" leads to two ""green"".
- When ""walm"" appears at the end, it translates to just a ""green"".

Given the inconsistencies and the limited context we can deduce that ""walm"" generally translates to ""green"", but the number of times ""green"" appears seems to be influenced by the preceding word(s) and possibly its position in the sequence, which is not entirely clear with the provided data.

Rule: walm -> generally translates to the color ""green"", with the amount of green potentially affected by the preceding word(s) and its position in the sequence.",-0.07605968945166663,98,walm
"To analyze the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at its occurrences and their corresponding outputs, and then we'll try to identify a pattern or rule that describes its meaning.

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by a single ""green.""
- In the second example, ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green."" ""Walm"" is at the end again, and it is followed by three ""green.""
- In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" ""Walm"" is followed by ""green"" again, but this time it is followed by ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""green green green red blue green green green."" Here, ""walm"" appears twice and each time is followed by ""green,"" but the number of ""green"" varies based on what follows.
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red."" Here, there are no ""green"" after ""walm,"" but what follows ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which translates to ""red.""

Analyzing these examples, we can see that ""walm"" is consistently followed by ""green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" contributes to generating a ""green"" in the output. However, the number of greens that follow ""walm"" differs depending on the words that come after ""walm."" When ""walm"" is at the end, or before a word that doesn't normally turn to ""green,"" it is followed by a varying number of greens.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" contributes to the generation of ""green"" in the output. When ""walm"" is followed by words that have a certain color association (other than green), the number of ""green"" outputs it generates varies, adding more ""green"" outputs until a color corresponding to the next word is reached in the sequence. When ""walm"" is at the end or not followed by another colored word, it seems to generate additional ""green"" until the sequence ends.",-0.10370861096648955,98,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's analyze the given input-output pairs to identify any patterns or rules. We will look at the position of ""walm"" in each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

Observations:

- ""walm"" appears after ""wif"": output is ""red red red green"" (examples 1 and 5).
- ""walm"" appears after ""dax"": output is ""green green green"" (examples 1, 3, and 4).
- ""walm"" is the last word: the output ends with ""green"" (examples 2 and 4).
- When ""walm"" is the second-to-last word: the last word in the output corresponds to the word following ""walm,"" modified by a ""green"" (examples 1, 3).
  
Based on these observations:

- ""wif"" might correspond to ""red,"" and ""dax"" might correspond to ""green.""
- The presence of ""walm"" creates an additional ""green"" in the output, typically following the regular output for the word that comes right after it.
- The color that ""walm"" itself produces seems to be dependent on the word before it, suggesting that ""walm"" might modify or enhance the color associated with the previous word.
- When ""walm"" comes directly after ""dax"" or is the last word in the input, the output is always ""green."" This suggests that ""walm"" might be directly associated with the color ""green"" under specific circumstances (like after ""dax"" or at the end of the input).

Rule: ""walm"" might add an additional ""green"" color to the output, potentially enhancing or repeating the output of the preceding or following word, especially if that word has an associated output of ""green.""

Walm -> meaning: Walm likely means an additional or intensified ""green,"" particularly following the output related to the word it follows or precedes.",-0.12426977000862487,98,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will look for patterns in the examples provided:

- Example 1: ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
- Example 2: ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green""
- Example 3: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
- Example 4: ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green""
- Example 5: ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""

In all of these examples, the word ""walm"" is associated with multiple ""green"" outputs in the following pattern. When ""walm"" appears, the output is ""green"" once, followed by a number of additional ""green"" outputs equal to the number of words following ""walm"":

- In Example 1, ""walm"" is followed by one word (""dax""), so the output is ""green"" once, followed by another ""green.""
- In Example 2, ""walm"" is at the end, and it is preceded by ""dax,"" leading to two ""green"" outputs.
- In Example 3, ""walm"" is followed by one word (""zup""), so the output is ""green"" once, followed by another ""green.""
- In Example 4, ""walm"" is followed by a different number of words each time it appears, resulting in different numbers of ""green"" in the output.
- In Example 5, ""walm"" is followed by one word (""wif""), thus leading to the output ""green green.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: When ""walm"" occurs in an input, it outputs ""green"" and then outputs ""green"" an additional number of times equal to the number of words that follow it in the sequence.",-0.17741854963691664,98,walm
"Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it appears that the word ""walm"" contributes to the pattern in the following way:

1. In every instance of the input, the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""green"" in the output.
2. The number of times ""green"" is repeated correlates with the position of ""walm"" in the input.
3. The first example shows ""walm"" as the second word, resulting in two ""green"" outputs.
4. In the second example, ""walm"" is the fourth word, resulting in three ""green"" outputs.
5. This pattern continues in all given examples.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for walm as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat ""green"" in the output for as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input. If ""walm"" is the nth word, output ""green"" n-1 times.",-1.5032445576059368,98,walm

Rule: Each time the word ""lug"" appears, it is associated with the color ""blue.""",-1.5441015077777775,99,lug
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" When ""dax"" is used in combination with other nonce words, it maintains its association with ""green,"" and the additional nonce words are associated with other colors. For example, ""bluf"" and ""walm"" are both associated with ""green"" when they follow ""dax,"" while ""lug"" and ""zup"" are associated with ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, when in the context of other words following ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" and when used, it colors the following words with their respective corresponding colors until a new word specifies a different color. 

Here is the rule interpretation for each example:

1. dax bluf -> green green (both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" mean green)
2. dax walm -> green green green (both ""dax"" and ""walm"" mean green)
3. dax -> green (just ""dax"" means green)
4. zup dax bluf zup dax -> yellow green green yellow green (zup means yellow and changes the color association, while ""dax"" resets it back to green)
5. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow (here ""dax"" means green, but ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" seem to associate with red after ""dax,"" and ""zup"" changes the association to yellow)

This rule is generated based on the given data and may not hold true for other unseen examples without further testing.",-0.1110577841413334,99,dax
"Looking at the first three examples, the presence of the word ""dax"" correlates with the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of what follows or doesn't follow ""dax.""

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Here two unidentified words ""dax"" and ""bluf"" lead to ""green green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Adding another word ""walm"" after ""dax"" still results in additional ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax
Output: green

Here, only the word ""dax"" is present and it corresponds to a single ""green.""

This suggests that ""dax"" itself maps to the word ""green,"" and whatever follows ""dax"" is also contributing to the output, though we don't have enough information yet to deduce the rules for ""bluf,"" ""walm,"" and other words.

In the fourth example:

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
Output: yellow green green yellow green

The output pattern shows a ""yellow"" correlating with ""zup,"" and ""green"" correlating with ""dax,"" while ""bluf"" again results in a ""green,"" mirroring its pairing with ""dax"" from the first example.

In the fifth example:

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Here, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green,"" while ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red."" And ""zup"" at the end of the sequence translates to ""yellow,"" just like in the prior input, solidifying that ""zup"" equates to ""yellow.""

From these examples and applying simple rule induction, we can deduce that:

Rule:
- ""dax"" -> green
- We can also infer other rules based on the examples given, though not as confidently without additional examples:
  - ""zup"" -> yellow
  - ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""lug"" may each independently correlate to the word ""red"" or there is a rule that a sequence of unknown words between known words map to ""red.""
  - The last word before ""zup"" induces the output ""blue"" in this specific context, though more examples would be needed to confirm this rule.",-0.14384254953826667,99,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" correlates to the word ""green."" This is clear from the consistent presence of ""dax"" with the corresponding output ""green"" in every instance.

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" may also mean ""green,"" or that each word in the input string is independently translated to ""green"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green."" This example doesn't provide enough information on its own to deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" but it maintains that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- The third example further reinforces that a single ""dax"" translates to a single ""green.""
- The fourth example introduces another word, ""zup,"" which seems to correspond with ""yellow"" and maintains the green output for ""dax.""
- The fifth and final example shows that ""dax"" still translates to ""green,"" while ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" appear to correspond to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is as follows:
dax -> green",-0.62302631048,99,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green."" Each occurrence of ""dax"" is directly translated to ""green"" in the output.

Accordingly, the rule can be summarized as follows:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns present in the examples:

Example 1:
Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
In this sequence, everything after ""walm"" repeats the color before ""walm,"" which is yellow, until ""lug"" appears again, which corresponds to blue.

Example 2:
Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
In this sequence again, ""walm"" causes the color before it (green) to repeat until a new input word (lug, then wif) introduces a new color (blue, then red).

Example 3:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
Here, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color red until ""lug"" appears prompting a change to blue and then back to red with ""wif.""

Example 4:
Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
This is identical to Example 1 and the pattern holds.

Example 5:
Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""walm"" causes the color green to repeat until ""zup"" appears, changing the color to yellow which then repeats after the second ""walm.""

Rule:
The pattern suggests that ""walm"" functions as an instruction to repeat the color output corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" until a new input word changes the color.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" could be defined as follows:
walm -> Repeat the previously mentioned color until a new input word introduces a change in color.",-0.08347961045496155,99,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to discern a pattern for the meaning of the word ""walm."" Each instance of ""walm"" correlates to a repetition of the color that follows its first occurrence.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" appears to repeat the color that comes after it, so in this case, it repeats ""yellow""  

2. Input: zup dax walm lug wif 
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
   - Following ""dax,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green""
   - ""lug"" then translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red""

3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
   - Again, ""walm"" occurs and the following color ""blue"" associated with ""lug"" is repeated

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - This is the same as example 1, reinforcing the pattern

5. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
   - Both instances of ""walm"" repeat the color that follows 

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word that follows its first occurrence to be repeated until a different color word or ""walm"" is encountered again.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: A command to repeat the color that follows its first appearance until a new command or color appears.",-0.08348824078913462,99,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, it seems to be generating repetitions of the color word that immediately precedes it in the pattern. Specifically, it repeats the previous color except when followed by ""lug,"" in which case it turns into ""yellow"". This can be seen from the second and third examples, where ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and the output color is yellow.

For further clarity, let's examine the input-output pairs:

1. ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" twice before encountering ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

2. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" yields ""yellow green green green blue red,"" indicating that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" twice before ""lug,"" which turns to ""blue.""

3. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red,"" showing that ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times before meeting ""lug,"" which changes to ""blue.""

4. The fourth example is the same as the first one and thus supports the rule posited.

5. ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" twice. Then ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" twice.

Based on these examples, when ""walm"" is present, the rule seems to be to repeat the color immediately preceding it, except when followed by ""lug,"" where it generates ""yellow"" (not observed in the examples provided but deduced from the instances where ""lug"" directly follows ""walm"").

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" could be summarized as follows: repeat the color that directly precedes ""walm,"" except when followed by ""lug,"" in which case output ""yellow"".",-0.21784103720182688,99,walm
"Based on the provided examples where the nonce word ""walm"" is used, we can observe the following patterns:

- In each instance where ""walm"" appears, the word directly after ""walm"" is always translated into the color word that corresponds to the word directly before ""walm"" in the sequence.
- The color sequence following ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word before ""walm"" until interrupted by the next color correspondence.

For instance:

- In the first example (lug zup walm lug), ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. After ""walm"" we see a repetition of the color yellow (which corresponds to ""zup"") until the sequence is interrupted by another sequence of blue associated with the following ""lug.""
- In the second example (zup dax walm lug wif), ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red. After ""walm,"" the sequence of green (which corresponds to ""dax"") repeats until the sequence is interrupted by blue, associated with ""lug.""

Given these observations, the rule regarding the meaning of ""walm"" in this context appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it until another color is introduced by a different word.

So, the meaning of ""walm"" could be described as:

- In the second example, ""walm"" again follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is ""green.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is ""red.""

""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" as seen in every example where it is mentioned.

""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" It appears twice in the third input followed by the color red in the output each time, and it appears in the first input before ""bluf"" and both are followed by red in the output.

""bluf"" also corresponds to the color ""red."" It appears in the first input before ""wif"" and in the third input immediately followed by red in the output.

""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" It is present in the second and fifth inputs, and wherever it appears, blue follows in the output.

""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" It shows up in the second and third inputs, and wherever it appears, yellow follows in the output.

- Here, ""zup"" is followed by two words, and the output starts with yellow.

- After ""zup"" (which correlates with ""yellow""), ""bluf"" also results in ""yellow""
- After ""lug"" (which correlates with ""blue""), ""bluf"" results in ""blue""

   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm"" is used, ""green"" is repeated two more times (for a total of three consecutive ""green"").
   
3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" is used, ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. Input: wif walm

5. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" is used, ""yellow"" is repeated two more times (for a total of three consecutive ""yellow"").

Based on the pattern, ""walm"" results in repeating the color of the previous word two additional times, making it a total of three consecutive occurrences of that color. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word two more times.",-0.09267874155346516,101,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns of the input and the corresponding output:

- Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""
- The number of repetitions of the color in the output corresponds to the number of letters in the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Let's apply these observations step-by-step:

1. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
- ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color blue.
- ""lug"" has 3 letters, and blue is repeated three times in the output when ""walm"" is used.

2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax -> Output: green green green yellow blue green
- ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color green.
- ""dax"" has 3 letters, and green is repeated three times in the output when ""walm"" is used.

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
- ""lug"" once again precedes ""walm"" and is associated with blue.
- ""lug"" has 3 letters, and blue is repeated three times.

4. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
- ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color red.
- ""wif"" has 3 letters, and red is repeated three times.

5. Input: zup walm lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color yellow.
- ""zup"" has 3 letters, and yellow is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, as many times as there are letters in that word.",-0.11310416967002325,101,walm
"Rule: walm -> the word immediately preceding walm is repeated in the output as many times as there are letters in that word.

- In ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and since ""lug"" has three letters, the result is ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""wif"" has three letters, thus it leads to ""red red red.""
- In ""zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""zup"" has three letters, so the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""",-0.5592869500918604,101,walm
"Given the provided examples, it looks like the word ""walm"" is replicated in the output by a color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it. To further explain, let's dissect a couple examples:

1. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue. ""Walm"" then is output as ""blue blue"" (repeating the color).

2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax -> Output: green green green yellow blue green
In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green resulting in the repetition ""green green.""

3. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red 
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, so ""walm"" results in ""red red.""

From these observations, we can deduce the rule:

"To decipher the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in each example provided. We note the color outputs that are associated with known and unknown inputs. The known inputs are 'dax', 'zup', 'lug', 'bluf', and 'walm', which correspond to the colors 'green', 'yellow', 'blue', 'blue', and 'red' respectively, based on the consistent mapping in the examples given.

Now, let's look at the sequences containing ""wif"":

1. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow blue red red red""
2. ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" -> ""blue blue red blue blue yellow""
3. ""wif"" -> ""red""
4. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
5. ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""

From these sequences, we can observe the following:

- Example 1 and Example 4 show that after ""wif,"" the color ""red"" always follows, even when 'wif' precedes 'walm' (which is also red).
- Example 3 shows that ""wif"" alone translates to ""red"".
- Example 5 shows that the presence of ""wif"" does not change the color of the words before it.
- In Example 2, ""wif"" appears after two blue words, ""lug bluf,"" and again results in ""red."" 

The consistent pattern is that irrespective of its position or the context within the sequence, ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red."" Hence, we can deduce the following:

Rule: wif -> red",-0.22795574985404832,102,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we can analyze the relationship between the inputs and their respective outputs. Here are the relevant pieces of information:

1. The word ""wif"" appears in every input where the output contains ""red.""
2. ""Wif"" on its own yields a single ""red"" in the output.
3. When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is a sequence of ""red"" repeated three times, which reflects the number of occurrences of ""wif"" and ""walm.""
4. When other words precede ""wif,"" such as ""dax"" or ""bluf,"" the output for those words (""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""bluf"") is not repeated but followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""
5. When the word ""zup"" appears without ""wif,"" it is translated to ""yellow.""
6. The word ""lug"" appears to be translated to ""blue.""

"Observed from the examples, every time the word ""walm"" is present, the following words all translate into the same color until a different color (not yellow) is introduced by a term other than ""walm"". For example:

- ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red,"" where all terms after ""walm"" are yellow until ""wif"" which is red.
- ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where all terms after ""walm"" are blue.
- ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green,"" where all terms after ""walm"" are green.
- ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" where the terms after ""walm"" continue as yellow until ""lug,"" which is blue and then ""wif"" is red.
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red,"" where all terms after ""walm"" are green until ""lug,"" which is blue and then ""wif"" is red.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color of the following word, effectively a ""repeat color"" command, until another color word that is not yellow is present.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the next word until a different (non-yellow) color word appears.",-0.09878033524561541,102,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the correspondence between the input and output sequences in each example. Here is what we know from the examples provided:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax zup,"" the colors are ""green yellow green green green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup lug,"" the colors are ""yellow blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the colors are ""green yellow yellow yellow red.""
- When ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug wif,"" the colors are ""yellow yellow yellow blue red.""

Based on these observations, we can infer the following:
- When ""walm"" is present, the color that occurs immediately before ""walm"" repeats until a new color is introduced.
- The color that comes after ""walm"" follows the color rule of the word that appears right after it in the input, not affected by the presence of ""walm.""
- ""walm"" itself does not have a corresponding color, but affects the repetition of colors of the word before it.

Given these rule inductions, walm seems to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> causes the color before it to repeat until the next color is introduced by a subsequent word.",-0.6045908279329671,102,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the immediately preceding word. Rule:

When ""walm"" follows a word that corresponds to a color, the word ""walm"" induces repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here are the mappings for individual words to colors, as suggested by the examples:

dax -> green
zup -> yellow 
lug -> blue
wif -> red

Following these mappings, ""walm"" takes the color of the word right before it, creating a sequence of that color until the sequence is interrupted by a different word/color. For example:

- In ""dax zup walm wif"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"", so it repeats ""yellow"" until ""wif"" changes the color to red.
- In ""dax zup dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", so it repeats ""green"" continuously.
- In ""zup dax walm lug wif"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", repeating ""green"", until ""lug"" changes the color to blue, followed by ""wif"" which changes the color to red.",-0.7205124229537362,102,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the color sequence where each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a repeated color. The repetition and the color matched with ""walm"" depend on the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" This means ""walm"" following ""dax"" outputs three greens.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" This means ""walm"" following ""zup"" outputs three yellows.
- When ""lug"" is mentioned after ""walm,"" we have blue outputted afterwards, but the count of blue isn't determined by ""walm"" itself, so we can't define the exact rule of ""walm"" when it comes to ""lug.""

Keeping in mind the examples and the analyses thereof, we can try to formulate a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it outputs a sequence of the same color associated with the preceding word; for ""dax"" it's triple green and for ""zup"" it's triple yellow. The word ""walm"" itself is linked to outputting a sequence of the same color, but the exact number of repetitions depends on the word that comes before ""walm."" However, there's not enough data to conclude its effect on the word that follows it.

walm -> A sequence of the same color corresponding to a preceding word, potentially multiple instances of that color.",-1.087760309587912,102,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word 'walm' seems to influence the color output of the subsequent words until a different nonce word is encountered. Specifically, after 'walm', the following nonce words all translate into the color 'green', until a nonce word that translates into a definitive color (such as 'wif' translating to red or 'lug' translating to blue) appears. 

The effect of 'walm' can be observed in the following manners:

- In the first example, 'wif' after 'walm' gives the output 'red', indicating that 'wif' has a stronger rule or a specific color output that overrides 'walm'.
- In the second example, only 'walm' and 'lug' (which translates to 'blue') are given, and 'lug' retains its color, which shows 'lug' has a color definition that is not overridden by 'walm'.
- In the third example, 'dax' after 'walm' produces 'green', showing that in the absence of a specifically colored nonce word following 'walm', the output remains 'green'.
- The fourth example is like the first, with 'lug' (blue) being the word that breaks the 'walm' sequence.
- The fifth example confirms the rule as 'walm' follows 'dax' and all subsequent unknown nonce words are translated to 'green' until the known 'lug' (blue) and then 'wif' (red) follow.

The interaction between 'walm' and the other nonce words suggests that 'walm' changes the color output rule to ""green"" for all following words until one with a known color output appears.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup - Output: red red red green yellow
5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug - Output: green green red yellow blue

From the examples above:

- In example 1, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" just like the output for ""bluf.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" is between ""walm"" and ""zup,"" and again, the output for ""dax"" is ""green."" In this example, ""walm"" appears three times and each occurrence has the output ""red."" Since ""dax"" doesn't get the ""red"" output, it's not related to ""walm"" directly.
- In example 3, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""walm,"" which are ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively. The output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" matching ""walm"" again.
- In example 4, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and is before ""zup,"" with the output for ""dax"" again being ""green.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" is before ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" and as noted in previous examples, the output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" just as it is for ""bluf.""

Based on the outputs, the meaning of ""dax"" seems to be consistently linked with the color green no matter where it appears in the sequence. 

Rule: dax -> green",-0.07295405176910377,103,dax
"Based on the given input and output examples, the rule appears to be that every unique word is mapped to a specific color. We can determine the colors for each word by matching the input sequence with the output sequence on a one-to-one basis.

From the examples:

- ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"" 
- ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue"" in the one instance it appears
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" in all instances it appears

However, we must note that ""walm"" was repeated in a sequence and the output was also duplicated. Therefore, it is likely that the rule involves maintaining the sequence of colors for repeated words.

Using this information, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as in each case where ""dax"" is in the input, ""green"" is outputted in the corresponding position.

5. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   Alignment: wif -> ?
              dax -> green

Observing the patterns, we can see that:

- When ""wif"" stands alone, it outputs ""red"" (as seen in examples 4 and 5).
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", ""dax"" changes its color from what would be expected (normally, it should be green, but after ""wif"" it is red as seen in example 1).
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", the same thing happens: ""bluf"" normally outputs yellow, but after ""wif"", it outputs green (seen in example 3).

From this information, we can deduce that ""wif"" is changing the color output of the following word to red if the following word has a standalone color associated with it, and to a different color if it's followed by another ""wif"". The ambiguity remains on what happens when ""wif"" follows another color that is not its natural output without ""wif"" affecting it. However, we know that ""wif"" influences the color output of the following word. Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> changes the following word's normal color output to red, or to another predefined color if part of a specific sequence (e.g., ""walm"" always turns to ""red red""). When ""wif"" stands alone, it results in the color red.",-0.0977780259447126,103,wif

3. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. wif dax -> red green

Based on these examples, we observe:

- ""wif"" always translates to ""red""
- The word that follows ""wif"" always translates to ""green"" if it's ""dax""
- There's one instance where ""wif"" is followed by a word ""walm"" which is not immediately followed by another ""wif"" and in this case, both ""wif"" and ""walm"" translate to ""red""

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""wif"":

Looking at example 1, we see that when the input is just ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" This suggests that ""zup"" itself translates to ""yellow.""

In examples 2 through 5, we can observe that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

"Based on the provided examples, there seems to be a pattern correlating certain input words to specific output colors. Specifically, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". As the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" and the word ""bluf"" either corresponds to the color ""green"" or ""blue"" depending on its position, the consistent output for ""zup"" across all examples allows us to deduce its meaning.

Rule: zup -> yellow. Zup consistently translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in a sequence.,-1.7127542777315785,103,zup
"Based on the examples provided, bluf seems to correspond to the color red when preceding or following the word 'wif.' The rule can be discerned as follows:

- Every time the nonce word ""bluf"" is used, the word that follows or comes before it is transformed into ""red"" in the output sequence.

Let's check this against each example:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   - Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which translates to ""red.""

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""Bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" again making the following word ""red.""

3. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   - Again, ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" results in ""red.""

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" not ""wif,"" so it doesn't become red; ""bluf"" by itself results in yellow.

5. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - Once more, ""bluf"" is not followed by ""wif,"" and it becomes yellow.

Given this pattern, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" specifically when it is adjacent to ""wif"". If ""bluf"" is not adjacent to ""wif,"" it translates to ""yellow.""

Rule:
bluf -> red when adjacent to ""wif"", otherwise bluf -> yellow.",-0.06186420443710751,103,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to identify patterns between the input strings and the output colors. By inspecting each pair of input and output, we can attempt to match the specific words to their corresponding colors:

Example 1: 
Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow
Pattern: 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and the placement of 'bluf' results in another 'red'.

Example 2:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red 
Pattern: 'zup' still corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' is 'red', and since 'walm' is new but results in 'red red', 'bluf' may not correspond to a color but rather could be a duplicator of some sort, as 'yellow' is doubled at its occurrence and 'walm' creates two 'red'.

Example 3:
Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
Pattern: 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'lug' to 'blue', 'zup' to 'yellow' and 'wif' to 'red'. Notably, after 'bluf', the color 'red' is repeated.

Example 4:
Input: zup bluf lug zup
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
Pattern: Here, 'bluf' being between two instances of 'zup' (which corresponds to 'yellow'), results in a repetition of 'yellow', following the identified pattern of it having a duplicating function of the color that comes before it.

Example 5:
Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green
Pattern: 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'zup' to 'yellow', and 'dax' to 'green'. The 'bluf' duplication rule holds, as 'yellow' is doubled, following its initial appearance.

Based on the pattern observed, ""bluf"" appears to duplicate the color that precedes it. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the previous word.",-0.11797875850649464,103,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" can be associated with the color ""red."" However, the meaning might be influenced by its position relative to the other words. Let's analyze the examples:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears twice and is represented by ""red"" both times.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif walm,"" where ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and ""wif"" with ""red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" is still represented by ""red.""
- The third example places ""bluf"" after ""wif"" within a sequence that starts and ends with ""dax."" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again, and ""bluf"" follows this pattern.
- The fourth example positions ""bluf"" between ""zup"" instances, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow."" In this case, ""bluf"" is again translated to ""yellow,"" matching the color preceding it, but this could be purely coincidental due to the repeated use of ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
- The fifth example situates ""bluf"" after ""zup"" (yellow) and before ""dax"" (green). ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" once more, but this could also be due to the repetition rule for ""zup.""

However, observing each instance of ""bluf,"" we can see that regardless of its position, it consistently correlates to the color ""red,"" except in scenarios where it could potentially be succeeding a word that means ""yellow,"" and the repetition rule may apply. This introduces some ambiguity, yet the dominant pattern suggests ""red"" is the correct translation for ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> red.",-0.967474924805591,103,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The word 'bluf' consistently maps to ""yellow"" when it follows 'zup' and maps to ""red"" otherwise. To summarize:

- 'zup bluf' -> ""yellow yellow""
- 'bluf' following 'wif' or not preceded by 'zup' -> ""red""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word 'bluf' seems to be:

Rule: 'bluf' -> ""yellow"" when it immediately follows 'zup'; 'bluf' -> ""red"" in all other contexts.",-1.315442975867204,103,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> yellow

Based on the correspondence between the inputs and outputs given, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow."" Every time bluf appears in the input, the color yellow appears in the output at the same position regardless of the words surrounding it.",-1.6281127407883875,103,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated color output that comes after it. The color that is repeated is based on the color associated with the word just before ""walm"". The association appears to be as follows:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

The word ""walm"" causes the next few outputs to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Analysing each input:

1. ""wif dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""red green blue blue blue"".
   'walm' follows 'lug', which corresponds to the color blue, resulting in multiple blues.

2. ""wif lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""red blue green green green"".
   'walm' follows 'dax', which corresponds to the color green, resulting in multiple greens.

3. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"".
   'walm' follows 'dax', creating repeated greens.

4. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow"".
   'walm' follows 'wif', leading to repeated reds until the next color 'lug' (blue) interrupts.

5. ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"".
   'walm' follows 'zup', resulting in repeated yellows until 'lug' (blue) appears.

Rule: walm -> repeated color. The repeated color is the one associated with the previous word before ""walm"". If the preceding word is ""dax"", the repeated color is green; if ""wif"", it's red; if ""lug"", it's blue; if ""zup"", it's yellow. The repetition continues until a new color is introduced or the list ends.",-0.07871511736283719,103,walm
"Based on the given examples, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that precedes it in the sequence. This is indicated by the fact that ""walm"" takes on the color of ""dax"" in example 3 (""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"") and the color ""red"" from ""wif"" in the fourth example (""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow"").

Let's verify this with the other examples provided:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color ""blue."" The output is ""blue blue blue,"" confirming the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

- In example 2, similarly, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is ""green green green.""

- Finally, in example 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and since we don't have a direct translation for ""zup,"" except for its output color in other examples (""yellow""), we see that ""walm"" repeats that color - ""yellow yellow yellow.""

This consistent pattern across all examples suggests the rule for ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repeated color of the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" in the sequence.",-0.5729066149438371,103,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with a repeated color output that corresponds to the color mentioned immediately before ""walm."" Analyzing the patterns,

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""green green green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" without any other context precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output after ""wif"" is ""red red red.""
- In the last example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" noting that there's an additional ""lug"" after ""walm"" which adds an extra ""blue"" at the end.

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""walm"" requires the preceding color word to be repeated three times, except in cases where ""walm"" is followed by another color word, in which case the sequence is interrupted.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color word preceding it three times, or until another color word occurs.",-0.9922713573069768,103,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" influences the color output sequence that follows it. In each example, after ""walm"" is mentioned, there is a repetition of a specific color output. The specific color that repeats corresponds to the color output of the word immediately preceding ""walm"". The rule can be defined as follows:

- If ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is multiple greens.
- If ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is multiple reds.
- If ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is multiple blues.

Thus, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output of the word directly before it a number of times. Moreover, the input before ""walm"" does not repeat. This allows us to establish the following rule:

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue. In each example, whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the color blue corresponds to it in the output. 

Here are the connections presented in the examples:

- ""lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue green green,"" which not only shows ""lug"" as blue but also confirms ""dax"" as green and ""bluf"" as green.
- ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue,"" which reinforces the meaning of ""lug"" as blue, along with establishing ""zup"" as yellow.
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" further confirms ""dax"" as green, ""zup"" as yellow, and ""lug"" as blue.
- Finally, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" which affirms ""zup"" as yellow and ""lug"" as blue.

- ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red""
- ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow red green""
- ""zup wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red blue green""

From these mappings, we can deduce the following:
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow"" (it seems to have the same output as ""zup"")

Consistently, ""wif"" maps to ""red"". Every time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the output. The position of ""wif"" within the input sequence corresponds to the position of ""red"" within the output sequence.

2. zup bluf wif => yellow yellow red
3. zup bluf => yellow yellow
4. zup bluf => yellow yellow
5. zup bluf dax => yellow yellow green

From the examples 3 and 4, we can see that the word ""bluf"" alone does not change the color output since ""zup bluf"" consistently results in ""yellow yellow.""

When ""bluf"" is used in combination with other words, such as ""dax"" or ""wif,"" the color following ""bluf"" changes (examples 1, 2, and 5). Notice that the color associated with ""bluf"" (yellow) does not change, but the color associated with the word that follows changes: ""dax"" changes to green after ""bluf"", and ""wif"" changes to red after ""bluf"".

From these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" does not seem to tie to a single word meaning but rather to an effect it has in context. Specifically, ""bluf"" maintains the preceding color which in this case is yellow, yet it does not give us enough data to solidify a pattern for the subsequent word's color transformation - we see ""dax"" go from an implied non-yellow color to green and ""wif"" go to red, without examples of what they do on their own.

Given this, and to provide a simple and consistent rule consistent with the examples provided, I am assuming that:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the next word to change its output color.

Without further context or examples, it is difficult to determine the specific rule for how ""bluf"" influences that change, (i.e., if it causes a consistent color shift or if the color change is contextually dependent on the word it precedes or follows). Without such information, any pattern for how the colors change after ""bluf"" would be speculative.",-0.16350276366117644,104,bluf

4. When ""zup bluf dax"" is given as input, the output is ""yellow yellow green"".

The colors associated with each word appear consistent for 'dax' and 'wif', which correspond with 'green' and 'red', respectively. Since 'zup bluf' consistently results in 'yellow yellow', we can deduce that both 'zup' and 'bluf' translate to 'yellow'.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we can compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's focus on the instances where ""walm"" appears and see how it affects the translation to colors.

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

Analyzing the sequences particularly where ""walm"" precedes or follows another word, we notice the following patterns:

- After ""lug walm,"" the color blue is repeated. This suggests that ""walm"" could have a ""repeat the color of the previous word"" function.
- In ""wif walm,"" the output is red red red, where ""wif"" coincides with red, and since ""walm"" is the only other word, it suggests the color red is repeated due to the presence of ""walm.""
- In ""dax walm lug,"" following the ""dax,"" we get two greens instead of a single color change, indicating ""walm"" may have caused the repetition.
- The appearance of ""walm"" between ""lug"" and ""dax"" resulting in ""blue blue blue green"" seems to support the repetition rule, since ""lug"" corresponds to blue and we see blue repeated twice after the appearance of ""walm"" indicating the color of the word before ""walm"" is repeated two times before moving to the next color.

Considering these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that precedes it to be repeated three times in total before continuing to the next color or word. This rule holds true across the given examples.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word two additional times (resulting in three instances of the color in total).",-0.06761764120313955,104,walm
"To induce the meaning of the word ""walm"" from the given examples, let us look at the input-output pairs and see how ""walm"" affects the output:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

From the first example (1), it seems that the presence of ""lug"" before ""walm"" resulted in a repetition of blues after ""walm"" until a new color word (yellow) associated with ""zup"" appears.

In the second example (2), ""wif walm"" results in three reds, with ""wif"" being associated with red.

The third example (3) is more complex. ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""wif"" with red, and ""dax"" with green. ""Walm"" occurs after a sequence of colors and the color repetition sequence is broken by a new color word (""lug""). After ""walm"", the repetition of green occurs until ""lug"" which changes the color again to blue.

In the fourth (4) and fifth (5) examples, the pattern is repeated. ""Lug"" before ""walm"" is associated with the blue, and after ""walm"" the color green is consistently produced until the sequence ends or another color word appears. However, since example 5 is identical to example 4 and the output does not change, it further confirms the pattern's consistency.

The presence of ""walm"" appears always to cause a repetition of the color before it. The rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""Walm"" causes the color output associated with the preceding word to repeat until a new color word appears or the sequence ends.

Therefore, ""walm"" means:

walm -> causes repetition of the previous color output until a new color code appears.",-0.07241000825860462,104,walm
"The nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a color output that repeats until a new input that changes the color pattern appears. The color that is associated with ""walm"" seems to be the same as the color associated with the word that precedes it, continuing until a different color-inducing word is introduced.

Reviewing the examples:

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- ""lug"" induces ""blue,"" then ""walm"" continues the ""blue"" sequence until ""zup,"" which changes it to ""yellow.""

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" induces ""red,"" and ""walm"" continues it with ""red.""

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
- ""zup"" induces ""yellow,"" ""wif"" changes it to ""red,"" ""dax"" switches it to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" until ""lug"" changes it to ""blue."" 

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" induces ""blue,"" and ""walm"" continues with ""blue,"" until ""dax"" changes the pattern to ""green.""

It seems that ""walm"" does not induce its own color, but rather, it continues the pattern set by the word preceding it. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> continues the color output of the previous word until a different input word changes it.",-0.17925763938283726,104,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the provided examples, let's examine the context in which ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

In this example, after ""walm,"" both instances of ""lug"" are followed by ""blue"" and ""zup"" by ""yellow"", just like before the ""walm"". However, ""wif"" changes from red to yellow after ""walm"".

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red"", indicating that ""walm"" does not change the color associated with ""wif"" in this instance, as ""wif"" is already ""red"".

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green"". The output is ""green"" for both ""walm"" and ""lug"", the following word. This suggests that ""walm"" might be repeating or maintaining the color of the word that precedes it if the word that follows is different. However, we know from previous examples that ""lug"" normally maps to ""blue"", not ""green"".

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

""Walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and followed by ""dax"" (green). ""Walm"" has the output ""blue"" here but turns ""dax"" to ""green"" instead of the ""blue"" that we might expect from the pattern that ""lug"" normally yields.

Considering these examples, it appears that ""walm"" might be a rule indicating that the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" is maintained or repeated for ""walm"" itself, but it may also have the ability to transform the word following it into the color it would naturally have.

However, the pattern is not entirely clear-cut due to the change exhibited in the first example when the sequence is lug walm zup lug zup wif. We would have expected ""wif"" to turn to ""yellow"" if ""walm"" repeats the preceding color, but it goes to ""red"" instead.

Given these observations and the contradictions, it might be best to look for additional examples that could clarify the rule. But based on the limited given data, the tentative rule could be formulated as:

Rule: ""walm"" likely maintains or repeats the color of the word that precedes it for itself, but the effect on the subsequent word may be transforming it to the color it would typically be mapped to without ""walm."" However, this rule does not consistently apply to all instances, as seen with the word ""wif"" in example 1, indicating that ""walm"" might have another context-specific rule or there might be exceptions.

If I were to make a guess with the current data, it would be:

walm -> Meaning: maintains the color of the word before it for itself, with potential to affect the following word's color (possibly depending on context).",-0.19721173305976744,104,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Explanation:

1. In the first input, ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue. The pattern is consistent in ""lug zup wif,"" where ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to red.

2. In the second input, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" indicating ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

3. In the third input, ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" the ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color is repeated ""green green,"" then ""lug"" changes it to blue.

4. In the fourth and fifth inputs, which are identical, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green."" ""Walm"" is following ""lug"" (which is blue) and repeats that color before changing to green for ""dax.""

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the given input-output pairs and try to deduce any patterns that could inform the rule.

Here are the input-output pairs broken down with their respective colors:

1. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   (walm is followed by two blue, which corresponds to ""lug"")

2. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow
   (Each walm adds two reds before the pattern changes to yellow)

3. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
   (After ""dax,"" walm leads to two additional green, before switching to yellow)

4. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
   (walm leads to two red, followed by the pattern changing to green)

5. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   (walm follows ""lug"" with two additional blue, and later follows ""zup"" with two additional yellow)

Observations:
- It appears that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color of the word that precedes it, exactly two times, before the color sequence resumes normally.

Rule:
- walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word two more times.

Let's check this rule against the examples:

1. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   The color before walm is blue, associated with ""lug."" After ""walm,"" we have two more blues.

2. wif walm zup walm
   The color before the first walm is red, hence two more reds are added. Then, before the second walm, the color is yellow, hence two more yellows are added.

3. dax walm zup lug
   The color before walm is green, so two more greens are added before switching to yellow.

4. wif walm dax zup
   The color before walm is red, so two more reds are added before the sequence changes due to ""dax.""

5. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   The first walm is preceded by blue, so two more blues are added. The second walm is preceded by yellow, so two more yellows are added before the color changes to red due to ""wif.""

Given these observations, the rule appears to be consistent across all examples. Thus, we can say:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word two more times.",-0.05552088154592662,105,walm
"Rule: walm duplicates the color of the word that directly follows it.

Explanation:

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""walm dax"" results in ""blue blue"", meaning walm takes the color of ""dax"" which is blue.

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red"" and ""zup walm"" in ""yellow yellow"", so walm matches the color of the subsequent word.

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green"", so walm matches the color of ""dax"" which is green.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red"", meaning walm copies the color of ""wif"" which is red.

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue"" and ""zup walm"" in ""yellow yellow"", so walm matches the color of the word after it.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondences in the examples given:

- In the first example, every time ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the output color is ""blue."" 
- In the second example, ""walm"" appears between repetitions of the same word (""wif"" and ""zup""), and the output color is ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.
- In the third example, ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" and the output color is ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" and the output color is ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and ""zup,"" and the output color is ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. Also, it is followed by ""wif"" with ""red"" as the output.

From these observations, we notice that the output color for ""walm"" matches the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Hence, ""walm"" seems to take on the color of the preceding word, indicating that ""walm"" serves as a repeater or duplicator of the previous color.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the colors in the output each time ""walm"" is in the input:

- In the fourth input, ""walm"" again corresponds to three consecutive ""red"" in the output, with ""red"" preceding it.
- Finally, in the fifth input, ""walm"" corresponds first to two consecutive ""blue"" and then to three consecutive ""yellow"" in the output, with both ""blue"" and ""yellow"" following the sequence.

From these examples, we see that ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color that last appeared, but the number of repetitions corresponds to the total number of times ""walm"" has appeared so far. To illustrate:

- First occurrence: ""walm"" -> two repeats of the preceding color.
- Second occurrence: ""walm"" -> three repeats of the preceding color.

Based on the given examples, it looks like the word ""bluf"" represents a color, but the particular color it represents changes in relation to the word that precedes it. The pattern seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it:

- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to green green.
- ""lug bluf"" corresponds to blue blue.
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to red red.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> red repeated thrice

Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: dax walm
- dax -> green
- walm -> green repeated thrice

Output: green green green

Input: wif walm dax

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it translates to the color that corresponds to the preceding word being repeated three times.",-0.09042110809301203,106,walm
"From the given examples, we can deduce the following associations:

1. zup -> yellow
2. wif -> red
3. dax -> green
4. lug -> blue

Now let's look at the output each time ""walm"" is used in the input:

- Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
- Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
- Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue
- Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green

Following the pattern, ""walm"" appears to generate a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the pattern according to each example:

- In the first input, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red"", indicating a threefold repetition of ""red"".
- In the second input, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is three ""green"" in a row.
- In the third input, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""red red red"" for ""wif walm"" and ""green"" for ""dax"".
- In the fourth and fifth inputs, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"" in one case, and in the other ""green green green"" following ""dax walm"".

Therefore the rule we can deduce is:

walm -> The rule is that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat three times.

Hence, the meaning assigned to ""walm"" is as follows:
Rule: walm results in a threefold repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it in the sequence.",-0.09878468521759037,106,walm

- Input ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"", with two additional ""green.""
- Input ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"", with two additional ""blue.""

When ""walm"" follows a color-associated word (wif for red, dax for green, and lug for blue), it repeats the color word two more times, as evidenced by the outputs.

Here are the observed rules:

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.

The word ""walm"" appears in all the given examples after different word(s) which already have a determined output color. In each case, ""walm"" seems to produce a repetition of the last color mentioned, and it repeats that color three times. Thus, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

"To decipher the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the given examples and the resulting color patterns. We notice that each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color in the output:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
3. wif dax wif -> red green red
4. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
5. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue

Considering the provided data:

- In examples 1, 4, and 5, the word ""dax"" precedes a color that does not repeat from any previous words.
- In example 3, ""dax"" is between two instances of ""wif,"" which translate to ""red.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" appears at the end of the sequence; yet, the output color ""green"" is different from the colors assigned to the words preceding it.

The outputs reveal a pattern: whenever ""dax"" appears, it's followed by ""green"" in the output. This color does not follow any preceding words in any of the examples. There's also no evidence to suggest that ""dax"" itself has a different color assigned, as it directly translates to ""green"" in each instance.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be that it translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.08108808852882225,107,dax
"Given the examples provided, we can see that each word aligns with a specific color in the output. To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns:

Output: red red red green yellow
- Here, ""wif"" aligns with ""red,"" and ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow."" ""Dax"" is aligned with ""green.""

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- Again, ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" is before two consistent ""yellow"" colors in the output, we can deduce that ""walm"" changes the next color (which would have been ""red"") to ""yellow."" Thus, the word ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green.""

Input: wif dax wif
Output: red green red
- This confirms that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and reinforces that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- We can observe that ""dax"" is ""green,"" and regardless of the ""walm"" that follows, the ongoing sequence remains green until it is interrupted by ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
- This solidifies ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" introduces ""bluf"" as ""blue,"" and suggests that ""lug"" keeps the color that directly precedes it, unless a new color is introduced (in this case ""dax,"" which changes the pattern to ""green"").

The rule that can be deduced from the examples given is:
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

The rule is therefore:
dax -> green",-0.08869871350434441,107,dax
"Based on the examples given, each word seems to correspond to a color:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> green
- bluf -> blue
- lug -> blue

The word ""dax"" appears to always correspond to the color green, except for when following the word ""walm,"" when ""walm"" is already associated with green. So, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, but its output changes in a sequence following ""walm."" 

However, there is an instance where ""dax"" is still green even though it follows a ""walm,"" which is in the sequence ""dax walm zup."" Yet in ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""dax"" yields the color yellow and not green. This sequence suggests that ""dax"" might not only depend on its position relative to other specific words but also on its position in the sequence.

To be able to state a definitive rule for ""dax,"" we need to identify a consistent pattern across all examples where ""dax"" is used, but given the examples, a clear consistent pattern for ""dax"" doesn't emerge.

Therefore, the best deduction that can be made with the given information is:
Rule: dax generally corresponds to the color green, but may change color based on context or position in the sequence which is not entirely clear from the given examples.",-0.9162800307798886,107,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look at the position where it occurs and the corresponding output color each time.

- When ""dax"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""zup"" (if present), the output is green.
- When ""dax"" appears at the beginning or after ""walm,"" the output is green.
- When ""dax"" is the last word, the output is red, but we do not have an instance of ""dax"" being the last word in the inputs provided.

There is not enough information to deduce a pattern based solely on the position of ""dax."" However, looking at the outputs corresponding to other words:
- ""wif"" seems to always correspond to red.
- ""zup"" seems to always correspond to yellow.
- ""walm"" corresponds to red when it's the first word and to green when it follows ""dax.""
- ""bluf"" and ""lug"" correspond to colors not associated with other words (blue and blue, respectively).

It's possible that ""dax"" indicates a change/transition because it always leads to a deviation from the pattern that a preceding or following word would otherwise dictate. It might reset the pattern or start a new pattern. 

Considering the context in which it appears, ""dax"" seems to assume the value of green regardless of its position, and this doesn't change even when it precedes a word that would normally have a different color (like ""walm"" or ""zup"").

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the sequence of words in the input and their corresponding colors in the output. 

Here's what we can tell from the examples:

1. After ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"", the sequence ""green blue blue blue green"" appears, with ""red red"" following. Given that ""bluf"" comes before the second ""dax"", it seems that ""bluf"" may cause the repetition of the color assigned to ""dax"", which is ""green"".

2. After ""zup wif dax wif bluf"", the sequence ""yellow red green red red"" appears, with ""red"" repeated after ""bluf"". The word ""dax"" which comes before ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"". 

3. After ""dax bluf"", the output is ""green green"", which reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" may cause the repetition of the previous color (""green"" in this case).

4. In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"", the output is ""green red yellow yellow red red red"". ""Bluf"" comes after ""zup"" which is associated with ""yellow"", and a ""yellow"" follows in the output after ""bluf"".

5. Finally, in ""wif dax bluf"", the output is ""red green green"". Again, ""green"" is repeated after ""bluf"".

Based on these observations, it seems that the word ""bluf"" causes the immediate repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it. However, there is an exception in the first example, where ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output sequence shows ""red red"" while according to the initial rule, it should have been ""green green"". This might indicate that the context or position may impact the function of ""bluf"". The challenge with this exception is that it doesn't fit the observed rule from the other examples and might require additional examples to fully understand the rule where ""bluf"" follows multiple words before ending with ""dax"". Thus, considering the exception, we could tentatively propose the following:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, unless this word is ""dax,"" which may modify the rule depending on the context.

With the exception noted, a safer induction would be:

Rule for Bluf: bluf -> Causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it, with a possible exception or additional rule when ""dax"" immediately follows ""bluf.""",-0.16867202366410095,107,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the patterns of the inputs and the corresponding outputs, examining where ""bluf"" appears and what color follows in each case. Here's each example broken down with ""bluf"" highlighted:

- Example 1: dax lug walm dax **wif bluf** dax
  Output: green blue blue blue **red red** green

- Example 2: zup wif dax wif **bluf**

- Example 4: dax wif zup **bluf** wif walm
  Output: green red yellow **yellow** red red red

- Example 5: wif dax **bluf**
  Output: red green **green**

In each instance, ""bluf"" directly affects one or two colors that follow it in the output. It may not be transforming the word immediately following ""bluf,"" as we see different results: red, green, and yellow. Instead, ""bluf"" might dictate a rule that is based on the context of the words around it. 

Looking closely at the output, ""bluf"" seems to cause the following color to be the same as the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" For example:
- In Example 1, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red.""
- In Example 3, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" and the output is ""green.""
- In Example 5, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" and the output is ""green.""

- In Example 2, ""bluf"" directly leads to a single ""red.""
- In Example 3, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" so in this instance, ""bluf"" correlates with the same color as ""dax.""
- Example 4 is a bit more complex, but after ""bluf,"" the color ""red"" occurs, even though ""bluf wif"" would be expected to lead to ""red red"" based on Example 1.
- In Example 5, ""dax bluf"" again corresponds with ""green green,"" similar to Example 3.

Based on these observations, the word ""bluf"" appears to act as a modifier to the word it follows or precedes, in some cases duplicating the color that ""dax"" produces, and in other cases, changing the output to ""red."" However, the exact conditions under which ""bluf"" changes the color to ""red"" or duplicates it are not made entirely clear from the given examples. 

Therefore, the rule might be that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the following or preceding word ""dax,"" unless ""wif"" appears nearby, causing it to change to ""red."" Yet this rule isn't consistent across all examples—specifically, it does not fully account for Example 4. Without a clear pattern across all the examples, the dataset might be too ambiguous to deduce a conclusive rule that applies in all cases.

Given the inconsistencies, the best tentative rule based on the information provided might be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows or precedes ""dax,"" it results in the color ""green."" When ""bluf"" is combined with ""wif,"" it may result in the color ""red.""

- In the second example, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"", showing that ""green"" corresponds to ""dax"" and is repeated three times for ""walm"".

- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is green repeated twice.
- If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is blue followed by red.
- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color pattern seems to change:
    - When ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" the output is green, yellow, and then blue (as in the first example), but the second instance of ""bluf"" instead yields yellow. This discrepancy indicates there may be additional factors influencing the outcome.

Looking for a unifying rule, we could propose that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the preceding word, except in the case where ""zup"" alters the pattern, possibly due to its own meaning or placement in the sequence.

Based on the available information, the potential rule could be:
- bluf by itself after ""dax"" leads to green repeated twice.
- bluf following ""lug"" leads to blue followed by red.
- bluf following ""zup"" is less clear, but may lead to a repeated color from the preceding pattern or introduce an alternate pattern influenced by ""zup"".

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green, the same color as ""dax.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the pattern is not consistent; the output changes from blue to yellow.

However, the inconsistency could be because the rule might be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it, unless that color is blue. In the case of ""blue,"" it changes to ""yellow"" instead.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

2. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue. Before ""zup"" and ""lug"", we have multiple greens after ""walm"".

3. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green. After ""walm"" there is a repetition of green.

4. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue. After ""walm"" there is a repetition of blue.

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red. After ""walm,"" there's a repetition of green before the next ""zup"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.08597022778127905,108,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs from the examples provided.

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> yellow red red red
2. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> green green green yellow blue
3. ""zup dax walm"" -> yellow green green green
4. ""zup lug walm"" -> yellow blue blue blue
5. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" -> yellow green green green yellow red

Observing each sequence where ""walm"" appears, we can see:

- In the first example, the word ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red red red"" follows in the output.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green green green"" follows in the output.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and once again, ""green green green"" follows in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue blue blue"" follows in the output.

It appears that the word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. The replicated color is repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze how the output colors correspond to the input words in each example. We can start by looking at the sequences that repeat and the colors that they map to in the outputs.

- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" inconsistently maps to ""green.""
- ""zup"" followed by ""dax"" maps to ""yellow"" followed by ""green.""
- ""lug"" inconsistently maps to ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Let's isolate the inputs and outputs that include ""walm"":

1. ""zup wif walm"" maps to ""yellow red red red.""
2. ""dax walm zup lug"" maps to ""green green green yellow blue.""
3. ""zup dax walm"" maps to ""yellow green green green.""
4. ""zup lug walm"" maps to ""yellow blue blue blue.""
5. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" maps to ""yellow green green green yellow red.""

From these examples, we can observe how the colors repeat in the output after ""walm"" appears:

1. ""walm"" after ""wif"" turns the output to three repeats of ""red.""
2. ""walm"" after ""dax"" turns the output to three repeats of ""green.""
3. ""walm"" appears after another color word (not ""wif""), like ""lug,"" turns the output to three repeats of that color word's corresponding color, like ""blue.""

Therefore, we can induce that ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color output of the last color word before it three times.

2. Other words in the input correspond to other colors, for example, ""wif"" to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the given examples.

Input: dax walm zup lug

In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and results in repeated ""green.""

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The ""walm"" in between repeats the color for ""lug,"" which is blue, hence ""walm"" --> ""blue blue.""

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Consistent with the previous patterns, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" The ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

Again, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" ""wif"" produces ""red,"" which is a new color not associated with ""walm."" The ""walm"" after ""zup"" gives us repeated ""yellow.""

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

In the final example, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" According to the pattern, ""walm"" should repeat the color of the preceding word, so after ""wif,"" ""walm"" yields repeated ""red.""

From these observations, the pattern is that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word three times.",-0.07846338892953487,110,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the colors associated with it in the output. Let's break down each instance where ""walm"" is used and its corresponding color output:

1. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
2. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
3. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
4. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
5. dax wif walm -> green red red red

From the above examples, we can derive the following observations:

- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color that follows is green, which is the color associated with ""dax.""
- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color that follows is blue, which is the color associated with ""lug.""
- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color that follows is yellow, which is the color associated with ""zup.""
- The color that follows ""walm"" is repeated as many times as ""walm"" is repeated in the input.
- When ""walm"" is at the end, as in the fifth input, the color after ""wif"" (red) is repeated an additional time, suggesting ""walm"" repeats the color of the word preceding it.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it in the input sequence.

Therefore, we can conclude:

walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.",-0.09961648089093024,110,walm
"Given the examples, we can notice a pattern that seems to involve repetition and color association. Let's closely analyze each instance where ""walm"" is used:

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""zup lug"" to ""yellow blue"". ""walm"" appears between ""dax"" and ""zup"" and the output is ""green green green yellow blue"". The repetition of ""green"" three times and the position of ""walm"" suggests that ""walm"" might mean to repeat the color before it two more times.

- In the second example, ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" equals ""blue"" and ""dax"" equals ""green"". Here ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""dax,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue green"". This still fits with the rule from the first example, as the color before ""walm"" is repeated two more times.

- The third example, ""dax walm zup walm,"" further supports the rule: ""dax"" is ""green,"" followed by ""walm"" the output is ""green green green"". ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm"" and the output becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"". This solidifies the idea that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color before it two more times.

- The fourth example, ""zup walm lug wif,"" starts with ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" ""walm"" does not influence ""wif"" because it isn't preceding it.

- The fifth example, ""dax wif walm,"" shows ""dax"" as ""green"" and ""wif"" as ""red"". The word ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" and the output sequence ends with ""red red red."" Since ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" it causes ""red"" to be repeated three times in this case.

From these observations, the rule associated with the word ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

- In the second example, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in another blue.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is green, and the first ""walm"" repeats green. ""Zup"" is associated with yellow, and the second ""walm"" repeats yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" repeats that yellow. ""Lug"" is blue, and this is independent of the ""walm"" rule.

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is repeated three times following ""dax,"" which is repeated as ""green"" once.

Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to a repetition of ""green""

Breaking down the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif

   - ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red""
   - ""lug walm"" results in a repeat of the color for ""lug,"" which is blue, hence ""blue blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""zup walm"" repeats the yellow, hence ""yellow yellow""
   - The final ""wif"" is simply ""red""

2. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""zup walm"" repeats the yellow, giving us ""yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.

Here is the reasoning:

- In the first Input, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" the word ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and right after ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated. Similarly, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated thrice.
  
- In the second Input, ""zup walm wif,"" the word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and right after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice, followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""

- In the third and fifth Inputs, both sequences end with ""dax zup,"" which translates to ""green yellow,"" but just before these, ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the color for ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

- The fourth Input, ""wif walm,"" shows ""walm"" causing the repetition of ""wif's"" color, which is ""red.""

From these examples, we can conclude that ""walm"" induces the repetition of the color associated with the previous word.",-0.4794744734147314,111,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine its position in relation to other words within the given examples and their corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears twice:
  - Once after ""lug,"" which is followed by ""blue blue"" in the output.
  - Once after ""zup,"" which is followed by ""blue"" in the output.
  - Before each ""walm,"" different words are used (`lug` and `zup`), but both times, ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated in the output.
  - ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" and each time after ""wif,"" ""walm"" is present, and ""wif"" results in ""red.""

- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""wif"":
  - ""zup walm wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow red.""
  - We can deduce ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and thus ""walm"" would be connected to the repetition of the color before it (in this case, ""yellow"").

- In the third example:
  - ""wif walm dax zup"" leads to ""red red red green yellow.""
  - ""zup"" consistently leads to ""yellow""; ""dax"" has only appeared before ""zup"" and leads to ""green.""
  - ""wif"" continues to lead to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" which follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated twice more, suggesting ""walm"" repeats the previous color (in this case, ""red"").

Looking at these examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.",-0.5954231289252687,111,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the input and associated output:

In all examples, ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red."" Knowing this, we can look at the outputs following ""walm"" in each example to find a pattern.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" appears twice:
   - The first ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") and is followed by ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), resulting in the output ""blue.""
   - The second ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") and precedes ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), resulting in the output ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") and is followed by ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), resulting in the output ""yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") and precedes ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), resulting in the output ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") and no word follows it, resulting in the output ""red.""

Looking at these patterns, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the last mentioned color in the output sequence. Whenever ""walm"" is used, it takes on the color of the word preceding it. So, if ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" indicating repetition of the color.

"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following patterns for the nonce word ""lug"":

1. In ""zup walm lug wif"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"". We can't deduce the meaning of ""lug"" from this example alone because we don't have a one-to-one mapping of the words to colors.

2. In ""lug zup"", the output is ""blue yellow"". Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", as ""zup"" is consistent in being ""yellow"" from the previous example.

3. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", the output is ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" is consistent with ""red"", and ""zup"" is still ""yellow"". ""Bluf"" seems to correspond with a repetition of ""yellow"", and ""walm"" is in a sequence that results in ""blue blue"". Since after ""bluf"", the colors are repeated twice, it could be inferred that ""bluf"" causes the next color to be repeated. Given that ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue"", it's possible that ""lug"" simply means ""blue"", as it's not affected by the ""bluf"" repetition rule.

4. In ""lug zup lug"", the output is ""blue yellow blue"". This supports the notion that ""lug"" means ""blue"" as it directly converts to ""blue"" without interference from any repetition rules.

5. In ""lug wif dax wif"", the output is ""blue red green red"". ""Lug"" in this context again corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" stays consistent as ""red"". The new word “dax” corresponds to ""green"".

Given these examples, the rule seems to be consistent:

Rule: lug -> blue",-0.10636112640822781,112,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the examples provided and analyze which word corresponds to which color in the outputs:

1. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
2. ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""
3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""lug zup lug"" -> ""blue yellow blue""
5. ""lug wif dax wif"" -> ""blue red green red""

Now let's make observations:

- Every time the word ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.
- The word ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" always translates to ""red.""
- The word ""walm"" seems to be associated with multiple ""yellow"" or ""blue,"" suggesting a repetition rule, but since we see it produce ""yellow yellow yellow"" and ""blue blue blue,"" the repetition count is inconsistent and seems to depend on another rule. 

The independent variable appears to be ""lug"" as it consistently correlates with ""blue."" Other words like ""walm"" seem to be influenced by the position or the presence of other words like ""lug"" and are thus not consistent on their own. The repetition perhaps only occurs when ""walm"" appears after ""lug"", but since we don't have examples of ""walm"" without ""lug"" in front except in the first case where it is followed by ""yellow"" three times, there's not enough data to determine the rule for ""walm"". 

Given the information above, we can deduce the following rule for ""lug"":

Rule: lug -> blue",-0.1242936436428481,112,lug
"Observing the patterns from the given examples, we can deduce the following representations for each nonce word:

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""walm"" includes repetition, suggesting ""walm"" may indicate repeating the color that comes after it.

In the third example, ""walm"" comes before ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which implies that ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue"" and ""walm"" caused the repetition. Since ""lug"" also appears without ""walm"" and consistently translates to ""blue,"" the effect of ""walm"" should be seen as supplemental rather than integral to the meaning of ""lug.""

- ""bluf"" is not defined alone, but since ""walm bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" and we know ""walm"" repeats the following color, ""bluf"" likely translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the last example.

Rule: lug -> blue",-0.9984242646044303,112,lug
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""lug"" appears to correspond directly to the color blue. This can be determined from instances where ""lug"" is immediately followed by the word ""blue"" in the corresponding output. This pattern holds true across all examples where ""lug"" is used. 

The other words in the inputs seem to correspond to other colors: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" seems to denote a repetition of the color blue. The word ""dax"" in the fifth example corresponds to green. 

This is best summarized as:

Moreover, by looking at the patterns and comparing the input to the output, we can attempt to discern the meanings of other words or elements in the sequence as well, although it was not explicitly asked for. For example, ""wif"" always results in ""red,"" ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" and ""green"" otherwise, and ""lug"" results in ""blue.""

"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs after each occurrence of the word in the examples given:

1. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
2. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
3. dax walm wif -> green green green red
4. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
5. dax walm -> green green green

Now, let's analyze:

- In the first example, after ""walm,"" the word ""lug"" correlates to the first ""blue"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end, and the output ends with three ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" which correlates to the final ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is again at the end, followed by three ""red"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, there's nothing after ""walm,"" and the output is three ""green.""

From these examples, we could suggest that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the next word three times. If ""walm"" is the last word, it means to repeat the color of the word just before ""walm"" three times. 

However, when we look at Example 1 again, after ""walm,"" there's ""lug,"" which translates to one ""blue"" (not three). It is important to note that ""lug"" is followed by ""wif,"" which correlates to ""red."" This could imply that even when there is a word after ""walm,"" it is the color of the final word in the sequence that is repeated, not the immediate next word.

To check this, let's examine Example 2 again: after ""walm"" (which is at the end), the output ends with three ""blue,"" which is the color of ""lug,"" the word before ""walm,"" rather than ""dax,"" which would be ""green."" This supports our revised observation.

So, our revised rule for ""walm"" could be: repeat the color of the last word in the sequence three times. When ""walm"" is the last word, repeat the color of the word just before ""walm"" three times.

walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color of the final mentioned color three times. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm"" three times.",-0.092356340692561,112,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern of colors generated in the output and the position of ""walm"" in the input. Here's an analysis of the examples:

1. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" generates ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red.""
2. ""wif dax lug walm"" generates ""red green blue blue blue.""
3. ""dax walm wif"" generates ""green green green red.""
4. ""lug wif walm"" generates ""blue red red red.""
5. ""dax walm"" generates ""green green green.""

From this, we observe that:

- In Example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to repeating ""yellow,"" then follows the pattern set by ""lug"" and ""wif"" for ""blue"" and ""red.""
- In Example 2, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which results in repeating the color ""blue.""
- In Example 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated.
- In Example 4, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated.
- In Example 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated again.

It appears that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. If ""walm"" is at the end, it repeats the color associated with the preceding word. Therefore,

Rule: ""walm"" -> the word ""walm"" repeats the color that is associated with the next word in the sequence. If there's no word after it, it repeats the color of the preceding word.",-0.12594187422846337,112,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at each instance where ""walm"" appears and analyze the corresponding output to look for patterns.

- In the first example, ""walm"" seems to be associated with two ""yellow"" and one ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" corresponds to three ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" corresponds to three ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" corresponds to three ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" corresponds to three ""green.""

From these observations, a pattern emerges: each time ""walm"" is used, it appears to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times.

Let's look at the input and associated output in the second example to break the rule down further:

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

Here ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" After ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" three times in the output, confirming our identified pattern.

Based on the given examples, we can conclude the following:

Walm -> ""Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before 'walm' three times.""

Rule: When ""walm"" is in the input, output the color associated with the previous word in the input sequence three times in the output sequence.",-1.0277862799336586,112,walm
"Reviewing the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" influences the output based on the word that directly precedes it. If we look at the color outputs following the word ""walm,"" we see that the color repeats the number of times based on the preceding word's associated number of color outputs:

- In ""zup walm,"" the result is ""yellow yellow yellow;"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" three times.
- In ""lug walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times since ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue.""
- In ""wif dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" hence ""blue"" appears three more times.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""green"" appears three times, matching the three ""green"" from ""dax.""
- In ""dax walm wif,"" ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" leading to a ""red"" output after the three ""green.""

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word before it in the sequence to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" results in the color associated with the preceding word being repeated three times.",-1.028547617718293,112,walm
"Looking at the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" has an effect on the series of colors produced in the output. The introduced color repeats a number of times. To deduce the rule, first, let's list out the examples with attention to what ""walm"" corresponds to:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to red), the output is three instances of red.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to green), the output is three instances of green.

From these observations, we can see a pattern that ""walm"" causes the next color to be repeated three times.

From the first and second examples, we see that when ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""red green,"" but when ""wif"" comes before ""dax,"" the output reverses to ""green red."" This suggests that ""wif"" inverts the order of colors that are associated with the words that come before and after it.

In the third example, ""wif"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" and the output is ""yellow red green"", demonstrating again that ""wif"" may cause an inversion, but not affecting ""yellow,"" which remains consistent from input to output.

In the fourth example, ""wif"" produces ""red red"" when placed before ""bluf,"" which does not give us much information on its own as there is no positional change or associated word to compare it with. However, since ""wif"" appears to be responsible for ""red"" appearing in all examples, we might consider that one of its functions is to output ""red.""

In the fifth example, ""zup wif lug dax"" outputs ""yellow red blue green,"" and it seems like ""wif"" is again between two words ""lug"" and ""dax,"" with the output being ""red blue green,"" which follows the inversion pattern seen previously.

Combining this information, it seems like ""wif"" signifies a rule that outputs ""red"" and also inverts the color order of the adjacent terms in the input sequence.

Explanation:

- In ""lug walm dax,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. The word ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and since ""lug"" has three letters, we see ""blue"" repeated three times.

- In ""dax walm,"" the word ""dax"" is associated with the color green. ""Dax"" has three letters, so ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

- ""zup walm wif"" shows ""zup"" associated with yellow. Following the rule, since ""zup"" has three letters, ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times, followed by ""wif,"" which is red.

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" provides an example where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" at the end of the sequence. ""Dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times, matching the three letters in ""dax.""

Walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",-0.1178694611880682,114,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs provided. Let's examine each example:

- When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red""; thus, ""wif"" probably means ""red.""
- When ""dax"" appears, the output always starts with ""green""; hence, ""dax"" likely means ""green.""
- When ""zup"" appears, the output contains ""yellow""; therefore, ""zup"" could mean ""yellow.""

Now, let's focus on ""walm"":
- In the first example, ""walm"" is paired with ""wif"" and the output is ""red red red."" Since ""wif"" translates to a single ""red,"" the triple ""red"" suggests that ""walm"" somehow amplifies or repeats the color word it's paired with. The same pattern occurs in the third example with ""wif walm"" resulting in ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax zup walm wif,"" and the output has ""yellow yellow yellow red."" This further supports that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color word three times.
- The fourth example has ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" with the output being ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and we see ""yellow"" repeated three times again.
- The fifth example has ""dax walm,"" with the output ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""dax"" repeats ""green"" thrice.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

- In the first example, the word before `bluf` is `wif`, which maps to `red`; therefore `bluf` also maps to `red`.
- In the second example, the word before `bluf` is `zup`, which maps to `yellow`; hence `bluf` maps to `yellow`.
- In the third example, `bluf` follows `lug`, which maps to `blue`; this means `bluf` also maps to `blue`.
- The fourth example has `bluf` immediately following `wif`. Since `wif` maps to `red`, `bluf` maps to `red` as well.
- The fifth example presents `bluf` after `zup`, which corresponds to `yellow`, so `bluf` takes on the `yellow` color in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm.""

In the first example, the repetition of ""walm"" correlates with the color red being repeated:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three repetitions of the color blue:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and there are three yellows:
Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

In the fourth example, ""walm"" at the end results in a repetition of the color red:
Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red

In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" results in a repetition of the color green:
Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" induces repetition of the color that immediately precedes it:

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the color word that precedes it in the output. The number of repetitions matches the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively. If there is no color word before ""walm,"" it repeats the most recently mentioned color word.",-0.08584230225065215,115,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. To deduce the rules more clearly:

1. dax wif walm lug zup walm
   - Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red"", indicating ""walm"" has caused ""red"" to repeat.
   - ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating ""walm"" again causes the color of the preceding word to repeat.

2. lug walm
   - Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"", confirming that ""walm"" causes the preceding word's color to repeat.

3. zup walm dax
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   - ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", once more showing that ""walm"" induces repetition.

4. lug wif zup wif walm

   - The final ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", consistent with previous examples.

5. wif bluf dax walm
   - Output: red red green green green
   - The final ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"", which means ""walm"" caused ""green"" to repeat two additional times.

Rule: ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the immediately preceding color in the output three times, following the first occurence of the color.

Thus, the meaning is:
walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat three additional times.",-0.11233030170750001,115,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" directly influences the number of color words that follow it in the output. Specifically, it seems that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color word that comes just before it. To establish the rule, let's look at each example:

1. In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"", ""walm"" first follows ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"" in the output, and ""red"" is then repeated two times. Later in the sequence, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

2. In ""lug walm"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

3. In ""zup walm dax"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

4. In ""lug wif zup wif walm"", ""walm"" follows the second ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"" in the output, and ""red"" is then repeated three times.

5. In ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"" in the output, and ""green"" is then repeated three times.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the immediately preceding color word in the output to be repeated a certain number of additional times. The number of repetitions seems to correspond to the position of the color in the input sequence before the occurrence of ""walm"". For example, if ""walm"" is the third word in the sequence, the color before it is repeated two additional times in the output (for a total of three times), whereas if ""walm"" is the second word, the color is repeated two more times (for a total of three times), and so on.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Causes the repetition of the color word that precedes it in the output, with the total number of repetitions (including the original) seemingly equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.",-0.4090051088238154,115,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color of the previous word three more times.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" the word ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red. Hence, we repeat ""red"" three times. Later again, the word ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, so ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm,"" the ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, so ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""zup walm dax,"" the ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in three ""yellow"" before moving to ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" the ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" so red is repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, hence three ""green"" are added.

Given the above examples, ""walm"" appears to indicate a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-0.49694661559423914,115,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to function as a directive to repeat the color associated with the last word prior to ""walm."" 

Here is the analysis:

1. In the first example, after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" the output is three times ""blue"" due to the word ""walm."" Similarly, ""walm"" after ""zup"" (""yellow"") results in three repetitions of ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three ""blue"" in the output.

3. In the third example, the noun ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" causing ""yellow"" to be repeated three times. The final word, ""dax,"" changes the output to ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" resulting in three ""red"" in the output.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" leading to three occurrences of ""green"" in the output.

The consistent pattern is that whenever ""zup"" appears, regardless of the position or surrounding words, the output is ""yellow."" So, the most straightforward rule for ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow. Meaning that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""",-1.0571928637315733,116,zup
"Based on the given examples, the color output corresponds to each input word, indicating that ""zup"" translates to a specific color. By comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, one can deduce the color linked to each word:

- Whenever ""zup"" is present, the output color is ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" as well (as seen in the second and third examples, it seems that the output is not a mistake and ""bluf"" does indeed correspond to ""green"").
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Thus, the rule seems to be that each word is associated with a specific color output. Consequently, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs, focusing on presence and repetition:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

3. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

From these examples, we can notice the following patterns:

- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the examples 1 and 5. 
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in examples 2, 3, and 5.
- ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in examples 2 and 3.
- ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in all examples.

The word ""walm"" seems to act as a repeater for the color represented by the previously mentioned nonce word. After each instance of ""walm,"" the color corresponding to the previous nonce word is repeated two more times, for a total of three appearances. For example, in the first input, after the word ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous nonce word. Here is the observed correspondence:

Walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding nonce word three times.",-0.09525884126753122,116,walm
"Analyzing the given examples, let's look for patterns related to the word ""walm"" and its corresponding output colors:

1. Whenever the word ""walm"" is present, a sequence of a single color is outputted three times in a row.
2. The particular color seems to be dependent on the word that precedes ""walm"":
    - If preceded by ""zup"", the color is yellow.
    - If preceded by ""wif"", the color is red.
    - If preceded by ""lug"", the color is blue.
    - If preceded by ""dax"", the color is green.

There is no instance where ""walm"" appears without a preceding word, which would help to determine if ""walm"" itself dictates the specific color or if it is entirely context-dependent. However, from the provided examples, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the following output to triple the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the output color to triple based on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If ""zup"" precedes it, the color is yellow; if ""wif"" precedes it, the color is red; if ""lug"" precedes it, the color is blue; if ""dax"" precedes it, the color is green.",-1.036167448747396,116,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" has an effect on the immediately preceding word by changing the color representation into three repetitions of that color. Let's analyze the examples given:

1. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"". The word ""wif"" alone usually means ""red"", but when followed by ""walm"", it repeats the color three times.
2. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". Similarly, ""dax"" by itself would relate to ""green"", but it is repeated thrice when followed by the word ""walm"".
3. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Again, ""zup"" would typically mean ""yellow"", and it is tripled when ""walm"" follows.

The word ""walm"" seems to function as a rule for tripling the color output related to the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Triple the color associated with the preceding word.",-1.0387341470354163,116,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next color word to be repeated three times.

Explanation:

- In the first example, the presence of ""walm"" before ""zup"" changes the output from red red to yellow yellow yellow.

- In the second example, ""walm"" precedes ""zup"" and the single ""green"" is extended to green green green.

- The third example has two instances of ""walm"", both of which precede ""zup"" and ""lug"" respectively. As a result, the single ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and the single ""blue"" for ""lug"" are each repeated thrice.

- The fourth example is simply ""zup walm"", which clearly shows ""zup"" being extended to yellow yellow yellow.

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" precedes ""lug"", resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color word that immediately follows it to be outputted three times in a row.",-1.0647755969348958,116,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word 'walm' appears to translate to the replication of the color that immediately follows it, three times. Here's a breakdown of the observed pattern:

- In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" (associated with ""zup"") is repeated three times.
- The second and third input further support this as ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""lug"" respectively, and the output has ""yellow"" and ""blue"" (colors associated with ""zup"" and ""lug"") repeated three times.
- The fourth input simply consists of ""zup walm,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times, which is consistent with the previous examples.
- The fifth input shows ""zup walm"" followed by ""lug"" and then ""wif,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times followed by ""blue"" and ""red,"" consistent with the pattern of replicating the color that follows ""walm.""

However, there may also be rules for the words ""wif"" and ""zup"" since they correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively in the outputs given. The word ""walm"" only appears once in the series of inputs, and the corresponding output consists of three instances of ""green"", which suggests that the word ""walm"" might either be associated with green or follows a different rule that is not immediately clear from the given examples.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs provided in the examples.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

We have one ""zup"" followed by ""walm,"" and the output features ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Here, ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in two ""red"" followed by three ""green"". This implies ""wif"" correspond to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green"". The word ""bluf"" is new, but we cannot determine its meaning from this example alone.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" We observe that ""walm"" doesn't correspond to a single color but may instead be a rule about repetition or sequencing.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Here, we see that ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" Similar to the previous instances, ""walm"" is followed by repeated colors.

Input: dax zup walm wif walm

""dax"" produces ""green,"" ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red."" In both instances where ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a repeated sequence of colors, according to the word that comes right after ""walm.""

From the examples, we can hypothesize the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the following word to be repeated three times.

Based on this rule:
- After ""zup walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- After ""dax walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.
- After ""wif walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.

Thus, our induction leads us to define:

"Walm -> to repeat the color associated with the previous word(s) multiple times. 

Rule: The word walm indicates a repetition of the color output associated with the word that comes directly before it. The number of repetitions seems to be determined by the number of words since the last occurrence of walm (or since the start of the sequence if walm has not appeared before). Here's the pattern deduced from the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, and since there's only one word before ""walm,"" the color is repeated three times (starting count at 1).
2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" leads to ""red red green green green"" because ""dax"" is green, and there are three words before ""walm"" so green is repeated three times (one additional repetition per preceding word).
3. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue"" because ""wif"" is red and there are two words before ""walm,"" hence red is repeated three times before moving to the next word ""lug"" which is blue.
4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" gives ""green blue blue blue yellow red"" because ""lug"" is blue and there are two words before ""walm,"" so blue is repeated three times. After ""walm,"" it continues normally with ""zup"" which is yellow and ""wif"" which is red.
5. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"" because after ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow), as explained in previous examples, ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times. Then ""wif"" is red, and since there is one word between the walm examples, we only repeat red two additional times (starting at 1).

Please note that the starting point for the repetition counter is under the assumption that we begin counting from 1, not 0.",-0.13309846747748397,117,walm
"Observing the examples provided, we can infer that the output colors correspond to specific words in the input and that the word ""walm"" results in repeating the color that correlates to the preceding word. The pattern shows that each word has an associated color: ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""wif"" with red, ""dax"" with green, and ""lug"" with blue. When ""walm"" appears after any of these words, the associated color is repeated a number of times.

For the input ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, following by ""walm"" which causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times in the output.

When the input is ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" does not seem to have an output (perhaps it's ignored or has no associated color), ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated twice (for a total of 3 times including the original) in the output.

Following this pattern, for the input ""zup wif walm lug"", ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated thrice (for a total of 4 times including the original), and ""lug"" translates to blue.

In the other examples given, ""walm"" consistently causes the color corresponding to the word that precedes it to repeat a number of times, with the total instances depending on its context.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the provided examples and identify patterns regarding the usage of ""walm"" and its corresponding output. Here's an analysis of each example:

1. dax walm zup lug

- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup.""

2. zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""walm"" is at the end, following ""wif.""

- ""walm"" appears twice: after ""wif"" and at the end.

5. wif walm dax zup

- ""walm"" follows ""wif.""

Observations:
- Whenever ""walm"" appears, it triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
- If ""walm"" is at the end, it repeats the color of the preceding word multiple times.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to act as an instruction to repeat the corresponding color of the word that comes before it. If ""walm"" is the last word, the color repeats multiple times (the exact number of repetitions is not consistent across examples).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word. If ""walm"" is at the end, repeat multiple times (the exact number of repetitions may depend on context not provided in examples).",-0.07187444736816669,118,walm
"Based on the supplied examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that its color representation changes depending on the word that precedes it. Here is a breakdown of each example:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   The word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green"".

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   The word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red"".

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red"".

From the examples given, ""walm"" seems to mirror the color of the word that precedes it unless it is preceded by ""lug"", which results in the color ""blue"". Without an example of ""walm"" following ""lug"" directly, we can tentatively state that ""lug"" might reset the color representation of ""walm"" to blue, although more examples would be needed to confirm this consistently.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word, except when following ""lug"", where it becomes blue.",-0.0794376864139583,118,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the input-output pairs and identify consistent patterns.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows the word ""dax,"" which correlates to the color green. Shortly after, ""walm"" is represented by three consecutive colors: green, yellow, and blue. This does not tell us much, as there is no apparent pattern yet.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end and corresponds to three consecutive reds. However, ""wif"" also correlates with red, and ""zup"" correlates with yellow, so this example alone doesn't clarify if ""walm"" is specifically related to red or to repeating the color of the previous word.

3. In the third example, ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which could imply that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word before it, which in this case is ""zup"" (yellow).

4. The fourth example has ""walm"" appearing twice, after ""wif"" and ""lug,"" and in both cases, it outputs a repetition of the color of the words before it: red after ""wif,"" blue after ""lug."" This supports the idea that ""walm"" causes a repeat of the previous word's color.

5. The fifth example also supports this rule. ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and the result is three reds in a row, presuming that ""dax zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word.

So, ""walm"" -> meaning is to repeat the color of the word before it.",-0.8507029088520833,118,walm
"Based on the examples provided, where each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to a specific color output, we can induce the following rule:

- If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is 'yellow'.
- ""Walm"" does not influence the color of words that follow it; rather, it changes its own color based on the word that directly precedes it.

However, some ambiguity still remains due to the limited context as we don't have an example where ""walm"" stands alone or is at the start of the input. But based on the available examples, we can decipher that the meaning of ""walm"" is tied to the word that comes immediately before it.

1. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   
2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: wif walm

4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   
5. Input: dax walm wif bluf

From these examples, we notice that ""walm"" is always followed by a repetition of a color three times.

- After ""dax,"" ""walm"" repeats the color green three times.
- After ""zup,"" ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times.
- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" repeats the color red three times.

The color that ""walm"" repeats depends on the word that comes immediately before it. Here is a rule that can be deduced from the examples:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

- If the previous word is ""dax,"" the color is green.
- If the previous word is ""zup,"" the color is yellow.
- If the previous word is ""wif,"" the color is red.",-0.09270658780169232,119,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the instances where it occurs and the corresponding output:

1. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
5. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red

From these examples, we can infer the following:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is three green colors.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is three yellow colors.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is three red colors.

Looking at the other words, ""lug"" and ""bluf"" do not seem to influence the output immediately following ""walm."" Instead, their presence leads to the outputs ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively, but not in a triadic repetition.

Therefore, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to signal a triadic repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", which suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.
2. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and again, ""walm"" leads to a triplet repetition.
3. ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red"", which shows that ""wif"" equals ""red"" and ""walm"" triggers a threefold repetition.
4. In the sequence ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" we see that ""walm"" follows ""dax"" to give three greens and follows ""lug"" (through ""dax"") to repeat green three more times.
5. For the input ""dax walm wif bluf,"" we notice that ""bluf"" has not appeared before; hence, there is no repetition associated with ""walm."" Since ""walm"" still follows ""wif,"" it repeats ""red"" three times.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately previous word three times.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to trigger repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Each word, when not preceded by ""walm"", maps to a specific color as follows:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue

When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the corresponding color is repeated three times. In the case where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which is mapped to blue), but ""lug"" is preceded by ""dax walm"", the output sequence has the color blue followed by three greens, which indicates that the presence of ""lug"" in the sequence does not affect the repetition induced by ""walm"" following ""dax"".

- In every instance, the word following ""walm"" is translated into a color that is repeated multiple times.

- ""zup walm"" translates into three yellows.
- ""wif walm"" translates into three reds.
- It's not clear from the examples what governs how many times the next word's color is repeated; it may depend on a rule not evident from the provided examples or could be a constant repetition (like three times), with ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" being an exception or having an additional rule element not yet identified.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" designates the next word to be repeated multiple times in its corresponding color.

zup -> yellow",-0.8900146893646154,120,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the patterns between the inputs and outputs:

Input containing ""zup"" consistently produces ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence. Therefore, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow.""

Looking at the additional context where other words are present, it appears that each word might represent a color:

- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" when considering the first and last examples.
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" when observed in the first example.
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" which is consistent in the first and last examples.
- ""walm"" consistently correlates with ""yellow,"" demonstrated by multiple occurrences in the second and third examples.

Even though other words might change the output sequence's length, ""zup"" alone always results in a single instance of ""yellow.""

Considering this analysis, the meaning of ""zup"" is as follows:

zup -> yellow

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the individual inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify patterns.

Let's consider each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
   Here, ""wif"" produces ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which then produces another ""red.""

2. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   
   Similarly, ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which leads to another ""blue.""

3. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red
   
   Following the pattern, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""wif,"" producing a second ""blue.""

4. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue
   
   Again, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" duplicating the ""blue.""

5. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   
   This sequence is more complex, but ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Notice that after each word (except the last ""zup""), ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word before it.

Based on these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it duplicates the output (color) of the preceding word in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.",-0.08906931232512659,120,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the meaning or the rule for the word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs and outputs while focusing on the pattern of the colors associated with the words preceding ""bluf.""

From the input and output pairs, we can deduce the following pattern:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
   - ""wif"" output is ""red"" and then ""bluf"" results in ""red"" again.

2. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
   - ""lug"" output is ""blue"" and then ""bluf"" results in ""blue"" again.

3. Input: dax lug bluf wif -> Output: green blue blue red
   - ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" ""bluf"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue"", and ""wif"" as the last word outputs ""red.""

4. Input: dax lug bluf -> Output: green blue blue
   - ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" afterward results in ""blue.""

5. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   - ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" ""lug"" outputs ""blue"", ""bluf"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" another ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" and then ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" again.

By analyzing these pairs, it's clear that ""bluf"" results in the same color as the word that comes just before it. Therefore, the rule is:

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should carefully examine the outputs in each case to see how they correspond to the inputs. I will use the process of elimination and pattern recognition to deduce the rule.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue"", as indicated by the repetition of blue after lug and walm.

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"", as indicated by yellow being repeated after zup and before lug.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" produces a repeated color based on the preceding word. This time, it seems to repeat ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif."" Given that ""walm"" followed ""lug"" and ""wif"" yet the output is not blue but is red, it suggests a positional influence or another factor affecting ""walm""'s output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" when followed by ""wif,"" it causes added repetition of the ""blue"" from ""lug."" After ""wif,"" we revert back to ""blue"" for ""lug.""

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""walm"" corresponds here to ""green,"" repeating the color of ""dax.""

Based on these observations, we can arrive at a rule for ""walm"": it causes repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word, whether it is the color itself or that color multiple times.

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.",-0.10379992259476743,120,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern of colors it produces in the output.

- Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
- Input: zup walm lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- Input: zup lug walm wif walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue
- Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green

In each instance where ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is a series of the same color repeated. It seems that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color that comes right before it:

- The first example, ""wif lug walm,"" gives us ""red blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and we get three blues in the output.
- Similarly, in the second example, ""zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, leading to three yellows.
- To confirm, the third example has ""walm"" following both ""lug"" and ""wif,"" and each time three of the corresponding color follow in the output: blue and red, respectively.
- The fourth example again follows this rule as ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and three blues are in the output.
- Finally, the fifth example's ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which must correspond with green, as indicated by the three green colors in the output.

Based on the above observations, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color that precedes it three times.",-0.11117344304337211,120,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze each distinct input and output pair to identify any patterns.

1. Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
2. Input: zup walm lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
4. Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue
5. Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green

Now, consider each instance where ""walm"" appears in the input and the corresponding colors in the output:

1. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
   Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of blue.

2. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
   Here, ""walm"" appears before ""lug"" and corresponds to the single instance of blue following three yellows.

3. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   The first ""walm"" follows a ""lug"" and corresponds to two instances of blue.
   The second ""walm"" follows a ""wif"" and corresponds to three instances of red.

4. ""lug walm wif lug"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue""
   The ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to two instances of blue and then a red.

5. ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green""
   ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and it corresponds to two instances of green.

From these examples, we notice:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" there are two instances of blue in the output.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" there are three instances of the color that follows ""wif"" in the pattern (for instance, red in the example 3).
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" there are two instances of the color green in the output.

Considering there's insufficient data to directly link ""walm"" to a particular color, the most consistent rule appears to be - ""walm"" causes a repetition of a certain number of colors based on a word that directly precedes it.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" triggers the repetition of colors in the output, with the specific number and color of repetitions depending on the context or the word that precedes ""walm"".",-0.1114320367155814,120,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe the pattern of how the word ""walm"" translates into colors in the output and how it interacts with other words. 

Looking at the first example:
Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

The word ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" with more blue in the output. This suggests that ""walm"" might be repeating the color that comes before it.

Looking at the second example:
Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Here, ""walm"" is placed after ""zup,"" and it results in repeating the color yellow until ""lug,"" which turns the output to blue. Again, ""walm"" seems to repeat the preceding color.

In the third example, ""walm"" appears twice, each time repeating the color that comes before it.

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red 

Looking at every instance of ""walm,"" in all examples, it consistently repeats the color of the word immediately before it until a new color word appears.

The rule for ""walm"" based on the given examples is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word in the output until a different color word appears.",-0.588628320488721,120,walm
"Analyzing the input and output patterns, it seems that ""walm"" affects the color sequence. I'll examine each instance of ""walm"" to derive the rule:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated.

Given the examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated several times equal to the number of letters in the preceding word. For example, ""lug"" has three letters, and ""blue"" was repeated three times after ""walm.""

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue."" Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Here is the deduction broken down by example:

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""wif,"" and the output is ""blue red."" Since ""lug"" is the only word correlated with ""blue"" across all examples, it likely means ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" is between “zup” and “dax,"" corresponding to ""yellow blue green"" in the output, which supports the idea that ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- The third example features ""lug"" followed by ""zup"" and ""dax,"" with ""blue yellow green"" as the output, reinforcing that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

- In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when ""walm"" follows, it repeats ""blue"" twice, since ""lug"" was the first word (hence two repetitions in addition to the initial occurrence), followed by ""dax,"" which turns to ""green.""

- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows, it repeats ""green"" twice, as ""dax"" was the first word (hence, two repetitions in addition to the initial occurrence).

- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes repetition of ""yellow"" three times since ""zup"" was the first word and preceded ""walm"" (three total instances of ""yellow"").

- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" again translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat three times in total following the rule.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: When walm follows a color word, it causes the color of that word to repeat an additional number of times equal to the number of colors mentioned before walm plus one.",-0.34353079074700005,121,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's examine the patterns given in the input and their respective outputs:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is multiple ""green"", suggesting that ""walm"" may mean repeating the color that ""dax"" represents ('green').

2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is multiple ""blue"", which again implies that ""walm"" means repeating the color that ""lug"" represents ('blue').

3. When ""dax"" and ""walm"" are presented without any other words, the output is still multiple ""green"".

4. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""wif"", the output is multiple ""yellow"" (the color tied to ""zup"", based on other inputs and outputs we might infer from this system, assuming a pattern exists for ""zup"" as well) and then ""red"", indicating the presence of ""wif"".

5. When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is multiple ""blue"" again, reinforcing the pattern of repetition.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

**Rule:** ""walm"" means repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" can be represented as follows:

walm -> meaning. Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.6560923958671431,121,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" when following another word causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to that previous word three times. 

For example:
- ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and with ""walm"" following it leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" following the same pattern, where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-0.8812399027185714,121,walm
"walm -> repeated color of the preceding word. Rule: The output for ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.",-1.5204860248899998,121,walm
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue."" Here's a breakdown of each example to illustrate this:

- ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue""
- ""lug walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow red,"" and it's consistent with ""lug"" being ""blue"" as the first word in the input corresponds to the first color in the output.
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" corresponds to ""red red blue green red,"" again showing ""lug"" as ""blue"" in the third position of both input and output.
- ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue,"" where ""lug"" is the second element and ""blue"" is the second color.
- ""wif lug"" as another example, still corresponds to ""red blue.""

- ""walm"" and ""zup"" both translate to ""blue"" as ""lug"" does, but there's not enough information to discern if there's a finer rule between these words, as they don't appear alone.

2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in green being repeated three times, and ""lug"" (blue) followed by ""walm"" resulting in blue being repeated three times.

3. ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green,"" with ""dax"" (green) followed by ""walm,"" resulting in green being repeated three times in the output.

4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue,"" where ""dax"" (green) preceding ""walm"" results in green being repeated three times in the output, followed by once occurrence of ""lug"" (blue).

5. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green,"" with ""wif"" (red) followed by ""walm,"" causing red to repeat three times.

Here is what we observe:
- Whenever ""walm"" occurs, the following colors are the same as the one immediately preceding ""walm.""

- In the first example, 'bluf' follows 'dax' and results in the color 'green', which is the same color that follows 'dax'.
- In the second example, 'bluf' is preceded by 'wif' and hence the color 'red' is repeated.
- In the third example, 'bluf' follows 'lug' and the color 'blue' is repeated.
- In the fourth example, 'bluf' comes after 'zup' and the color 'yellow' is repeated.
- Finally, in the fifth example, 'bluf' follows another 'zup', resulting in a repetition of the color 'yellow'.

Therefore, the rule is that 'bluf' results in repeating the color associated with the word that comes directly before it in the sequence.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: The word 'bluf' causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",-1.1653220954624137,123,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce a rule that defines what ""bluf"" means.

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the corresponding color is ""yellow"" (examples 1 and 4).
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the corresponding color is ""red,"" as seen in examples 2 and 4.
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the corresponding color is ""blue"" (examples 3 and 5).

The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it inherits the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Inherits the color of the preceding word.",-1.3352987674,123,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" appears to mirror the color of the word that precedes it. 

Given the examples provided:

1. ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" that follows ""zup"" also results in ""yellow.""
2. ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""bluf"" that follows ""wif"" also results in ""red.""
3. ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" that follows ""lug"" also results in ""blue.""

The above pattern persists through all given examples, hence we can deduce the rule that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word.

So:
bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word directly before it.",-1.3540433069448272,123,bluf
"Rule: bluf translates to the color that precedes it, or yellow if it starts the sentence.",-1.8245392272942527,123,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word 'walm' represents a rule that dictates the color output should repeat three times with the color associated with the word prior to 'walm'. Here is the analysis of the given examples:

- Input: wif walm zup walm
  Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
  (wif -> red, repeated three times; zup -> yellow, repeated three times after 'walm')

- Input: zup dax walm
  Output: yellow green green green
  (dax -> green, repeated three times after 'walm')

- Input: wif lug walm
  Output: red blue blue blue
  (lug -> blue, repeated three times after 'walm')

- Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
  Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
  (lug -> blue, repeated three times after 'walm'; the rest of the sequence follows the pattern established earlier for individual colors)

- Input: dax walm zup lug dax
  Output: green green green yellow blue green
  (dax -> green, repeated three times after 'walm'; the rest of the sequence follows the pattern established earlier for individual colors)

Rule: walm -> The color corresponding to the word immediately preceding 'walm' is repeated three times.",-0.059079705403893616,123,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's consider the word's position and the output in each instance:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm | Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
Here ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""red red red."" Then ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output changes to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
   
2. Input: zup dax walm | Output: yellow green green green
Here ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green.""
   
3. Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
Here ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
   
4. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif | Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Here ""walm"" is after ""lug"" and before ""zup,"" leading to ""blue blue blue"" followed by ""yellow.""
   
5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax | Output: green green green yellow blue green
Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" leading to ""green green green,"" and then comes ""zup,"" which leads to ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word preceding it three times. For instance:
- After ""wif"" (which maps to ""red""), ""walm"" generates ""red red red.""
- After ""lug"" (which maps to ""blue""), ""walm"" generates ""blue blue blue.""
- After ""dax"" (which maps to ""green""), ""walm"" generates ""green green green.""

Rule:
walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.06953451814754254,123,walm
"By examining the examples given, it is possible to induce a rule that governs the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's analyze the output colors in association with the words in the input and their placements:

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

The word ""walm"" occurs after a word that has been translated to a color. The number of times the color repeats seems to be determined by the rule following the appearance of ""walm."" Here are the rules we can infer:

1. The color that appears after ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" gets repeated three times.
2. The color that precedes ""walm"" will be the one that is repeated.
3. The repetition ends when a new word appears which is associated with a different color.

Given these observations, we can define the meaning of ""walm"" as follows:

Walm -> Repeat the preceding color three times before moving on to the next word.

Rule: The word ""walm"" signals the repetition of the last color mentioned three times.",-0.07131582505073403,123,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern of colors that follow the word ""walm"" in each example. In each case where ""walm"" is used, the three words that follow are in the following color output:

- After ""walm,"" the outputs are three successive occurrences of the same color.
- The color that follows ""walm"" corresponds to the color that would have been assigned to the following word had ""walm"" not been present.

Here's the breakdown:

1. In the phrase ""wif walm zup walm,"" after ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" we have ""walm,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated two more times instead of proceeding to the next colors. Then ""walm"" occurs again before ""zup,"" and instead of outputting ""yellow"" once, it repeats ""yellow"" three times.
   
2. In the phrase ""zup dax walm,"" ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" followed by ""dax,"" which outputs ""green."" After ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated two more times instead of moving on to the next color.

3. The phrase ""wif lug walm"" features ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" then ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue."" After ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated two more times, following the established pattern.

4. In ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" after ""lug"" which outputs ""blue,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" three times. Then the pattern continues with ""zup"" outputting ""yellow,"" and so forth.

5. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" shows ""dax"" outputting ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which then leads to two more ""green"" outputs. 

Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color output of the following word three times in total.

So, the rule is: When ""walm"" precedes a word, the color output associated with the next word is repeated for a total of three times before moving on to the next word.",-0.28046838841351046,123,walm
"From the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to be a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes ""walm."" The number of repeated colors is three. We can determine this by analyzing how ""walm"" behaves in different contexts in the provided examples:

- In ""wif walm zup walm,"" ""wif"" precedes the first ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red,"" and ""zup"" precedes the second ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

- In ""zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" directly precedes ""walm,"" so the output is ""green green green.""

- In ""wif lug walm,"" ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue.""

- In ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" producing ""blue blue blue,"" while the other colors follow the color corresponding to their respective words without repetition as they are not followed by ""walm.""

- Similarly, in ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""green green green.""

Based on these examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it triggers the output of that word's corresponding color repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the preceding word's color three times.",-0.4004615238709361,123,walm

Rule: lug -> blue,-1.7471513988272147,124,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that each nonce word is consistently associated with a color. Specifically, the word ""dax"" is always associated with the color green. No other context or variation seems to change this result for ""dax."" Let's infer the associations for the other nonce words:

In the third example:

- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue.""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""red.""
- The second ""dax"" at the end is followed by ""green.""

In the fourth example:

- ""walm"" is followed by ""green."" Since ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" might also mean ""green"" or be a rule that doesn't change the previously mentioned color, which is ""green"" from ""dax.""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red."" This matches with the third input, where ""wif"" also corresponded to ""red.""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" which is also consistent with the third example.

In the fifth example:

- Only ""dax"" and ""wif"" are mentioned, with ""dax"" followed by ""green"" and ""wif"" by ""red,"" again consistent with the above examples.

Taking this information together, we can propose the following associations:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- walm -> green (or doesn't change the preceding color)

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in every instance. However, other words in the examples also translate to specific colors:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" (Note: this might be a pattern where non-""dax"" words ending in ""f"" map to ""red"")
- ""walm"" translates to ""green""

It seems that other nonce words also represent colors and the context in which ""dax"" appears does not affect its translation. 

Rule: dax -> green",-0.8147565400211266,124,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern in which specific nonce words correspond to specific colors. The given examples show a consistent mapping between the nonce word ""dax"" and the color ""green.""

As for the other nonce words in the examples, we can attempt to deduce their meanings by their consistent pairing with particular output colors:

- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- ""lug"" once appeared and mapped to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" is seen once and maps to ""green,"" the same as ""dax.""
- ""bluf"" once appeared and mapped to ""red.""

Here is the rule deduction considering the nonce words individually:

Rule:
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> green (as per single occurrence, assuming it behaves like ""dax"")
- bluf -> red (as per single occurrence, assuming it might be an alternative to ""wif"")",-0.9816364408014083,124,dax
"Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Every instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.

Similarly, other nonce words appear to correspond to different colors:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> green (since ""dax walm"" produced ""green green"", it's assumed that ""walm"" maintains the color green)

Therefore, the rule can be defined as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. ""dax"" always translates to the color ""green.""",-1.0613339417366194,124,dax
"Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""",-1.8594950343352112,124,dax
"Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" seems to be a rule precursor that signals the start of a sequence where the meaning of the terms that follow is translated into colors, with a specific color associated with each distinct word after ""wif.""

Here's what we can deduce from each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Rule: ""walm"" translates to a sequence of three ""red.""

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

4. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow
   Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" translates to three ""blue.""

With these observations, the meaning of ""wif"" appears to initiate the translation of the following words into a sequence of colors. The color each word translates to does not seem to depend on ""wif"" but on the specific word's inherent definition within this system. Additionally, the color sequence always starts with ""red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" may inherently include an initial ""red.""

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:
wif -> Signals the start of a sequence of colors, beginning with ""red."" Each subsequent word is replaced with a corresponding color or colors, depending on the predefined translation for that word.",-0.1078839775769706,124,wif
"Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" appears to precede a sequence of nonce words, each nonce word corresponding to a color in the output. The rule seems to be that ""wif"" introduces a sequence where each following nonce word is translated into a specific color. 

For example:
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" meaning ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" meaning ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" as well, repeated three times.
- ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" meaning ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue,"" where the pattern holds for ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm.""

The rule seems fairly straightforward, with ""wif"" being a signal word that is always translated to ""red"" and is used to initiate a sequence of color translations.

Rule: wif -> red (initiates a color sequence, translating subsequent nonce words to specific colors)",-0.11067600357000001,124,wif
"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" might act as a trigger for a sequence of output colors, where each subsequent word affects the output according to a specific rule. Let's examine the output for each given input:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"". Since ""bluf"" is not directly associated with a standard color, the word possibly means to repeat the color triggered by ""wif"", which is ""red"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red red"". Similarly, ""walm"" might mean to output two additional ""red""s after the initial ""red"".
- When ""lug"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red blue"". Here, ""lug"" seems to change the color output to ""blue"" after the initial ""red"".
- When ""dax zup"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red green yellow"". It seems that ""dax"" triggers the color ""green"" to follow ""red"", and ""zup"" subsequently changes the next color to ""yellow"".
- When ""wif dax lug walm"" is provided, the output is ""red green blue blue blue"". This suggests that ""dax"" initially changes the output to ""green"", ""lug"" changes the next output to ""blue"", and ""walm"" continues to output ""blue"", just like it continued to output ""red"" in the second example.

Based on this analysis, the implied rule for ""wif"" in these given examples seems to be the initial trigger word for the color ""red"". Each subsequent word then modifies or continues the sequence according to its own rule.

Rule: wif -> triggers the initial output of the color ""red"". Each word following ""wif"" then modifies the color sequence based on its own associated rule.",-0.13405341919352937,124,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we will examine the relationship between each input with ""wif"" and its corresponding output.

1. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
2. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
3. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
4. Input: wif dax zup | Output: red green yellow
5. Input: wif dax lug walm | Output: red green blue blue blue

Based on the examples, ""wif"" consistently produces ""red"" as the first word in the output. Following ""wif,"" each additional word results in a specific color in the output:

- ""bluf"" results in an additional ""red.""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue.""
- ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- ""walm"" results in three ""reds.""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""wif"" generates the initial ""red"" and potentially instructs to process the following words to determine the rest of the output colors. The specific rule might be as follows:

- wif -> Start with red.
- Each word following ""wif"" is then replaced by a specific color depending on the word:
  - bluf -> red
  - lug -> blue
  - dax -> green
  - walm -> red red red (repeating ""red"" three times)

The given word ""wif"" seems to trigger the start of the color sequence, consistently leading off with ""red,"" followed by other colors determined by the succeeding words.

From the examples, we see that whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is a repeated color word. More specifically, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word that precedes it in each sequence:

"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the rule for the word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

In the first input-output pair (dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow), we cannot deduce much since it's the first instance we see these words and their matching colors.

In the second input-output pair (lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue), we see that 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow.' Therefore, since 'bluf' is also mapped to 'blue' with 'lug,' we might infer that 'bluf' could mean 'blue' or a rule that translates to the 'blue' output, but we need more evidence from other pairs.

In the third pair (zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red), we see 'zup' mapped to 'yellow' and 'wif' and 'walm' to 'red.' Without other colors to compare, 'bluf' is again mapped to 'yellow.' This seems to contradict the inference from the second pair if we assumed that 'bluf' directly means 'blue.'

In the fourth pair (zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue), we can confirm that 'lug' consistently corresponds to 'blue' and 'zup' to 'yellow.' 'Bluf' again returns a yellow result following 'zup,' which starts to suggest a pattern.

Finally, in the fifth pair (wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red), we identify that 'dax' is 'green' and 'wif' is 'red.' Interestingly, 'bluf' produces a 'red' output following 'wif,' which is different from the previous outputs of 'bluf.' 

Based on the evidence, we can notice that 'bluf' takes the color of the word that comes immediately before it. Here is the rule described below: 

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it in the sequence. If there is no word before it (it is the first word in the sequence), it takes on the color 'yellow'.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will analyze the position each instance of ""bluf"" is in within the input and the corresponding color in the output. I'll then determine if there's a pattern that relates ""bluf"" to a specific color or set of conditions.

- In the second example, ""bluf"" is the second word and corresponds again to the color ""yellow.""
- In the third example, again ""bluf"" is the second word and corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is the fourth word and corresponds again to the color ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is the fourth word and again corresponds to the color ""red.""

Looking at these examples, there does not seem to be a fixed position for ""bluf."" However, in four out of five examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The inconsistency occurs in the fifth example, where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" This inconsistency could suggest that the meaning of ""bluf"" may not be just a straightforward mapping to ""yellow,"" but there could be a different rule that can explain why ""bluf"" sometimes corresponds to ""red.""

One hypothesis can be that ""bluf"" carries the meaning of ""yellow,"" but it might turn to ""red"" if a certain condition is met in the sequence. One possibility is that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when the word ""wif"" is present before it. In the last example, ""wif"" appears three times before ""bluf,"" which is the only instance where ""bluf"" does not correspond to ""yellow.""

However, in the third example, ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" but ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""yellow."" This discrepancy rejects our hypothesis.

Upon closer inspection, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup,"" the condition that causes ""bluf"" to correspond to ""yellow"" takes priority over the condition where it would potentially correspond to ""red.""

With the given examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" except when it follows ""wif"" not followed by ""zup,"" in which case it corresponds to ""red.""

So:

bluf -> yellow (default)
bluf -> red (when preceded by ""wif"" and not followed by ""zup"")",-1.5211480440956522,124,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be consistent across all examples. Each time ""bluf"" is used, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> yellow",-1.732099435845653,124,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

""Walm"" appears in varying positions within the input sequences, and its output is not fixed—it changes based on context. One possible pattern is that when ""walm"" appears, the outputs thereafter repeat the color that was given for the word directly preceding ""walm."" 

Looking at the second example, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"", and after ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" with ""blue"" being the color corresponding to ""lug."" This pattern is consistent with the first input; ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""

In the third input, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"", and both outputs are ""yellow,"" with ""yellow"" being the color for ""zup."" In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and the colors after ""walm"" are repeated ""yellow."" Finally, the fifth input causes only ""yellow"" to be outputted following ""walm,"" and it follows ""zup.""

Based on the analysis, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it induces a repetition of the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it for the rest of the sequence, or until a new word possibly alters the pattern.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the output color that directly precedes ""walm"" is repeated for the subsequent outputs until the end of the sequence or until a new word possibly changes the pattern.",-0.06736197171414285,124,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs related to the occurrence of ""walm"" while considering the other inputs.

- When ""dax lug walm"" is input, the output is ""green blue blue blue"". The outputs for ""dax"" and ""lug"" seems to be ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively, and since ""walm"" is followed by three ""blues,"" it could suggest repetition of the color related to ""lug.""

- Looking at ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" the output is ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" Here, ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" again, while ""zup"" seems to lead to ""yellow"". ""Walm"" again follows ""lug"" and corresponds to repeated ""blue.""

- In the third input ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" the output ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"" occurs. Here, ""walm"" is followed by two additional ""yellow""s before ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" It indicates that ""walm"" is again related to the repetition of a color, and in this case, the color that precedes it.

- With the input ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" the output is ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" is at the end, following ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" there is a repetition of ""yellow.""

- Lastly, ""zup walm"" as an input yields ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output, showing that ""walm"" associates with repeating the color that precedes it.

Based on these observations, the rule linking ""walm"" to the outputs seems to be that ""walm"" signifies the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.",-0.0863636799416837,124,walm
"Analyzing the examples given and looking for patterns, here's what correlates with each instance of ""walm"":

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
2. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
3. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
4. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

Considering the pattern, ""walm"" is consistently associated with a sequence of ""blue."" It seems that ""walm"" results in multiple occurrences of the color ""blue."" However, the number of times ""blue"" appears is not consistent across examples based solely on the presence of ""walm."" It appears that either the context or the words preceding ""walm"" affect the number of ""blue"" outputs.

By examining the outputs before and after the ""walm"" term, we can see an association with the term ""lug,"" which consistently yields ""blue."" It can be inferred that ""lug"" directly translates to ""blue.""

Now, to determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to delve deeper into the context. Let's compare examples 1 and 2. The only difference between the two is that ""zup lug"" is added at the beginning and end in example 2, changing the pattern of blues at the end. Given that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" appears to replicate the color output of the word immediately before it—however, ""yellow"" is not repeated in example 5. Hence, this rule does not hold all the time.

Next, let's examine example 3, where ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow""—though there's not a ""blue"" in sight before or after ""lug."" Similarly, in example 4, ""zup walm"" yields three ""yellow"" outputs.

Based on these observations, a plausible rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the output color of the word that immediately precedes it. However, this duplication is bounded, as it does not repeat indefinitely. Also, the context seems relevant, as the number of duplications can change depending on the placement of ""walm"" within the sequence or the other words present.

So, the most consistent pattern observed is:
walm -> replicates the output color of the preceding word a variable number of times.",-0.11610309293674492,124,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the commonalities in the input and the corresponding output sequences.

1. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
2. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
3. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
4. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

Based on the given examples, we can attempt to figure out the patterns for each word except ""walm"":

- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red.""

Now, let's analyze ""walm"":

The only consistent rule when ""walm"" appears in the output is that it is always followed by the word corresponding to ""yellow."" However, ""walm"" does not have a consistent output color itself; instead, ""walm"" seems to cause repetition of the output color that would come next in the sequence if ""walm"" were not there.

Therefore, ""walm"" could signify a rule such as repeating the next color in the sequence a specific number of times. To be more specific, let's count:

In example 1, ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") and causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"") and causes ""yellow"" to be repeated two more times.
In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"") and causes ""yellow"" to be repeated two more times.
In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"") and causes ""yellow"" to be repeated two more times.

It appears that ""walm"" repeats the next color in the sequence two more times, except when the color is blue, where it repeats three times. However, this inconsistency could arise from the fact that ""blue"" is the only color used more than once in these contexts, which could indicate that the number of repetitions is related to the positioning of ""walm"" rather than the specific color that follows it.

To create a general rule for this limited dataset, we can hypothesize:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Induces the repetition of the color word that comes after it. If the next word is ""lug"" (blue), it repeats it three times, and for other colors, it repeats them two additional times.

However, without more examples showing ""walm"" surrounded by colors other than blue and yellow or not followed by any color word at all, we cannot confirm whether this rule applies solely to the context of these examples or is a more general rule.",-0.14444320294663263,124,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the output color for the nonce word ""walm"" depends on the preceding word. If we analyze the patterns:

- In the first input ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and produces three ""blue.""

- In the second input ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it once again results in three ""blue.""

- In the third input ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces three ""yellow.""

- In the fifth input ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in three ""yellow.""

- In the first input, ""dax walm lug"", ""walm"" is followed by one word (lug), thus there is one blue in the output after the sequence of greens.
- In the second input, ""dax lug walm"", ""walm"" is at the end with two words preceding it, and there are two blues in the output at the end.
- In the third input, ""lug walm"", ""walm"" is at the end with only one word preceding it, and there is one blue in the output at the end.

- In the fifth example, the appearance of ""walm"" corresponds with three 'red' outputs, showing a strong correlation with the color red.

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" may be associated with the output color 'red' since whenever ""walm"" appears, a pattern of multiple red outputs follows.

- zup lug -> yellow blue (one syllable after zup, one yellow followed by a new color)
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (walm is likely a special case that specifies repetition, hence three yellows)
- dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow (walm causes the preceding color to repeat)

"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" However, it's important also to note that ""zup"" seems to influence the number of ""yellow"" color words in the output. Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- ""lug"" on its own probably represents ""blue,"" but when prefixed with ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow blue."" This indicates ""zup"" adds a ""yellow"" to the output but does not replace ""lug.""
- ""walm"" leads to the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" in front of ""walm"" might mean to repeat the color ""yellow"" three times.
- In the third example, ""zup"" is at the end, after the word ""walm."" Since ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" the presence of ""zup"" afterwards suggests again that it adds a single ""yellow"" to the sequenced colors.
- ""bluf"" ending up as ""yellow yellow"" suggests that ""bluf"" means double of a color; since the output does not have ""blue,"" we can hypothesize that ""zup"" modifies ""bluf"" to express ""yellow"" twice.
- The repetition of ""zup lug"" yielding ""yellow blue"" confirms the consistent use of ""zup"" leading to an added ""yellow.""

"Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". The number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output corresponds to the number of syllables in the second word of the input. ""Lug"" has one syllable, thus ""zup lug"" leads to ""yellow blue"". ""Walm"" has one syllable, repeated three times for some idiosyncratic reason in this context, leading to ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Bluf"" has one syllable, so ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".

Thus, the rule is: zup -> ""yellow"" repeated for the number of syllables in the following word (not consistently applied in these samples due to the peculiar repetition of ""walm"").",-1.0417089081594202,126,zup
"Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and it precedes a color descriptor that determines how many times ""yellow"" is said or a specific color to follow. ""Lug"" means ""blue,"" ""walm"" means ""yellow yellow yellow"" (thus ""zup walm"" is ""yellow"" followed by ""yellow yellow yellow""), ""bluf"" stands for ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" likely means ""green.""

So the general rule for ""zup"" in this context seems to be: 

zup -> yellow (as a prefix to other color descriptors or quantities)",-1.0669469749420293,126,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the consistency of the word associations in the given examples.

In the first example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red."" Since ""lug"" appears again in the third example as ""blue,"" it's reasonable to assume that ""lug"" means ""blue."" Now ""wif"" appears twice in the examples: in the first and last, and in both instances, it is associated with ""red."" The repetition of ""wif"" and ""red"" suggests that ""wif"" is likely to mean ""red.""

Now, looking at ""bluf,"" we must determine its role by comparing examples where it's present:

In the first example, it seems to correspond to the last ""red,"" but we need more information to confirm this.

In the second example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Because the output is two yellows without a ""wif"" to correspond to red, we can infer that ""zup"" likely means ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" in this context seems to correspond to the repetition of that color, indicating a duplicating effect.

In the third example, ""lug bluf dax lug"" becomes ""blue blue green blue."" Since ""lug"" is confirmed to mean ""blue,"" the double ""blue"" suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""repeat the previous color."" However, ""dax"" introduces ""green,"" which doesn't seem to follow the same rule. Still, ""dax"" only occurs once, and thus it is impossible to reliably infer its meaning from this example alone.

In the fourth example, we see ""zup bluf"" again, resulting in ""yellow yellow,"" reinforcing the rule suggested by the second example where ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the previous color.

In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red."" If ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" we're introduced to a new word, ""walm,"" which would correspond to the repeated ""blue."" Since the example ends with ""bluf"" leading to a double ""red,"" it strengthens the idea that ""bluf"" means to repeat the preceding color again.

Based on the analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the previous color.",-0.11265082084830984,126,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of the color word that precedes it when there is one, and repeats it. When there is no color word preceding ""bluf"", it defaults to yellow. This can be deduced from the following analysis:

1. ""lug wif bluf"" leads to ""blue red red"" which suggests that ""bluf"" here means ""red"", the color word that comes before it.
2. ""zup bluf"" on two occasions leads to ""yellow yellow"", showing that without a preceding color word, ""bluf"" means ""yellow"".
3. ""lug bluf dax lug"" results in ""blue blue green blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" here means ""blue"", the preceding color word.
4. ""lug walm wif bluf"" turns into ""blue blue blue red red"", indicating that ""bluf"" takes the meaning of ""red"", the color immediately preceding it.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> If a color word precedes ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" means the same as that color word. If no color word precedes ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" means yellow.",-0.25470465795633795,126,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following patterns for the nonce word 'bluf':

- When 'bluf' appears after 'lug', the output is 'blue'
- When 'bluf' appears after 'zup', the output is 'yellow'
  
Given these patterns, it seems that 'bluf' transforms into a color word, but the specific color it represents is dependent on the word that precedes it. Here are the specific rules we can deduce:

- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'

So, when 'bluf' follows 'lug', it repeats the color that 'lug' maps to (blue, repeated). Similarly, when it comes after 'zup', it repeats the color 'zup' represents (yellow, repeated). The rules also suggest that the colors can combine, such as in the input ""lug walm wif bluf"" where 'walm' presumably causes a repetition of the preceding color before 'bluf' takes effect.

"Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the output pattern of colors is directly related to the input sequence of nonce words. Specifically focusing on the word ""walm,"" we look for a consistent pattern in its appearances and the corresponding output colors. We can notice that every time ""walm"" is mentioned, a sequence of ""green"" appears in the output with a specific number of green mentions. This number seems to be determined by the position of ""walm"" within the sequence of input words — the next green output appears until another word follows ""walm.""

Let's analyze the examples to confirm this rule:

1. Input: zup dax walm - Output: yellow green green green.
   When ""walm"" appears after two words, there are three greens following.

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug - Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue.
   Here, ""walm"" appears after four words, and only one green follows before ""dax"" occurs.

3. Input: dax zup walm wif walm - Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red.
   ""Walm"" first appears after two words and yields three yellows after which ""wif"" interrupts. ""Walm"" appears again but since it's the final word, reds follow indefinitely.

4. Input: lug walm - Output: blue blue blue.
   After one word we have two blue outputs.

5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif - Output: blue green yellow green green green red.
   ""Walm"" is preceded by four words and followed by one red after which ""wif"" comes into play.

From the analysis, it seems that ""walm"" generates a sequence of green in the output corresponding to the number of words that preceded ""walm"" in the input, plus one. This rule breaks only when ""walm"" is the last word in the input, in which case the color sequence continues according to the last mentioned color related to a word (wif -> red), and this color repeats indefinitely.

Based on this induction, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it results in a sequence of the color green in the output. The number of times ""green"" appears is one more than the count of preceding words before ""walm"" in the input sequence, unless ""walm"" is the last word, then the last mentioned color repeats indefinitely.

"walm -> repetition. Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times. Here are the details:

- ""zup dax walm"" yields ""yellow green green green,"" where ""green"" is repeated three times following ""dax.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue,"" with ""blue"" repeated three times after ""lug"" before ""walm.""

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so ""walm"" means green repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" again follows ""dax,"" which is green, so ""walm"" means green repeated twice since the sequence is interrupted by another ""lug"" (blue).
- In the third example, ""walm"" is after ""zup"" (yellow) and before ""wif"" (red). Each ""walm"" produces a repetition of the preceding color, first yellow, then red.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), so it means blue repeated twice.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is after ""dax"" (green) so it results in green repeated twice and it's followed by ""wif"" which is red.

In this string, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""wif"" is ""red"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and outputs ""red"", followed by another ""zup"" which is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"".

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The sequence ""wif dax"" outputs ""red green"", then another ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red"", and another ""dax"" is ""green"". Following the last ""dax"" we have ""bluf"" which again outputs ""green"".

Based on all these examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" outputs the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the word that precedes it in the sequence.",-0.08164828839541936,127,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the position of ""bluf"" and the word it translates to in the output.

1. Input: zup bluf lug | Output: yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax | Output: green green red yellow green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

3. Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""

4. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug | Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

5. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf | Output: red green yellow red green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""

From these examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" does not translate to a fixed word. Rather, it seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. In each case, the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color for the word before it:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- In examples 2, 3, and 5, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" so ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" so ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Using this analysis, we can derive the rule:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""bluf"" in the output.",-0.08691594632422904,127,bluf
"bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color green, based on the provided input-output pairs.",-1.5979165535284952,127,bluf
"Rule: bluf means ""green"".",-1.6187976332860219,127,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, let's analyze the patterns associated with the nonce word ""walm"".

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

The word ""lug"" always results in the color blue immediately following it, and ""wif"" results in red, while ""dax"" results in green, and ""zup"" in yellow. Given the fact that the color blue follows after ""walm"" in all instances but is not exclusively tied to the word ""lug"", it seems that ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color given by the previous word in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for walm seems to be that it repeats the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word",-0.06663625636836734,127,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine its occurrence in each of the examples given:

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif  
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red  

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

3. Input: zup wif walm lug  
   Output: yellow red red red blue

4. Input: dax lug walm  
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: lug walm dax  
   Output: blue blue blue green

Looking at the outputs associated with each instance of ""walm,"" we can discern a pattern. In each case, the color ""blue"" appears immediately after ""walm."" Every other nonce word seems to correspond to a color as well, and the position of ""walm"" doesn't affect its output color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" or ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

The output color changes after ""walm"" is mentioned, in most cases corresponding directly to the next nonce word. However, when ""walm"" is the penultimate word followed by another nonce word (as is the case in both the fourth and fifth examples), the output color for ""walm"" is not the color expected for the following nonce word but instead is ""blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" regardless of position or surrounding words.

Rule: walm -> blue",-0.0756861588623469,127,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is related to the sequence of colors in the output. To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the context in each input where it appears and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - Right before and after ""walm"" are the words ""wif"" (which corresponds to red) and ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue). ""Walm"" is followed by the color blue, but it's not clear yet what rule ""walm"" follows.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - Here, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) and is followed by ""lug"" (blue) and the color sequence has blue immediately after ""walm.""

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - Again, ""walm"" is succeeded by ""lug"" and is followed by the color blue in the sequence.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - Here, ""walm"" is at the end, preceded by ""lug"" (blue), and all the following colors are blue.

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""Walm"" is in the middle, sandwiched between ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green), with the output showing blue before ""walm"" and blue continuing after it until a different word appears.

From the patterns above, a potential rule for ""walm"" can be deduced. ""Walm"" seems to result in the color blue continuing in the output until a different color is necessitated by a subsequent word. Therefore, ""walm"" itself corresponds to continuing the previous color's output until a different color word is encountered in the input. 

Rule: walm -> continue the previous color in the output until a different non-walm word requiring a color change follows.",-0.08042335322097957,127,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns related to the word ""walm"" and its corresponding outputs in each example. Here are the observations:

1. In example 1, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" the output is ""red red green green red red red blue red."" The word ""walm"" is followed by a ""lug,"" and the color changes from ""red"" to ""blue."" However, ""lug"" alone corresponds to ""blue"" in other places, so this change is likely not due to ""walm.""

2. In example 2, ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" The sequence contains three instances of ""yellow,"" followed by one instance of ""walm."" It's not clear yet what ""walm"" does, but after it and ""lug,"" the color changes to ""blue.""

3. In example 3, ""zup wif walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red red red blue."" ""Walm"" is again before ""lug,"" and the color again changes to ""blue"" afterwards.

4. In example 4, ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" There is no color repetition this time, but ""walm"" is again followed by consecutive ""blue.""

5. Finally, in example 5, ""lug walm dax,"" the output is ""blue blue blue green."" Like before, ""walm"" precedes a repetition of ""blue.""

From these observations, we see that ""walm"" is consistently followed by a ""blue"" output, with repetitions when the preceding or following words would also correspond to ""blue.""

Considering this, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" might be that it transforms the word after it into a repetition of the color blue, regardless of what color that word would actually represent on its own. If the following word already corresponds to ""blue,"" then ""walm"" maintains that output color.

Rule: walm -> causes the color blue to repeat or to be outputted next, irrespective of what color would naturally follow.",-0.09753180682336737,127,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples.

Example 1:
Input: wef bluf dax bluf wef walm lug wef
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Example 2:
Input: zup walm lug wef bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Example 3:
Input: zup wef walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Example 4:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Example 5:
Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Let's break down the examples to find patterns:

- When the input has ""walm lug,"" the output color sequence always includes ""blue blue."" This points to ""walm lug"" possibly translating to a pair of ""blue"" colors.
- In Example 2, ""walm lug wef bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue red,"" so ""walm lug"" here yields ""yellow yellow blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may also have an influence on the preceding word.
- However, in Example 5 ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green,"" which shows that ""walm"" following ""lug"" does not change the color associated with ""lug"" (which is ""blue"") but does alter the color associated with the following word ""dax"" (which usually is ""green"").

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to affect the color associated with the word that comes after it, causing it to repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm."" With this in mind, let's paraphrase:

Thus:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll look at each context where the word appears and try to extract patterns associated with the output colors.

From the first two examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to result in a ""green"" output when it follows the word ""dax"" (which itself results in a ""green"" output in every instance):

- dax bluf wif -> green green red
- dax lug bluf -> green blue blue

In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and both yield a ""blue"" output:

- lug bluf wif -> blue blue red

From the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears at the end of a sequence with various colors before it and results in a ""red"":

- wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red

Lastly, in the fifth instance, ""bluf"" again follows the word ""dax,"" producing a ""green"" output:

- wif dax bluf -> red green green

Given these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word just before it:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, it results in green.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, it results in blue.
- The forth example may be seen as an anomaly since it does not follow a single color output, but the sequence may have another rule affecting it (such as ""zup"" changing the pattern), or it could be that ""bluf"" defaults to red at the end of a sequence. 
- However, since the primary consistent rule in the first three examples and the fifth is that ""bluf"" copies the color of the word before it, we will follow that rule.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",-0.09845896308535806,128,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following rules for the colors corresponding to the words:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

Now, let's try to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" based on these rules:

1. ""dax bluf wif"" -> green green red
2. ""dax lug bluf"" -> green blue blue
3. ""lug bluf wif"" -> blue blue red
4. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> red green red red yellow red
5. ""wif dax bluf"" -> red green green

Looking at the first and fifth examples:
- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and the output is green, which is the same as the color for ""dax"". 
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" as well, and again the output is green.

In the second and third examples:
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", and the output is blue, which is the same as ""lug"".
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" again, and the output is again blue.

In the fourth example:
- ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and the output is red, which matches the color for ""wif"".

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Therefore, the meaning attributed to ""bluf"" in the examples given is:

bluf -> The color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf"".",-0.14500786338536426,128,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the input and output pairs.

- For the first input ""dax bluf wif,"" the ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""bluf"" corresponds to green, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

- In the second input ""dax lug bluf,"" ""dax"" is green again, ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" is blue.

- For ""lug bluf wif,"" ""lug"" is blue, ""bluf"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red.

- The fourth example ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" translates to red, green, red, red, yellow, red; this tells us ""zup"" is yellow and ""bluf"" is red in this context.

- Finally, in ""wif dax bluf,"" we have ""wif"" as red, ""dax"" as green, and ""bluf"" as green.

From these examples, it seems ""bluf"" does not have a fixed meaning; instead, its output color can vary: it corresponds to green in some contexts and blue or red in others. To deduce the rule for ""bluf,"" we must determine the pattern that dictates its color.

Looking at the context:

- In each instance where ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is green. Thus, it seems ""bluf"" inherits its color from ""dax,"" which is green.
- In contexts where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" directly, the output color is blue, similar to ""lug.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or precedes ""zup,"" the output color is red, which matches ""wif.""

The pattern appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it unless it precedes ""zup,"" in which case it is red. Therefore:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the immediately preceding word, except when it comes right before ""zup,"" where it always becomes red.",-0.2309357871689999,128,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be tied to the color associated with the word that precedes it. The color sequence for each word seems consistent throughout the examples:

- ""dax"" consistently correlates to the output ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently correlates to the output ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently correlates to the output ""red.""

When ""bluf"" follows these words, the output color for ""bluf"" matches the color of the word before it:

- When ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

The rule is that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word in the sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern for the word ""bluf"":

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears before ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is green.
2. Whenever ""lug"" appears before ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is blue.
3. Whenever ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is red.

Thus, it appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word that immediately precedes it. The word before ""bluf"" determines its color in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the term ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the word just before it three times. Taking each example in turn:

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times.

Input: dax walm

The word before ""walm"" is once again ""dax"" = ""green,"" so ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. The presence of ""walm"" in the input always leads to a repetition of the color word that precedes it in the output.
2. The number of times the color word is repeated corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned.

Let's apply this observation to each example:

- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", meaning ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green"", where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.
- ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"", where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" makes ""red"" appear three times.
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""green red yellow yellow red red red"", where each color word corresponds to a color (""dax"" to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow""), but only ""wif red"" is repeated three times following ""walm"", even though other colors are present between the second ""wif"" and ""walm"".

- ""lug dax walm"" outputs ""blue green green green"" which suggests ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) four times (one more than the two words before ""walm"").
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"" which again has ""walm"" repeat the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times (one more than the one word before ""walm"").
- ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red"" so ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red) four times (one more than the two words before ""walm"").
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""green red yellow yellow red red red"", where ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red) four times (one more than the four words before ""walm"").

So the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

"walm -> repeated coloration of the previous color. Rule: If ""walm"" follows a color word (or a word that is associated with a color), the output repeats that color word three times. 

For example:
- ""wif walm"" gives ""red red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with red.
- ""lug dax walm"" gives ""blue green green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" follows, repeating ""green"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" simply gives ""green green green"" as ""dax"" is associated with green and is repeated three times due to ""walm.""
- ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with red and is repeated three times after ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow.
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" yields ""green red yellow yellow red red red"" whereby each color word, when followed by ""walm,"" is repeated three times. Only ""bluf,"" which is not followed by ""walm,"" remains unaffected and is not repeated.",-0.15460440458469132,128,walm

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns and correlations in the examples provided between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
2. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
3. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red green green red""
4. ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red""
5. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""

Analyzing the inputs and corresponding outputs, we observe the following:

- Every time ""bluf"" appears, the immediate output is ""green.""
- The output preceding ""green"" is always identical to the one following the first word before ""bluf."" For example:
  - In Input 1, ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" (the color corresponding to ""dax"").
  - In Input 2, ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" (the color corresponding to ""lug"").
  - In Input 4, ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" (the color corresponding to ""lug"").

Given these observations, we can discern the following rule:

Rule: The output for ""bluf"" is ""green,"" followed by the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Therefore:

bluf -> ""green"" followed by the color corresponding to the previous word.",-0.14953410780238757,129,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the association between the inputs and outputs. We can see that ""bluf"" appears in various contexts, but with consistent output.

1. In the first example, ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green."" Since ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green"" consistently in other examples, we can reasonably infer that ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"" in this context. 

2. The second example, ""lug bluf,"" translates to ""blue blue."" Given that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in other examples, it's reasonable to infer that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" in this instance.

3. In the third example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif,"" translating to ""yellow blue red green green red,"" and knowing the consistent translations of ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""bluf"" maintains the translation of ""green"" in this context since it follows ""dax.""

4. The fourth example, ""dax lug bluf wif,"" which translates to ""green blue blue red,"" supports that ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and therefore ""bluf"" must be ""blue"" here, as it directly follows ""lug.""

5. The final example is identical to the first and corroborates the previous findings.

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color translation of the word that immediately precedes it. If ""bluf"" directly follows a word that translates to a color, it takes on that same color translation.

In each case, ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word before it. ""Bluf"" seems to act as an instruction to repeat the color of the preceding word.

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine each example and its corresponding output.

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

In the first two examples, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green."" In the fifth example, ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red."" The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" and in the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when it comes before ""walm,"" which is different from the third example where ""wif"" comes after ""walm"" and still corresponds to ""red.""

In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" both times it appears. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the fourth example, where ""walm"" is at the end and the output ends with ""blue blue blue.""

Looking at the varying positions of ""walm,"" we can attempt to generalize a rule. In each case, the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word. Moreover, there are three repetitions of that color. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to indicate ""repeat the color of the preceding word three times.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding nonce word three times.",-0.11457250237333334,129,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to repetition of the previous color word in the output. Each example demonstrates that when ""walm"" is present in the input, the color that is immediately prior to ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.

Let's break down each example to validate this:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   The color ""green"" appears three times after ""dax,"" which precedes ""walm.""

2. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   The color ""green"" follows ""dax"" and is repeated three times as per the rule of ""walm.""

3. Input: wif lug walm

4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   The color ""red"" follows ""wif"" and is repeated three times after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Triggers the repetition of the previous color word three times in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be described as:

Rule: When ""walm"" is used in an input sequence, the color word immediately before ""walm"" in the sequence will be repeated three times in the output sequence.",-0.20551910523205125,129,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repeated output of the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before it. Each instance where ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the preceding word. For example, when ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".

Let's examine the output for each case where ""walm"" appears:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
2. ""zup dax walm"" -> ""yellow green green green""
3. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
4. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""

The pattern is that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times in a row.

5. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow

In each of these examples, every time ""bluf"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is outputted immediately after, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input string. However, when ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""dax,"" the output color is ""blue"" instead of ""yellow"" which follows it. If we assume that ""bluf"" affects the color output immediately following it, we can construct a rule.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is followed by any word other than ""dax,"" the output color is ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output color is ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:

"Based on the examples provided, we can look for patterns to determine the meaning of the word ""bluf.""

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" both times.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" again.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" appears once following a ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and in this sequence, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears twice. In the first instance, it follows ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and is itself ""blue""; in the second instance, it follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned immediately before it. If no color precedes ""bluf,"" then it defaults to yellow. There is a direct color relationship between ""bluf"" and the preceding word:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow (This is also deduced from instances where ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow."")

Putting this together:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that precedes it. If no color word precedes it, then ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow.

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the preceding word, or if there is no color before it or it's the start of the sequence, use yellow.""",-0.7749412597940593,130,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first observe the patterns in the given input and outputs. As we know neither the other terms (zup, dax, lug, wif) nor ""bluf"" are standard words with common meanings, we should look for consistencies in their translation to color names.

1. In all examples where ""bluf"" appears, it translates to ""blue"" at least once.
2. ""Bluf"" does not always translate into the same color, which suggests that its meaning may vary depending on its position or the words around it.
3. It does not appear that ""bluf"" is dependent on the words that come before it since the word before it changes but sometimes still results in ""blue.""
4. It seems that ""bluf"" tends to result in ""blue"" when it appears at the end of an input sequence or just before a word that has been consistently translated into ""yellow"" (zup).
5. When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" or ""lug,"" which translate to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively, it translates to ""red"" which could indicate a pattern where ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word if that color isn't ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, here is the possible rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" unless it directly follows a word that translates to ""red"" or ""blue,"" in which case it takes that color. If it follows a word that translates to ""yellow,"" it remains ""yellow.""

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" might be:

- After ""lug"" or ""wif,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

bluf -> meaning. If ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or ""dax,"" then it means ""yellow."" If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif,"" then it means ""blue.""

- ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue"", so ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""dax walm"" within ""dax walm wif dax"" gives us ""green green green"" before ""wif dax"", indicating that ""dax"" is associated with green.
- ""lug dax walm"" provides ""blue green green green"", again showing that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word directly before it (""dax"" in this case) to be repeated three times.

"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to discern the rule or pattern that dictates what ""dax"" means within the context of the inputs and outputs.

In each sequence with ""dax,"" the output is invariably green. However, ""dax"" does not appear to have a fixed position within those sequences (it can appear at the beginning, middle, or end), and the words that follow it do not consistently yield the same output color. This suggests that ""dax"" itself corresponds directly to the color green, rather than being dependent on its position or on surrounding words.

Here are the deductions from the input/output examples:

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" corresponds to the first green.

Input: zup dax lug zup
Output: yellow green blue yellow
- Here, ""dax"" again corresponds to green, which is not influenced by either ""zup"" or ""lug"".

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- Once more, ""dax"" yields a green output.

Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
- ""dax"" precedes the last two colors but still outputs green.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- Although ""dax"" is not the last word in this sequence, it still results in a green output, and the words after it have different colors from each other.

2. Other words ('walm', 'zup', 'lug', 'wif', and 'bluf') consistently lead to other colors ('red', 'yellow', 'blue', and so on), irrespective of the presence of 'dax'.

"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf"" by examining its consistent impact on the output. Let's take a closer look at each input and its corresponding output.

- In the first example, when ""wif bluf"" is given, the output is ""red red"". Since ""wif"" on its own outputs ""red"" in other examples, the addition of ""bluf"" did not change the color associated with ""wif"".

- In the second example, ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"", the presence of ""bluf"" follows a ""dax wif"" and precedes a ""zup"", yielding ""red green red red yellow red"". Again, we see that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to an output of ""red"", which aligns with the output for ""wif"".

- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"", we get ""red red green green green"". The output corresponding to ""bluf"" is ""red"", consistent with the output for ""wif"". 

- In the fourth example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"", the output is ""yellow blue red green green red"". The ""bluf"" here is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif"". It corresponds with an output of ""green"", the same as ""dax"".

- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf wif"", the output is ""green green red"". ""Bluf"" is in between ""dax"" and ""wif"" and the output corresponding to ""bluf"" is ""green"", which is the same output as for ""dax"".

Taking the above into account, it seems like ""bluf"" may take the color of the preceding word, if that word has an associated color. Looking at all the instances where ""bluf"" is placed after ""wif"", it takes on the color ""red"". When placed after ""dax"", it takes on the color ""green"". We do not have instances where ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" or ""lug"" for further comparison, but based on the available data, the tentative rule could be:

**Rule: ""bluf"" reflects the output color of the word right before it.**

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Takes on the output color of the preceding word (if the preceding word has an associated output color).",-0.1033053656204782,131,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each example and take into account the position of the word ""bluf"" and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
2. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> Output: red green red red yellow red
3. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
4. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red
5. Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red

If we analyze the sequences, we notice that the word ""bluf"" is always followed by the color word ""red"" in the output regardless of the words that come before it. However, the word before ""bluf"" also has an impact on the color word that directly follows the preceding color word.

We can observe:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output color word is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output color word is ""green.""
- ""Bluf"" does not appear to immediately influence subsequent non-color words in the output (""walm,"" ""zup""), but it does determine the color word ""red"" succeeding itself.
- The word that precedes ""bluf"" does not change after ""bluf"" is used; it remains ""green"" after ""dax"" and ""red"" after ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it directly translates to ""red"" in the output, and it does not change the color that is associated with the word just before it.

Rule: bluf -> always followed by ""red"" in the output; the preceding word dictates the color before ""red"" and remains consistent even after the introduction of ""bluf.""",-0.11237431625913046,131,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by examining the corresponding outputs and looking for patterns. Here is the analysis:

- In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the output includes a sequence of ""red green"" (with the exception of ""walm"" transforming to ""green"" subsequently), suggesting that the word ""bluf"" might translate to ""red green"" under certain conditions.

  - Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red green
  - Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> Output: red green red red green yellow red
  - Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
  - Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red
  - Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red red

Using these observations, we can propose the following rule for the word ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red green"" when following the word ""wif"". However, it should be noted that ""wif"" itself translates to ""red"", so when ""bluf"" is directly after ""wif"", the output is ""red red green"". If ""bluf"" does not immediately follow ""wif"", it seems to translate directly to ""green green"".

So the induction for ""bluf"" might be:

bluf -> meaning:
- When immediately following ""wif"", ""bluf"" means ""red green"".
- When not immediately following ""wif"", ""bluf"" translates to ""green green"".",-0.3073039679254891,131,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds with the color ""red"" consistently in the outputs. However, there is also a pattern in regard to the word preceding ""bluf"" which affects the output. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is always ""red red."" But when ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" outputs a ""green"" instead.

To condense this into a rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output will be ""red red."" If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the word ""bluf"" is then translated to ""green"" in the output sequence.",-1.382266108242391,131,bluf
"Based on the presented examples, the word ""bluf"" translates into ""red"" whenever it appears. However, it's important to note that its translation might also depend on the context of the adjacent words. For instance, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" or ""wif"" the color green also appears in the output. Nonetheless, there is no direct evidence to associate ""bluf"" with the color green in such a way that is independent from the presence of ""dax"" or ""wif"". Therefore, with the limited information provided, the safest rule to induce is the direct translation of ""bluf"" to ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red",-1.4479370808282608,131,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" is correlated with repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Here are the associations shown in the inputs and outputs:

- ""zup wif walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, so ""walm"" repeats red three times.
- ""zup walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats yellow three times.
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"": ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow. ""walm"" after ""dax"" and ""wif"" repeats the associated colors three times each.
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow, three times.
- ""wif walm"": ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" repeats red three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word three times.",-0.3891482395854118,131,walm
"Based on the given input-output pairs, we can deduce the following:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"".
2. ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red red red"".
3. ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green green green"".
4. ""lug"" alone corresponds to the output ""blue"".
5. ""bluf"" has not been used without ""lug"", but ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red"", suggesting that ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red red"".

Each time ""walm"" is used in an input, the output consists of multiple occurrences of a single color. The number of occurrences of the color seems to be equal to the number of syllables in the corresponding word. For instance:

- ""zup wif walm"" results in one ""yellow"" (from ""zup"") followed by ""red red red"" (triple ""red"" from ""wif"") and ""walm"" is followed by the same color as the word immediately preceding it. Here, ""walm"" alone would mean yellow since it follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" with ""walm"" repeating the color yellow, which corresponds to the word ""zup"" that immediately precedes it.
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green"" from ""dax"", followed by ""red red red"" from ""wif"", and it seems that ""walm"" takes the color from the preceding word and repeats it three times (three times green, then three times red).
- ""wif walm"" simply leads to ""red red red"" which is the output for ""wif"", and since ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it repeats the color red three times.

Based on these observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it and repeats that color three times in the output.

Therefore, we can write:

walm -> meaning: The meaning of ""walm"" seems to be a repeater of the color output of the word that precedes it, repeating that color three times.",-0.45394597304976475,131,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems associated with a repetition of a color. The color repeated corresponds to the word preceding ""walm."" Here is the breakdown:

- In Example 1, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" is connected to repeating the color ""red"" associated with ""wif.""
- In Example 2, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it repeats the color ""yellow.""
- In Example 3, ""walm wif walm"" leads to ""green green green red red red,"" where the first ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" associated with ""dax,"" and the second ""walm"" repeats ""red"" associated with ""wif.""
- In Example 4, ""zup walm"" once again yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" consistent with the pattern.
- Finally, in Example 5, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" further supporting the consistency of the pattern.

Rule: The word ""walm"" when placed after another word indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times.

Therefore, walm -> meaning. Meaning: a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Input: dax lug bluf

- Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow.

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
- ""bluf"" corresponds to red.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow.

Looking at all the outputs, the color that corresponds to ""bluf"" is not consistent and changes based on another factor. However, a noticeable pattern is that ""bluf"" appears to take the same color as the word that immediately precedes it:

- When preceded by ""wif"", ""bluf"" is red.
- When preceded by ""zup"", ""bluf"" is yellow.
- When followed by ""lug"", it takes the color blue, potentially influenced by ""lug"" since ""lug"" is blue in other combinations.

It's important to note that the rule derived here is based on the limited examples provided, and without additional examples, we can only hypothesize that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word (or potentially the following word when ""lug"" follows ""bluf"").

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the word immediately preceding it. If it is followed by ""lug"", it might take the color blue.",-0.08679306473752504,132,bluf

2. ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and results in ""blue.""
3. ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and results in ""yellow.""

This suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it. Thus, we can conclude that:

Focusing on the word ""bluf"" and the color that follows it, a pattern emerges:

- In the first example, after ""bluf"" comes ""dax"" which is translated to ""green"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by no other word, and the next color is ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", translating the subsequent word to ""blue"" again.
- In the fourth example, like the first, ""lug"" follows ""bluf"", resulting in the color ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" stands alone and the color repeated is ""yellow"".

It appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color red, but also affects the color of the word that immediately follows it:

- When ""bluf"" is followed by another word, the next word translates to ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" is not followed by another word, the color that it translates to is repeated (as seen in the fifth example).

1. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   - Here, bluf is followed by dax and preceded by zup, and it outputs blue after green. It is also followed by lug which does not seem to affect its output.

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - Here, bluf is preceded by wif and it outputs red.

Rule: bluf repeats the color output of the word before it. Hence, if the previous word's corresponding color is yellow, bluf will also result in yellow. If the previous word's color is red, then bluf will also result in red, and so on.

So, bluf -> Repeats the color of the previous word.",-0.09232647033772289,133,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns surrounding its use in the examples provided:

1. In the first example, ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" It is clear that ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow and is followed by ""dax"" which is green. ""Bluf"" is seemingly associated with the color blue, as ""lug"" is not part of the pattern and the first instance of ""bluf"" translates to blue in the output.

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" In this instance, ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the preceding word ""wif,"" which is red.

3. In the third example, ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green."" Here, ""bluf"" takes the same color as the previous word ""dax,"" which is green.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green."" Again, ""bluf"" is the same color as the word before it, ""dax,"" which is green.

5. In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" Here, ""bluf"" takes the color red, following ""wif."" The word after ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which is green, and ""walm"" has no translation here but seems to continue the pattern as if it were ""dax"" following ""bluf.""

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. Thus, the rule seems to be:
Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-0.09299983079301208,133,bluf
"From the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color or item that precedes it. This is consistent across all provided examples. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it replicates or doubles the color or item it follows.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the previous color/item.

Examples to illustrate the rule:
- In ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively. Hence, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" after ""zup"" and ""blue"" after ""lug.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" so ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also results in ""green.""
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which results in ""red,"" and ""walm"" is after ""dax"" repeating ""green.""",-0.33046247365367476,133,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can see that the occurrence of the word ""bluf"" consistently results in the output color being repeated. Each ""bluf"" is followed by a color, and that color is the same as the one that would be produced by the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Here are the observations:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf dax"" outputs ""blue blue green,"" and ""lug"" would output ""blue"" based on other examples.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red,"" and ""wif"" output is ""red"" when it is not followed by ""bluf.""
- The third example, ""zup dax bluf,"" the output is ""yellow green green,"" and ""dax"" would output ""green"" without ""bluf.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green,"" reflecting the same rule that the word before ""bluf"" sets the color.
- Finally, in the fifth example ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green"", again showing that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the preceding color.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

bluf -> causes the color of the word immediately before it to be repeated.",-0.428655979436024,133,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, it's replaced by the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. For example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow."" Similarly, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""",-1.203870782827711,133,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs:

1. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
2. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
3. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

Now, observing the pattern, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color that comes just before it the same number of times as has been repeated before plus one, and following ""walm"" by yellow. 

Here's how it works:

1. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> the pattern before ""walm"" is ""red blue yellow,"" and we see that yellow is repeated twice before ""walm."" Afterwards, we have three yellows. Finally, the sequence red blue follows, as it did in the beginning.
   
2. dax walm zup -> ""green"" is repeated twice before ""walm,"" so after ""walm"" it is repeated three times, followed by yellow.

3. wif walm zup -> ""red"" is repeated twice before ""walm,"" so it is repeated three times after ""walm,"" followed by yellow.

4. zup walm -> the pattern before ""walm"" has ""yellow"" once, so after ""walm"" it is repeated twice, consistent in the following example as well.

Therefore, ""walm"" in these examples indicates that the color immediately preceding it should be repeated an additional time plus one compared to the number of times it has been already repeated before adding a yellow at the end.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the previous color once more than its prior sequence before ""walm,"" and ends with yellow.",-0.09747820245700001,133,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, we notice that the output changes based on the presence of the nonce word ""walm."" By examining the pattern, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with ""walm.""

In the first example, the presence of ""walm"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color that comes just before it. However, in the other examples, the presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that would have been produced by the preceding word.

Let's break it down:

1. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
2. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow""
3. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""
4. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

In every output, the color that is repeated corresponds to the color that was assigned to the word immediately before ""walm."" This suggests that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to repeat for every occurrence of ""walm."" Additionally, the sequence always ends with ""yellow,"" which is the color correlated with ""zup.""

Based on this analysis, the rule associated with ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output color of the preceding word to repeat, until a new word presents a different color (in this case ""zup"" which leads to ""yellow"").

Therefore:

walm -> causes repetition of the preceding word's output color.",-0.145845068851375,133,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to function as a modifier that changes the preceding word's corresponding output to a series of that output color. In the given inputs and outputs, each non-walm word appears to correspond to a particular color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow

When the word ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. The length of repetition for ""walm"" appears to match the total number of words in the input sequence up to and including ""walm"":

1. Input: ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". 
   - The ""walm"" after ""zup"" changed the output for ""zup"" to three yellows, which is the total number of words before it plus one (wif lug zup walm).

2. Input: ""dax walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow"".
   - The ""walm"" after ""dax"" changed the output for ""dax"" to three greens.

3. Input: ""wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow"".
   - The ""walm"" after ""wif"" changed the output for ""wif"" to three reds.

4. The last two inputs ""zup walm"" both translate to ""yellow yellow yellow"", showing consistency in the output when the pattern is followed.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output associated with the immediately preceding word for the count of total words up to and including ""walm"" in the sequence.

Example application: If we had an input ""lug walm wif"", we would expect the output to be ""blue blue blue red"", indicating ""lug walm"" translates to three blues followed by the usual color for ""wif"" which is red.",-0.1799106100866625,133,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to correspond with the repetition of the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. Here's how we can come to this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" the output ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"" shows that walm follows zup (which corresponds to yellow) and the output repeats yellow three times after walm.
  
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup,"" the output ""green green green yellow"" indicates that walm follows dax (which corresponds to green) and the output repeats green twice after walm followed by yellow corresponding to zup.
  
- In the third example, ""wif walm zup,"" the output ""red red red yellow"" demonstrates that walm repeats the color red (corresponding to wif) twice after walm.
  
- The fourth and fifth examples, ""zup walm,"" both result in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that walm repeats the color yellow (corresponding to zup) twice after walm.

In the first example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which doesn't have a direct color association in the output (as it is not repeated), but ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""yellow.""

In the second example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" the word ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated three times. In subsequent appearances, ""lug"" doesn't result in triple colors, perhaps due to the presence of ""walm.""

In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" we see ""red red green green green,"" with ""walm"" being associated with double ""green"" this time. ""Wif"" and ""dax"" are associated with ""red"" and ""green"" respectively. ""Bluf"" does not appear in other examples, so its effect isn't clear. However, the ""walm"" again yields repeated colors.

In the final example, ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in ""green blue blue blue,"" with ""dax"" associated with ""green"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" Here, ""walm"" appears to cause a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Explanation: In each example, the word ""walm"" results in the color word that precedes it being output three additional times.

Example analysis:

1. In ""wif dax zup walm"", ""zup"" is not immediately followed by an output color, so it does not provide information for the rule of ""walm"". We look at ""dax"" -> ""green"" and then ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here ""yellow"" is an unexpected output if we just base it on ""dax"", so the ""walm"" seems to change the expected color from green to yellow and repeat it three times.

2. In ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"", ""lug"" -> ""blue"" and after ""walm"" we see ""blue blue blue"". This supports the idea that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color word that comes before it, which in this case is ""blue"".

3. In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" -> ""blue"" and following ""walm"", it's ""blue blue blue"". Again, this suggests repetition of the preceding color.

4. In ""wif bluf dax walm"", the presence of a non-mapped word ""bluf"" which does not correspond to a color in the output is likely a distractor. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", but after ""walm"", we see ""green green green"", supporting the repetition rule for ""walm"".

5. In ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" -> ""blue"". After ""walm"", we have ""blue blue blue"", which continues to support the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Thus, walm -> three repetitions of the color word that precedes it.",-0.4388670682821839,134,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeated color of the previous word, repeated as many times as the number of letters in the word 'walm' (four repetitions).

In the third example, 'lug' corresponds to blue, and 'walm' follows, resulting in four blue outputs.

2. In the context of other nonce words within the sequences, the output for ""dax"" remains consistent as ""green.""

"Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to ""red"". Here is the reasoning:

- When ""wif"" appears alone (""wif""), the output is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" (""zup wif""), the output of ""wif"" remains ""red"", while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In a longer sequence (""dax wif dax zup bluf""), ""wif"" still translates to ""red"", while other words (""dax"", ""zup"", ""bluf"") correspond to their respective colors (""green"", ""yellow"", ""yellow"").
- With a new word preceding ""wif"" (""lug walm""), the output is consistent with the word ""wif"" producing ""red"", while ""lug"" and ""walm"" both map to ""blue"".
- Again, when ""wif"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax"" (""zup wif dax""), the output for ""wif"" is ""red"", with ""zup"" and ""dax"" giving ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the pattern of inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify possible rules.

From the first example:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

We notice that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""bluf"" there are two ""blue.""

From the second example:
Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" After ""bluf,"" there are two ""blue"" again.

From the third example:
Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" again maps to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" there are two ""red.""

From the fourth example:

Output: yellow green yellow green red red

We see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" there are two ""red.""

From the last example:
Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""bluf"" there are two ""red.""

From these examples, we can induce that ""bluf"" likely causes the next color in the sequence to be repeated once more than it would ordinarily appear.

Rule: bluf -> causes the next color word's corresponding color to be outputted twice.

For example, normally ""lug"" would correspond to a single ""blue"" in the output, but after ""bluf,"" it leads to ""blue blue"" in the output. Similarly, ""wif"" usually corresponds to ""red,"" but after ""bluf,"" we get ""red red.""",-0.0636704266805294,135,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided:

4. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf  
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
5. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug  
   Output: green yellow red red blue

From the examples given, each time ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, the output is ""red red."" However, there is an additional color associated with ""bluf,"" which seems to change based on the preceding word. Observing the examples, a pattern emerges where the color preceding ""bluf"" in the output sequence is connected to the word immediately before ""bluf"" in the input sequence:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""blue"" comes before the ""red red.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""red"" comes before the ""red red.""
- When ""walm"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""green"" comes before the ""red red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""green"" comes before the ""red red.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""yellow"" comes before the ""red red.""

Based on the above patterns, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.

"To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's look at the patterns and the corresponding outputs.

- In every instance, after ""walm,"" the following colors repeat three times.
- The color that follows ""walm"" relates to the word that precedes it, not ""walm"" directly.

Now, let's examine each input and its output:

1. Input: ""dax walm zup walm""
   Output: ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
   The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" these colors repeat three times.

2. Input: ""zup walm wif""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
   The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" it repeats three times, followed by ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

3. Input: ""dax walm zup lug""
   Output: ""green green green yellow blue""
   Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" it repeats three times. This pattern is consistent.

4. Input: ""wif dax lug walm""
   Output: ""red green blue blue blue""
   The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" ""blue"" repeats three times.

5. Input: ""lug wif dax walm zup""
   Output: ""blue red green green green yellow""
   The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" After ""walm,"" ""green"" repeats three times.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" signals the repetition of the next color three times. What initiates the color, however, is the word that comes before ""walm,"" not ""walm"" itself. Hence, ""walm"" functions as a repeater for the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule:
- walm -> causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat three times.",-0.08116604214264131,135,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the inputs and outputs associated with it:

1. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
2. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
3. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
4. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
5. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow

Now, let's examine what happens when ""walm"" is used in the examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is used twice and it generates a pattern of ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""green green green"" and at the end of the input sequence.
- In the second example, ""walm"" appears once after ""yellow yellow yellow"" and before ""red,"" yielding another ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow,"" which is the new color introduced after ""green.""
- The fourth example shows ""walm"" at the end after ""blue blue blue,"" which follows the pattern of repeating the last color three times.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""green,"" again aligning with the subsequent color scheme.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" is a rule that means repeat the last color mentioned three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned three times.",-0.08458433438350003,135,walm
"Observing the provided examples, it is possible to infer a pattern where the nonce word ""walm"" directly relates to the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. In the color sequence output, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times if ""walm"" follows the said word. Let's verify this rule with the provided examples:

- Example 1: ""dax walm zup walm""
  - ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""green green green""
  - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow""

- Example 2: ""zup walm wif""
  - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
  - ""wif"" is not followed by ""walm"", hence it correlates to a single ""red""

- Example 3: ""dax walm zup lug""
  - ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""green green green""
  - ""zup"" is not followed by ""walm"", hence it correlates to a single ""yellow""
  - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""

- Example 4: ""wif dax lug walm""
  - ""wif"" stands alone and correlates to ""red""
  - ""dax"" stands alone and correlates to ""green""
  - ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""blue blue blue""

- Example 5: ""lug wif dax walm zup""
  - ""lug"" stands alone and correlates to ""blue""
  - ""wif"" stands alone and correlates to ""red""
  - ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" correlates to ""green green green""
  - ""zup"" stands alone and equates to ""yellow""

Given this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" can be described as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

This rule accurately explains the sequence of colors in the provided output examples.",-0.12046315503700002,135,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the output color sequence being one set of ""green"" followed by two copies of the color immediately preceding ""walm"". Let's examine the evidence:

1. In ""dax walm zup walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Following ""walm"", we get ""green"" once and then ""yellow"" twice, which corresponds to ""zup"". For the second ""walm"", it again produces ""green"" followed by two ""yellow"" which correspond to ""zup"".

2. In ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" gives ""yellow"", and following ""walm"", we get ""green"" once and then ""red"" twice, which corresponds to ""wif"".

3. In ""dax walm zup lug"", ""dax"" outputs ""green"", and after ""walm"", there's ""green"" followed by ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""zup"".

4. In ""wif dax lug walm"", ""lug"" gives ""blue"", and after ""walm"", we observe ""blue"" repeated twice, with ""green"" preceding them.

5. Lastly, in ""lug wif dax walm zup"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"" we find ""green"" once followed by ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""zup"".

Rule: zup -> yellow,-1.8872146413716044,136,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each instance where it appears in the examples:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. dax lug bluf -> green blue blue
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
5. lug dax bluf -> blue green green

In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output colors are green for both. In the second example, both ""dax"" and ""lug"" are present, but this time, ""lug"" is immediately before ""bluf"" and the outputs are different colors (blue for ""lug"" followed by blue for ""bluf""). The third time, ""lug"" is directly followed by ""bluf"" giving us blue followed by blue again.

From this pattern, we can see that the output color corresponding to ""bluf"" matches the output color of the word immediately preceding it. In cases where ""lug"" is immediately before ""bluf,"" the output for both is blue. In the one example where ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" their corresponding output colors are both green.

Using this rule, we can interpret that the word ""bluf,"" in this context, means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Thus, we do not have a direct translation for ""bluf,"" but rather a contextual meaning based on the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",-0.11302841817602935,136,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color that corresponds to the preceding word. The color of 'bluf' depends on the word right before it:

- 'dax' corresponds to the color green.
- 'lug' corresponds to the color blue.
- 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow.
- 'wif' corresponds to the color red.

If multiple colors are mentioned in the output, it seems that the rule for 'bluf' is to repeat the color of the preceding word:

- 'dax bluf zup' translates to 'green green yellow' because 'dax' is green, 'bluf' repeats the color of 'dax', and 'zup' is yellow.
- 'dax lug bluf' translates to 'green blue blue' because 'dax' is green, 'lug' is blue, and 'bluf' repeats the color of 'lug'.
- 'lug bluf' translates to 'blue blue' because 'lug' is blue, and 'bluf' repeats the color of 'lug'.
- 'zup wif bluf' translates to 'yellow red red' because 'zup' is yellow, 'wif' is red, and 'bluf' repeats the color of 'wif'.
- 'lug dax bluf' translates to 'blue green green' because 'lug' is blue, 'dax' is green, and 'bluf' repeats the color of 'dax'.

Hence, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word.",-0.11688892013632356,136,bluf
"Based on the given examples where the word ""bluf"" is used, we can see that the output colors of ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""red"" are repeated for the words ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup,"" respectively, which appear before ""bluf."" This suggests that the output color associated with ""bluf"" is directly dependent on the word that precedes it.

Here is the rule I have deduced:

- ""dax bluf"" generates the output ""green green,"" implying that when proceeded by ""dax,"" ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of ""green.""
- ""lug bluf"" generates the output ""blue blue,"" implying that when proceeded by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of ""blue.""
- ""zup wif bluf,"" where ""zup"" is three words prior to ""bluf,"" produces ""yellow,"" then two unrelated colors, suggesting that the position immediately before ""bluf"" is essential for determining its color.
- ""lug dax bluf"" gives us ""blue green green,"" indicating again that the word immediately before ""bluf"" dictates its color, in this case, ""dax"" sets it to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:
Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

So if the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green."" If the preceding word is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue."" If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow."" There is no given example with ""wif bluf,"" so we do not know what color ""bluf"" would be in that case.",-0.5870759948813237,136,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""bluf"" is followed by a corresponding color. It appears that ""bluf"" is associated with colors depending on the word that comes before ""bluf.""

From the examples:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the result is ""green green.""
2. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the result is ""blue blue.""
3. No result is shown specifically with ""zup"" or ""wif"" preceding ""bluf"" alone, but we can see that when they are paired with another word, the colors ""yellow red"" (zup wif) and ""yellow"" (dax bluf zup) follow.

Given these data points, we can hypothesize that ""bluf"" reflects the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. However, without further examples that isolate ""zup"" and ""wif"" with ""bluf,"" we cannot define the exact rule for those terms. Nonetheless, for ""dax"" and ""lug,"" the rule seems consistent:

- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
- ""lug"" before ""bluf"" results in ""blue.""

Since the output is always two colors and the second color always matches the rule identified for ""dax"" and ""lug,"" it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word before it, thus the output is the color twice. This rule, however, requires a word that determines the color to appear directly before ""bluf.""

"Rule: The meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be tied to the color associated with the word that precedes it:

- When preceded by ""dax,"" the output is green, therefore ""bluf"" yields the color corresponding to ""dax,"" which is green.

- When preceded by ""zup,"" the output is yellow, therefore ""bluf"" yields the color corresponding to ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- When preceded by ""wif,"" the output is red, therefore ""bluf"" yields the color corresponding to ""wif,"" which is red.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the consistent patterns associated with its use in the examples provided.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

From the examples given, we can observe the following:
1. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" it translates to ""green."" This is evident from the first and last examples.

2. ""walm"" after a sequence starting with ""dax"" and including other words (e.g., ""zup,"" ""lug"") leads to a repetition of the last color before ""walm."" The second example starts with ""dax zup,"" and the color pattern is ""green yellow"" before ""walm"" which gives us ""yellow yellow yellow."" The fourth example starts with ""dax lug,"" with the color pattern ""green blue"" before ""walm,"" which then leads to ""blue blue blue.""

3. If we consider that ""walm"" repeats the last color before it, the third example also fits the rule. The pattern before ""walm"" is ""green yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" it is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Considering these observations, ""walm"" seems to invoke the last color mentioned before it, leading to a repetition of that color.

Rule: walm -> repeats the last mentioned color in a series.",-0.09397003222759034,136,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the commonalities and differences between examples and their outputs. Let's analyze each example and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
   - The word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with ""dax"" (which is ""green"").

2. Input: dax zup walm wif | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which changes the color pattern to yellow. The pattern is then interrupted by ""wif"" which produces red.

3. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm | Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - Again, ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" resulting in a series of yellows after the color introduced by ""dax.""

4. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" introduces blue, and ""walm"" repeats this color.

5. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
   - As with the first input, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax.""

From these examples, we can deduce a pattern that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. However, in example 2, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" which changes the output color to red.

Thus, the rule is:
Rule: walm repeats the color of the preceding word until another word specifies a different color.",-0.09869181550879517,136,walm
"By inspecting the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is leading to a sequence of colors in the output, and the sequence is consistent according to some rule based on the preceding words. I will illustrate my deductions through each input-output pair:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Deduction: The word ""walm"" occurs after ""dax"" and results in ""green green green.""

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Deduction: The appearance of ""zup"" before ""walm"" results in a sequence of three ""yellow"" following a ""green,"" while ""wif"" after ""walm"" leads to a ""red.""

3. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Deduction: The combination of words before ""walm"" leads to a sequence that includes ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ends with three ""yellow."" It seems the colors correspond to the words before ""walm"" in some way.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Deduction: Insertion of ""lug"" before ""walm"" but after ""dax"" results in ""green"" followed by three ""blue.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Deduction: This instance is the same as the first and confirms the consistency of the response to ""dax walm"".

Using these deductions, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" triggers a sequence of colors that correspond to the words that appear before it. Specifically, it seems that ""walm"" produces a sequence based on the colors associated with the individual words that precede it as follows:

- ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""
- ""wif,"" when following ""walm,"" is associated with ""red.""

Moreover, it seems that the sequence is three times the color that is associated with the immediately preceding word to ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: It produces a sequence of colors where the color repeats three times and corresponds to the preceding word, with ""wif"" after ""walm"" adding a ""red"" to the end of the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Produces a sequence of three of the same color based on the word immediately before ""walm,"" and if ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" append ""red"" to the sequence.",-0.1022208675233735,136,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the words preceding ""walm"" appear to dictate the color outputted for ""walm."" Specifically, walm takes the color of the last color word mentioned before it, and repeats this color for as many times as there are non-color words following the last color word up until ""walm."" Looking at the examples:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Therefore, ""dax"" must generate the first ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats this color twice more, as there are no non-color words between ""dax"" and ""walm.""

- ""dax zup walm wif"" leads to ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" ""Dax"" generates ""green,"" ""zup"" generates ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats the last color ""yellow"" three times as there are two non-color words (""walm"" and ""wif"") that follow ""zup"" before ""walm"" is said.

- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" yields ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" In this sequence, ""dax"" generates ""green"" and ""zup"" changes it to ""yellow"" once again. ""Walm"" then repeats the color ""yellow"" as many times as there are non-color words following the last occurrence of ""zup"" up to ""walm,"" which in this case is three.

- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" produces ""green,"" ""lug"" generates ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue"" since it is the last mentioned color, and there are no non-color words between ""lug"" and ""walm.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will compare the inputs and outputs and look for patterns to understand the transformation rules from the input words to the output colors. I'll analyze each instance of ""dax"" in the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. In the first example, ""dax"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and the output colors in that position go from yellow to green and then to red. Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

   Input: zup dax wif zup
   Output: yellow green red yellow

2. In the second example, ""dax"" appears twice, once after ""bluf"" and before ""lug,"" and the second time after ""bluf"" and before ""zup."" In the output, colors are green after ""yellow"" (which corresponds to ""bluf"") and before ""blue"" (which corresponds to ""lug"") and green again before ""yellow"" (which corresponds to ""zup""). ""Dax"" still corresponds to the color green.

   Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

3. In the third example, ""dax"" is at the beginning, followed by ""walm"" and ""wif"" which correspond to green and red. ""Dax"" again corresponds to the color green.

   Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears after ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" with the output colors being red, red, green, and blue. The appearance of ""dax"" coincides with the color green once again.

   Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue

5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and precedes ""zup."" The output sequence surrounding ""dax"" is red, red, red, green, yellow. ""Dax"" is aligned with green once more.

   Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Based on the analysis, in every instance, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:

Rule: ""dax"" -> green",-0.05748647049750981,137,dax

Therefore, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as: 

dax -> green.",-0.08187217541243137,137,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the position of ""dax"" in each input and its corresponding output color.

- In the first example, ""dax"" is surrounded by ""zup,"" and the output for ""dax"" is green.
- In the second example, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and precedes ""lug,"" its output is green.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is preceded by ""walm"" and followed by ""wif"" and ""walm,"" its output is green.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and precedes ""lug,"" its output is green.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and precedes ""zup,"" its output is green.

Based on these observations, ""dax"" results in the color green regardless of the surrounding words. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

- Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds with the output ""green.""
- Other words like ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" seem to produce consistent color outputs as well across the different inputs.

Now let's match the nonces with their outputs to see what the pattern is:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds with ""red""
- ""walm"" consistently corresponds with ""red""
- ""bluf"" consistently corresponds with ""blue""
- ""lug"" has appeared twice next to ""dax"" and seems to not have any direct color associated with it, likely because it's output is always combined with that of ""dax""

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf (Output: green green green red red)
   - ""Walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

It consistently repeats the color three times after the color corresponding to the word before ""walm."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.09395406970289998,137,walm
"Based on the provided input-output pairs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" We need to find a consistent pattern that fits all the examples:

1. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   -- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in additional ""blue""

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   -- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in three ""red""

3. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   -- ""walm"" follows the second ""wif"" and results in three ""red""

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   -- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in two additional ""blue""

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   -- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in two additional ""green"" (assuming ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"")

Now, let's analyze the pattern:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", we get additional ""blue"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", we get additional ""red"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", we get additional ""green"".

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color word that precedes it a certain number of times. The number of repetitions looks to be two, based on examples 1 and 4. Example 5 seems to support this as well, assuming ""dax walm"" implies repetition of ""green"" followed by the color for ""wif."" Let's consider, however, that example 2 and 3 have three repetitions of ""red"" after ""walm."" This discrepancy might be explained by the immediate presence of a second ""wif"" before ""walm,"" suggesting an increase in repetition.

Rule: walm -> meaning
When 'walm' follows another color word, it seems to repeat the corresponding color of that word an additional two times if it is the only color word before 'walm,' or an additional three times if 'walm' follows a double occurrence of the preceding color word (as in the second occurrence of ""wif"" before ""walm"").

So, a tentative rule might be:
- walm: Repeat the color of the preceding color word two more times, and if the preceding color word occurs twice before ""walm,"" repeat the color three more times.",-0.11256045958455553,137,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs containing ""walm"" to their respective outputs.

1. Input: ""wif dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""red green blue blue blue""
2. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> Output: ""green red red red blue yellow""
3. Input: ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""blue red yellow red red red""
4. Input: ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue""
5. Input: ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> Output: ""green green green red red""

In each case, after the first appearance of a color, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of that color until another color word appears or the sequence ends:

1. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" after which ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue.""
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated until ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue.""
3. After ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" ""walm"" again causes ""red"" to be repeated.
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" continues the color ""blue.""
5. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" continues the color ""green"" until ""wif"" changes the color to ""red.""

"Rule: walm -> the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Explanation: In each instance, the output for ""walm"" is the same color as the word that comes directly before it.

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" so ""walm"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- The third example, ""wif walm,"" again shows ""walm"" repeating the color of the preceding word, ""wif,"" which is red.
- The fourth example only consists of ""lug walm,"" which outputs ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with ""lug's"" color being blue.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green,"" showing that ""walm"" mimics the color of ""dax,"" which is green.",-1.104538495297111,137,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output color corresponding to the nonce word ""walm"" is determined by the color word preceding it. The rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes on the same color as the previous color word repeated one or more times. Here's the breakdown for each example:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" follows, resulting in three repetitions of blue.
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" follows, resulting in three repetitions of red.
- In the third example, the second ""wif"" (which corresponds to red) is immediately followed by ""walm,"" which yields three additional reds.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" (blue) is immediately followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three blues.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""walm,"" which leads to two more greens.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

There doesn't seem to be a context-specific variation, as ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words around it. Moreover, each other nonce word seems to correspond to a unique color independent of ""wif"":

2. dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
3. lug zup dax wif -> blue yellow green red
4. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
5. zup dax wif zup -> yellow green red yellow

It appears that the word ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"" in the output. This can be confirmed by looking for instances where ""zup"" appears in the input and ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output:

- In examples 1 and 5, ""zup"" is the first word, and ""yellow"" is the first color.
- In example 3, ""zup"" is the second word, and ""yellow"" is the second color.
- In example 2, ""zup"" is the third word, and ""yellow"" is the third color.
- In example 4, ""zup"" is the third word, and the output starts repeating colors, with ""yellow"" appearing in sequences corresponding to the words after ""zup.""

Therefore, we can conclude the meaning of ""zup"" as follows: zup -> yellow. Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence.",-0.12448186808973818,138,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can see a pattern in the appearance of the nonce word ""zup"" and the corresponding output. Here's the pattern found in each example:

1. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green

2. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green
   Note: We see that the sequence ""zup dax"" leads to ""yellow green"" like in the first example.

3. Input: lug zup dax wif
   Output: blue yellow green red
   Note: Again, ""zup dax"" leads to ""yellow green"" and the other inputs lead to respective colors.

4. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   Note: The output shows that ""zup"" is followed by three ""yellows"" after a sequence of a word (here, ""walm"") has been repeated once already (making it a second occurrence of a previously used word before ""zup"").

5. Input: dax wif zup
   Output: yellow green red yellow
   Note: In this case, after ""zup"" we only have one instance of ""yellow"" instead of two or three, which means the amount of ""yellow"" depends on the context of how many times a preceding word is repeated before ""zup"".

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" signifies a sequence of ""yellow"" in the output, and the number of times ""yellow"" appears corresponds to the number of times a preceding word has been repeated before ""zup"". If the preceding word (e.g., ""dax"") has not been repeated before ""zup"", then ""zup"" translates to a single ""yellow"". If the preceding word is repeated once before ""zup"" (like ""walm"" before the second ""zup"" in example 4), it leads to ""yellow"" repeated twice. 

Rule: zup -> A sequence of ""yellow"" repeated as many times as the immediately preceding word has been repeated before ""zup"". If the preceding word has not been repeated, ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow"".

- dax -> green

- zup dax -> yellow green
- dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
- lug zup dax wif -> blue yellow green red
- dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
- zup dax wif zup -> yellow green red yellow

Analyzing the positions of ""zup,"" it comes before a color, and in the output, ""yellow"" always appears before the color associated with the word following ""zup."" This suggests that ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

"Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax"" consistently outputs ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently outputs ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently outputs ""blue""
- ""walm"" repeated twice outputs ""yellow"" three times.

Now, if we analyze the occurrences of ""zup"":

1. In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""dax"" and outputs ""yellow"" before ""green"".
2. In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""dax"" again and outputs a ""yellow"" before ""green"".
3. In the third example, ""zup"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""dax"", where ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" and ""zup dax"" outputs ""yellow green"".
4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" follows ""walm"" and precedes another ""walm"", and we see that after ""zup"", three occurrences of ""yellow"" are outputted instead of just two, indicating that ""zup"" added an extra ""yellow"".
5. In the fifth example, there are two occurrences of ""zup"", both followed by ""dax"", which respectively output ""yellow"" before the ""green"" associated with ""dax"".

The rule for ""zup"" could be:

zup -> adds ""yellow""

- ""dax"": green
- ""wif"": red
- ""lug"": blue
- ""walm"": sequence of ""green yellow""

Given this correlation, the output color pattern for ""zup"" is always ""yellow"". Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output position.

Therefore, we can deduce the meaning as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" represents the color yellow in this context.",-0.8435341150619047,138,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the color immediately preceding it when translated to English. It copies the color of the preceding word.

Examining all the instances:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output is red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green), we would expect green, but the output is yellow, which may suggest an inconsistency or an incomplete rule.

2. With ""wif walm"" as the input, the output is ""red red red."" Given that ""wif"" on its own typically gives a single ""red"", ""walm"" here adds two more ""red.""

3. For ""wif lug walm,"" the output is ""red blue blue blue."" Similar to the previous example, one ""red"" and one ""blue"" can be accounted for by ""wif"" and ""lug,"" respectively, with ""walm"" adding three ""blue.""

- The word ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"" when it occurs in the first example.
- The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the output ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently correlates with the output ""yellow.""

When the word ""bluf"" appears in the examples, it results in different outputs depending on the context:

- In the first example ""wif bluf dax lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which is the same as the output for ""wif.""
- In the second example ""zup bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" which matches the output for ""zup.""
- Similarly, in the fourth example ""zup bluf,"" the outcome is the same as in the second; ""bluf"" results in an output of ""yellow,"" which is the same as ""zup.""
- In the last example ""wif lug bluf wif zup,"" the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue."" This is the same output as the word ""lug"" that is immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Given these observations, it is plausible to deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" has a chameleon-like nature, taking on the color output of the word immediately before it. If it is the second word in the sequence, it repeats the color associated with the first word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. If there is no preceding word (if it is the first word in a sequence), there is no given example to determine the color; all provided examples have ""bluf"" preceded by another word.",-0.6009254283289334,139,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the instances and the outputs that correspond to each instance where ""bluf"" is present:

- When ""bluf"" appears with ""dax"" and ""lug,"" the output has ""green"" and ""blue,"" suggesting a possible relationship.
- ""bluf"" with ""wif"" outputs ""red red,"" but when ""lug"" is present, there is also a ""blue"" in the output.
- ""bluf"" with ""zup"" alone outputs ""yellow yellow.""
- ""bluf"" with ""wif lug"" results in ""blue blue.""

From these examples, it's possible that ""bluf"" could signify the output of the color blue. However, this doesn't hold in the case of ""bluf"" with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow yellow."" It's also not clear why there are repetitions of the colors in certain cases (e.g., ""red red,"" ""yellow yellow"").

Given the context and the inconsistency, a pattern cannot be established with high confidence. However, we can attempt a hypothesis:

Rule: ""bluf"" is related to colors, possibly corresponding to blue in some contexts; however, when combined with the word ""zup,"" the color switches to yellow. The repetition of color in the output might relate to the other words in the input, but there is not enough information to define a clear rule for this.

Based on this hypothesis but acknowledging possible contextual differences, an initial conclusion could be:

bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" seems to be associated with colors, but the specific color it corresponds to can change depending on context. Without further examples or rules, it's challenging to form a more definitive rule.",-0.7937857334328,139,bluf

"To deduce the rules for ""walm,"" let's look at the association of inputs and outputs in each example.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Rule: The presence of ""walm"" with ""zup"" causes the word ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
Rule: ""Walm"" in the third position leads to three repetitions of ""red,"" following the color associated with ""wif.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Rule: ""Walm"" in the second position still leads to three repetitions of ""red,"" the color associated with ""wif,"" regardless of the position of ""zup.""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
Rule: ""Walm"" following ""dax"" results in three repetitions of ""green,"" the color associated with ""dax,"" and then the color associated with ""wif"" (red).

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
Rule: ""Walm"" at the end of the sequence causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it (""dax"" -> ""green""), regardless of other words present.

From these observations, it looks like ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, there's no repetition of any previous color, but instead, the repetition is based on the word right before ""walm."" So, ""walm"" seems to act as a multiplier for the color word that is immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.",-0.1358894535117143,139,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns in the given examples and correlate them with the outputs:

1. Whenever ""walm"" is mentioned, the output consists of repetitions of the same color.
2. The color repeated corresponds to the color associated with the word prior to ""walm"" in the sequence.

For example:
- In the first input ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" hence the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second input ""zup wif walm lug,"" ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red,"" resulting in ""red red red,"" followed by ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, the colors red, green, and green are repeated three times, respectively, after ""walm"" and correspond to the colors associated with the words immediately before ""walm"" (""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""dax"").

Rule: walm -> replicate the color associated with the word directly before it three times.",-0.7935510316857145,139,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color coded by the previous nonce word. To deduce the rule, let's examine each case:

In the first example, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and then ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

In the second example, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and then ""walm"" is used after ""wif,"" resulting in ""red red red"" followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" This supports the previous observation.

The third, fourth, and fifth examples further support this conclusion, as ""walm"" consistently repeats the color indicated by the word that comes before it three times.

Now let's analyze ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of three ""blue"" before ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow."" This suggests that ""walm"" might repeat the preceding color.

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by two ""yellow"" colors, which is the color associated with ""zup.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green"" 
2. ""lug wif bluf"" yields ""blue red red"" 
3. ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow"" 
4. ""wif dax zup bluf"" yields ""red green yellow yellow"" 
5. ""dax lug wif bluf"" yields ""green blue red red""

When observing each input and its corresponding output, it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes it. For instance:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so when followed by ""bluf,"" it becomes ""green green.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so when followed by ""bluf,"" it becomes ""yellow yellow.""

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

"Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word as many times as the number of letters in that word.

Explanation:
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"" because ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""dax"" has three letters, so ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"", ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and as ""zup"" has three letters, ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In ""dax walm zup lug"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", so ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" stands alone after a word, it repeats the color corresponding to that word for as many times as there are letters in the word. With ""zup walm"", ""yellow"" is said three times, and with ""dax walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.",-0.41648422971662663,141,walm

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow repeated three times.
- There's no example of ""walm"" following ""wif"" or ""lug,"" but ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""lug"" to blue in other instances.

In the given examples, it seems like ""walm"" repeats the color of the word it immediately follows three times in the output sequence. If we take this as the rule for ""walm,"" we can write the meaning as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-1.0371517523530116,141,walm

Looking at how ""walm"" translates into the output, we can notice the following pattern: The color that ""walm"" corresponds to in the output is the same color as the color of the word preceding ""walm."" Notably, the output for ""walm"" always consists of three repetitions of the same color. If ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green,"" and if it follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

"Based on the examples given, where 'zup' corresponds to a specific output, we can try to deduce a pattern.

From example 1 (dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow) and example 3 (zup dax bluf zup dax -> yellow green green yellow green), we can see that 'zup' does not always correspond to the same color when surrounded by the same words. Here, 'zup' is followed by ""dax"" and ""bluf"" in both instances, but the colors that follow 'zup' are different ('yellow' in example 1 and 'green' in example 3). Thus, the meaning of 'zup' is unlikely to be a fixed color.

From example 2 (zup -> yellow), we see that 'zup' on its own corresponds to 'yellow'. However, this does not necessarily mean that 'zup' translates directly to 'yellow', because in other contexts, it does not output 'yellow' consistently.

In example 4 (wif zup dax -> red yellow green), we can see that 'wif' corresponds to 'red' and 'dax' to 'green'. The 'zup' in the middle outputs 'yellow'. Here, 'zup' does correspond to 'yellow', but it's surrounded by different colors than in the previous examples.

Example 5 (zup lug zup dax -> yellow blue yellow green) shows 'zup' both preceding and following 'lug', leading to 'yellow', but here 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'.

With the information given, we notice that 'zup' results in 'yellow' when it stands alone or when it does not directly follow another 'zup'. When 'zup' immediately follows another 'zup', it is not followed by 'yellow' in the output. However, this pattern isn't reliably confirmed with the existing examples provided, and we have no instances of 'zup' immediately following a 'zup' with a different output.

The best rule we can induce with the given data is that 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' unless there's an unaddressed condition affecting the output. With the provided examples, no clear condition has been established that changes the output of 'zup'.

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is three repetitions of ""blue"" followed by the color associated with the next word. Since ""bluf"" results in two ""red"" after the three ""blue,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" means red in this context.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is three repetitions of ""green."" It implies that ""dax"" means green, and ""walm"" somehow causes the triplication of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and we see one ""red"" for ""wif"" followed by three ""blue."" This is consistent with the rule we're formulating since ""lug"" now has a triplicate ""blue"" following it due to ""walm.""

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which results in three ""red"" followed by a ""yellow"" for ""zup."" Again, we see ""walm"" causing a triplication of the color associated with the preceding word.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Once more, ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in three ""green,"" which supports the triplication rule. After ""walm,"" we see ""wif,"" which gives us ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word preceding it to be repeated three times.

"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the rule governing the use of the nonce word ""walm"" and its effect on the output.

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" leads to ""blue blue blue red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" impacts the color words following it but does not affect the color word ""bluf"" that comes after ""wif,"" since ""wif"" is not directly preceded by ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which implies that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with ""dax,"" which in this case is green.
- The third example, ""wif lug walm,"" results in ""red blue blue blue,"" showing that ""walm"" is affecting ""lug"" and causing it to produce more ""blue"" outputs.
- The fourth example, ""wif walm zup,"" leading to ""red red red yellow,"" indicates that ""walm"" is causing the color associated with ""wif"" to be repeated before eventually having ""zup"" produce ""yellow.""
- In the final example, ""dax walm wif,"" the output is ""green green green red,"" so ""walm"" again causes repetition in association with a color preceding it and is unaffected by any color terms after it.

Combining these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the term immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. It does not affect any color term that follows unless that term is immediately preceded by it.

- ""lug walm wif bluf"" → blue blue blue red red (lug corresponds to blue, walm repeats blue three times, wif corresponds to red, bluf does not have a defined output so it is ignored)

4. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" after zup causes the following sequence to start with yellow (since another ""bluf"" follows zup).

5. zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""lug"" after zup causes the following sequence to start with blue (repeated for each subsequent ""walm"" or ""wif"").

Therefore, ""zup"" appears to be a command word that resets the sequence colors to start with yellow, and the color that follows next (caused by the word after ""zup"") is then repeated for each subsequent word until a new color is introduced or the sequence ends.

Rule: zup -> resets the sequence to start with yellow, followed by repetitions of a color based on the next word.",-0.07419795464231001,143,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to establish a rule for the meaning of ""zup"". To do this, let's look at each instance where ""zup"" occurs and see if there is any consistent transformation or pattern in the output.

1. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

3. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

5. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Analyzing the examples:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the immediate next word in the output is ""yellow"".
- The words following the yellow in the output are colors repeated depending on the word that comes after ""zup"" in the input:
  - Input ""dax"" becomes ""green"" (example 1)
  - Input ""wif"" becomes ""red"" (examples 1, 2, 5)
  - Input ""lug"" becomes ""blue"" (examples 1 and 5)
  - Input ""walm"" becomes ""red"" (examples 2 and 5)
  - If nothing follows ""zup,"" or if it's a word that hasn't been given a specific output color (like ""bluf""), the default color seems to remain ""yellow"" (example 4).

By understanding this pattern, we can deduce a rule for ""zup"". It appears that ""zup"" initiates a sequence with the color ""yellow"" in the output, followed by as many colors as the word following ""zup"" dictates. For instance, ""wif"" is always followed by three ""reds"", and ""lug"" by two ""blues"". If ""zup"" is the last word or followed by an unfamiliar term, it leads simply to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> Initiates a sequence starting with the color ""yellow,"" followed by colors corresponding to the pattern defined by the next word in the sequence. If the next word is not defined, or if ""zup"" is the last word, the sequence consists only of ""yellow"".",-0.07738463701299998,143,zup
"Given the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" denotes the color yellow when it appears in an input sequence. The output always contains the color yellow corresponding to the position of ""zup"" in the input. Also, it appears that ""zup"" causes all following words (until the next occurrence of ""zup"" if present) to repeat the color the immediately follows ""zup."" Here's how it breaks down:

In the first example, when ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow green,"" and subsequent words ""walm lug wif"" continue the pattern starting with ""green.""

In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" equates to ""red,"" and ""zup"" caused the red to repeat for ""walm.""

In the third example, ""wif dax zup walm"" yields ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" again showing that ""zup"" leads to a repeat of the color after it, which is yellow, suggesting ""walm"" aligns with yellow.

Notice that whenever ""zup"" is immediately followed by another word, it initially outputs ""yellow,"" and the subsequent color corresponds to the word following ""zup"" and repeats that color.

Additional examples support this observation, and ""zup"" doesn't seem to have an effect on words that precede it, only on those that follow.

Rule: zup -> yellow. When ""zup"" appears in a sequence, it outputs ""yellow"" and causes the color corresponding to the word following ""zup"" to be repeated for the rest of the sequence or until the next ""zup"" is encountered.",-0.8600431452028003,143,zup
"Rule: zup -> yellow

"Rule: zup -> the color yellow repeated as many times as there are words following ""zup"" in the input sequence.",-1.7196421093329997,143,zup
"Observing the given examples, we can try to understand the rule by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
2. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
4. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
5. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue

The word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color output directly preceding it. It's consistent in each example that the color before ""bluf"" is duplicated in the output when ""bluf"" is present. Therefore we can deduce a rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> meaning the same as the color word directly before it in the output.",-0.11883081760034524,143,bluf
"From the examples, we can infer the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the patterns observed when other words appear and the corresponding colors they represent:

- ""wif"" results in ""red""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- ""dax"" results in ""green""

Now, by analyzing the context in which ""bluf"" appears and the resulting outputs, we can deduce a rule:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is at the end, following ""dax"" for ""green,"" and the output is the repetition of ""green.""
3. In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" for ""yellow,"" and the output is another ""yellow.""
4. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and the output is another ""blue.""

Looking at these patterns, it suggests that ""bluf"" results in the repeated color of the word just before it. Therefore, if ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which represents ""red,"" we would expect the output for ""bluf"" to be ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word just before it.",-0.7357557138640471,143,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can determine the following relationships between the input words and the colors in the output:

- The color corresponding to ""wif"" is consistently ""red.""
- The color corresponding to ""lug"" is consistently ""blue.""
- The color corresponding to ""dax"" is consistently ""green.""
- The color corresponding to ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow.""

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of the nonce word ""bluf"":

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is translated into ""blue,"" but because the color blue is already tied to ""lug,"" this doesn't seem consistent.
2. In the second example, we see ""bluf"" at the end of the sequence, and it translates to ""green green,"" meaning it has to repeat the color before it, which in this case is ""green.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is translated to ""yellow,"" which is the color tied to ""zup"" before it.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is translated to ""yellow yellow,"" repeating the color tied to ""zup"" before it.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is translated to ""blue blue,"" repeating the color tied to ""lug"" before it.

Using these examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" specifies that the color word before it should be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word before it in the output sequence.",-0.7666384109116667,143,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can notice that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output, and it seems to be influenced by the word that comes immediately before it. Let's look at the patterns:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue yellow,"" where the color immediately before ""yellow"" is ""red."" However, in this case, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output color sequence ends in ""green green,"" meaning ""bluf"" is translated to ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" which is consistent with example 3.

5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" so when ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" its color turns out to be ""blue.""

We can determine a rule based on these observations:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it translates to ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue."" If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green."" If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""",-1.0652665900741665,143,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, bluf seems to always translate to the color blue, except when it follows the word zup, where it translates to yellow. 

However, looking at the broader context provided by all examples, another pattern emerges where the color outputted by bluf is the same as the color that precedes it, except when bluf is the first word, then it defaults to blue. Let's verify this with the examples:

Example 1: bluf is blue because it is the first word and defaults to blue.
Example 3 and 5: When bluf follows zup (which is yellow), the outputted color is yellow.
Example 4: When bluf follows zup (which is yellow), the outputted color is yellow.

Hence, the rule I induce for bluf is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> The color of the preceding word; if there is no preceding word, then blue.",-1.3589037017083332,143,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color outputted immediately before it. The number of repetitions seems to be two additional times, as in each case, the color preceding ""walm"" is repeated a total of three times (including the one that directly precedes ""walm"").

Here’s the breakdown of how ""walm"" works in each example:

- Example 1: ""dax lug dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue green blue blue blue"". The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", and after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated two more times, for a total of three ""blue"" in a row.
  
- Example 2: ""wif dax lug walm"" leads to ""red green blue blue blue"". The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated two more times.
  
- Example 3: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" leads to ""green green green yellow blue green"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated two more times.
  
- Example 4: ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated two more times.
  
- Example 5: ""wif lug dax walm"" leads to ""red blue green green green"". The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated two more times.

So the rule is:

walm -> Causes the last color mentioned to be repeated two more times, for a total of three consecutive mentions of that color.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the color representation of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is outputted two additional times.",-0.08356687719477314,143,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the patterns where it appears and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   
2. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   
3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   
4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   
5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green

Considering these examples, we observe that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color to be repeated in the output. In every instance, the color that appears immediately before ""walm"" is repeated multiple times in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color multiple times in the output.

Based on this rule, the meaning of ""walm"" can be generalized as an instruction to duplicate the most recently referenced color.",-0.09024837502070103,143,walm
"In all the examples provided, the term ""walm"" appears in different contexts but always seems to produce the color blue in the output, often more than once sequentially. However, ""walm"" does not always result in the same number of blue outputs. By analyzing each instance, we can attempt to deduce the rule governing the meaning of ""walm"":

In the first example, ""walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" which is two instances of blue.

In the second example, ""walm"" again results in ""blue blue,"" or twice.

In the third example, ""walm"" results in ""green green,"" but this might be an outlier, as it is the only context in which blue isn't produced directly afterward. However, given the apparent pattern, it's conceivable that the previous word (""dax"" which seems to correspond to ""green"") influenced the output, creating a situation where ""walm"" duplicated the prior color twice.

In the fourth example, ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" following a ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Just like in the third example, it seems to be repeating the previous color twice.

In the fifth example, ""walm"" results in ""green green,"" following a ""dax,"" which again corresponds to green and is repeated twice.

Combining these observations, we can conclude the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color corresponding to the previous word two times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the previous word twice.",-1.3395268132054639,143,walm
"Rule: walm -> the color of the word following ""walm"" is repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the last word, the color blue is repeated three times.

Explanation:
- In the first example, the word following ""walm"" is not present, thus ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by no word, thus ""blue"" is repeated three times.",-1.5953326998705157,143,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided, it seems the word ""walm"" affects the colors outputted after it appears. Here's the pattern I notice:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" appears before another repetition of ""blue.""
3. The third example shows that after ""walm"" is introduced, ""green"" repeats except for when a new color (in this case ""yellow"") is introduced in a sequence, then ""green"" resumes.
4. The fourth example follows the same rule, where ""yellow"" is repeated after ""walm"" until a new color (""blue"") is introduced, and then the repetition continues with ""red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""green"" is repeated after ""walm"" has been said.

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the last color mentioned before it until a new color is introduced. If there's no prior color given (as seen in the second example), ""walm"" defaults to repeating ""blue.""

"Based on the given examples, it seems like ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue"" in the output. Here is how it breaks down:

- In the first example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" with ""lug"" again corresponding to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Since ""walm"" seems to replicate the color ""blue"" three times, ""lug"" once again corresponds to a single instance of ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif lug dax"" translates to ""green red blue green."" Here, ""lug"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" with ""wif"" translating to ""red"" and each ""dax"" to ""green,"" so ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to the single instance of ""blue"" amidst the ""yellow"" outputs from both ""zup"" and ""walm,"" and the rest of the colors follow the patterns of their respective nonce words.

We can identify the following consistent patterns:

- Every time ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is in the output.
- When ""lug"" is immediately followed by another nonce word, the output color for ""lug"" is still ""blue,"" regardless of the following word. This indicates that ""lug"" is independent of the word it is paired with.

5. Input: dax zup dax zup

From these examples, we can try to establish a rule:

a) The word ""dax"" is always followed by the word ""green"". 

Next, let's determine the relationship with other words:

b) The word ""walm"" is followed by ""green"" as well.
   However, after ""wif,"" the color changes to ""red,"" breaking the green pattern. This indicates that ""wif"" could be a trigger for a change.

c) ""Bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" which suggests it does not alter the ""green"" output associated with ""dax.""

d) The word ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""blue,"" which indicates that ""lug"" uniquely translates to ""blue.""

e) The word ""zup"" results in a ""yellow"" hue. One can infer that the word ""zup"" itself translates to ""yellow.""

With this information, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" functions as a reset to ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"" regardless of the previous word.

In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and again the output is the repeated color (""red red""). Afterward, we have ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

In example 3, ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence. ""Zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" which then gets repeated due to ""bluf.""

In example 4, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following ""dax"" by ""bluf"" results in ""green green.""

In example 5, we can see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" again causes the previous color ""yellow"" to be repeated. Later, ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow"" a second time followed by ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color word that precedes it.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to ""red"" when following the word ""wif,"" and it translates to ""green"" when following the word ""dax."" Additionally, it translates to ""yellow"" when following the word ""zup."" Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" appears dependent on the word that precedes it.

Here's the observed pattern:

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

However, in the example ""dax zup lug zup bluf,"" the output of ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" instead of the expected ""green"" from the established rule when following ""dax."" This suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color of the last color word before it, not the immediate preceding word which indicates action or state. 

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: ""bluf"" takes the color of the last mention of a color word before it, if no color word precedes it then it defaults to ""green"". This rule can be inferred from the examples where ""bluf"" follows non-color words and yet still translates to a color matching the last stated color.

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which outputs ""green""), the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green"". We see this pattern in the second, fourth, and fifth examples.
3. The third example shows ""bluf"" at the end without a preceding word to determine its color, but based on the pattern it seems likely that if a word were given before it that had an associated color, ""bluf"" would repeat that color.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""  ""bluf"" is the only element left, corresponding to the only color left, ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and since ""bluf"" is the only other word, and the output is two ""yellow"" colors, this implies ""bluf"" also means ""yellow.""
- The third example is a repetition of ""zup"" and ""lug"" with their meanings already known, followed by ""zup"" and ""bluf."" ""Zup"" is known to be yellow, and given that at the end it has two ""yellow"" outputs, this indicates that ""bluf"" is again ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, the presence of ""zup"" (known as ""yellow"") and ""lug"" (known as ""blue"") before and after ""bluf,"" combined with ""zup"" following ""bluf"" and the alternating pattern of yellow and blue ending with yellow suggests ""bluf"" is yellow.
- The fifth example includes ""dax"" (known as green) and ""zup"" (known as yellow). Since the output for ""bluf"" following ""zup"" is another yellow, ""bluf"" is consistent with ""yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns associated with each example:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is associated with the word ""blue"". 
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" appears alone and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" which does not include blue. 
3. In the third example, ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" is repeated an odd number of times, the color ""yellow"" is present instead of blue.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is again associated with ""yellow"" as it follows ""zup"".
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows both ""dax,"" associated with ""green,"" and ""zup,"" associated with ""yellow."" The output is two yellows following ""bluf,"" suggesting that the presence of ""zup"" before ""bluf"" affects the output.

Based on the above observations, ""bluf"" seems to mean ""yellow"" when it directly follows ""zup."" However, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it still results in ""yellow"" in the context of these examples, but it is not enough to definitively conclude that it always translates to ""yellow"" after ""dax."" Also, when ""bluf"" is by itself, the rule is less clear since it translates to ""yellow yellow,"" but perhaps ""bluf"" on its own simply means to repeat the previously stated color or the last color in the sequence.

Considering these patterns, we can propose a tentative rule that ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" but the broader rule for ""bluf"" might depend on the preceding word or context, possibly implying a repeat of the last color or an association with ""yellow"".

2. wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

3. wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

4. lug walm wif

5. dax walm zup lug dax

The word immediately preceding ""walm"" in each input directly influences the color repetition in the output. Specifically:

- In example 1, ""zup"" is yellow, and following ""walm,"" the output has three additional yellows.
- In example 2, ""lug"" is blue, and following ""walm,"" there are three blues.
- In example 3, ""wif"" is red, and following ""walm,"" there are two additional reds (three in total).
- In example 4, ""lug"" again leads to three blue outputs after ""walm.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" is green, and following ""walm,"" there are two additional greens (three in total).

From this, it's reasonable to deduce that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in total in the output.

Input: word preceding bluf -> Output: color of the word preceding bluf

Using the examples:

- ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""dax"" is not translated into a color, ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" translates to blue as well, and ""wif"" is red.
- ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" following ""wif"" translates to red.
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" following ""zup"" translates to yellow.
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""lug"" is blue, ""bluf"" after ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" doesn't translate, the second ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" is not translated but the pattern shows it should be yellow as well, and the final ""lug"" is blue.
- ""wif zup dax bluf"" -> ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" doesn't translate and here is an exception as we would expect bluf to be yellow but perhaps due to ""dax"" not having a color, it defaults to the color before it which is green.

Rule:
bluf -> takes the color of the word directly preceding it, unless the preceding word doesn't have a color translation, in which case it may default to the color before the non-translated word. 

Note: The final example introduces some ambiguity to the rule since ""dax"" is not associated with a color and ""bluf"" defaults to green which is unexpected. This may indicate that there might be additional rules or exceptions not clearly outlined by the given examples, or that ""bluf"" translates to green by default when the preceding word has no associated color.",-0.3348819103324418,146,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word, then it defaults to the color that follows it in the sequence.

- In the first example, ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" and ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" is blue.
- In the second example, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" is red.
- In the third example, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" is yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" and is blue, then ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and corresponds to green, but ""bluf"" takes the color blue from ""lug"" since it is before it.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" is green.

bluf -> The word ""bluf"" represents a color that is the same as the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the input. If ""bluf"" appears at the beginning of the input, it takes the color of the word immediately following it.",-1.1969177767916284,146,bluf

- zup precedes bluf: yellow -> red
- lug precedes bluf: blue -> blue
- wif precedes bluf: red -> red

When 'bluf' appears after 'dax' or 'lug', the output is 'blue'. This suggests that the rule might be that 'bluf' translates to ""repeat the color of the preceding word.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",-1.230990661232442,146,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color that is determined by the word that comes immediately before it. Let's analyze the patterns:

1. When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue.""
2. When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
3. When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""
4. ""lug"" before ""bluf"" gives us ""blue,"" similar to ""dax.""

Rules found:
- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" -> output is ""blue.""
- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" -> output is ""red.""
- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" -> output is ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" before ""bluf"" -> output is ""blue.""

Now, let's apply the identified rules to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on the word that precedes it. If that word corresponds to a specific color in the output, then ""bluf"" takes that color.

- If the preceding word's corresponding color is ""green,"" there is no example given, but following the pattern, ""bluf"" would likely mean ""green"" in that case.
- If there is no word before ""bluf"" (no preceding word), it repeats the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence.

Using this rule, we can define ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> The color that ""bluf"" represents is determined by the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" or ""lug,"" it means ""blue""; if by ""wif,"" then ""red""; and if by ""zup,"" then ""yellow"". If ""bluf"" is the first word or if no preceding word is given, it repeats the color of the previous word in the output sequence.",-1.3366180074986045,146,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""walm"", let's examine the patterns in the provided input-output pairs. We'll look for consistencies in the transformation from input to output that involve ""walm.""

1. Input: lug walm dax 
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" to green. ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that precedes it.

2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow. Again, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that precedes it.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Once more, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that precedes it with ""wif"" represented as red and an extra ""blue"" at the end, which could correspond to a non-listed ""bluf"" word.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Yet again, we notice that after ""walm,"" the color blue repeats.

5. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   Here, ""walm"" seems to cause the color green to repeat after ""dax"" and before ""wif.""

From the observed patterns, the rule that emerges is that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat.",-0.06082877685255554,146,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

1. Input: lug walm dax | Output: blue blue blue green
2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug | Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf | Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
4. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
5. Input: lug dax walm wif | Output: blue green green green red

Looking at each usage of ""walm,"" we can attempt to discern a pattern based on the output provided.

In the first input, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax"" which results in the sequence ""blue blue blue green."" Since ""lug"" is consistently mapped to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is consistently mapped to ""green,"" we can infer that ""walm"" as used here generates an additional ""blue.""

In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the sequence is ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""walm"" after ""zup"" generates another ""yellow."" Additionally, ""wif lug"" brings about the outputs ""red blue,"" and after ""walm"" the sequence is ""yellow yellow red blue"" which follows the pattern for ""wif lug.""

The third input again has ""walm"" following ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" which continues the pattern of ""walm"" generating an additional ""blue"" when following ""lug.""

In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the ""blue blue"" output pattern recurs.

Finally, in the fifth input, ""walm"" is following ""dax"" and precedes ""wif."" Given that ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and ""lug dax"" to ""blue green,"" then with the addition of ""walm"" it results in ""green green."" When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""green red,"" adhering to the pattern where ""wif"" outputs ""red.""

Through these observations, the pattern suggests that ""walm"" needs to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is ""blue blue,"" and when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output color is ""green green."" Hence, it seems that ""walm"" doubles the color of the prior word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",-0.09329455340704441,146,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's analyze the examples provided and look for patterns that align with the outputs:

1. lug walm dax         -> blue blue blue green
2. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
3. lug walm wif lug bluf     -> blue blue blue red blue blue
4. dax lug walm         -> green blue blue blue
5. lug dax walm wif     -> blue green green green red

From the examples, we notice that ""lug"" is consistently followed by ""blue"" and ""dax"" generally corresponds to ""green"", while ""wif"" seems to align with ""red."" The presence of ""walm"" in different contexts changes the subsequent colors but not immediately, so ""walm"" doesn't translate to a simple static color. Based on these observations, let's formulate a rule:

- After ""lug,"" we see single ""blue"" repeating until we encounter ""walm,"" then ""blue"" repeats once more before a color shift happens.
- Proceeding ""walm,"" other words seem to repeat their corresponding colors. For example, after ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" is still ""blue."" After ""dax lug walm,"" we have ""lug walm"" followed by ""blue blue.""
- In the situations where a color shift occurs (not immediately after ""walm"" but after the repeating pattern), the color change happens on the word after ""walm.""

Now let's try to construct a rule. Given that the nonce word ""walm"" comes after a word, it causes a repetition of that word's associated color on the output once more before a subsequent word's color can appear.

Here's a potential rule based on the examples:
Rule:
- The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated once after ""walm,"" before continuing with the color associated with the next word.

Therefore:
walm -> causes the color of the previous word to repeat once after itself before continuing with the sequence.",-0.1034265022378889,146,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" has an effect on the words that come before it by changing their corresponding outputs to the 'walm' associated output, which is ""blue"". The effect of 'walm' does not extend beyond the preceding word, but it does affect words that occur multiple times before it. The word itself is represented by ""blue"" as well.

Let's analyze the examples to identify the pattern:

- Input: lug walm dax
  Output: **blue** blue blue green
  (The ""lug"" before ""walm"" turns into ""blue"" because of the presence of ""walm"".)

- Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
  Output: red **blue** yellow yellow yellow red blue
  (The ""lug"" before ""walm"" turns into ""blue"", but ""wif"" does not change despite appearing again after ""lug"".)

- Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
  Output: blue **blue** blue red **blue** **blue**
  (The ""lug"" before ""walm"" turns into ""blue"". The ""wif lug"" sequence after ""walm"" follows its normal pattern for those inputs.)

- Input: dax lug walm
  Output: green **blue** blue blue
  (The ""lug"" before ""walm"" turns into ""blue"".)

- Input: lug dax walm wif
  Output: **blue** **green** **green** **green** red
  (The ""lug"" and ""dax"" before ""walm"" both turn into ""blue"", but here ""dax"" is represented as ""green"" which implies that ""walm"" changes the color for each instance of ""dax"" or ""lug"" that precedes it.)

Rule: ""walm"" changes the output of the word preceding it to ""blue"", and the output of ""walm"" itself is ""blue"". If a word, such as ""lug"" or ""dax"", appears multiple times before ""walm,"" each occurrence is affected and outputs ""blue"". 

Therefore:

walm -> turns the preceding word(s) into the output ""blue"" and is also represented by ""blue"" itself.",-0.11929658181411108,146,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

1. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
2. ""dax,"" when it appears before ""walm,"" translates to ""green.""
3. ""wif,"" when it appears after ""walm,"" translates to ""red.""

However, ""walm"" itself is not directly translated to a single color, as it modifies the output color of the word that immediately follows it. In the case of ""lug walm dax,"" walm causes ""dax"" to output ""blue"" instead of its usual ""green."" In ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" ""walm"" causes ""wif"" to output ""blue"" whereas it usually outputs ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce that ""walm"" changes the color attributed to the next word to ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze how the output colors correspond to the inputs:

1. Every time ""wif"" precedes another word, the output is ""red"" for ""wif"" and another color for the subsequent word.
2. The color that follows ""wif"" depends on the word that comes after ""wif.""

Let's look for patterns based on the ""wif"" positioning:

- ""wif walm"" -> red red
- ""wif lug"" -> red blue
- ""wif dax"" -> red green
- ""wif bluf"" -> red red
- ""wif zup"" -> red yellow

""Wif"" itself seems consistent with the output ""red."" However, the words after ""wif"" have different colors when they appear in a different context without ""wif"":

- ""dax"" -> green when not preceded by ""wif""
- ""lug"" -> blue when not preceded by ""wif""
- ""bluf"" -> green when not preceded by ""wif""
- ""zup"" -> yellow when not preceded by ""wif""

When these words are preceded by ""wif,"" they produce different colors:

- ""wif dax"" -> red green (though ""dax"" retains green)
- ""wif lug"" -> red blue (consistent)
- ""wif bluf"" -> red red (changes from green to red)
- ""wif zup"" -> red yellow (consistent)

Given that ""wif"" consistently results in ""red,"" and the second word color seems to change only in the presence of ""wif,"" we may induce that ""wif"" is a function that modifies the color output associated with the word that follows it, with some words retaining their color and others changing.

However, based on the information provided, it is not entirely clear how ""wif"" modifies the subsequent color since there's not a consistent rule for every word following ""wif."" There isn't enough information to determine a complete rule set, but we can draw a preliminary conclusion for ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" outputs ""red"" and may alter the color association of the following word.",-1.0699626707464702,147,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif"", let's analyze the shared characteristics of the examples given.

1. In every example, the presence of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
2. Whenever ""wif"" is present, other words follow, but ""wif"" has a direct correspondence only with the color ""red"", regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence or the presence of other words.

Analyzing the data, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".

Therefore, when we see the word ""wif"" in the input, we can deduce that its output will be ""red"". Using this rule, the meaning of ""wif"" can be determined:

wif -> red.",-1.6034343701578428,147,wif

2. The word after ""wif"" does not seem to affect the color immediately following it (it is always ""red"").
3. The word ""wif"" does not affect the colors that come after the next word. 

Based on these observations, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" irrespective of its position or the context in which it appears. 

Therefore, the rule could be formulated as:

2. zup lug -> yellow blue
3. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
4. dax wif zup -> green red yellow

Now let’s analyze the patterns:

- When ""dax"" is present, the output starts with ""green.""
- When ""walm"" is present, consecutive sequences of ""blue"" are translated to the same number of ""green"" followed by ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" is present, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red.""
- When ""zup"" is present, it precedes a switch to a new color in the pattern, adding ""yellow"" to the output before the color changes.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""zup"":

Rule: ""zup"" indicates an impending change in the color sequence, transitioning with the color ""yellow.""

Given this rule, we can now write out the meaning of ""zup"":

zup -> indicates a color change to the next color, initiated with ""yellow.""",-0.13628833373608107,147,zup

1. ""dax walm zup walm"" outputs ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" The words ""dax"" and ""walm"" are respectively associated with ""green"" three times before ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is associated with ""zup walm.""

2. ""zup lug"" outputs ""yellow blue."" Here ""lug"" is linked to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

3. ""lug walm zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow red."" ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" three times, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""zup"" is preceded by ""yellow.""

5. ""zup lug"" outputs ""yellow blue"" again. This reaffirms the association of ""lug"" with ""blue"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

Examining the above examples, we can determine that ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow."" It does not matter what word comes after ""zup""; it always produces ""yellow."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule about the meaning of ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> meaning. ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" regardless of the context it appears in.",-0.13683570012291893,147,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"". The pattern relates to the word that precedes ""zup"" and the color that corresponds to that word. Let's analyze the patterns:

1. When ""zup"" appears after ""dax"" (related to green), the output is yellow following a series of greens.
2. When ""zup"" appears after ""lug"" (related to blue), the output is yellow following a series of blues.
3. When ""zup"" appears after ""walm"" (related to blue), the output is yellow following a series of blues.
4. When ""zup"" appears after ""wif"" (related to red), the output is yellow after a red.

In every instance, the appearance of ""zup"" results in yellow being outputted after a series of colors corresponding to the word that came before ""zup"". ""Zup"" itself seems to translate to ""yellow"" but also appears to repeat the color pattern of the word that came before it an equal number of times. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

zup -> Emit yellow following the emission of the color associated with the previous word an equal number of times. If there are multiple instances of the previous word, then the color is emitted as many times before yellow is emitted.

Rule: ""zup"" translates to repeating the color associated with the preceding word an equal number of times followed by yellow.",-0.8666805832256759,147,zup
"Based on the provided examples, zup seems to generate an output color that varies depending on its position relative to other words. Each word appears to correspond to a specific color: dax to green, lug to blue, walm to blue (repeated for emphasis as seen in the first example), and wif to red.

When zup appears after these words, the color it produces is yellow, which does not match the color generated by the previous word. This indicates that zup does not mimic the color of the word preceding it but rather introduces its own color, yellow, regardless of the surrounding words. 

Using this information, the rule for zup seems to be:

"Rule: bluf -> the color of the following word.

Explanation: In each example, when the word 'bluf' appears, the output is the color that corresponds to the word that follows 'bluf'. For instance:

- In ""wif bluf,"" 'wif' is translated to 'red' and since 'bluf' indicates we should repeat the color of 'wif', the output is ""red red"".
- In ""dax bluf zup,"" 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'bluf' makes us repeat 'green', and 'zup' translates to 'yellow', producing ""green green yellow"".
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" 'zup' is 'yellow', 'bluf' repeats the color of the next word which is 'wif' ('red'), and 'walm' again corresponds to 'red', yielding ""yellow yellow red red red"".
- In ""dax bluf wif zup lug,"" the pattern follows with 'dax' translating to 'green', 'bluf' indicating a repetition of the color of 'wif' ('red'), 'zup' being 'yellow', and 'lug' corresponding to 'blue', resulting in ""green green red yellow blue"".
- Lastly, in ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" 'dax' is 'green', 'bluf' repeats the color of 'zup' ('yellow'), and the second 'bluf' repeats the color of the next 'dax' ('green'), giving us ""green green yellow yellow green"".

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue

Let's look at each example:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" comes next, ""red"" is repeated.

2. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm

   ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" repeats it, and then ""wif"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""red."" Since ""wif"" is affected by the ""bluf"" before ""walm,"" it is repeated as well.

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""bluf"" repeats it, ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

5. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax

"Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word. 

Each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs is followed by the repeat of the color that corresponds to the word just before ""bluf"". Thus, ""bluf"" functions as an instruction to repeat the color of the previous word:

- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" outputs ""red"", and after ""bluf"" the output is ""red"" again.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the given examples:

1. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
2. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> Output: green green green yellow blue green
3. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
4. ""dax lug walm"" -> Output: green blue blue blue
5. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

In each instance, we can see the following patterns:

- The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.
- ""zup"" is always followed by the color yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Analyzing the context in which ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs, it becomes clear that ""walm"" always results in repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. For instance, in the first example, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" implying that a single ""lug"" results in one blue, and ""walm"" creates two additional blues.

By applying the same logic to other examples, we can reinforce this rule:

- In example 2, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color (green) twice.
- In example 4, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" again, ""walm"" repeats the preceding color (blue) twice.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color of the word before it two times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word twice.",-0.08397926445958766,147,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look at each example and identify the patterns. Let's start by analyzing each example and the associated output:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   In this case, the word ""lug"" precedes and follows ""walm"" and the output for ""lug"" is consistently ""blue."" The word ""zup"" seems responsible for the ""yellow"" output.

2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Here, ""dax"" precedes and follows ""zup"" and the words ""dax"" and ""lug"" produce ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively. Again, ""zup"" results in a ""yellow"" output.

3. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Noting that ""dax"" produces a ""green"" output and ""wif"" results in a ""red"" outcome. ""zup"" in front of ""walm"" results in a ""yellow"" output, which is then followed by another ""yellow"" and a ""red.""

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   We have ""dax"" followed by ""lug"" resulting in ""green"" and ""blue,"" then ""walm"" causing three consecutive ""blue.""

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   The word ""dax"" leads to a ""green"" output and is followed by ""walm,"" producing additional ""green"" before ""zup"" and ""lug,"" after which ""walm"" results in three more ""blue.""

Analyzing the context where ""walm"" appears and its resultant colors, it becomes apparent that ""walm"" frequently results in repeating the previous color. Specifically, when ""walm"" appears immediately after ""lug"" or ""dax,"" it repeats the color associated with these words. However, after ""zup,"" it results in a ""yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" might also reflect the color that follows ""zup.""

From this information, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" results in repeating the color output of the word that precedes it, except when it follows ""zup,"" in which case it outputs ""yellow.""

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: The rule that defines ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the preceding word unless that word is ""zup,"" which changes the output to ""yellow.""",-0.08453116390701029,147,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze how the presence of ""walm"" affects the output colors in the given examples:

1. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue.""
2. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" results in ""green green green yellow blue green.""
3. ""dax zup walm wif"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red.""
4. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue.""
5. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" results in ""green green green yellow blue blue blue.""

Let's break it down:

- In example 1, the occurrence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in repeating the color ""blue.""
- In example 2, the occurrence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in repeating the color ""green.""
- In example 3, the occurrence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" consists of repeating the color ""yellow.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again, and ""blue"" is repeated.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows both ""dax"" and ""lug,"" resulting again in the repetition of the corresponding colors (""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"").

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" signals the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> triggers the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.09902156932859792,147,walm
"To deduce the meaning of walm, we need to compare the inputs and outputs to understand how walm affects the colors displayed in the output. Here is the analysis:

1. Whenever walm precedes zup, the output after walm is a series of three yellow:
   - Input: lug walm zup lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - Input: dax walm zup lug dax -> Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - Input: dax walm zup lug walm -> Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

2. Whenever walm appears on its own, the output repeated is blue:
   - Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
   - Input: lug walm zup lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

3. When walm is followed by wif, the output is yellow followed by red:
   - Input: dax zup walm wif -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Based on the analysis, walm seems to determine the color sequence that follows it in the output. When walm is followed by zup, it results in three yellows; when it stands alone, it results in repetitions of blue; and when followed by wif, it results in yellow followed by red.

Rule: walm -> walm triggers a sequence of colors based on the word following it. If it is followed by zup, three yellows appear; if it stands alone, it repeats the color blue; and if followed by wif, it results in yellow followed by red.",-0.22766911402865975,147,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns before and after each instance of the word ""walm.""

1. In every instance where ""walm"" appears, it is followed by an increase in the occurrence of the corresponding color in the Output. Specifically, ""walm"" is followed by repetition of the color word that would correspond to the word immediately before ""walm.""

2. Before ""walm,"" different words appear (""lug,"" ""dax""), and each of these words is consistently mapped to a color (""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green""). The words ""zup"" and ""wif"" map to ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively, but are not directly relevant to understanding ""walm.""

Based on the information above, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color word that corresponds to the word immediately before it, with each instance of ""walm"" increasing the color word by three repetitions.

Based on this, let's deduce the rules for ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" follows a single color-indicating nonce word, it causes the output to repeat the corresponding color three times.
   - Example: ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
   
2. When ""walm"" follows multiple color-indicating nonce words, it causes the output to repeat each color for as many times as that color has appeared immediately before ""walm,"" adding one additional instance for the last color mentioned.
   - Example: ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" (one ""green"" followed by two ""blue"" and one more ""blue"" because ""blue"" was the last color and should be repeated once more).
   - Example: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red"" (one ""green"" and one ""red,"" then two ""yellow"" followed by two ""red"" and one more ""red"" because ""red"" was the last color mentioned).

This interpretation could be condensed into a more general rule:
- Rule: ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the names of the colors indicated by the nonce words preceding it, repeating the last color mentioned based on how many times it was consecutively said before ""walm"" plus one.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.",-0.09203265882534145,149,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the given sequences and their corresponding outputs. Note that each word in the input is represented by a color in the output. We will analyze the relationship between the input words and the output colors to identify what the word ""bluf"" signifies. 

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the color is yellow. When it follows ""zup,"" it is also yellow. When it follows ""wif,"" it is red. 

2. ""Bluf"" is the only common word in all the outputs, so let's consider the other words:

- dax -> green (in the first and third examples, dax corresponds to green regardless of its position)
- zup -> yellow (consistent in the first and third examples)
- wif -> red (consistent in the second and fourth examples)
- lug -> blue (only in the third example, but lug maps to blue)

Now that we have the meanings for the other words, let's re-examine the sequence where ""bluf"" appears:

- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or ""wif,"" it outputs a similar color to the word it follows (green follows dax -> yellow, zup -> yellow, wif -> red). 

- When ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" the same pattern is observed: it mimics the color of the word it is next to. 

Based on the above observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" assumes the color corresponding to the word it is next to, either preceding or following it.

Hence, the meaning of ""bluf"" could be:

bluf -> takes on the color of the adjacent word.",-0.7498124989352438,149,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output color corresponds to a specific input word. Each instance of ""bluf"" is translated to the color ""red"". Here's the breakdown:

- Every time ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
- Every time ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".
- Every time ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- Every time ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
- Every time ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" is directly associated with the color ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red",-0.8855554683645123,149,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule of ""bluf,"" we can examine each input and corresponding output while paying attention to the word positions and their associated colors.

Here are the observations:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it is mapped to the color yellow. In each other context, ""bluf"" is mapped to the color red. This suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it unless preceded by ""dax,"" in which case the rule for ""bluf"" changes.

2. ""dax"" consistently maps to green, and ""zup"" consistently maps to yellow regardless of their position, indicating stable color mappings for these words. ""Lug"" always maps to blue, and ""wif"" conceptually maps to red based on the available examples.

3. The position of ""bluf"" appears critical to understanding its rule, as it changes between red and yellow based on its position relative to ""dax.""

Based on the examples, we can derive the following rule:

bluf -> If preceded by ""dax,"" output yellow. In all other cases, output red.

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it takes the color yellow; otherwise, it takes the color red.",-0.9038715124356096,149,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color represented by the word that comes before it. In every situation, the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the word that directly precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means the output is the same color as the color represented by the word immediately before ""bluf"".",-1.4673439341243908,149,bluf
"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the output by producing a sequence of the color ""yellow."" The number of times ""yellow"" is repeated corresponds to the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence. Each word in the input appears to correspond to a specific color in the output.

Let's analyze the occurrence of ""walm"" in the provided examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""walm"" appears second and last (sixth) in the input, resulting in three yellows after it (since it's the last word in the sequence) and two yellows after the first ""walm.""

2. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   ""Walm"" appears fourth, producing three yellows after it.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""Walm"" appears second, resulting in two yellows after it.

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" appears sixth, resulting in three yellows after it.

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   ""Walm"" appears second, and one yellow is expected after it, but since ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" it seems the presence of another word (wif) after ""walm"" changes the pattern, and ""walm"" does not produce yellows after it.

With these observations, we can deduce a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is at the end of the input, it produces n-1 yellows where n is the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. However, if another word follows ""walm,"" the expected sequence of yellows is not produced.

Based on the rule induction, the meaning of ""walm"" in the context can be stated as:

walm -> meaning: A command that typically results in a pattern of ""yellow"" outputs corresponding to its position in the input string unless followed by another word which stops the pattern.",-0.08262034699506253,149,walm
"To identify the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of colors in the output for each instance where ""walm"" appears.

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Focusing on the outputs, we can see the following relationships:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it produces a sequence of three reds, exception being when ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence (red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow; green green green red).
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it produces a sequence of three greens (green green green).
3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it produces two yellows following a blue (yellow yellow yellow).
4. When ""walm"" is not preceded immediately by another word but occurs after some sequence, it again produces a sequence of colors starting with green (green green green) or yellow (yellow yellow yellow).

> Notice that the color sequence starts with the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" but adds repetitions of ""green"" for ""dax"" or ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

The rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word three times. However, this rule doesn't hold if another word comes right after ""walm,"" in which case the sequence is interrupted.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:
Rule: ""walm"" -> when following another word, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with that word three times. If another word immediately follows ""walm,"" the sequence may not always hold.",-0.09022245181692705,149,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each time the word ""walm"" is used, the output is a sequence of ""green"" repeated for the count of the words that precede ""walm"" plus one. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first line, ""walm"" occurs twice, and after each ""walm,"" there are three ""yellow"" which equals the number of words before it, plus one additional ""yellow"".
- In the second line, ""walm"" is used once, and there are three ""green"" after it, which is the count of the words before ""walm"" plus one.
- In the third line, there are three ""green"" following ""walm,"" which again equals the number of words before ""walm"" (1) plus two.
- In the fourth line, there are three ""yellow"" after ""walm,"" which again is the number of words before ""walm"" (2) plus one.
- In the fifth line, ""walm"" is preceded by two words and followed by three ""green"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will analyze the patterns given in the examples:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears by itself or is the first word in a sequence, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by different words such as ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""walm,"" the sequence affects the output. It seems ""dax"" does not change the meaning of the words that come after it, but rather each word is directly translated to a color:

    - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
    - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns before and after the word appears in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. In the first input-output pair, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow."" Here ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Since ""bluf"" appears between two words that repeat (in this case ""lug"" and ""wif"") and result in the output ""blue blue,"" it seems like bluf might be repeating the color that comes before it.

2. In the second input-output pair, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red."" Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is again ""blue."" When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" the output is still ""blue."" It once again seems to repeat the color before it, irrespective of what comes after.

3. The third input-output pair, ""dax walm wif bluf,"" translates to ""green green green red red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows a ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output once again has ""red"" after ""bluf.""

4. In the fourth input-output pair, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" and ""lug"" directly corresponds to ""blue"" in the fifth input-output pair (""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue""). Given these instances, ""bluf"" is simply repeating the color that immediately precedes it.

"Analyzing the examples provided for patterns in relation to the word ""walm"" and its corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   
3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   
4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   
5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

Based on the input and output patterns, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color of the word(s) immediately prior to ""walm"" the number of times equal to the total number of words that came before ""walm"" plus one (including ""walm"" itself in the count). 

For example:
- In input 1, before ""walm,"" there are five words, and ""walm"" is the sixth word. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated six times.
- In input 2, ""walm"" is the second and fourth words. ""Dax"" comes once before the first ""walm"" (green is repeated twice), and ""wif"" comes before the second ""walm"" (red is repeated three times).
- In input 3, ""walm"" is the seventh word; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""red"" is repeated seven times.
- In input 4, ""walm"" is the third word; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" hence ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In input 5, ""walm"" is the second word; ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""blue"" is repeated twice.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word a number of times equal to the number of words present before ""walm"" inclusive.
",-0.07416978844150003,150,walm
"Rule: walm repeats the color of the immediately preceding word an additional two times.

Explanation:

walm seems to affect the word before it by repeating the color that word represents two more times. This is evident because every occurrence of walm results in a repetition of the previous color, adding two more instances of that color to the output.

In a structured form based on the examples:
- Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue 
  Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
  Analysis: 'zup' results in yellow, and then 'walm' follows, which causes 'yellow' to be said two more times, making it three 'yellow' in a row.

- Output: green green green red red red
  Input: dax walm wif walm
  Analysis: 'dax' is green, followed by 'walm', which repeats 'green' two more times. Then 'wif' is red, followed by 'walm', repeating 'red' two more times.

- Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
  Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
  Analysis: 'wif' is red, then 'walm' comes after it, causing 'red' to repeat two additional times.

- Output: blue red red red
  Input: lug wif walm
  Analysis: 'wif' is red, and 'walm' makes it appear two more times.

"To induce the rule for the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the examples provided and look for patterns. We will examine each instance of ""dax"" and the corresponding color in the Output:

- Here, ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
- Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and both lead to a ""green"" output.

- In this context, ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""

Input: zup dax zup lug
Output: yellow green yellow blue

- Here, ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds with ""green"" both times.

In each example where ""dax"" is used, the output is consistently ""green."" Thus, the rule seems quite straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.0709190837364253,151,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word dax, let's identify the patterns and outputs associated with its usage from the examples provided.

1. zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   
   Here, whenever the input has ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""yellow."" When the input has ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" and comes after ""zup,"" so ""bluf"" does not directly correspond to ""yellow,"" because ""zup"" is in front of it. But ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" when it comes after ""wif.""

2. dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   
   Here, the input starts with ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" ""Walm"" and ""zup"" follow ""dax"" and result in ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, denoting that the presence of ""dax"" has not changed the output for ""zup"" compared to the first example. ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" consistently following ""zup.""

3. zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue

   Again, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" ""Dax"" remains corresponding to ""green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" consistently means ""green,"" independent of its position relative to ""zup"" and ""lug.""

4. zup dax zup lug
   Output: yellow green yellow blue

   This sequence reiterates the correlation of ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

5. dax wif dax
   Output: green red green

   When ""dax"" appears before ""wif,"" it translates to ""green,"" and when ""wif"" appears after ""dax,"" it represents ""red."" When ""dax"" appears again, it maintains its association with ""green.""

From these observations, we can induce a rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" is corresponding to the color ""green.""

Here is the rationale:

In every example where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"":

- In the second example, where the input is ""dax walm zup lug,"" and the corresponding output is ""green green green yellow blue,"" ""dax"" is the first word and is translated to ""green.""
- Similarly, in the first example, the sequence ""wif dax wif"" in the input correlates to the sequence ""red green red"" in the output, suggesting that ""dax"" stands for ""green"" as it is the middle term of both sequences.
- This pattern holds across all the examples provided, with ""dax"" consistently resulting in the output of ""green,"" no matter its position or repetition within the sequence.

Hence, the rule is: dax -> green",-0.8150317695100001,151,dax
"Based on the given examples, we observe that different words correspond to different colors in the output. The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each instance where it appears.

Here's the pattern from the given examples:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""dax,"" but we don't see ""wif"" in another context, so we can't conclude its meaning beyond following ""dax.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" only in its appearance, and we have no other examples to confirm its meaning outside of its pairing with ""dax.""

Based on this information, we can determine the meaning of ""dax"" as follows:

Rule: dax -> green (regardless of context, ""dax"" translates to ""green"").",-0.9704228131195404,151,dax

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output is ""green,"" and the same color follows for any word thereafter until ""zup"" appears.
- The word ""dax"" itself results in ""green"" when it appears at the beginning of a sequence or after certain other words, but not consistently after ""wif.""

1. Whenever ""zup"" appears by itself, the output is ""yellow"".
2. When ""zup"" appears with ""lug"", the output is ""yellow"" followed by ""blue"" for ""lug"".
3. The order in which words appear in the input determines the order of colors in the output.
4. ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"".
5. ""wif"" is not explicitly shown by itself, but it appears before ""lug"" in one example and the output is ""red"" before ""blue"", so we might infer that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
6. ""walm"" is not shown separately, but in one example, it appears twice after ""zup"", and the output is two additional ""yellow""s, indicating that ""walm"" could be interpreted as another ""zup"" or also means ""yellow"" in this context.

Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" and ""dax"" by ""green.""

2 - zup bluf -> yellow yellow

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""zup"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""yellow.""

4 - lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
In this example, we again see that ""lug"" equals ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" equates to the color preceding it, which in this case is ""blue."" However, this seems to contradict the earlier observation where ""bluf"" corresponded to ""yellow.""

5 - zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
Here, ""walm"" does not have a direct color equivalent, but rather seems to be a repetition of the color of the preceding word, which is ""yellow"" from ""zup."" The word ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" follows with ""red,"" which is the color that follows ""lug"" in the second sequence.

Given the patterns revealed through each example, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color that precedes it, when the previous word is not a new color word. If ""bluf"" follows a new color word like ""lug"" or ""dax,"" it takes the color that typically follows that new color word (e.g., after ""lug,"" the next color is ""green,"" and after ""dax,"" the next color is ""red""). Therefore, ""bluf"" represents a repeat or continuation of the current color sequence.

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the preceding color when not following a new color word, but when following a new color word, it assumes the color that typically follows that new color word.",-0.10571631814687636,151,bluf
"Given the example inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce the rule or meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"".

In the first example:
- Input: zup wif dax wif **bluf**
- Output: yellow red green red **red**

In this case, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".

In the second example:
- Input: zup **bluf**
- Output: yellow **yellow**

In this instance, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".

In the third example:
- Input: zup **bluf** lug dax lug
- Output: yellow **yellow** blue green blue

Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

In the fourth example:
- Input: lug **bluf** dax **bluf**
- Output: blue **blue** green **green**

Here, ""bluf"" first maps to ""blue"" and then in the subsequent use, to ""green"". This suggests that ""bluf"" might not have a fixed meaning but could be context-dependent.

In the fifth example:
- Input: zup walm lug wif **bluf**
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red **red**

In this context, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

From these examples, we can induce that ""bluf"" does not map to a single consistent color, hence the rule is not a direct translation to a specific word. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to change contextually based on the words that precede it.

One potential rule could be that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. For example, if ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", then ""wif bluf"" would result in ""red red"". If ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", then ""lug bluf"" would result in ""blue blue"", and so on.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color translation of the word that immediately precedes it.",-0.12061163913591008,151,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color whenever it appears. To deduce the rule, we can compare each instance of ""bluf"" to the color that follows it in the output.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by two reds, which follows ""wif"" that was already associated with red. This might indicate that ""bluf"" is also red, but let's check more examples.
  
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", and the corresponding output is yellow following another yellow. Since ""zup"" is already linked with yellow, this suggests that ""bluf"" may also be yellow.

- In the third example, ""lug"" is followed by blue, and ""dax"" by green. In the sequence, ""bluf"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax"". The output following ""bluf"" is ""yellow blue"". Since yellow is already linked with ""zup,"" the third example diverges from the initial hypothesis.

- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" to green. ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" here and is associated with green, despite following blue in the output. Another ""bluf"" in the sequence gives us another green in the output.

- In the fifth example, ""lug"" and ""wif"" follow ""bluf"", and their corresponding outputs are yellow and red, respectively. The preceding ""zup"" and ""walm"" are both associated with yellow, and ""bluf"" is associated with red in the output, following a blue (which corresponds to ""lug"").

From the examples given, a discernible pattern indicates that ""bluf"" results in the color that succeeds it in the output, suggesting that ""bluf"" might act as a placeholder for the following color. However, the second and third examples contradict this rule since ""bluf"" precedes the color it supposedly represents in the output sequence.

Given the contradictions and inconsistency with the second and third examples, a clear and definitive rule for ""bluf"" cannot be established with certainty. It's possible that ""bluf"" requires additional context or rules not provided in the examples.

For a tentative rule based on the given information, though it's not consistent:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and the output for ""bluf"" is also red.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is the only word besides ""zup,"" and it corresponds to the color yellow, which is also the output for ""zup.""

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and it corresponds to the color of the word preceding it, blue for ""lug"" and green for ""dax.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color red.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence.

3. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue.

The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color corresponding to the word right before it, except for the case when it follows ""walm,"" in which case the output is red. This exception might be due to an additional rule regarding ""walm,"" or because the color associated to ""bluf"" when following ""walm"" simply happens to be red in this example.

We don't have enough information to determine a color for ""bluf,"" but for all the other words we do have consistent colors assigned—except for ""walm."" 

Taking a closer look, it seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Here’s the breakdown:
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output color is ""red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" also follows ""wif"" and the output color is ""red.""
- In the third and fifth examples, the ""walm"" that follows ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- In the third and fourth examples, when ""walm"" is at the end or follows ""zup,"" it changes the output color of ""zup"" from ""yellow"" to ""red.""

Looking at the fourth example, we see that ""walm"" followed by another ""walm"" also results in ""red,"" hence we can deduce that ""walm"" doesn't change color once it's already red.

So the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""walm"" -> the same color as the word immediately prior to it.

To formalize the rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-0.08664086358867859,151,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's analyze the patterns in the given examples and their corresponding outputs.

1. In the first input, ""wif walm dax zup"", ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output. In this context, ""wif"" and ""dax"" also correspond to ""red"", while ""zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow"".

2. In the second input, ""dax wif walm"", ""walm"" corresponds to the last ""red"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to the second ""red"".

3. In the third input, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"", ""walm"" corresponds to the second and seventh ""red"". ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

4. In the fourth input, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"", ""walm"" corresponds to the seventh and eighth ""yellow"". Interestingly, the second ""yellow"" could be representing a change in the pattern due to trailing ""walm"".

5. Finally, in the fifth input, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", ""walm"" corresponds to the sixth ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red"".

The consistent observation is that ""wif"" almost always corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". However, ""walm"" appears to take on the color associated with ""wif"" in most contexts, except for the fourth input where it corresponds with ""yellow"", but this deviation can possibly be attributed to its position at the end of the sequence affecting the pattern.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it takes on the color ""red"" unless it is followed by another ""walm"", in which case the color changes.

Rule: walm -> red (with an exception that if followed by another ""walm"", the color may change, possibly to yellow, although the pattern isn't clear with the information provided).",-0.4363995952562501,151,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can correlate each instance of ""walm"" in the provided sentences with the associated colors in the output.

- In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to a red output.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is also linked to a red output.
- In the third example, ""walm"" appears twice and corresponds to red outputs both times.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears twice; the first instance corresponds with yellow and the second instance with yellow again, which seems to contradict earlier examples.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" corresponds to red once more.

Looking for consistency, in four out of five examples, ""walm"" corresponds with red. However, the fourth example is at odds with this pattern, showing ""walm"" corresponding with yellow twice. Since ""walm"" precedes ""zup"" in the fourth instance and the color yellow follows it, we can infer that the color yellow is not tied to ""walm"" but to the word ""zup.""

Therefore, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: walm -> red

This rule suggests that ""walm"" consistently results in the color red, except when followed by ""zup,"" which seems to override the output due to ""zup"" itself, not because of ""walm."" The inconsistency arises due to the presence of another element in the sequence (""zup""), which might change the color independently of ""walm.""",-1.4967153283714278,151,walm

- There are no instances where ""walm"" itself has a color associated with it in the output.

Output: green green

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Looking at the outputs associated with ""dax,"" we see that every time ""dax"" appears in an input, the corresponding output is ""green."" It is also important to observe that the color output depends on the position of ""dax"" when combined with other words. When ""dax"" appears first, it is followed by ""green;"" when it appears last or in other positions, it is also followed by ""green.""

Now, analyzing the combination with other words:

- ""zup"" yields ""yellow"" when combined with ""dax"" but ""green"" does not change, indicating that ""zup"" is not affecting ""dax's"" associated color.
- ""bluf"" yields ""yellow"" when it is in combination with ""zup"" but yields ""green"" when presented with ""dax"" alone.
- Different words like ""lug"" and ""walm"" yield ""blue,"" while ""wif"" yields ""red,"" which shows that different words have their own corresponding colors, but ""dax"" consistently correlates with ""green.""

Given this information, it appears that the meaning of ""dax"" is not dependent on context or combination with other words, as it produces the same output each time.

- In the first example, ""dax"" is accompanied by ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" and the output is ""green yellow yellow."" However, from the third example, ""dax bluf"" generates ""green green."" This indicates that ""bluf"" on its own can also translate to ""green,"" making its pairing with ""dax"" somewhat redundant in this case.
- In the second example, ""dax zup"" leads to the output ""green yellow."" With ""dax"" having already been associated with ""green,"" it suggests that ""zup"" would then correspond to ""yellow.""
- Next, ""dax"" in isolation with ""bluf"" in the third example produces ""green green,"" which further supports the idea that both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" individually result in ""green.""
- The fourth example involves ""lug walm dax,"" with the output being ""blue blue blue green."" As ""dax"" is the final word and ""green"" is the final color in the sequence, it seems consistent that ""dax"" would again correspond to ""green."" The first two words, ""lug"" and ""walm,"" must then correspond to ""blue.""
- Lastly, the presence of ""wif"" and ""dax"" in the fifth example results in ""red green."" Since ""dax"" is once again associated with ""green,"" it would imply that ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

- Given the previous determination of ""dax"" as green and ""wif"" as red, ""bluf"" must translate to red in this context.

In the third input-output pair:
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"".
- Here, ""lug"" translates to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" appears to translate to yellow. ""Bluf"" takes the place that outputs yellow, so in this case, ""bluf"" would mean yellow.

In the fourth input-output pair:
- ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red"".
- ""Lug"" maintains the translation as blue, and ""wif"" as red. ""Bluf"" appears where the color blue is output, so it translates to blue here.

In the fifth input-output pair:
- ""lug zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green"".
- Here, ""lug"" translates to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green. ""Bluf"" corresponds to where the output is yellow, so ""bluf"" would mean yellow here.

The findings are inconsistent across examples. However, based on the pattern, it's noticeable that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word's defined color (for example, ""lug"" translates to blue and ""lug bluf"" translates to blue blue). Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to be a chameleon word that takes on the meaning of the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" follows a word that translates to blue, then ""bluf"" means blue; if it follows a word that translates to red, then ""bluf"" means red; if it follows yellow, then ""bluf"" means yellow, etc.",-0.1009146360193103,153,bluf
"Given the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. In each example, colors are mapped from words. To deduce what ""bluf"" means, let's look at the instances:

1. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue"". Here, ""wif"" is consistently mapped to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". ""dax"" is ""green"" in this same sentence.

2. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"". Since ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"", ""bluf"" maps to ""red"".

3. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow"", ""dax"" with ""green"", and ""lug"" with ""blue"". Based on ""lug"", the last ""bluf"" in this sentence should also map to ""blue"".

4. ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red"". ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", which means in this context ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".

5. ""lug zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green"". ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""dax"" is ""green"". Hence, ""bluf"" has to be ""yellow"" in this case.

The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be context-dependent:

- In the first, third, and fourth examples, it translates to ""blue"".
- In the second example, it translates to ""red"".
- In the fifth example, it translates to ""yellow"".

The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" stands for the color word that directly follows it in the sequence. To confirm:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", so ""bluf"" maps to ""red"" (but it seems to be an inconsistency based on the rest of the observations).
- In example 2, no word follows ""bluf"", and it maps to ""red"" (as a default?).
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is followed by nothing, but it is in a sequence preceded by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" maps to ""blue"".
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", but ""bluf"" maps to ""blue"" which is the color word before it.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"", but ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow"", which is the color word immediately before it.

The rule for ""bluf"" is not entirely clear based on these examples. However, the most consistent pattern is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color word immediately before it or follows a default when it stands at the end or start of a sequence. For now, I will tentatively deduce:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it, with exceptions in undetermined contexts. Exceptions suggest that when ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence, it may default to ""red"".",-0.10979428913997702,153,bluf

- In example 2, ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue"". ""Dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated two more times.
- In example 3, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". Here, ""lug"" (blue) is repeated twice after ""walm"".
- In example 4, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" (blue) is repeated twice after ""walm"".

- ""dax walm zup lug"": ""dax"" translates to green, ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax"" three times, then ""zup"" translates to yellow, followed by ""lug"" which is blue.

- In the second example, the word ""dax"" which corresponds to green is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green yellow blue"". ""Walm"" replicates the color green twice.
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color blue. The output ""blue blue blue"" following ""walm"" suggests that ""walm"" has taken the color blue from ""lug"" and replicated it twice.

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to deduce a rule or pattern from the given inputs and outputs. Let's analyze the position and corresponding output color of ""dax"" in each input:

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - ""dax"" appears first and is green, but when it appears again at the end, it's associated with red.

2. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - The single appearance of ""dax"" at the end is green.

3. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   - ""dax"" is first and is green.

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""dax"" is first and is green.

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" is first and is green.

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

- ""dax"" alone or at the beginning of a sequence is green.
- ""dax"" when repeated in a sequence turns red.

Now, let's refine the rule considering that in every input where ""dax"" appears without repetition, it's always green, regardless of its position. But when ""dax"" is repeated, it is green the first time and red the second time.

Considering this pattern, it's probable that ""dax"" being green indicates the first occurrence, and ""dax"" being red indicates a repeated occurrence within the same sequence. However, we don't have enough data to determine the colors associated with other words, or what if ""dax"" occurs more than twice.

Rule: ""dax"" -> first occurrence in a sequence is green, and the second (repeated) occurrence in the same sequence is red.",-0.08872556477299998,154,dax
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""dax"", we need to analyze its occurrence in different contexts and correlate that with the outputs given:

1. In the first example, when ""dax"" appears before and after ""walm"" and before ""wif,"" the output is green, except for the position after ""wif"" where the color is red.

2. In the second example, ""dax"" appears after ""wif,"" resulting in green.

3. In the third example, ""dax"" precedes ""zup,"" and the output is green.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" is at the beginning and is followed by ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif,"" resulting in green for ""dax"" and different colors for the other words, with ""wif"" being followed by red.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" is at the beginning again and is followed by different words, always resulting in green for ""dax.""

From these observations, we can infer the following potential rule for ""dax"":

""dax"" always results in the output green, regardless of its position or the words around it.
  
Therefore, the rule is:

"Based on the examples provided, there is a consistent pattern that when the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" is included in the corresponding output. Other words seem to translate into different colors consistently as well (""walm"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow, etc.), regardless of their position in the sequence. The word ""dax"" does not seem to vary in meaning based on context; its presence always results in the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",-1.4744669012809999,154,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine its occurrences and the corresponding outputs:

From examples 2 and 4 which are identical, we can conclude that ""wif bluf"" consistently results in ""red red."" This suggests ""bluf"" does not change the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.

In examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""dax,"" which are associated with the colors yellow and green, respectively. After ""bluf"" is introduced, the pattern of colors continues but with ""yellow"" repeated after ""zup"" and ""red"" repeated after ""wif.""

In example 5, ""lug"" is added to the input after ""wif bluf."" This results in ""blue"" being added to the output. This suggests that ""bluf"" itself does not change the output, but allows for the output of the next word (in this case, ""lug"") to show up in the output sequence.

Taking all of this into account, ""bluf"" most likely signifies a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. If there is a word after ""bluf,"" then it seems to proceed with the color associated with that word.

Given this information, the rule seems to be: Whenever ""bluf"" is present, the output is ""red red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Hence, we can conclude:

To deduce a rule, let's analyze the outputs associated with the other words:

- ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

Given that ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" are associated with single colors while ""bluf"" consistently outputs two reds in a row, we can infer that ""bluf"" represents a duplication or repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. If ""bluf"" is indeed a duplicator, then the examples provided do not directly show what the standalone meaning of ""bluf"" may be since it always follows another word. However, the last example shows that adding ""lug"" after ""bluf"" results in an additional ""blue,"" which may suggest that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" or that ""lug"" changes the output sequence in some manner.

From the above observations, it seems ""bluf"" correlates to ""red red"" but the rule might not be complete given that other words influence the output when they follow ""bluf,"" as seen in the case with ""lug.""

"From the provided examples, we can induce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the duplication of the color that follows a set of color-indicating rules. Here's the pattern observed:

- ""lug"" on its own produced ""blue"", but when preceded by ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- ""dax"" on its own did not appear, but when preceded by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- ""walm"" on its own did not appear, but ""bluf dax walm"" produced ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" following ""dax"" which follows ""bluf"" adds an extra ""green.""
- ""zup"" on its own produced ""yellow,"" but when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the examples given and look for patterns that correspond with the occurrence of the word ""walm."" 

Looking at the first example:
- Input: dax wif walm lug zup
- Output: green red red red blue yellow

In this example, ""walm"" is associated with three ""red"" colors in the output.

Moving on to the second example:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" is associated with two extra ""yellow"" colors.

Now, the third example:
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
- Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

In this example, ""walm"" follows a sequence that results in two additional ""blue"" outputs.

Following with the fourth example:
- Input: lug walm
- Output: blue blue blue

Again, ""walm"" is associated with two extra ""blue"" outputs.

Lastly, the fifth example:
- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
- Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Here, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of three ""red"" outputs. 

By analyzing the patterns:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, it is followed by multiple outputs of the same color immediately after.
2. The number of repeated colors corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm.""
3. The colors corresponding to the words are:
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""bluf"" -> blue (from the third example)

Therefore, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated multiple times. The exact number is not directly given, but it appears to be at least two repetitions based on these examples.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the previous word to be repeated multiple times in the output.",-0.04629765923111459,155,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a pattern in which the output color repeats as many times as the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input. Here's the observed pattern:

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- ""walm"" appears after two words, thus ""red"" is repeated twice.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" appears after one word, thus ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- ""walm"" appears after four words, thus ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""walm"" appears after one word, thus ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- ""walm"" appears after five words, thus ""red"" is repeated four times after ""walm"".

From these observations, the rule can be summarized as:

walm -> The color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the input is repeated a number of times equal to the total count of words that came before ""walm,"" ignoring ""walm"" itself.

Rule: If x is the color associated with the word immediately before walm, and n is the number of words before walm in the sequence, then the output of walm is x repeated n times.",-0.0766069180673646,155,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let us examine the examples and their corresponding outputs:

- In the first example, ""dax wif walm lug zup"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow."" The only repeating color is ""red,"" which occurs thrice following ""wif walm lug.""

- In the second example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow."" We see the color ""yellow"" repeated thrice.

- In the third example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" Following the word ""walm,"" there are three ""blue"" colors.

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue."" Again, we see the color ""blue"" repeated thrice after ""walm.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" There is a sequence of ""red red red"" following ""wif walm lug.""

Comparing inputs to outputs in all examples, it becomes apparent that the word ""walm"" is connected to the repetition of the last mentioned color three times. To confirm this rule, we observe that after each instance of ""walm,"" the color that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the input is the color that is repeated thrice in the output.

Rule: walm -> repetition of the last mentioned color three times",-0.09856088614531251,155,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the given examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the corresponding output is ""red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" might be related to duplicating the color associated with the following word, lug -> blue becomes red red.
- In the second example, the output is three yellows, and ""walm"" is the only word before ""zup,"" which we know translates to yellow. This again indicates duplication or triplication.
- In the third example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and the output for that sequence is ""blue blue blue."" This reaffirms the idea of ""walm"" causing a triplication effect.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" which is consistent with the triplication rule.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows several words, and the color pattern becomes ""red blue red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might be duplicating the colors that came before it in reverse order up to the first instance of ""bluf"" (since blue is the color for ""bluf"").

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word (if there is one) to be repeated two or three times. The specific number of repetitions (duplication or triplication) might be influenced by the presence and position of other words, but based on the given examples, the exact mechanism for determining the number is not clear. The last example also shows ""walm"" causing a reverse duplication of the sequence of colors.

"Considering the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output position. Here are the observations:

Input: wif dax wif lug wif

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The word ""wif"" before and after ""dax"" corresponds to ""red.""

Specifically, when ""bluf"" is directly before ""dax,"" this could be changing its corresponding output. But with the limited examples, it's hard to determine a consistent rule for the exception. 

With more examples, especially isolating ""bluf"" with different surrounding words, one might figure out if ""bluf"" has more than one meaning or whether its meaning changes based on context.

Rule: ""bluf"" typically means ""blue"", except in certain contexts where the surrounding words might affect its meaning. The examples provided are insufficient to establish a rule for these exceptions.",-1.3724832183294735,156,bluf
"The nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue"" in the output, but it's not a simple one-to-one mapping. Instead, it seems to depend on the words that come immediately before ""bluf."" More specifically, here's what appears to happen:

- If ""lug"" comes right before ""bluf,"" there are two ""blue"" outputs in a row.
- In all other cases, ""bluf"" corresponds to a single ""blue"" in the output.

From the examples provided, here is the rule that I can deduce:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" in the output. If ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug,"" it results in two ""blue"" outputs in a row (""blue blue""). Otherwise, ""bluf"" just results in a single ""blue"" output.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to change the output colors to all be the same color as the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, until a different non-""walm"" word appears that changes the color sequence.

For instance:
- ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow,"" with ""walm"" continuing the red from ""wif"" until ""dax"" changes it to green, and ""zup"" finally changes it to yellow.
- ""dax walm wif dax"" shows ""green green green red green,"" with ""walm"" causing the continuation of green after ""dax,"" until ""wif"" changes it to red.
- ""zup lug walm"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue"" because ""walm"" extends the blue from ""lug.""
- ""dax walm"" has ""green green green"" because ""walm"" repeats the green from ""dax.""
- ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow"" because ""walm"" extends the blue from ""lug"" until ""zup"" changes it to yellow.

2. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
3. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow

By comparing these lines, we can see that the color following ""walm"" is always the same as the color that corresponds to the word before ""walm"". Therefore, we can deduce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color output of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output of the previous word.",-0.08954749912705,156,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the word's position in each input and the corresponding output:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
3. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow

Firstly, observe the pattern for the given inputs and outputs:
- ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red.""
- ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green.""
- ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue.""

Now, analyzing the use of ""walm"":
- In the first and second examples, ""walm"" appears next to words of different colors (red, green), and the output color for ""walm"" matches the color of the word before it.
- In the third and fifth examples, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" (blue) and before ""zup"" (yellow) or without another word after it, and the output color for ""walm"" continues to be blue.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" does not have any word following it and it follows ""dax"" (green), with the output remaining green.

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word, or maintain the same color if it's the last word and there's no word to take a color from after it. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the preceding word or maintain the same color if it is the last word without any following word to influence its color.",-0.09337179245992504,156,walm
"The input-output pairs suggest that the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color indicated by the previous word. To illustrate this:

- ""wif walm dax"": ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" repeats this color for the next one or two words, here both ""walm"" and ""dax"" result in ""red."" ""zup"" then changes to ""yellow.""
- ""dax walm wif dax"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" for the next two words: ""walm"" and ""wif."" Finally, ""dax"" changes it back to ""green.""
- ""zup lug walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" changes to ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" repeats ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green.""

"Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context or surrounding words. 

Let's break down the examples:

- In the first example, the input ""wif"" alone results in the output ""red"".

- In the second example, the input ""dax wif"" results in ""green red"". Here, ""dax"" can be inferred to mean ""green"", while ""wif"" remains ""red"".

- In the third example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"". We can surmise that ""zup"" means ""yellow"", and ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".

- The fourth example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"", results in ""red blue blue red yellow"". We see that ""wif"" leads to ""red"" in two instances within the same input. ""lug"" and ""bluf"" each translate to ""blue"", and ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow"".

- In the last example, ""wif walm zup"" correlates with ""red red red yellow"". It is established that ""zup"" equals ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""walm"" in this case seems to be redundant or has no meaning because it is translated to ""red"" which is the meaning for ""wif"". So, ""wif"" here keeps its meaning and ""walm"" is assumed to either emphasize the meaning of ""wif"" or carry no meaning of its own.

From these observations, the rule we can induce is:

wif -> meaning. Meaning: red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in all given contexts.",-0.09642374753197058,157,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Every time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the output. Additionally, other words seem to correspond to other specific colors:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""blue""
- ""walm"" has not been explicitly paired with a color other than ""red"", but based on the last example that includes ""walm"" and ""zup"", it is followed by ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is outputted in the corresponding position in the sequence.",-0.5963634862935296,157,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- The output always contains the color ""red"" whenever the input contains the nonce word ""wif.""
  
Now let's analyze the outputs associated with other words:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" and ""bluf"" output ""blue,"" but there's only one instance of ""lug"" and it coincides with a ""bluf,"" so the induction for ""lug"" isn't as strong as for ""bluf.""

The pattern shows that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. However, we don't have enough examples of ""wif"" combined with different words to conclusively determine if ""wif"" always translates to ""red"" regardless of position or combination with other words. But based on the given examples, this seems to be the case.

- ""walm"" appears once, corresponding to ""red,"" but since ""wif"" also translates to ""red,"" it's unclear if ""walm"" has the same output as ""wif"" or is inheriting the color due to the presence of ""wif.""

Based on the inputs and outputs provided, the working rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be:

- ""zup lug"" yields ""yellow blue""; ""lug"" must mean ""blue"".
- ""lug walm zup"" yields ""blue blue blue yellow""; ""walm"" seems to be repeated for ""blue"".
- ""zup lug walm"" yields ""yellow blue blue blue""; this aligns with the previous conclusions.
- ""zup dax bluf"" yields ""yellow green green""; ""dax"" likely means ""green"", and ""bluf"" might be a repeat or intensifier for ""green"".
- ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" yields ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""; ""wif"" means ""red"", reinforcing that ""walm"" and ""lug"" are ""blue"".

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the pattern suggests that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green."" The presence of ""zup"" in the sequence translates into ""yellow"" added at the beginning.

- ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" -> ""red blue blue red yellow"" (again ""lug"" before ""bluf"" results in ""blue blue"")

From this pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color corresponding to the preceding word. For example, if ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""",-0.13054206782391886,158,bluf
"bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: When the word bluf follows a word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated twice. For example, the word that precedes bluf dictates the color:

- ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" So, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""
- ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue."" Thus, ""lug bluf"" yields ""blue blue.""
- In the example ""dax wif bluf,"" ""wif"" comes before bluf and is associated with ""red,"" resulting in ""red red"" following the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and following ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" has repeated the color associated with ""wif.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" produces a blue color, and after ""bluf,"" the output again has the color doubled, ""blue blue.""
- The third and subsequent examples support this rule, as each time ""bluf"" is used, the color word before ""bluf"" is repeated.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we can analyze how it is translated into an output color in each input/output example.

1. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""
   Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"".

2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
   Here, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue"".

3. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
   In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red"". But a ""walm"" that follows a ""zup"" turns to ""yellow"".

4. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and thus corresponds to ""yellow"".

5. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
   ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue"" again.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the meaning of ""walm"" depends on the word that precedes it:
- If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" then it translates to ""red.""
- If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" then it translates to ""yellow.""
- If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" then it translates to ""blue.""
- There's no example following ""dax,"" so we can't induce the meaning for that scenario from the given examples. 

Rule: ""walm"" changes its meaning based on the preceding word. Following ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" following ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and following ""lug"" leads to ""blue.""",-0.08539124419142859,158,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the color patterns in the output sequences relative to the presence of ""walm"" in the input sequences.

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
Rule: ""wif"" leads to a single ""red"", ""walm"" seems to extend the ""red"", ""lug"" initiates ""blue"", and ""bluf"" repeats ""blue"".

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
Rule: ""zup"" initiates ""yellow"" and ""dax"" at the end initiates green before ""lug"" adds additional ""blue"".

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
Rule: After ""wif,"" the presence of ""walm"" continues ""red"" until ""zup"" changes the sequence to ""yellow"".

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
Rule: ""zup"" starts ""yellow"", and ""walm"" continues ""yellow"" until ""lug"" changes it to ""blue"".

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
Rule: ""dax"" leads to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" extends the color initiated just before it. ""wif"" and ""bluf"" then create ""red red green"".

From these examples, we can deduce:
Rule: ""walm"" extends the color initiated by the previous word or continues the sequence of the current color if no new color was initiated.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to continue the current color sequence. If the color sequence is initiated by a word directly before ""walm"", it continues that color; if ""walm"" is the first word or follows another ""walm"", it continues the last color mentioned.",-0.1001521201388381,158,walm
"From the provided examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color of the previous word as many times as the number of letters in the word ""walm"". ""Walm"" has four letters, hence the color before ""walm"" is repeated four times. Let's confirm this with the provided examples:

- Input: wif walm lug bluf
  Output: red red red red blue blue
  Explanation: ""wif"" translates to ""red"", followed by ""walm"", which results in ""red"" repeated four times. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
  Output: red yellow blue blue blue blue blue green
  Explanation: ""lug"" translates to blue, followed by ""walm"" results in ""blue"" repeated four times. ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

- Input: wif walm zup walm
  Output: red red red red yellow yellow yellow yellow
  Explanation: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" followed by ""walm"" leads to ""red"" repeated four times, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" followed by another ""walm"" which translates to ""yellow"" repeated four times.

- Input: zup walm lug
  Output: yellow yellow yellow yellow blue
  Explanation: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated four times.

- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
  Output: green blue blue blue blue green red blue green
  Explanation: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""blue"" repeated four times, then ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" to blue, followed by ""dax"" which is ""green"".

Based on this pattern, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" could be defined as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word four times.",-0.3708692373251143,158,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the appearances of ""walm"" in the outputs and the corresponding patterns.

1. In the first input-output pair, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""
2. In the second pair, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""dax lug,"" with the outputs being ""blue blue blue green blue"" for this segment. However, since ""walm"" is followed by three occurrences of ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug,"" it's not clear what ""walm"" by itself corresponds to.
3. In the third pair, ""walm"" appears twice without other words in between, and both times it corresponds to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" could be associated with repetition.
4. In the fourth pair, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" but since ""lug"" after ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue,"" the exact meaning is unclear.
5. In the fifth pair, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""dax"" and before ""dax wif,"" the sequence in the output is ""blue blue green red red green,"" and since ""walm"" is in the middle of ""blue"" and ""green,"" it may be contributing to the ""blue"" portion of the output.

Based on these observations, one pattern that emerges is as follows: 

- ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of the color that would correspond to the word ""wif"" (e.g., ""red red red"").
- The number of repetitions might be three since each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red"" repeated three times in the output.

Therefore, the rule might be:

Rule: walm -> The color associated with the word ""wif"" repeated three times.",-1.091372484340952,158,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"". Here are the patterns observed:

- Every time ""walm"" is present, a repeated sequence of ""red"" follows in the output.
- The number of ""red"" in the sequence is equivalent to the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively.
- ""walm"" seems to translate independently from the words that appear before or after it, always resulting in the ""red"" sequence.

Therefore, based on the information given, we can induce the following rule about the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> A sequence of the word ""red"", where the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of consecutive occurrences of ""walm"".",-1.6814020158845713,158,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to determine the meaning or the rule that defines the nonce word ""lug.""

- In the first example, ""lug zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green green green."" We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow whenever it appears, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""Walm"" seems to correspond to green in this instance as well, but we have no additional examples of ""walm"" to confirm this.
- In the second example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green blue red red."" We already know ""dax"" is green, and ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are red.
- In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" Here, both ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to yellow. Since ""wif"" is red, we can presume ""lug"" is the blue between ""yellow"" and ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue green."" Both ""zup"" and ""dax"" keep their previous associations of yellow and green, respectively.
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""green green red blue."" We see that ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" and ""wif"" are red, and ""lug"" appears as blue here as it does elsewhere.

By examining each instance where ""lug"" appears and considering the assigned colors, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue, since no contradictory evidence is provided in the examples.

Rule: lug -> blue.",-0.0870630263908193,159,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's examine patterns in the input and their corresponding output.

First, notice that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" With this in mind, we can eliminate them when they appear to isolate the impact of ""lug.""

In the first three examples, ""lug"" is paired with different words, and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue."" Specifically, no matter the position of ""lug"" in the input, the output color related to it is ""blue.""

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

In these examples, regardless of the words that accompany ""lug,"" the term ""lug"" itself translates to ""blue.""

The fourth example, which lacks the word ""lug,"" is not useful for determining its meaning since it does not affect the output pattern. 

Adding credibility to this interpretation, in the fifth example, ""dax bluf wif lug,"" we see ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" with ""lug"" being the last term again translating to ""blue.""

Since in every instance where ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue,"" we can conclude with confidence:

"Comparing the examples provided, let's break down each instance where the nonce word ""lug"" is used and the corresponding color output to induce the rule behind its meaning:

3. When ""lug"" follows ""wif,"" the output is blue (Example 5).
4. When ""lug"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" the output is blue (Example 2 and Example 5).
5. When ""lug"" is the second word, the output is blue no matter what the first word is (Examples 1, 2, and 5).

"To discern what the nonce word ""zup"" means, I need to identify the consistent pattern in the examples provided. Here's the breakdown of each input and respective output:

1. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   - The presence of ""dax"" and ""walm"" consistently leads to ""green,"" so ""zup"" being followed by yellow suggests it is not ""dax"" or ""walm.""

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""Bluf"" does not correspond with yellow on its own, as seen in subsequent examples. Hence, ""zup"" might be inducing the yellow.

3. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red
   - ""Bluf"" after ""zup"" is yellow again. ""Bluf"" without preceding ""zup"" turns to red, confirming ""zup"" alters the color associated with ""bluf."" ""Wif"" also corresponds to red, showing consistency.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Independently, ""walm"" corresponds to green. Following ""zup,"" it turns to yellow. This reinforces the idea that ""zup"" changes the usual color outcome.

5. Input: zup lug wif dax lug
   Output: yellow blue red green blue
   - ""Lug"" after ""zup"" is blue instead of its usual color. ""Wif"" after ""zup"" remains red, consistent with the color ""wif"" is assigned when not preceded by ""zup."" ""Dax"" without ""zup"" before it goes back to green. The second ""lug"" also turns to blue, but this is consistent with its output after ""zup.""

From these examples, a rule for what ""zup"" might mean can be inferred:

Rule: ""Zup"" preceding another word changes the standard color associated with that word to yellow, with the exception of ""wif,"" which remains red, and the second occurrence of ""lug"" after ""zup"" does not yield yellow (could make ""lug"" blue).

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

zup -> Changes the following word's associated color to yellow (with outlined exceptions, where it changes ""lug"" to blue and does not affect the color for ""wif"").",-0.11438742385467529,159,zup
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"", we can analyze the given examples and compare the inputs to their respective outputs, looking for patterns that could explain ""zup's"" meaning in relation to other words and their corresponding color outputs.

1. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. zup lug wif dax lug -> yellow blue red green blue

Let's examine each color to see if we can find what words might correlate to them:

- Green is consistently output for ""dax"" and ""walm.""
- Yellow appears for ""zup"" and possibly for ""bluf"" and ""lug"" as well.
- Red appears for ""wif.""
- Blue once for ""lug.""

It appears that ""zup"" precedes the colors of the words that follow it. For instance, in example 1, the colors for ""dax"" and ""walm"" are green, yet when ""zup"" is added at the end, it adds a yellow to the series. In examples 2 and 4, only ""zup"" and one other word are given, and both times they result in two yellows. Meanwhile, ""zup"" at the beginning of a sequence results in a stream of corresponding colors afterward, as shown in examples 3 and 5, with a yellow appearing before the colors that correspond to each subsequent word.

Based on these patterns, it seems that ""zup"" might not have a color of its own but may indicate a sequence change or act as a marker for processing upcoming words. When ""zup"" precedes other words, it applies a yellow output before the sequence of colors for other words begins. 

Rule: ""zup"" seems to function as a sequence indicator or marker, translating to a yellow output before the pattern of the other words continues.

So, the rule would be written as: zup -> A marker leading to a yellow output before continuing with the pattern for subsequent words.",-0.12916634397,159,zup
"Based on the given examples, we have to determine the underlying rule for the nonce word ""zup"". Let's analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green yellow""
2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
3. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow red red""
4. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup lug wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow blue red green blue""

The word ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" in the output every time it is mentioned in the input. However, it does not have a fixed position in the output, which suggests that ""zup"" may not correspond to a single color but may be a placeholder for a variable or a change in the pattern.

When ""zup"" appears, the color immediately following seems to be impacted in the following ways:

- If ""zup"" is followed by a new word we haven't seen paired with it, the color is ""yellow"" (""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"").
- After ""zup"", a previously seen color name, not directly following ""zup,"" results in a repeat of its color (""zup bluf wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow red red"" and ""zup lug wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow blue red green blue"", here ""bluf"" and ""lug"" repeats its corresponding color ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively).
- If ""zup"" precedes a word already used in the same sequence, it does not seem to affect the output (""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green yellow"" does not repeat ""green"").

Given these observations, we can induce that ""zup"" acts as a color changer or modifier for the subsequent word if it is new and indicates a repeat if the word has been previously mentioned. However, it will always first cause a ""yellow"" to appear in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> Acts as a marker that leads to ""yellow"" in the output and either (1) changes the following word to ""yellow"" if it is a new combination or (2) results in a repetition of the color associated with the following word if it has appeared before in the same sequence.",-0.28599498838532456,159,zup
"To determine the meaning of the word ""zup,"" we must compare the input strings with their corresponding outputs and identify patterns.

- When ""dax"" and ""walm"" appear together with ""zup,"" the output is three ""green"" followed by a ""yellow."" 
- When ""zup"" appears with ""bluf,"" the output is two ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf wif bluf,"" the outputs are ""yellow yellow red red,"" indicating that ""zup"" itself is not producing ""red.""
- ""zup walm"" leads to three ""yellow,"" showing that ""walm"" alone is not responsible for producing ""green.""
- ""zup lug wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue red green blue,"" demonstrating that ""zup"" precedes colors that correspond to the words that follow it, excluding the first color that is always yellow when ""zup"" is first.

From these observations, we can induce the first rule: When ""zup"" is the first word, it seems to make every output start with a ""yellow,"" and the colors that follow correspond to the other words.

However, we need more information to fully deduce the color mapping of each word. We do not have enough examples of ""zup"" being used in different positions or enough variety of words used with ""zup"" to confirm additional rules. With the given data, the best rule we can induce is:

Rule: ""zup"" when used as the first word in an input sequence, contributes a ""yellow"" to the output sequence and indicates that the color output for the subsequent words will follow a specific pattern not disclosed by the examples provided. The presence of ""zup"" does not influence the color outcome of the words that follow except for the first ""yellow"" it causes.",-0.4210637725283117,159,zup
"zup -> a color that does not directly correspond to the following word but rather reflects a change or shift in the pattern between the input and output sequences.

Rule: When 'zup' is present, the color sequence appears to shift in a predictable manner. The color that follows 'zup' in the output is not the one associated directly with the word that follows 'zup' in the input. Instead, 'zup' seems to function as a placeholder or a signal for a pattern change or continuation. It is notable that the color associated with 'zup' itself is yellow in all instances. Here is the breakdown based on the examples given:

- When 'zup' is followed by 'dax' or 'walm' (which both result in the color green when 'zup' is not present), the color yellow takes the place of green, suggesting that 'zup' made it shift forward in the pattern to the next color following green.

- When 'zup' is followed by 'bluf', the output is two yellows, and when another 'bluf' is added, it extends with two reds. This implies that the presence of 'zup' causes the color for 'bluf' to be suppressed or skipped, and perhaps 'bluf' to turn into red following the 'zup'.

- In the example with 'zup lug wif dax lug', the sequence displays a variety of colors: yellow (for 'zup'), blue (for 'lug'), red (for 'wif'), green (for 'dax'), and then blue (for 'lug') again, suggesting that 'zup' affected only the first occurrence of 'lug' that came after it, signaling the continuation of the color pattern from that point on.

Therefore, 'zup' seems to play a role in altering the expected color sequence by initiating a change or continuation. It's consistent that 'zup' itself corresponds to yellow, but for the subsequent words, it disrupts the direct word-to-color matching.",-0.7975161943701297,159,zup

Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

From this example, we can notice that the output is the color ""green"" followed by ""green"" again after the word ""walm"". Then, the sequence ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". This suggests a repeating pattern being initiated by ""walm"".

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" does not appear in other examples, but after ""walm"" we see ""red red red"". This could imply that ""walm"" is followed by a threefold repetition of a new color.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""walm"" is causing a color to be repeated three times.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

In this example, we have the word ""lug"" before ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times, confirming again that ""walm"" triggers a triple repetition of the color before it.

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

For this input, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", which results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times. The sequence ""dax lug"" is unrelated to ""walm"" and follows the previously known pattern for those words (""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"").

Taking into consideration all these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> cause the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.",-0.06395472833343749,159,walm
"Observing the outputs for each input where the word ""walm"" is used, and given the consistency of the colors that follow the word ""walm"" in the output, we can deduce a pattern that the word ""walm"" implies a repetition of the last color mentioned before it, and this repetition occurs three times.

Here are the detailed observations to support this rule:

1. ""dax walm zup walm"" outputs ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"". The color ""green"" is associated with ""dax"" and is repeated three times after the first ""walm"". The color ""yellow"" is associated with ""zup"" and is repeated three times after the second ""walm""

2. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red"". The color ""red"" is associated with ""wif"" and is repeated three times after ""walm"".

3. ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"". The color ""blue"" is associated with ""lug"" and is repeated three times after ""walm"".

4. ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"". The color ""blue"" is associated with ""lug"" and is repeated three times after ""walm"".

5. ""zup walm dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". The color ""yellow"" is associated with ""zup"" and is repeated three times after the first ""walm"".

Based on these observations, the rule is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the last color mentioned before it three times.",-0.09121887330762504,159,walm
"Given the examples, we can try to deduce the rule for ""walm"" by identifying patterns associated with its use. 

First, let's note the number of colors in the output corresponding to the words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" in combination with ""walm"":
1. ""dax walm"" ⇒ ""green green green""
2. ""zup walm"" ⇒ ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""lug walm"" ⇒ ""blue blue blue""

In the above cases, the words paired with ""walm"" have consistent colors: ""dax"" produces green, ""zup"" produces yellow, ""lug"" produces blue. Each of these words is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is the corresponding color repeated three times. 

Looking at a case without the word ""walm"":
4. ""zup wif"" ⇒ ""yellow red red red""

In this case, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"" instead of ""walm,"" resulting in a yellow followed by three reds.

Now, looking at the inputs with ""walm"" combined with multiple other words:
5. ""zup walm dax lug"" ⇒ ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""

Here it's clear that ""zup walm"" follows the pattern of producing three yellows, ""dax"" alone produces one green, and ""lug"" alone produces one blue.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
- When ""walm"" is preceded by the words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or ""lug,"" it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Therefore, the rule can be articulated as:
Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-0.4540418999295002,159,walm
"Based on the provided examples, walm seems to be associated with the repetition of the output color that corresponds to the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first input, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" implying that ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in repeating the output color for ""dax"" (which is green) three times. The same happens with ""zup walm"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second input, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" after ""wif"" repeats the output color for ""wif"" (which is red) four times.
- The third and fourth inputs show that ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" implying that ""walm"" after ""lug"" repeats the output color for ""lug"" (which is blue) three times.
- The last input sequence, ""zup walm dax lug,"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green blue,"" where again ""zup walm"" leads to the repeating of yellow three times, followed by the colors for ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue).

Based on this pattern, the rule is that ""walm"" repeats the output color of the preceding word a certain number of times, which seems generally to be three, although it was four in one instance. This variance means there might be a rule we have not yet discerned that determines how many times the color is repeated. In the examples provided, there is no instance of the word ""walm"" at the beginning of an input to establish how it behaves independently.

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (Here, ""zup"" means yellow).
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (Here, ""lug"" means blue).

- When ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue yellow.""

"From the given examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" represents the color that results from the word preceding it when the color corresponding to that word is duplicated. To figure out the rule, we need to analyze each example:

1. Input: ""zup bluf"" 
   Output: ""yellow yellow""
   Here, we see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""bluf"" we also get ""yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color connected to ""zup.""

2. Input: ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow green yellow green red red""
   The pattern again corroborates that ""bluf"" replicates the color linked to the preceding word. In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""

3. Input: ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf""
   Output: ""red green yellow red green green""
   Here, ""dax"" becomes ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" we have ""green"" again, indicating that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of ""green.""

4. Input: ""zup bluf lug zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   The word ""lug"" is placed after ""bluf,"" which doesn't follow the same pattern since it outputs ""blue,"" and it doesn't seem to affect the rule of ""bluf."" The last word ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" since ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

5. Input: ""zup bluf""
   Output: ""yellow yellow""
   Again, it confirms that ""bluf"" causes the duplication of the preceding word's corresponding color.

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows a word, it causes the output to be the color corresponding to that word repeated twice.

Rule: bluf causes the color associated with the preceding word to be duplicated in the output.",-0.07732039285921735,160,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the output associated with each occurrence:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and we have ""bluf"" resulting in ""yellow"" as well, we get a repetitive pattern of the color associated with the previous word.

2. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Following the pattern, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" After each word sequence, ""bluf"" shows a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word: ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" then ""bluf"" gives ""red"" again.

3. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green

Here, ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Again, ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word right before it: ""dax"" is ""green,"" followed by ""bluf"" which results in ""green.""

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf,"" as seen previously, repeats this color. ""Lug"" introduces a new color ""blue,"" but it doesn't seem to influence ""bluf"" directly, as ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the latter of which has the consistent output ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

This supports our previous observation where ""bluf"" echoes the color associated with ""zup.""

Based on these examples, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes right before it.

In the first input, ""wif dax lug walm"", the output is ""red green blue blue blue"", and the word ""walm"" follows ""lug"", resulting in two more ""blue""s. 

In the second example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", the output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". Here, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and results in ""red red red"".

In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup"", the output is ""red red red green yellow"", and ""walm"" following ""wif"" leads to an additional ""red"".

In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow red red red"", and again ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and leads to repeated ""red""s.

In the last example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in repeated ""blue"".

From the above examples, it is evident that the word ""walm"" induces repetition of the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence.

Rule:
walm -> induces repetition of the preceding color in the sequence.",-0.07603687041217824,160,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the correlation between the input and the output in each example. Let's analyze the color outputs next to their respective inputs:

1. Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue
   Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue.""

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Here, ""walm"" is placed after two ""wif"" tokens and corresponds to ""red red.""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
   Here, ""walm"" follows a ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red red.""

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Here again, ""walm"" follows a ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red red.""

5. Input: lug walm zup lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   In this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue blue.""

Now let's attempt to find the pattern:

- In both examples 1 and 5, ""walm"" follows a single color (either ""lug"" or ""wif"") and produces a double instance of the color that ""lug"" or ""wif"" represents.
- This pattern also fits examples 3 and 4, where ""wif"" (representing red) is followed by ""walm,"" producing ""red red.""
- For example 2, it's slightly different because ""walm"" follows two ""wif"" tokens. However, the rule doesn't seem to change because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" following ""wif wif"" corresponds to double of that color, which is ""red red.""

Therefore, we can deduce that ""walm"" is a function that duplicates the color of the word immediately preceding it.

   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" must correspond to ""blue""

   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

From the examples, we notice a pattern where ""walm"" always corresponds to a repetition of the color that came just before it.

When ""walm"" is used in an input sequence, the corresponding output is a sequence of the color that represents the immediately preceding word in the input sequence, repeated for each occurrence of that preceding word within the entire input sequence.

Let's break down the examples to illustrate the rule:

1. Input: zup walm
   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow
   - ""zup"" appears once before ""walm""
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow (three yellows, the same count as the total occurrences of ""zup"")

2. Input: lug walm dax

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow
   - ""zup"" appears once before ""walm""
   - Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue (one blue for ""lug"", three yellows for the one occurrence of ""zup"", and one blue for the last ""lug"")

4. Input: dax walm zup
   - ""dax"" precedes ""walm""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the color green
   - ""dax"" appears once before ""walm""
   - Output: green green green yellow (three greens for the one occurrence of ""dax"" and one yellow for ""zup"")

5. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue

"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"". Let us examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: zup walm

2. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

4. Input: dax walm zup

5. Input: dax lug dax lug walm

From these examples, we can infer the following patterns:
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three instances of ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three instances of ""blue.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is three instances of ""green.""

Additionally, the output colors seem to be consistent with the given input word; for example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Considering these observations, we could suggest the following rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to generate multiple instances of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The number of color instances is equal to the number of letters in the preceding word. Here are the observed rules:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (because ""zup"" has 3 letters, so ""walm"" produces ""yellow"" 3 times)
- ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green"" (because ""lug"" has 3 letters, so ""walm"" produces ""blue"" 3 times; ""dax"" is not influenced by ""walm"")
- ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" (because ""zup"" has 3 letters, so ""walm"" produces ""yellow"" 3 times; ""lug"" at the end is independent of ""walm"")
- ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow"" (because ""dax"" has 3 letters, so ""walm"" produces ""green"" 3 times; ""zup"" is not influenced by ""walm"")
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue"" (because the last word before ""walm"" is ""lug"" which has 3 letters, so ""walm"" produces ""blue"" 3 times)

Based on the above analysis, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

"To deduce the meaning of the word 'walm', let's look for patterns in the examples given. It seems that the appearance of 'walm' in the input consistently generates a sequence of the same color in the output.

1. When 'zup' precedes 'walm', 'yellow' is repeated thrice in the output.
2. When 'lug walm' is present, 'blue blue blue' is in the output followed by 'dax' as 'green'.
3. When 'lug zup walm lug' is the input, it corresponds to 'blue yellow yellow yellow blue', which suggests that 'walm' is responsible for the three 'yellow' in sequence and is surrounded by whatever color 'lug' corresponds to (blue in this case).
4. 'dax walm zup' provides 'green green green yellow', so again 'walm' causes the triple repetition of the color preceding it ('dax' leads to 'green').
5. In the input 'dax lug dax lug walm', 'walm' is at the end and corresponds to 'blue blue', duplicating the color from 'lug' twice.

Based on these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: 'walm' repeats the color outputted by the word that immediately precedes it, thrice if followed by a different word or twice if at the end.

Thus, walm -> Repetition of the color denoted by the preceding word, three times if followed by a different word, two times if at the end of the input.",-0.39194363937700005,161,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in a repeated color word in the output. The color word that repeats is determined by the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" Each example also indicates a specific color associated with certain words: ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" Furthermore, the number of times that color is repeated in the output is based on the sequence directly preceding ""walm."" All preceding unique words that have associated colors lead to the repetition of their corresponding color as many times as they appear before ""walm.""

Here is the pattern from the examples:

- ""zup walm"" repeats ""yellow"" once because ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm dax"" repeats ""blue"" once for ""lug"" and ends with ""green"" for ""dax.""
- ""lug zup walm lug"" repeats ""yellow"" twice for ""zup"" and ends with ""blue"" for ""lug"" because ""lug"" and ""zup"" both precede ""walm,"" and then it adds another ""blue"" because ""lug"" follows after ""walm.""
- ""dax walm zup"" repeats ""green"" twice for ""dax"" and adds ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" repeats ""blue"" four times for ""lug"" because there are two instances of ""lug"" before ""walm."" ""Dax"" doesn't repeat because ""lug"" comes after it and before ""walm.""

So, a general rule for ""walm"" can be the following:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to include a repetition of color words based on the word that immediately precedes it. The color repeated corresponds to the preceding word's associated color, and the number of repetitions equals the count of all unique color-associated words preceding ""walm.""

1. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
2. dax wif bluf -> green red red
3. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
4. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
5. dax bluf -> green green

We can observe the following:

- When ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" (examples 1, 2, 3), the output color for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" (example 4), the output color for ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" (example 5), the output color for ""bluf"" is ""green"".

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. To confirm this, let's check if the words that precede ""bluf"" in the examples indeed correlate with the color mentioned:

- ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".
- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"".
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green"".

Given that ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green"" respectively, and ""bluf"" matches the color of the word before it, we can surmise that:

- In ""dax wif bluf"", ""red"" for ""wif"" is repeated for ""bluf"".

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug walm wif lug

Based on the outputs, the word ""walm"" appears to take on the color of the word immediately preceding it. In cases where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color is yellow since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. When ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, ""walm"" also corresponds to blue. Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is green, ""walm"" produces a blue output as well because ""lug"" comes after ""dax"", suggesting a transitive property.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word.

"Based on the given examples, we observe that the output colors change when the word ""walm"" is mentioned in the input. To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern in the examples:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug

   Notice the change of the following colors to red after ""walm"" appears, except for ""lug,"" which gives the color blue.

2. Input: zup lug walm wif dax

3. Input: zup walm

   In this case, after ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated.

4. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   Again, we see that the appearance of ""walm"" changes the subsequent colors to blue, then red for ""wif,"" and back to blue for ""lug.""

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Here, after ""walm"" is introduced, the color changes to blue and continues as such.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" has an effect on the subsequent elements in the sequence rather than having a fixed color or meaning. The effect seems to be that ""walm"" causes the next terms (until a certain condition is met) to take on a uniform color, but the specific color chosen depends on the context or perhaps the word that follows ""walm."" However, there seems to be an exception for the words ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax,"" which maintain their colors as red, blue, and green, respectively.

Therefore, the meaning or rule of ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the following terms to change to a uniform color unless they are specific words with predetermined colors like ""wif"" (red), ""lug"" (blue), or ""dax"" (green).

In all scenarios, ""walm"" seems to be associated with one color that repeats for each word in the input sequence up to the appearance of a different color word. If a different color word appears after ""walm,"" it breaks the repetition and adds its associated color to the output sequence.

"Based on the given examples, we can work out the meaning of ""dax"" by looking for a consistent pattern. The word ""lug"" references blue and ""zup"" references yellow as seen by their repeated use and consistent outputs.

So let's examine what ""dax"" could mean in each given output:

1. ""dax lug zup"" -> ""green blue yellow""
   ""dax"" occurs before ""lug"" (blue) and provides the output ""green"".
   
2. ""zup dax zup"" -> ""yellow green yellow""
   Here ""dax"" is between two ""zup"" (yellow) and its output is ""green"".

3. ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""

"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the pattern in each input and their corresponding outputs:

1. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
2. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
3. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
4. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

From these examples, it appears that every word is linked to a specific color output:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> sequence appears to extend adding one more red compared to the previous occurrence of walm

Given this, we can deduce:
- In examples 1, 2, and 5, the word ""bluf"" directly follows different words and each time it outputs the same color as the word before it.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" appears twice after the word ""lug"" and the word ""dax"" respectively, and it takes on the color of the word immediately before it both times.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word immediately preceding it. Hence the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it is a chameleon word that mimics the color associated with the preceding word.

Bluf -> Mimics the color output of the preceding word.",-0.08996087317473035,163,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to generate an output that repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, it results in another ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, it's evident that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it: ""wif"" is ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" turns into ""red red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" so ""dax bluf dax"" turns into ""green red green.""
- The fifth example further supports this rule, as ""zup"" turns to ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which also becomes ""yellow.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> Replicates the color of the preceding word.",-1.1749001803029215,163,bluf
"Rule: The word 'bluf' seems to correspond to the output 'red yellow'. However, in the third example, 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue green'. In the fourth example, 'bluf' precedes 'dax' which results in 'red red green', differing from previous examples. 

The pattern changes with context, which indicates that 'bluf' may not have a fixed meaning but alters its output based upon the words around it or its position in the sequence.

From the given examples, the rule appears that 'bluf' takes on the following patterns:
- When followed by 'zup', it appears as 'yellow yellow'.
- When sandwiched between 'lug' and 'dax', it results in 'blue green'.
- When preceding 'dax', it transforms into 'red red green'.

However, the pattern is not entirely clear, and more examples would be needed to determine a more accurate rule. As such, it is difficult to state a concrete meaning for 'bluf'; it appears to alter its output in relation to other words around it.

With the examples provided, I'll attempt to induce a tentative rule based on the observed patterns, but it's important to stress that this rule might not hold true with additional examples.

Tentative Rule: 'bluf' changes its corresponding colors based on specific rules that depend on the surrounding words. Here are the possible conditions based on the examples:

- If 'bluf' is followed by 'zup', the output is 'yellow yellow'.
- If 'bluf' is between 'lug' and 'dax', the output is 'blue green'.
- If 'bluf' precedes 'dax', the output is 'red red green'.
- Without clear context or more information, 'bluf' by itself translates to 'red yellow'.

One could write this as:

Rule for 'bluf':
- Followed by 'zup' -> 'yellow yellow'
- Between 'lug' and 'dax' -> 'blue green'
- Preceding 'dax' -> 'red red green'
- Alone or with no specific context -> 'red yellow' (uncertain due to insufficient examples)

"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word multiple times equal to the number of letters in the preceding word. To confirm this, we can look at the pattern before and after ""walm"" in each example:

- In the second example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" outputs ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Here ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and ""wif"" is outputted three times because it has three letters.

- In the third example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, repeated three times for the three letters in ""lug.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" correlates with yellow and has three letters, hence the output is three yellows.

- In the fifth example, ""wif walm dax"" turns into ""red red red green."" ""Wif"" comes before ""walm,"" and since ""wif"" is red and has three letters, ""red"" is outputted three times. ""Dax"" comes after ""walm"" and is not influenced by it, so its color, green, is outputted only once.

  Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times. There are no repeated colors after ""zup lug.""

- ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
  Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
  Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times, but note there are two sets of ""lug"" in the input, one after ""walm"" and one at the end. This may be why there's another ""blue"" at the end.

- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
  Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

From these examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule:
- ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes it to be repeated the same number of times it was repeated before ""walm."" If the preceding word has not appeared before ""walm,"" then the color that corresponds to the preceding word appears three times after ""walm.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" could be stated as:

walm -> Causes repetition of the directly preceding color the same number of times as it was repeated before ""walm,"" or three times if the preceding word is new.",-0.0910491901324111,165,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the input sequences with their corresponding outputs.

- The consistent aspect in all the outputs when ""walm"" appears is a repetition of a color word multiple times.
- The color that is repeated replaces the position of ""walm"" in the output.
- The color being repeated is the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" in the input.

Let's see if the rule applies:

1. Input: lug walm zup walm
   - ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is replaced with ""blue blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is replaced with ""yellow yellow""
   - Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow → This confirms that ""walm"" repeated the preceding color twice

2. Input: dax walm zup lug
   - ""dax"" corresponds with ""green""
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is replaced with ""green green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
   - Output: green green green yellow blue → ""walm"" repeated the preceding color two additional times

3. Input: zup walm wif
   - ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is replaced with ""yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds with ""red""
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow red → ""walm"" repeated the preceding color twice

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   - ""zup dax lug"" corresponds with ""yellow green blue""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is replaced with ""blue blue""
   - ""zup lug"" corresponds with ""yellow blue""
   - Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue → ""walm"" repeated the preceding color two additional times

5. Input: dax lug walm
   - ""dax lug"" corresponds with ""green blue""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is replaced with ""blue blue""
   - Output: green blue blue blue → ""walm"" repeated the preceding color two additional times

Based on the above analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the preceding color in the output to be repeated two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the preceding color in the output two additional times.",-0.09531471504472222,165,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns of input and corresponding output. Here is one possible analysis:

1. Input: lug walm zup walm / Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""lug"" is followed by three ""blue""
- ""zup"" is followed by three ""yellow""
- ""walm"" does not introduce a new color, but seems to repeat the last color mentioned 3 times.

2. Input: dax walm zup lug / Output: green green green yellow blue
- ""dax"" is followed by three ""green""
- ""zup"" is followed by one ""yellow""
- Here, ""walm"" is followed by only one ""yellow,"" which is the color code for ""zup,"" not ""lug.""

3. Input: zup walm wif / Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- ""zup"" is followed by three ""yellow""
- ""wif"" followed by one ""red""

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug / Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
- ""zup"" followed by one ""yellow""
- ""dax"" followed by one ""green""
- ""lug"" followed by one ""blue""
- ""walm"" is followed by two additional ""blue"" which is the color code for ""lug,"" not ""zup"" (not repetition)

5. Input: dax lug walm / Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" is followed by one ""green""
- ""lug"" is followed by one ""blue""
- ""walm"" is followed by two additional ""blue"" (repeating the color for ""lug"")

Based on the analysis, there is no consistent pattern of how many times ""walm"" repeats the color related to the previous word. It might be repeating the last color mentioned, but not for a consistent number of times.

However, there is a consistent pattern that ""walm"" results in the color that just appeared before it being repeated. We need to refine the definition of ""walm"" based on the variable repeatability.

Rule: ""walm"" will produce a series of the immediately preceding color, but the number of repetitions seems inconsistent. Considering the limited examples, the most we can deduce without assuming errors in the dataset is that ""walm"" causes repetition of the last color code.

With the information provided, the rule could be stated as:

Walm -> causes the immediate previous color to be repeated one or more times. The number of repetitions is not consistent across the examples.",-0.09634661636104441,165,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems like ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of three repetitions of the color that is associated with the word preceding ""walm."" Let's analyze the examples and their outputs to deduce the rule:

1. In ""lug walm zup walm"":
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - Therefore, ""walm"" after ""lug"" means ""blue blue blue""
   - And ""walm"" after ""zup"" means ""yellow yellow yellow""

2. In ""dax walm zup lug"":
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - Therefore, ""walm"" after ""dax"" means ""green green green""
   - The rest of the sequence (""zup lug"") corresponds to ""yellow blue""

3. In ""zup walm wif"":
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" is not followed by ""walm,"" but it corresponds to ""red""
   - Therefore, ""walm"" after ""zup"" means ""yellow yellow yellow""

4. In ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"":
   - The sequence ""zup dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue""
   - ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" so it should correspond to ""blue blue blue""
   - The rest of the sequence (""zup lug"") corresponds to ""yellow blue""

5. In ""dax lug walm"":
   - The sequence ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue""
   - ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" so it should correspond to ""blue blue blue""

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word three times.

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rules related to the word ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" could mean repeating the previous color three times. However, the number of repeated color words does not always correspond to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned.
 
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug"" leads to ""green green green yellow blue,"" which again shows ""walm"" causes the previous color word (""dax"" -> ""green"") to be repeated three times, followed by a transition back to what seems to be a regular sequence (""zup"" -> ""yellow"", ""lug"" -> ""blue"").

- In the third example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" makes the previous color to repeat three times (""zup"" -> ""yellow""), and then it goes back to the regular sequence with ""wif"" -> ""red.""

- The fourth and fifth examples support the same rule. Whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the color before it repeats three times, and then the sequence continues normally with the next color indication.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Here’s how the breakdown appears:

- ""wif"" leads to ""red.""
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" by itself is followed by three blues, thus ""walm"" might mean “repeat blue.”
- ""dax"" leads to ""green.""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""

From the examples, we can see that ""bluf"" is always followed by the color ""blue"" in the outputs.

""Wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" all translate directly into a single color output (""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green"" respectively), but ""lug"" and ""bluf"" do not seem to follow this pattern.

Looking closely at the pattern for ""lug"" suggests that it leads to either one or two ""blue"" outputs, depending on the position and context within the input. 

The consistent part appears to be that ""bluf"" directly translates to ""blue,"" while ""lug"" might either stand for ""blue"" directly or trigger an additional ""blue"" output when occurring before or after ""bluf.""

- There are no instances where ""bluf"" corresponds to a color other than ""blue"" in the output.
- Other words in the input correspond to different colors (""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""walm"" to ""blue""), but for ""bluf,"" ""blue"" is the consistent output.

However, since ""bluf"" does not always appear before the word ""blue"" in the output, we need to consider the possibility that ""bluf"" could be context-dependent or could represent a modifier that affects the subsequent word.

"The examples provided give a sequence of inputs where each word is associated with a color. From analyzing the sequences, we can try to isolate the meaning of ""bluf"" by considering the surrounding words and their corresponding output colors. 

Let's look at the patterns:

- ""wif zup bluf"" -> red yellow yellow
- ""wif bluf"" -> red red
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> red red red blue blue
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> yellow yellow red red red
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> red red blue green red

By examining the outputs, we notice that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". If we look closely at the examples that contain ""bluf"" multiple times, we see that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" directly. However, when ""bluf"" follows other words:

- ""lug bluf"" -> blue blue
- ""dax wif"" -> green red

It suggests ""bluf"" may take on the color of the word immediately preceding it, with ""lug"" being ""blue"" and ""dax"" being ""green"". ""Bluf"" seems to duplicate the color of the preceding word.

Let's summarize the rule based on the given data:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If the preceding word is ""wif"", then ""bluf"" results in the color ""red"". If the preceding word is ""lug"", it results in the color ""blue"", and so on for the other examples provided.",-0.10235119317609641,167,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the relation between the input and output in each example:

1. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   Rule: wif -> red, zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Rule: wif -> red, bluf -> red

3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   Rule: wif -> red, walm -> red, lug -> blue, bluf -> blue blue

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Rule: zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow, wif -> red, walm -> red

5. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red
   Rule: wif -> red, bluf -> red, lug -> blue, dax -> green

Looking at the results, it seems that ""bluf"" can be related to the color that is produced by the word immediately preceding it. In examples 1 and 4, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow,"" the same as ""zup."" In examples 2 and 5, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red,"" the same as ""wif."" In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce:

bluf -> Duplicate the color associated with the word immediately before bluf.

Rule: If a word X appears before ""bluf"" and X translates to color Y, then ""bluf"" translates to Y Y (the color Y repeated).",-0.10929011988885544,167,bluf
"From the given examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"". By looking at each instance where ""bluf"" is used and the corresponding output, we can deduce its meaning or rule:

1. Input: wif zup bluf -> Output: red yellow yellow
2. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
3. Input: wif walm lug bluf -> Output: red red red blue blue
4. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
5. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif -> Output: red red blue green red

Looking at Example 1 and Example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif"" respectively, the colors following ""zup"" and ""wif"" are yellow and red repeatedly, suggesting that ""bluf"" potentially means repeating the previous color.

In Example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which results in two blues, suggesting ""bluf"" causes the previous color to be repeated.

In Example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif"" and the output is yellow yellow before moving on to red. 

In Example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" again and it results in double blue.

From all these, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf means to repeat the color associated with the previous word.

So the rule we induce for ""bluf"" would be: 

bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.",-0.11399822502018073,167,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we should look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs. We notice that the output colors are dependent on the words that appear in the input. Each unique word corresponds to a specific color.

By examining the inputs where ""bluf"" appears and their corresponding outputs, we can make the following observations:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and the corresponding colors are ""yellow yellow."" Since we know ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" could correspond to ""yellow."" However, in the other examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors, so this assumption is incorrect.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"", and the output is ""red red."" Here, ""wif"" is known to correspond to ""red,"" so based on this example alone, ""bluf"" might correspond to ""red"" as well.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" appears at the end and the output after the colors for ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue blue."" It's not clear if ""bluf"" corresponds to one or both of these ""blues,"" but if it corresponds to one, it seems likely to be ""blue.""
- The fourth example again shows ""bluf"" followed by colors ""yellow yellow red red red,"" after the outputs for ""zup"" and ""wif."" The output associated with ""bluf"" is not immediately clear.
- In the fifth example, after ""lug"" and ""dax,"" the colors are ""blue green,"" and for double ""wif"" in the end, it's ""red red."" If we assume that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" then ""bluf"" here corresponds to ""blue.""

After further examination, the consistent pattern is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue."" In the third example, after the words ""wif walm lug, bluf,"" multiple ""red""s are followed by multiple ""blue""s, likely one each for ""lug"" and ""bluf."" The inconsistency arises due to the repetition of colors in the output, which at first glance, makes it seem as though one input word could be mapping to multiple identical colors.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> blue.",-0.7328442853837349,167,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to correlate the number of appearances of ""bluf"" with the repeating of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" might mean to repeat the color of the previous word twice.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the previous word, this time with only one repetition since ""bluf"" appears only once.
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", and since ""bluf"" appears twice, it represents two repetitions of the color blue assigned to ""lug"".
- In the fourth example, the order of words is different, but ""zup bluf"" still translates to ""yellow yellow"", showing consistency with previous examples.
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf"" again translates to ""blue"" repeated, but this time we notice ""bluf"" is followed by another word ""dax,"" which correlates with the color green. It does not change the pattern of ""bluf"" repeating the color of the previous word (""lug"" -> blue).

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeats the color of the word immediately before it, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of times ""bluf"" occurs consecutively.",-0.9856399690648193,167,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color corresponding to another word in the input. Each color is repeated three times, as indicated by the output.

- In the first example ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""zup"" means yellow and ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times.
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green (which is not repeated), ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" presumably repeats the color blue three times, ignoring the color green that is associated with ""dax."" 
- In the third example, ""wif walm,"" we see ""red red red,"" suggesting ""wif"" means red and ""walm"" repeats the color red three times.
- The fourth example, ""zup wif walm,"" combines ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red), with ""walm"" causing red to repeat three times as ""yellow red red red,"" meaning ""walm"" is applying the repetition to the second color word only.
- Finally, the fifth example, ""lug walm zup walm,"" provides the output of two sets of color repetition, ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" which means ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. If there are multiple color words before ""walm,"" it only applies to the one immediately prior.

- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" with ""walm"" following ""lug,"" causing ""blue"" to repeat three times.
- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"": suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.

- ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"": further supports the rule, as ""lug"" precedes the first ""walm"" and ""zup"" precedes the second ""walm,"" causing the repetition of the respective color words.

Moreover, when two color-words are present followed by ""walm,"" all colors represented by the words preceding ""walm"" are repeated three times, in the order they were mentioned.

Here are the rules deduced from each example:

- ""zup walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" repeats ""green"" once, and ""blue"" three times since ""lug"" is mentioned right before ""walm.""
- ""wif walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.

- ""zup"" seems to produce ""yellow"" (note that after ""zup"" the number of ""yellow"" in the output increases by two)
- ""wif"" seems to be associated with ""red""

Now, let's focus on ""walm"". It appears at the end of the input in each case, and its presence seems to dictate a repetition of the color immediately preceding it. We can infer this because:

- In the third and fifth examples, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", associated with ""yellow"", and the output contains repeated ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", associated with ""red"", and the output similarly contains repeated ""red"".

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color word that is immediately before it. The total number of color repetitions after ""walm"" may correlate with the number of instances of the respective color word before ""walm"":

- After ""dax"" (green), the color green is repeated three times.
- After ""zup"" (yellow), the color yellow is repeated three times.
- After ""wif"" (red), the color red is repeated three times.

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color indicated by the word immediately before it in the input to be repeated three more times in the output. If the color word is not present before ""walm"", then ""walm"" repeats the last color word mentioned.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three more times in the output. If the color word is not present, it repeats the last mentioned color.",-0.19404186847733332,168,walm
"walm -> rule. The rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" produces a sequence of colors that replicate the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Each color name is repeated a number of times corresponding to the number of letters in the preceding word.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""dax"" is a three-letter word, so ""walm"" produces three greens.

2. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""dax"" is a three-letter word, so ""walm"" produces three greens.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""zup"" is a three-letter word, so ""walm"" produces three yellows.

4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""wif"" is a three-letter word, so ""walm"" produces three reds.

5. Repeat of 3rd example to reinforce the rule.

"walm -> meaning. Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" appears to depend on the preceding word. The word before ""walm"" seems to determine both the color and the number of repetitions for the output. The rules look as follow:

- If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" then the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" then the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" then the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" is immediately after two words, ""dax"" and ""wif,"" it outputs ""green"" or ""red"" repeated four times based on the word right before it.
- When ""walm"" is the only word after ""zup,"" it repeats ""yellow"" three times, which is consistent with the single-word precedent case.
  
So in essence, ""walm"" translates into repeating the color associated with the word directly preceding it. The number of repetitions is always one more than the number of words preceding ""walm"" (up to the examples given).

"Walm -> repeating the last color that was mentioned. Rule: For each occurrence of the nonce word ""walm"" in the input, repeat the output of the last color word before ""walm"" an extra number of times equal to the number of instances ""walm"" occurs consecutively.

Explanation of the Rule Using Examples:

1. ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green""
- The word before 'walm' is 'dax', which translates to 'green'. Since 'walm' is mentioned once, the last mentioned color, which is 'green', is repeated three times.

2. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green""
- In this case, 'dax' comes before 'walm' again, and 'dax' means 'green'. 'Walm' leads to repeating 'green' an additional two times (for a total of three times) because 'walm' occurs once.

3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- Here, 'walm' follows 'zup', which translates to 'yellow'. Since 'walm' occurs once, the 'yellow' is repeated three times.

4. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
- 'Wif' is the word before 'walm', which translates to 'red'. 'Walm' makes 'red' repeat an extra two times (thus, three occurrences of 'red').

5. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- This is the same as the third example, confirming the behavior of 'walm', which repeats 'yellow' (from 'zup') three times because of the single occurrence of the word 'walm'.

The specific mechanism by which 'walm' causes repetition is not entirely clear, but the output pattern suggests that 'walm' causes the color before it to be repeated three times, regardless of whether the color appeared once or multiple times before the word 'walm'.",-1.2646898091919452,168,walm

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" from the given examples, let's break down each example by examining the transformation from the input to the output. 

1. ""lug wif walm"" is transformed into ""blue red red red"", where ""lug"" equals ""blue"" and ""walm"" equals ""red"".
2. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" is transformed into ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" equals ""yellow"", ""lug"" equals ""blue"", and ""walm"" equals ""red"".

5. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" is transformed into ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" equals ""yellow"", ""lug"" equals ""blue"", ""dax"" equals ""green"", and ""walm"" equals ""red"".

In all the examples, every occurrence of ""wif"" results in ""red"" in the output. There doesn't appear to be contextual dependence, as ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red.",-0.07978973507875278,169,wif
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""wif"", let's analyze the correspondence between the input and output sequences for each example:

- Input: lug wif walm
- Output: blue red red red

Here, the word ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", and the corresponding output for ""wif walm"" is ""red red red."" However, we cannot deduce the rule just from this example.

- Input: zup wif lug zup walm
- Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

In this example, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" and the corresponding output for ""wif lug"" is ""red blue.""

- Input: zup walm lug wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

This example shows ""wif"" at the end of the sequence, and the output for ""lug wif"" is ""blue red.""

- Input: wif bluf
- Output: red red

In this case, the word ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output for ""wif bluf"" is ""red red.""

- Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
- Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Given these examples, when ""wif"" appears in a sequence, the word following it seems to dictate the first color in the output after ""red"". No matter what the word is that comes after ""wif"", the corresponding output always starts with ""red"". 

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that its presence modifies the output to add ""red"" before the color that corresponds to the next word in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> the output will contain ""red"" followed by the corresponding color for the next word in the input sequence.",-0.08105524500951686,169,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the input and output.

Let's examine the examples:

1. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
2. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
3. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Looking at the outputs, we can see that ""red"" appears every time ""wif"" is in the input. Moreover, ""red"" does not appear in any other outputs without ""wif"" being in the input. This repeated occurrence suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

In examples 1, 3, and 5, ""wif"" precedes colors, and in those instances, ""red"" precedes the color pattern given in the output. In example 2, ""wif"" is in the middle, but ""red"" still immediately follows its occurrence in the output. Furthermore, in example 4, ""wif"" is followed by another color, and the output is two ""red"" in succession, suggesting that ""wif"" itself denotes the color ""red"" and is not necessarily dependent on the context it appears in.

Rule: wif -> red",-0.08845456932283147,169,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we must examine how the word is used in each example and look for patterns in the corresponding outputs:

- When we see ""lug wif walm,"" the output is ""blue red red red."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" appears frequently with ""yellow,"" the presence of ""wif"" as the second term correlates with the first ""red"" in the output.

- In ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here we see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again to ""yellow."" The interjection of ""wif"" again correlates with the first ""red"" after it.

- For ""zup walm lug wif,"" which yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" we note that ""wif"" appears at the end, following the same color sequence for the other words, but ends with a ""red.""

- ""Wif bluf"" gives us ""red red."" Since we don't have another example of ""bluf,"" we can't attribute the second ""red"" to it with certainty. However, the first ""red"" is consistent with the appearance of ""wif.""

- Lastly, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" with the output ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"" also begins with ""red,"" attributed to ""wif,"" and the subsequent color associations are consistent with the other examples for the subsequent words.

In each case, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sentence (beginning, middle, end), it always correlates with the appearance of ""red"" in the output. Given this consistent pattern, we can deduce the following:

Rule: wif -> red",-0.0929566959024719,169,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns of input and output to discern the rules for translation:

- In every case where ""wif"" appears, the word that follows ""wif"" in the sequence is translated to red in the output.
- ""wif"" itself is translated as red when it starts a sequence.
- When ""wif"" follows another word, it does not appear to have a consistent color output. This might suggest that its translation might be context-dependent or that it functions as a modifier for the following word.

Now let's analyze the inputs and outputs to draw further conclusions:

1. ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red,"" which suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Since ""wif"" appears before ""walm"" and correlates with ""red,"" it may be indicating that ""walm"" should also be translated as red.

2. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" becomes ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif lug"" turns into ""red blue,"" and ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow."" This again suggests that ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" and that ""wif"" may not have an output on its own but ensures ""walm"" translates to red.

3. ""zup walm lug wif"" translates into ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" In this case, ""lug wif"" correlates to ""blue red,"" but the pattern suggests that the appearance of ""wif"" after ""lug"" does not change ""lug"" but adds a ""red.""

4. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" This implies ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and it forces ""bluf"" to do so as well when following ""wif.""

5. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" becomes ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" again translates to ""red,"" and ""zup walm"" once more changes to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" remaining consistent even when there are other words between ""zup"" and ""walm.""

Taking these observations together, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" changes the translation of the word that follows it to ""red."" When ""wif"" starts a sequence, it translates to ""red."" Its presence suggests the next word will also be interpreted as ""red,"" regardless of what that word would usually mean.

- In all instances, the word ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of colors, with ""blue"" always being repeated following ""walm.""
- The number of times ""blue"" repeats corresponds to the number of syllables in the word preceding ""walm.""

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""lug walm wif lug"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue""

2. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
   - ""lug"" has one syllable, and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times before a color change due to ""dax.""
   
3. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
   - ""dax"" has one syllable, so after the first ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times. The color change to ""yellow"" is due to ""zup,"" followed by ""lug,"" then ""walm"" again, resulting in three ""blue.""

4. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" has one syllable, and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is followed by ""yellow"" due to ""zup."" After ""lug,"" we have ""zup"" and then ""walm,"" leading to a repeat of ""yellow.""

5. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""

   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Upon reviewing the above pairs, it is apparent that the meaning of ""bluf"" is not consistently associated with a specific color in the output. It might be the case that ""bluf"" is a rule that requires analyzing neighboring words or the sequence of the nonce words presented in the input. However, additional data or more complex patterns are needed to rule out the randomness and induce a definitive rule.

Considering the available information, we cannot define a consistent rule for ""bluf."" 

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" cannot be determined from the provided examples; the outputs are inconsistent and no clear pattern is discernible.",-0.059467134202792475,170,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the given examples:

1. In ""wif bluf dax lug,"" the output is ""red red green blue."" There is no obvious pattern here as to what ""bluf"" might mean, but ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

2. In ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug,"" the output is ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue."" Notice that the word ""bluf"" shows up twice, and each time its output is ""green."" However, the word ""bluf"" is not translating to ""green"" in the first example, which means either ""bluf"" does not translate directly to ""green"" every time, or there is contextual dependence.

3. In ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" again, but the previous words are not in the same order as in previous examples. This supports that ""bluf"" may translate to ""green"" but is contextually dependent.

4. In ""wif dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow."" Again, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" this time, and ""yellow"" appears twice just as ""bluf"" and another word do. This could indicate a rule where ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the last word mentioned before ""bluf.""

5. In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" Here, ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" which directly follows a ""green."" ""Dax"" appears right after ""bluf"" and its color is ""green,"" which was the color before ""bluf.""

We can try to identify a rule based on observing that ""bluf"" always translates to a color and sometimes that color corresponds to a previous one in the sequence. Given the examples, a plausible rule is that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that appears right before ""bluf.""

Bluf -> ""Repeat the color of the previous word.""

Let's apply this rule to the examples:

1. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
2. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
3. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
4. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green

This rule works for all the given examples and provides a consistent interpretation for the nonce word ""bluf.""",-0.06715891020596228,170,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf"", let's compare the input strings with their corresponding outputs, particularly focusing on the occurrence of ""bluf"" and the word in the output that aligns with it:

- Input: wif bluf dax lug | Output: red red green blue
  ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

- Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug | Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
  The first occurrence of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""; the second occurrence corresponds to ""yellow""

- Input: lug wif lug dax bluf | Output: blue red blue green green
  ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""

- Input: wif dax zup bluf | Output: red green yellow yellow
  ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""

- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax | Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
  ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

There is no consistent one-to-one mapping between the nonce word ""bluf"" and a single color in the outputs, as ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors in different contexts. However, there seems to be a pattern where ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word immediately preceding it:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red"" and ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow""
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green""
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow""
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""green red"" and ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green""

Using this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color value of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the word before it.",-0.07500919103179246,170,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the outputs and see where ""bluf"" appears in the inputs, and what is consistent about the output.

1. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in the first input/output pair.
2. In the second example, it corresponds to ""yellow"" when it is preceded by ""zup,"" and to ""green"" when it is not.
3. It corresponds to ""green"" in the third example.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" following ""zup.""
5. In the fifth example, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""red,"" but when it follows ""dax,"" it corresponds to ""green.""

Given that ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors based on the word that precedes it, we can deduce a pattern where ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on context. Specifically:
- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
- When preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color output associated with the word preceding it. If we treat ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" as signals for blue, blue, green, red, and yellow respectively, the meaning of ""bluf"" appears dependent on which signal word comes directly before it.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word multiple times. More specifically, the number of repetitions is equal to the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm"". 

Here is how the rule applies to the given examples:
1. ""zup lug walm"": ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" makes ""blue"" repeat four times (because ""lug"" has three letters).
2. ""zup walm lug wif"": ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" repeat four times (because ""zup"" has three letters), ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
3. ""dax walm"": ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""walm"" makes ""green"" repeat four times (because ""dax"" has three letters).
4. ""dax wif walm"": ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""walm"" makes ""red"" repeat four times (because ""wif"" has three letters).

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns before and after ""walm"" is introduced in each example:

- In the first example, ""lug"" correlates with a single occurrence of blue, but when ""walm"" is introduced after ""lug,"" blue is repeated three more times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and we get three occurrences of yellow before the introduction of ""lug,"" which gives us blue, followed by ""wif,"" which correlates with red.
- In the third example, ""dax"" correlates with a single occurrence of green, but when ""walm"" is introduced after ""dax,"" green is repeated two more times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" correlates with red after ""dax,"" but when ""walm"" is introduced after it, red is repeated three more times.
- The fifth example is identical to the third, reinforcing the pattern we've seen with ""dax"" and ""walm.""

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word preceding it to repeat three additional times. Therefore:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red red"" as ""wif"" stands for ""red"".
- ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green"" because ""dax"" is ""green"" and is followed by ""walm"", which repeats ""green"" three times.

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce that:

- The standalone ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- The word ""dax"" appears to maintain its meaning regardless of the position in the sequence.

Now let's see if the context of ""dax"" changes its meaning:

1. Input: ""dax""

   Here, there's a one-to-one correspondence between ""dax"" and ""green"".

2. Input: ""wif dax lug dax""

   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"" to two ""blues"".

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word 'wif' is associated with a particular color each time it appears. However, to deduce its meaning, we need to look at the other words in the sequences and the colors they correspond to. Let's analyze each input-output pair to identify patterns:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - Here, 'zup' and 'walm' both seem to map to 'yellow,' 'lug' maps to 'blue,' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red' at the end of the sequence.

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   - 'lug' and 'walm' map to 'blue' again, 'zup' now maps to 'yellow,' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red' the first time and 'yellow' the second time it appears. This suggests that 'wif' may not have a static meaning but depends on some aspect of the context.

3. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue
   - 'lug' maps to 'blue,' while 'wif' maps to 'red' here despite 'lug' appearing before and after it. 'bluf' also maps to 'blue.'

4. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red
   - Here, 'wif' appears three times and corresponds to 'red' every time, while 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'lug' to 'blue.' 

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - 'zup' and 'walm' both map to 'yellow,' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red.'

After reviewing the examples, it seems that the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red' whenever it appears at the end of a sequence. When it’s in the middle of a sequence, it takes the color of the word that comes after it in the sequence, except in the case where it follows 'lug,' in which it still represents 'red.'

Rule: wif -> 'red' at the end of a sequence; otherwise, the color of the following word unless followed by 'lug,' then it's 'red'.",-0.07181841954854444,171,wif

4. wif dax wif lug wif -> red green red blue red
5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red

Now let's note the position of ""wif"" and the output color that follows it:

- In the first example, ""wif"" results in a red color.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is followed by red and then by red again when it appears for the second time.
- In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by red.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by red each time it appears.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" results in red.

The consistent pattern observed is that regardless of its position or the words before it, ""wif"" always translates to the color red in the output.

This conclusion is reached by noting that each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here are the mappings from the examples:

1. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
2. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue red yellow red
3. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
4. wif dax wif lug wif -> red green red blue red
5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow red

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",-0.31466985332055564,171,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each non-wif word corresponds to a color:

- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue
- dax -> green

Now, looking at where ""wif"" appears and its respective output, we can try to find a pattern:

1. The first example indicates that ""wif"" following ""lug"" changes the next color in the sequence to red.
2. The second example shows that ""wif"" can change a following ""zup"" to red as well, and even affect another ""wif"".
3. The third example has ""wif"" after ""lug"", leading to blue remaining unchanged but the ""wif"" itself becomes red.
4. The fourth example has ""wif"" in multiple places, each instance turning red, but when ""wif"" follows ""dax"", it doesn't change the color of ""dax"".
5. The fifth example shows ""wif"" by itself at the end turning red again.

The common factor here is that ""wif"" itself is consistently tied to the color red, and it doesn't seem to change the color of the word that precedes it but only affects the following word if a specific color (in some instances, this could be contextual or represent a ""reset"" of the pattern).

Rule: wif -> red

"Analyzing the given examples, we notice that every non-wif word has a corresponding color in the output sequence, irrespective of its position. However, ""wif"" seems to produce a different color based on its position relative to the other words.

Let's examine how ""wif"" behaves according to its position:

- When ""wif"" is placed after ""lug walm"", the output color is red.
- When ""wif"" is placed after ""zup lug"", the output color is yellow, followed by red.
- When ""wif"" is alone before ""lug"", the output color is red.
- When ""wif"" is between ""lug"" words or follows ""dax"", the output color is red.

"To determine the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and output pairs.

1. ""dax walm wif bluf"" correlates with ""green green green red red"". We can note that ""dax"", ""walm,"" and ""wif"" each translate to ""green,"" and following these, the nonce word ""bluf"" results in ""red red."" 

2. ""dax zup bluf"" correlates with ""green yellow yellow."" Here ""dax"" is again ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow"" as well.

3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" correlates with ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" ""Wif"" changes to ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" again, and ""lug walm"" translates into ""blue blue blue,"" though it's important to note that ""lug"" alone corresponds to ""blue"" in example 5.

4. ""zup bluf"" correlates with ""yellow yellow."" Here again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" as well.

5. ""lug zup bluf dax"" correlates with ""blue yellow yellow green."" ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

Based on the examples, one rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" could be that it replicates the output color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the output color of the preceding word. If the preceding word outputs ""green,"" ""bluf"" outputs green. If it's yellow, ""bluf"" outputs yellow, and so on.",-0.10288463675132534,171,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" is related to the colors that follow its mention in the inputs, specifically altering the pattern or sequence of colors. To decipher it, let's examine the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
2. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
3. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green

Let's try to identify a pattern:

- When ""dax"" appears before ""bluf"", it outputs green before changing the pattern.
- When ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"", it outputs red before changing the pattern.
- When ""lug"" appears before ""bluf"", it outputs blue before changing the pattern.
- ""zup"" is consistently followed by yellow, regardless of whether ""bluf"" appears or not.
- In the absence of ""dax"", ""wif,"" or ""lug"" before ""bluf"", only yellows are present in the output after ""bluf"".

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" initiates a change in the color pattern that is dependent on the word that precedes ""bluf."" Given the data, the word after ""bluf"" tends to repeat the color that ""bluf"" corresponds to based on the word immediately before it. The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" will cause the next color to repeat based on certain conditions created by the word preceding ""bluf.""

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears, it causes the next word(s) to repeat the color output of the word directly before ""bluf.""

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" changes in meaning depending on the context it is placed in, that is, the word preceding it. Specifically, ""bluf"" seems to take its color from the color associated with the word that comes directly before it, repeating that color pattern twice. Here's how it works out in the given examples:

1. ""wif bluf"" becomes ""green red red"" since *""wif"" corresponds to ""green""* and the rule for ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it twice.
2. ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"" as *""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""*, and ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color pattern twice. 
3. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and so ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow.""

5. In ""lug zup bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be articulated as follows:

**Rule:** bluf -> meaning: Repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, producing two instances of that color.

Substituting 'meaning' with the rule:
bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, producing two instances of that color.",-0.8106710167311564,171,bluf
"From the examples provided, the following patterns can be observed:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" followed by two ""red"" colors.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is two ""yellow"" colors.

Comparing the instances where ""bluf"" is preceded by different words, it seems that ""bluf"" dictates a change based on the preceding word, transforming the output to a sequence of identical colors. The number of colors in the output is not always constant and appears to depend on the preceding word:

- ""dax"" leads to one ""green"" followed by two ""red"".
- ""wif"" leads to one ""red"" followed by three ""blue"".
- ""zup"" leads to two ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" before ""zup"" and ""bluf"" combined leads to one ""blue"", followed by ""zup bluf"" resulting in two ""yellow"".

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" triggers replication of a color change, possibly dependant on the context provided by the preceding word's assigned color.

However, since ""dax"" and ""wif"" are each immediately followed by ""bluf"" once and produce two ""red"" and three ""blue"" respectively, the rule isn't entirely clear. There could be a pattern regarding the number of repetitions based on the sequence or specific words, which is not apparent from the current examples.

It is also noticed that ""bluf"" never stands alone; it's always preceded by another word which seems to inform the output. With the information provided, a precise rule or exact meaning for ""bluf"" can't be defined, but it is an element that influences the color sequence directly after the words it follows, likely determined by the color associated with the preceding word.

"Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the immediately preceding word three times.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow""; therefore, ""walm"" seems to be taking the color associated with ""zup,"" which in previous examples has been ""yellow.""
- The third example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" The segment ""lug walm"" is directly before ""dax"" and results in ""blue blue blue."" Again, the word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word right before it three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm dax"" outputs ""blue blue blue green,"" where ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the rule that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color three times.
- The last example, ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" outputs ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow.""

"Based on the provided examples, walm appears to correlate with a repetition of the color word that precedes it. Specifically, walm causes the color word that comes immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output. Here is the breakdown:

- When ""lug walm"" is input, ""blue blue blue"" is output, so ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated thrice.
- When ""zup walm"" is input, ""yellow yellow yellow"" is output, thus ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" triggers a threefold repetition of ""yellow.""
- When ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" is input, ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue"" being output three times consecutively. After ""walm"" comes ""dax"" which is followed by ""lug"" again, but ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"" and does not affect the rule for ""walm.""
- Similarly, ""lug walm dax"" and ""zup wif lug zup walm"" follow the same pattern where ""walm"" directly follows a color word, causing that color word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the immediately preceding color word to repeat three times in the output.",-0.4835383546039536,171,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. Let's examine the patterns:

- ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""lug"" (""blue"") and repeats it three times.
- Similarly, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""zup"" (""yellow"") and repeats it three times.
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" within the sequence still results in ""blue blue blue,"" maintaining consistency with the previous interpretations.
- The fourth example, ""lug walm dax,"" has the repeated ""blue blue blue"" from ""lug walm"" and adds ""green"" from ""dax,"" not affecting the definition of ""walm.""
- The final example has ""zup walm,"" which should theoretically result in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" based on our understanding. The surrounding words (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug"") each generate their corresponding color once before and once after the ""walm"" series.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times.",-1.0199371899023255,171,walm
"Given the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it. For instance:

- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" means ""repeat blue"" three times.
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" means ""repeat yellow"" three times.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and therefore, ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times again.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and again ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" causing ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" means to repeat the color that corresponds to the word before it three times.

By examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can infer the following:

- Every time the word 'dax' appears, the color 'green' is in the output at the same position.
- The position of 'dax' in the input doesn't affect its output—it always corresponds to 'green,' irrespective of whether it comes first, last, or in between other words.

Therefore, the word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green' consistently throughout all examples. In other words, we can deduce the rule:

The other words ""walm"" and ""dax"" also seem to have consistent outputs, with ""walm"" mapping to ""red"" and ""dax"" mapping to ""green,"" while ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" means ""yellow"".",-1.9627651684873244,172,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will analyze each example, looking for patterns or consistencies that can inform us of the rule. Let's look at each input-output pair:

1. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax | Output: blue green green red green
2. Input: zup bluf lug | Output: yellow yellow blue
3. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
4. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax | Output: green blue yellow red red green
5. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green

Here are the observations:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" appears: in example 1, it occurs between ""dax"" and ""wif"" and, in example 2, between ""zup"" and ""lug."" In the first instance, ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" and in the second instance, it translates to ""blue.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup,"" and there's no color associated with it in the output. This suggests that ""bluf"" might not always correspond to a color on its own.
- Example 4 shows ""bluf"" between ""wif"" and ""dax."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is also the color that corresponds with ""wif."" There's no clear pattern here on what ""bluf"" means.
- Lastly, in example 5, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax"" and corresponds to the output ""red,"" which again matches the output for ""wif.""

With this information, we may speculate that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the previous color,"" as it repeats the immediately preceding color in every example provided. With this rule, in examples where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green), the output is green, when it follows ""wif"" (red), the output is red, and after ""lug"" (blue), it is blue. The third example does seem to break this pattern by not outputting a color for ""bluf"" after ""zup"" (yellow), which needs an explanation.

Since ""bluf"" is not always followed by a color in the Output (as in the third example), the rule might be that ""bluf"", when at the end of a sequence, does not add an additional color but rather indicates repetition of prior output without introducing a new color. This, however, is not completely consistent with the other examples unless the repetition is somehow conditional or context-dependent.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color"" when it is followed by another word that converts into a color, but when it's at the end, it does not output a new color, possibly just echoing or indicating the end of a pattern. 

For a more definitive rule, we would need additional examples or more information.",-0.13516904500722896,172,bluf
"From the provided examples, we can attempt to infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"". Analyzing the input and output patterns, we can observe the following:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears between ""lug dax"" (blue green) and ""wif dax"" (red green), and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is green. This doesn't immediately suggest what ""bluf"" means, since it's between words that translate to different colors.

- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and precedes ""lug"" (blue), while the output for ""bluf"" does not appear, as the output is simply ""yellow yellow blue.""

- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), but there is no output corresponding to ""bluf"", simply a repetition of ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" (red) and followed by ""dax"" (green), and there are two reds in the output where ""bluf"" should correspond, suggesting that ""bluf"" could result in a repetition of the previous color.

- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax"" results in ""red red green,"" which again shows ""bluf"" corresponding to a repetition of the previous color (red in this case).

Based on the above observations, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated in the output.

If we assume ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively, it seems that ""walm"" may be a command or function that repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. 

The pattern seems to be:

- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the output has a sequence of three yellows after the first yellow.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green,"" where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the output is two additional greens.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the output is two additional reds.
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the output has an additional yellow.
- ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and the output has two additional blues.

4. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
5. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""

In every instance, the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is translated into a color that is repeated three times in the output before changing to a different color. Therefore, we can deduce that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color that corresponds to the word before it three times.

"From the given examples, it appears that walm causes the output to repeat the color that would have been assigned to the word preceding it multiple times. Here's how the rule applies to the given examples:

1. Example: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Explanation: 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'wif' to 'red.' After walm is used, 'red' is repeated three times.

2. Example: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Explanation: 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'lug' to 'blue.' After walm is used, 'blue' is repeated three times.

3. Example: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   Explanation: 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' 'zup' to 'yellow,' 'bluf' has no preceding color so it repeats 'yellow,' 'lug' to 'blue.' After walm, 'blue' is repeated three times, then the sequence continues with 'dax' to 'green' and finally 'lug' to 'blue.'

   Explanation: 'dax' corresponds to 'green.' After walm is used, 'green' is repeated twice more.

Based on these observations, I can induce that walm causes the output to repeat the color of the word before it three times. Here is the formal rule:

2. When ""dax"" is immediately followed by a different word (e.g., ""zup"" or ""walm""), the output color following ""green"" corresponds to the pattern of that word observed in other examples (e.g., ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"").
3. When ""dax"" is repeated without a different word between (""dax zup dax""), the output is ""green"" for both instances of ""dax,"" while ""zup,"" again, corresponds to ""yellow.""
4. In ""zup walm dax,"" ""zup"" and ""walm"" both lead to ""yellow,"" while ""dax"" at the end corresponds to ""green.""

"From the given examples, we can analyze the position of the word ""bluf"" and its corresponding output to determine its meaning. Here are the observations:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif dax,"" which corresponds to ""green red green."" Since the pattern for ""dax"" seems to be ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" it appears that ""bluf"" results in ""green.""

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is in the middle of ""wif"" and ""zup,"" and the output colors for these positions are ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, while ""bluf"" outputs ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears twice, both times followed by ""zup."" The output for ""bluf zup"" sequence is ""blue yellow"" and ""yellow yellow,"" respectively.

5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif,"" with the corresponding output being ""yellow yellow red.""

Analyzing the sequences where ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding output colors, it seems that ""bluf"" might not have a fixed color associated with it, but perhaps a rule depends on its context.

Examining the inputs and outputs, I notice that ""bluf"" always results in the color that precedes its position in the output. Here are the respective ""bluf"" positions and its output color:

- Example 1: bluf -> red (position of ""wif"" color)
- Example 2: bluf -> green (position of ""dax"" color)
- Example 3: bluf -> red (position of ""wif"" color)
- Example 4: bluf -> blue (first instance, position of ""lug"" color), yellow (second instance, position of ""zup"" color)
- Example 5: bluf -> yellow (position of ""zup"" color)

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated thrice.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated thrice.

- In the second and fifth examples, 'lug walm' leads to 'blue blue blue'. Here 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and after 'walm', 'blue' is repeated two more times, for a total of three 'blue' outputs.
- In the third example, 'wif walm zup' leads to 'red red red yellow'. Similar to the first example, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'red' is repeated because of 'walm'.
- The fourth example, 'wif dax lug walm', outputs 'red green blue blue blue'. Here 'lug' precedes 'walm' and corresponds to the color 'blue'. 'walm' causes 'blue' to be repeated for a total of three times.

- When ""walm"" is alone with the word ""lug,"" the output is three blues.
- When ""walm"" is with ""lug"" but there are other words (""wif,"" ""dax"") the output associated with ""walm"" is still blue, but the number of blues depends on the additional words.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup,"" the output is three reds followed by a yellow, but it's not clear from the examples if the yellow is related to ""walm"" or ""zup.""

However, there is an exception in the second line where ""lug walm"" outputs three blues. The first and fifth lines are the same yet inputs but with different outputs. Also, there is no instance of ""walm"" followed by ""dax"" that doesn't include ""wif,"" so it's unclear how ""walm"" might affect the color associated with ""dax"" on its own.

Taking this into account, it becomes difficult to define an explicit rule for ""walm,"" as there is no consistent pattern that applies to all examples when considering the context or the position of ""walm"" in the string.

We can attempt a speculative rule based on the most consistent outcome, which seems to be related to the word that precedes ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red; when it follows ""lug,"" the output is blue. The color seems to be linked to the noun that ""walm"" follows, with ""wif"" prompting red and ""lug"" prompting blue.

- Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is a repetition of one color.
- The number of repetitions of the color in the output corresponds to the number of words in the input.

From this, we can induce that ""walm"" signals the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"":

- In the first input, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""wif"" corresponds to red in the output, thus ""walm"" results in a repetition of red.
- In the second input, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""lug"" corresponds to blue in the output, leading to a repetition of blue.
- In the fourth input, ""lug"" is the word before ""walm"" and results again in blue being repeated in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow",-1.760385507736471,175,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule appears to correspond to the output color being repeated for each occurrence of the nonce word 'bluf'. Here's my induction:

For the first example,
- ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" becomes ""green green red blue yellow"":
  Here 'bluf' precedes 'lug' and 'wif', and the output colors for these words are 'red' and 'blue'. However, 'bluf' gives us 'green', which is the color for 'dax'.
  
In the second example,
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" becomes ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"":
  The word 'bluf' follows 'zup' with the corresponding color 'yellow'. It appears to repeat the color of 'zup', since it is immediately before 'bluf'.

In the third example, 
- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"":
  The word 'bluf' follows 'wif', and the output color 'red' is repeated.

In the fourth example,
- ""zup bluf dax"" becomes ""yellow yellow green"":
  The word 'bluf' follows 'zup' and again the output color 'yellow' is repeated.
  
In the fifth example,
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" becomes ""red red red blue blue"":
  Here 'bluf' follows 'lug', and the output color 'red' is associated with 'wif' and 'walm'. However, 'blue' is repeated, which is the color associated with 'lug'. 

The consistent pattern is that 'bluf' repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. 'bluf' means repeat the color of the word that comes before 'bluf'.
Meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.",-0.07348301389596668,175,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can see that the output color changes depending on the words that are paired with ""bluf."" Below are the observations:

1. When bluf is paired with ""dax"" the output is green.
2. When bluf is preceded by ""wif"" the output is red.
3. When bluf is paired with ""zup"" the output is yellow.
4. When bluf is preceded by ""lug"" the output is blue.

Thus, it seems that ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on the word it follows or is paired with. The word ""bluf,"" therefore, carries the meaning of the color associated with the preceding word. 

Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the preceding word; it mirrors the output color of the word that comes directly before it.",-1.2178360481111108,175,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, where each input corresponds to an output in the same position, it seems that ""bluf"" directly maps to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" changes the color output of the words that follow it to red. Here's the breakdown of the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" The word following ""walm"" (dax) and the word after that (zup) both become red despite normally translating to green and yellow, respectively.
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue."" The word following ""walm"" would usually be ""green"" but is changed to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" turns into ""yellow yellow red red red."" The word following ""walm"" (wif) changes to red.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" but there's no word following ""walm"" to indicate a change to red following the pattern of the other examples.
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red."" Here again, the word following ""walm"" becomes red, and the original ""blue"" does not appear afterwards.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the colors of the words that follow it to become red. However, due to the fourth example where no word follows ""walm,"" we cannot definitively say that this pattern holds consistently without additional context. Therefore, the rule induced from the given data, but with a note of uncertainty due to one outlier example, can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" changes the color output of all subsequent words to red, except when no words follow it.",-0.09897378921762498,175,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" it's useful to look at the outputs for each example and find a pattern. Let's list the examples with their corresponding outputs and see what we can determine:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. lug wif walm -> blue red red red

Looking at these examples, ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color of the word that comes before it:

1. wif (red) walm (red red) dax (green) zup (yellow)
2. dax (green) lug (blue) walm (blue blue blue)
3. zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) wif (red) walm (red red red)
4. dax (green) walm (green green)
5. lug (blue) wif (red) walm (red red red)

In each case, ""walm"" generates a sequence of the same color that is associated with the word immediately prior to it. So, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word the same number of times as there are letters in ""walm"" (which is four).",-0.10787167594118752,175,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I'll analyze each input line and the corresponding output color sequence. I'll look for patterns in the colors that appear when the word ""walm"" is present.

1. Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is red for the position of ""walm.""
2. None of the other words consistently map to red in every instance, suggesting the color red is specifically tied to the presence of the word ""walm.""
3. ""dax"" corresponds to green except when followed by ""walm,"" where it still appears but in the first position, followed by reds. This suggests that ""dax"" itself signals green, but the rule for ""walm"" overrides the color for the subsequent positions after ""walm"".
4. ""lug"" corresponds to blue regardless of its position except when followed by ""walm,"" similar to how ""dax"" behaves with ""walm.""
5. ""wif"" corresponds to red; however, when ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" only ""walm""'s position is red, and ""wif"" takes on another color if it occurs in a sequence before ""walm.""
6. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and its pattern is not altered by the presence of ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, its corresponding output color is always red, and any other colors corresponding to words that come after ""walm"" in the sequence are also red. This suggests that ""walm"" has a cascading effect on the colors that follow it, turning them all red, while not affecting any preceding colors.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context appears to be:

walm -> Turns the output color of its position, and the positions of any subsequent words, to red.",-1.1167250083625002,175,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at how it affects the output across all examples.

- In every instance where ""walm"" is present, the color ""red"" appears in the output one or more times.
- The presence of ""walm"" also corresponds with a repetition of the color that precedes it. For example, when ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- This pattern holds consistent in the other examples as well. When ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") precedes ""walm,"" the output includes additional reds, denoting repetition.
- ""Walm"" does not correspond to any single color but rather indicates that the color tied to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be repeated.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated.",-1.3045163181724995,175,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can induce a rule about the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" To analyze the input-output pairs, we should look for patterns especially focusing on the inputs and outputs that include ""walm.""

Here are the observed patterns:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output ends with consecutive ""red.""
2. The length of the ""red"" sequence in the output corresponds to the number of words following ""walm"" in the input, plus one extra ""red.""

From these observations, we can infer the rule:

Rule: walm -> triggers a sequence of ""red"" in the output, with one ""red"" for itself and one additional ""red"" for each word that follows ""walm"" in the input.",-1.7995284618124998,175,walm
"From the examples provided, we can induce the meaning of ""lug"" by looking for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs.

3. zup lug bluf wif -> yellow blue blue red
4. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
5. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can compare the outputs that follow each instance of ""wif"" in the inputs. Let's first list the examples given where ""wif"" is followed by another word and the corresponding color output:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. wif lug -> red blue
3. wif zup -> red yellow
4. wif lug dax -> red blue green

In each case, the presence of ""wif"" yields the output ""red."" So when ""wif"" appears before another word, it always translates to ""red."" The other words following ""wif"" correspond to their own colors (e.g., ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow""). 

For the fifth input:

We can deduce that ""wif"" stands alone yields ""red,"" ""lug"" after ""wif"" yields ""blue,"" ""zup"" both before and after yields ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" which is a new word yields ""yellow"".

2. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
3. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
4. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

Looking at the examples where ""bluf"" appears, it seems like ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

1. In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" is green, so ""bluf"" is also green.
2. In ""lug zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" is also yellow.
3. In ""zup wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" is also red.
4. In ""wif walm lug bluf,"" ""lug"" is blue, so ""bluf"" is also blue.
5. In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" is also yellow.

Given this pattern, we can deduce the following:

"Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that follows the last non-bluf color mentioned before it. If there's no color mentioned before it, ""bluf"" defaults to ""yellow"".

Explanation: In each example, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the non-bluf word that immediately precedes it:

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" (since ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" also becomes green).
2. ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> ""blue yellow yellow green"" (here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow).
3. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"" (""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word ""wif,"" which is red).
4. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue"" (""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, so ""bluf"" becomes blue, and it's repeated because there are two ""bluf"" words at the end).
5. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (with no other color mentioned before ""bluf,"" it defaults to the previous color, ""yellow"").

bluf -> ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that follows the last non-bluf color mentioned before it, or to yellow if there's no color mentioned before it.",-0.34874520572870715,176,bluf
"Assessing the input-output patterns, it appears that the output color is determined by the preceding word in the sequence. Here's the pattern associated with the outputs given the inputs:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is red.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is red.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is blue.
- When ""bluf"" is not preceded by any word, as in the sequence ""zup bluf,"" it outputs the color corresponding to the word before it (""zup"" which is yellow).

We can infer the following rule:

""bluf"" -> The output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color for the word immediately preceding it, except when that word is ""dax,"" in which case the color is red. If ""bluf"" is the second word in a sequence and the first word is ""zup,"" then it repeats the color output of ""zup.""

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is blue.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is red.
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" alone, the output is yellow.

From these observations, it appears that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word that immediately precedes it in the input. The output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the word before it, with the exception of when it directly follows ""dax"", in which case the output is red.

Rule: bluf means ""repeat the color of the preceding word unless the preceding word is 'dax', in which case it is red.""",-1.2864121966895123,176,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs with their respective outputs. The goal is to identify a pattern that helps us understand how the nonce word ""walm"" affects the output.

Let's examine the inputs and outputs carefully:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

5. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

Observations:

- ""wif"" always leads to the output ""red"".
- ""dax"" always leads to ""green"".
- ""lug"" always produces ""blue"".
- ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"".

When ""walm"" appears in the input, we can see that it results in the repetition of the color word that came just before it. Each occurrence of ""walm"" elongates the duration of the previous color, resulting in the repetition of the color in the output sequence.

Here is the breakdown of the first example based on this observation:

- ""dax"" (green), then ""wif"" (red),
- ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" therefore red is repeated twice more,
- ""lug"" (blue),
- ""zup"" (yellow),
- ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" therefore yellow is repeated two more times.

Thus, based on the patterns observed, the rule for the word ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color word in the output sequence for an extended duration.",-0.06835565500891176,176,walm
"Observing the input and output of the examples provided, the patterns suggest the following rule:

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" yields ""red,"" then ""walm"" causes the next two (as there are no further words) outputs to be ""red.""

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" causes the next three outputs to be ""yellow,"" though only two ""yellow"" are observed before a ""dax"" breaks the pattern with ""green.""

5. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - ""dax"" yields ""green,"" then ""walm"" causes the next three outputs to be ""green.""
   - Then ""wif"" yields ""red"" and ""lug"" yields ""blue"" as per the standard pattern.
   - Then ""dax"" again yields ""green,"" followed by ""walm,"" which causes the next three outputs to be ""green.""

"Given the examples, it seems that ""walm"" in this context refers to a rule of repetition for the output color associated with the preceding word.

"Given the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the previously mentioned color. In the sequences, each time ""walm"" appears, the output is a sequence of the same color that immediately precedes ""walm."" Here's a breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow. The output for ""walm"" is thus ""red red"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" respectively.
- In the second example, ""wif dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third example, ""wif walm,"" there is no color before ""wif,"" yet ""walm"" produces ""red red,"" which might suggest that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" when there is no other color preceding.
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, so it outputs ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and then later ""dax"" again, both times corresponding to green. So ""walm"" outputs ""green green"" each time.

Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" means repeat the previous color mentioned multiple times.

This is evident in that ""walm"" always follows a color word, and the output is a repetition of the color associated with that word. The number of repetitions seems to be three, but when ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, the repetitions become two, possibly due to the repetition of the ""dax walm"" pattern itself in a sequence. However, without more context or examples, this secondary pattern is speculative.

Evidence for this rule is found in the structure of the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

2. In the second example, ""lug"" is blue, and following it with ""walm"" results in three consecutive blues.

3. In the third example, the presence of ""wif"" and then ""walm"" yields a repetition of reds.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" gives a yellow and ""walm"" after it repeats yellow twice. ""Dax"" gives a green, and ""walm"" is not present after, so no repetition of green is observed.

   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red""

From these examples, we can deduce that the presence of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output color ""red,"" regardless of its position or the words surrounding it.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif | Output: green green red yellow red
- In this example, ""wif"" appears twice and follows ""bluf"" and ""zup"" respectively, the word before ""wif"" corresponds to the color green or yellow and ""wif"" itself corresponds to red.

Input: dax lug wif lug | Output: green blue red blue
- ""Wif"" follows ""lug"", the word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and ""wif"" is associated with red.

Input: zup dax lug wif dax | Output: yellow green blue red green

Input: lug walm wif bluf | Output: blue blue blue red red
- ""Wif"" appears after ""lug"" and ""walm"", both of which are associated with blue, and before ""bluf"", which is associated with red.

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to have the following pattern: when the word ""wif"" appears after another word, the output for ""wif"" is the color red. Specifically, looking at the first position after any given word (not including ""wif""), we can see that the word ""wif"" does not reflect the same color as the word before it. Instead, it consistently translates to red. Here is how this pattern appears in the provided examples:

- In the first example ""dax wif walm,"" ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and the output for ""wif"" is red.
- In the second example ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" both occurrences of ""wif"" produce red.
- In the third example ""dax lug wif lug,"" ""wif"" follows ""lug"" and outputs red.
- In the fourth example ""zup dax lug wif dax,"" ""wif"" follows ""lug"" and outputs red.
- In the fifth example ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and also gives a red output.

Additionally, in the fourth example, the ""dax"" after ""wif"" outputs green, and the preceding word to ""wif"" is also ""dax.""

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the rule for the nonce word ""zup"". Let's analyze the examples:

1. The simple input ""zup"" results in the output ""yellow"".
2. In the second input, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow"", while ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"". 
3. The third input features ""zup"" followed by ""dax"" twice, and the output is ""yellow green green"". This suggests ""zup"" is not affecting the following word.
4. In the fourth input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"".
5. The fifth input has ""wif"" and ""walm"" both outputting ""red"" with no ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug"" this time, followed by ""zup"" which corresponds with ""yellow"", and then ""walm"" corresponding with ""yellow"".

4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   
5. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   
Observations:
- ""bluf"" always occurs towards the end of the input string.
- Every time ""bluf"" appears, ""blue"" appears in the output string, mostly after the previous color has been repeated.
- In every case except the first, there are two instances of ""blue"" in the output following ""bluf.""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or ""walm,"" which all output red at least once in the given examples, ""bluf"" yields ""blue"" twice.
- When preceded by ""dax"" (green) or ""zup"" (yellow), which only show up once in their respective strings before ""bluf,"" the output does not show a repeated ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" prompts the output of the color ""blue."" Furthermore, the rule seems to indicate that the number of times ""blue"" is outputted after ""bluf"" is related to the number of times the color preceding it is repeated.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"" repeated as many times as the color immediately before it has been repeated. If the color before it is not repeated, then the output is ""blue"" once.

Putting this into perspective:
- In the first input, ""red"" is present once before ""bluf,"" so the output is ""blue"" once.
- In the second input, ""red"" is present three times before ""bluf,"" resulting in ""blue"" being outputted twice (maybe this indicates some sort of maximum limit to the repetition rule or an error in the pattern).
- In the third input, ""yellow"" is present once before ""bluf,"" so the output is ""blue"" once.
- In the fourth input, ""red"" is present once before ""bluf,"" but since there is multiple ""dax"" (green) present afterwards, this input might not follow the basic rule pattern, or there may be another layer to the rule regarding subsequent inputs. However, ""blue"" follows only the ""red"" without repeating.
- In the fifth input, ""red"" is present once before ""bluf,"" so the output is ""blue"" once.

Given the inconsistency in the second input, I will conclude the meaning of ""bluf"" with the tentative rule based on the other inputs:

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns and correlative relationships within the given inputs and outputs.

Looking at the first example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green blue red red."" The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"". We need more information to deduce if it always means red.

The second example, ""wif walm lug bluf"", translates to ""red red red blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the sequence ""blue blue."" This indicates that ""bluf"" may not consistently represent a single color, but can also indicate that a color is repeated.

The third example, ""zup bluf,"" results in ""yellow yellow."" In this case, ""bluf"" has resulted in a repetition of the color ""yellow.""

The fourth example, ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" equates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"" since the pattern before and after ""bluf"" doesn't include red.

The fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup,"" corresponds to ""red red blue yellow,"" where ""bluf"" relates to a repeated ""red.""

From these examples, we can formulate a rule for ""bluf"":

Looking through the examples, we can observe the following:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" results in ""red.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" which suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" could be doubled.
- In example 3, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" could mean double the color mentioned before it.

- In example 5, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" confirming that ""bluf"" doubles the previous color.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'walm,' we will look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs provided in the examples.

Let's break down each example:

1. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""

2. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Following this pattern, ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" and after ""wif"" gives ""red red red."" Thus, 'walm' repeats the color of the word before it, three times.

3. ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue""
   We see ""dax"" and ""lug"" again, with their corresponding colors, followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

4. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""
   Once more, ""walm"" is repeating the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" three times.

5. ""zup wif dax walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red green green green""
   Each word has its own color, and ""walm"" again repeats the color of the preceding word, which in this case is ""dax,"" represented by ""green.""

The pattern suggested by these examples is that 'walm' repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it three times.",-0.09038753169550622,177,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the given examples:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
2. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
4. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green""

From the examples above, we can infer the following patterns:

- Every instance of ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of a color.
- The color that is repeated corresponds to the word that is immediately preceding ""walm.""

Looking at Examples 1 and 4, we have single words followed by ""walm"":
- ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green,"" so ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In Example 3, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"":
- This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In Example 5, ""dax walm"" again results in ""green green green,"" reinforcing the ""dax"" to ""green"" relationship. Also, ""wif dax walm"" gives us ""red green green green,"" indicating that ""wif"" has no color output on its own but modifies the repetition, possibly indicating that the next color should be repeated an additional time.

Additionally, in Example 2, ""lug walm"" is ""blue blue blue,"" but ""wif walm"" following it results in ""red red red"" instead of the expected ""blue blue blue"" (if we were only to replicate ""lug""). This indicates that ""wif"" changes the situation, likely indicating the next color should be ""red"" and should be repeated.

From these observations, we can develop the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be repeated three times. If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" then the color ""red"" is repeated three times, irrespective of the word that came before ""wif.""",-0.14274762236135805,177,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each input-output pair and see if we can figure out any patterns.

1. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""
2. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
3. ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue""
4. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup wif dax walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red green green green""

From the above, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times:

- In example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats the green three times.
- In example 2, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and then ""walm"" makes it ""blue blue blue""; when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" it becomes ""red red red.""
- Example 3 supports the ""lug"" to ""blue"" pattern with ""walm"" making ""blue blue blue.""
- In example 4, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats it as ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- Example 5 combines ""zup"" for ""yellow,"" ""wif"" for ""red,"" and ""dax"" for ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green"" in this case.

So the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: If X is a color word, then ""X walm"" results in ""X X X.""",-0.1666224341097531,177,walm
"To decipher the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine the patterns in both the input and the output. First, we notice that every time ""walm"" is used, a word in the output is repeated three times.

1. In the ""dax walm"" input, ""green"" is repeated three times. ""Dax"" is associated with ""green"" in the input and appears once, followed by a repeated ""green"" in the output.
   
2. In the ""zup lug walm wif walm"" input, we have the sequence ""blue blue blue"" corresponding to ""lug walm"" and ""red red red"" corresponding to ""wif walm"". If we consider ""lug"" as ""blue"" and ""wif"" as ""red"" based on other input-output examples, it's the ""walm"" that is responsible for the triple repetition of the subsequent color in the output.

3. The ""dax lug walm"" input outputs ""green blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" might mean ""blue"", ""dax"" means ""green"", and ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word just before it to be repeated three times.

4. In the ""zup walm"" input, ""yellow yellow yellow"" is the output, indicating that ""walm"" causes the word just before it, ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow,"" to repeat three times in the output.

5. The ""zup wif dax walm"" input has the output ""yellow red green green green,"" where ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""dax"", which precedes ""walm,"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times.

Given these observations, we can deduce the rule that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated thrice in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we need to look at the consistent patterns in each example. Analyzing the given input and output pairs, we can try to find a correspondence for ""lug"" in each output.

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to ""blue blue"" in the output.

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" precedes ""wif"" and ""walm,"" which correspond to ""blue red"" in the output.

3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to ""blue blue blue"" initially, and then ""lug"" is followed by ""wif,"" corresponding to ""blue red"" in the output.

4. Input: lug zup wif zup
   Output: blue yellow red yellow
   - ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to ""blue yellow"" in the output.

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""blue blue"" in the output after ""red"" for ""wif.""

If we examine the patterns where ""lug"" appears, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Additionally, it seems to translate to a single ""blue,"" regardless of what words follow or precede it. Let's write down the rule:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" represented by the word ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position or the words around it.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"", we should first observe the output colors associated with each input containing ""zup"" and any patterns that may exist in the provided examples.

In the first input, ""zup dax walm,"" the output is ""yellow green green green."" From this example alone, we cannot isolate the meaning of ""zup"" as we have three other words and four colors. 

The second input offers more insight: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug."" The output is ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" By comparing it with the first example, we see that ""walm"" consistently results in the color green in the output, and it is unaffected by the position or other words around it. This suggests that ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue,"" since it is repeated and followed by blue in the output. ""Bluf"" does not appear in other examples, but within this context, it likely represents the color ""blue"" as well.

The third input, ""zup dax,"" with the output being ""yellow green,"" provides another direct correlation. ""Dax"" precedes ""green"" again, indicating ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" In each case where ""zup"" appears, the color yellow is associated with it.

The fourth example is similar: ""zup wif"" becomes ""yellow red."" Now we see that ""wif"" is associated with red without any doubt, as there are no other factors. The prediction made from the first example about what ""wif"" might mean is now reinforced.

The fifth input, ""dax zup,"" inversely to the third example, results in ""green yellow."" This solidifies the individual meanings of ""dax"" as ""green"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

Through all these examples, ""zup"" is the common factor associated consistently with the color yellow, regardless of position or neighboring words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.08320951073431582,178,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" by looking at the patterns before and after it is used, and the corresponding output colors. Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green."" Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""walm"" seems to also translate to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" In this case, ""lug"" translates to both ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" depending on its position, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" again to ""green."" It is notable that ""zup"" is followed by ""walm lug,"" which translates to ""yellow yellow blue,"" suggesting that ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green,"" which is consistent with the previous examples where ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" Here, ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red"" and ""zup"" applies as ""yellow.""
- The final example, ""dax zup,"" translates to ""green yellow,"" again consistent with ""dax"" as ""green"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

From the examples given, the rule that consistently applies to the meaning of ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-0.12751726134605265,178,zup
"Based on the examples provided:

- Every time ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- The word ""walm"" also results in ""green"" when in the phrase ""zup dax walm,"" and the same for ""lug zup walm lug,"" but ""walm"" on its own is not provided, so the rule for ""walm"" might be context-dependent or the same as ""dax.""
- ""wif"" appears once with ""zup"" and the output is ""red.""

The rule appears to be that when ""zup"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-1.118043681553947,178,zup

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-1.7644330716157892,178,zup
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" outputs a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Considering each of the inputs and outputs:

- ""lug wif bluf"" becomes ""blue red red"" (repeating the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red"").
- ""zup bluf"" gives us ""yellow yellow"" (repeating the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow"").
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"" (repeating the color associated with the last ""zup"" before ""bluf,"" which is ""yellow"").
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" turns into ""yellow blue red green green red"" (repeating the color associated with ""dax"" before ""bluf,"" which is ""green"").
- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"" (again, repeating the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red"").

Rule: bluf -> The meaning of bluf is to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",-0.07987742109045001,178,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a relationship between the nonce word ""bluf"" and the outputs:

1. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
4. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
5. wif bluf -> red red

It seems that ""bluf"" on its own does not have a consistent colour output, but when in sequence with other words, it influences the colour output of the preceding word.

Carefully looking at the outputs, we see that the colour before ""bluf"" is always repeated once ""bluf"" is mentioned:

- In example 1, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and after ""bluf,"" the next color is ""red,"" which is the output of ""wif.""
- In example 2, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated.
- In example 3, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and after ""bluf,"" the ""yellow"" which is the output for ""zup"" is repeated.
- In example 4, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" the ""red"" which is the output for ""wif"" is repeated.
- In example 5, ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated.

From these observations, the rule concerning ""bluf"" can be inferred as the following:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, the colour output associated with the preceding word is repeated immediately after ""bluf.""

So, the rule would be:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color output associated with the word that immediately precedes it.",-0.12481466127562499,178,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the common pattern associated with its output in all given examples:

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax."" The output corresponding to these inputs are three yellows followed by a green, where ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is three yellows. There is no word after ""walm.""

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- In this case, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug."" The pattern is the same: the output of ""walm"" is three yellows, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green.

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output after ""lug"" is three blues, followed by ""wif,"" which is red, and ""lug"" again, which is blue.

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup."" The output corresponding to these inputs is three greens, followed by ""walm,"" which is also followed by ""zup,"" and the pattern repeats with three yellows.

Significantly, ""walm"" always corresponds to three repeated colors in the output. The color repeated is the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm,"" indicating that ""walm"" acts as a command or function that repeats the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color output associated with the prior word three times.",-0.10018237193303368,178,walm
"walm -> Rule: Repeat the color associated with the word before it.

Explanation: In each example, when the word ""walm"" appears, the output color repeats the color associated with the preceding word:

- In ""zup walm dax,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated before moving on to ""dax,"" which corresponds to green.
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated again.
- In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and is followed by ""walm,"" which repeats yellow. Then ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" follows with red. The pattern of ""zup"" and ""walm"" repeats, leading to yellow, and ""dax"" gives us green.
- In ""lug walm wif lug,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue and is repeated after ""walm."" ""Wif"" corresponds to red, again followed by ""lug"" which is blue.
- In ""dax walm zup walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, which repeats after ""walm."" Then ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm,"" it is repeated.",-0.3771298552125843,178,walm
"By observing the patterns and the corresponding colors in the outputs, we can infer the meaning or rule associated with the word ""walm."" 

Every occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of the color that follows the next word (if there is one). In other words, ""walm"" appears to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the following word three times. 

For instance:
- ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" where ""walm"" seems to make ""yellow,"" which is the color for ""zup,"" repeat three times, before giving the color for ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" has the sequence ""yellow yellow yellow"" for ""zup walm,"" then the color for ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" followed by the color for ""zup"" again, which is ""yellow,"" and lastly the color for ""wif dax,"" which is ""red green.""

When ""walm"" appears at the end of an input with no word after it to determine the color, the pattern of repeating the last color is not applicable because there's no subsequent color to dictate the output. In this case, the output is just the color for ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" repeated for the number of times ""walm"" would normally repeat the next color, if there were one.

Using this rule, here is the meaning for ""walm"":

We can infer that ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the color associated with the previously stated word, repeated three times. Thus, when ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color corresponding to that word repeated three times.

- The third example is clear; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""wif"" by ""bluf"" results in ""red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- In the final example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" first, which corresponds to ""red,"" and then ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Hence the output is ""red green blue blue.""

This pattern suggests that whatever word precedes ""bluf"" determines the color that is output, and ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word.",-0.6895280856254545,179,bluf
"The nonce word ""bluf"" seems to translate to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug,"" and ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"". When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it results in ""yellow,"" which does not follow the one-to-one color association seen with ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif."" However, ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"" twice after ""zup,"" suggesting that ""zup"" might influence the color repetition rather than the meaning of ""bluf."" Thus, following the pattern in the input-output examples, we can induce the rule that ""bluf"" takes the color of the previously mentioned word, with ""zup"" being an anomaly that requires repetition:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that precedes it. If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the meaning is ""green."" If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the meaning is ""blue."" If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the meaning is ""red."" If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the meaning is ""yellow"" and the color word is repeated.",-0.8512025121933764,179,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.,-1.656241897036363,179,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs with their outputs and look for patterns. Here's what we can observe from the examples given:

1. Whenever ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
2. When ""wif"" and ""dax"" bracket ""walm"" (i.e., ""wif walm dax""), the output starts with ""red"" and ends with ""green.""
3. When ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" are present and ""walm"" is placed before ""wif,"" the last color is ""red"" while the rest follow the sequence that ""lug"" and ""dax"" would produce without ""walm.""

From these observations, ""walm"" could signify a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, up to three times. However, this interpretation doesn’t explain why ""wif walm dax"" produces ""red red red green"" instead of ""red red red.""

Instead, let's consider the possibility that ""walm"" serves to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions appears to correspond to the presence of ""dax,"" which causes a triple ""green"" repeat.

Here's a potential rule:

- ""walm"" -> repeat the last color mentioned, the number of repetitions dependent on specific triggers (for example, ""dax"" triggering three repetitions).

Let's test this rule with the given examples:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green"" is repeated three times because ""dax"" is before ""walm.""
2. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax walm"" makes ""green"" repeat three times.
3. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""walm"" repeats this ""red"" twice, followed by a green for ""dax.""
4. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, and ""wif"" at the end turns to ""red.""

However, this rule does not explain why ""wif"" in the third example isn't repeated as it is in the second and fourth examples, which contrasts with the established pattern. If we cannot ignore this inconsistency, we might need additional examples or context to refine our rule.

Given this limitation, a rule that currently aligns with the provided examples is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the color ""green"" will be repeated three times. If not, the repetition pattern is not consistent, or additional information is needed to explain it.",-0.3299260604435844,179,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" induces repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Each example demonstrates that the color word before ""walm"" is repeated a number of times in the output.

- In example 1 and 2, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" causes ""dax"" (green) to repeat three times.
- In example 3, ""dax walm"" within the sequence ""wif lug dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" again, which is consistent with the first two examples.
- In example 4, ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green,"" indicating that ""walm"" caused ""wif"" (red) to repeat three times.
- In example 5, ""lug dax walm wif"" leads to ""blue green green green red,"" which is again consistent as ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" with ""lug"" leading to a single ""blue,"" and ""wif"" leading to a single ""red.""

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" has a consistent output regardless of its position in the input. In every instance, ""walm"" results in the word ""green"" being outputted. Here's an analysis of each input and output that leads to this conclusion:

- In the first and second examples, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", with ""dax"" clearly corresponding to the first ""green"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" maps to ""red"", ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", """"dax"" maps to ""green"", and ""walm"" is followed by another ""green"", implying ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green"".
- The fourth example shows ""wif"" and ""walm"" in juxtaposition, resulting in ""red red red"", making it clear that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the sequence.
- In the last example, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", ""dax"" maps to ""green"", ""walm"" again produces another ""green"", and ""wif"" at the end results in ""red"".

Therefore, based on these examples, we can deduce that regardless of its position, ""walm"" consistently correlates with the output ""green"" without regard to the surrounding words.

"To determine what ""bluf"" means, we need to analyze the examples and look for patterns or connections between the word ""bluf"" and the output colors.

In the first example, ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green red green yellow yellow."" We notice that ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow"" in the sequence. However, just from this example, it's difficult to induce a rule, so let's examine the other examples.

In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow."" This is consistent with the yellow in the first example, but still insufficient to deduce a rule.

The third example, ""lug zup bluf dax,"" results in ""blue yellow yellow green."" Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow."" This consistency in the color yellow associated with ""bluf"" across different sequences is becoming more apparent.

The fourth example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green."" In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"" in the sequence. This deviates from the yellow we've seen so far, but it’s worth noting that here ""bluf"" appears at the end once again, much like in the first example.

The fifth and final example, ""wif zup bluf lug,"" converts to ""red yellow yellow blue."" ""Bluf"" results in ""yellow"" once more, reinforcing the association we've seen in the majority of examples.

Despite the one instance where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" the predominant pattern is that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" especially when it does not occur at the end of the sequence. Therefore, we might conclude:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally means ""yellow,"" unless it appears at the end of the sequence, in which case it is ""green.""

However, with the data provided, we can only decisively conclude the association with ""yellow"" and not the conditional ""green"" at the end. The exception in the fourth example may require more examples to establish a pattern or could be an outlier.

Final rule based on the majority of examples:
bluf -> yellow",-0.0718608676443402,180,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" has a direct translation into a color, as each occurrence of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output. Each preceding word, like ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" also corresponds to a particular color. By examining the consistencies across these examples, we can deduce the following mappings:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue

To determine what ""bluf"" means, we must look at the color it gets translated to when it appears in the examples:

1. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green red green yellow yellow,"" which means ""bluf"" is translated as ""yellow.""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red,"" which means ""bluf"" is translated as ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" is not defined, but consistently results in ""red.""
3. ""lug zup bluf dax"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow green,"" which means ""bluf"" is translated as ""yellow.""
4. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" outputs ""red green yellow red green green,"" which means ""bluf"" is translated as ""green."" However, this is inconsistent with the previous examples.
5. ""wif zup bluf lug"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue,"" which means ""bluf"" is translated as ""yellow.""

Given this, it's apparent that there is a conflict in the fourth example. The presence of double ""green"" at the end is problematic, as it indicates that ""bluf"" could be thought of as ""green"" in this instance. This inconsistency means we cannot simply state a static meaning for ""bluf"" based on these examples. Instead, it seems likely that ""bluf"" is dependent on some contextual rule that is not immediately clear from the data provided.

Considering all the examples except the fourth one, the simplest rule is that ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow."" Focusing on the rule-inductive nature of our look at the data:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> translates to ""yellow"" based on the majority of examples, though there may be an exception or an unspecified contextual rule that could make it translate to ""green"" as seen in the fourth example.",-0.08661634885510312,180,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> ""the color represented by the word that immediately precedes 'bluf'."" 

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word 'bluf' appears, it takes the color of the word directly before it. Here are the breakdowns:

- In the first example, ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" we determine that 'dax' is green, 'wif' is red, 'zup' is yellow. Since 'bluf' follows 'zup,' it also becomes yellow.
  
- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" 'zup' is identified as yellow and is followed by 'bluf,' hence 'bluf' is yellow. 'Wif' is again red, as consistent with previous examples, and 'walm' introduces a new word with no assigned color but repeats, so it keeps the same color, which is red.

- In the third example, ""lug zup bluf dax,"" 'lug' is blue, 'zup' is consistently yellow, and 'bluf' follows 'zup' and thus is also yellow. 'Dax' remains green.

- In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" the pattern holds with 'wif,' 'dax,' and 'zup' maintaining their established colors. 'Bluf' comes after 'dax,' which is known to be green, so 'bluf' is green.

- In the final example, ""wif zup bluf lug,"" 'wif' is red, 'zup' is yellow, so 'bluf' which follows 'zup' is yellow. 'Lug' which comes after 'bluf' is blue, maintaining its color from the previous example.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' adopts the color of the word immediately before it.",-0.4037802582798967,180,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns:

1. The presence of ""bluf"" after ""zup"" consistently results in both being translated to ""yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color following ""dax"" is ""green,"" but ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" 
3. When ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" we've seen ""wif"" as ""red,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""
4. When ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, it seems to follow a pattern of repeating the color of the word just before it (exception of ""bluf"" after ""dax"" which seems to follow a unique rule mentioned in point 2).
5. In all cases where ""bluf"" doesn't directly follow ""dax,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
6. When ""bluf"" is at the beginning of the sequence, it's not observable due to lack of examples.

Based on these patterns, the rule for ""bluf"" could be defined as the following conditional:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" then it is ""yellow."" (Based on rule 2)
- In other cases, ""bluf"" appears to copy the color of the word just before it. (This is a generalization from rule 4 and is congruent with rule 1 and 3, but there is an exception with ""wif"" leading to ""bluf"" being ""green"" while ""wif"" itself is ""red"").

The general rule seems to have an exception for when ""bluf"" follows ""dax."" However, there are not enough diverse examples to fully confirm these rules. The absolute consistency can't be guaranteed with the limited dataset, but below is the induction from the given examples:

2. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

Example 3 places ""wif"" in the first position resulting in the color red appearing in the first position of the output.

Example 4 has ""wif"" in the second position, and red appears in the second position of the output.

Finally, in example 5, ""wif"" is in the first position, and red is also in the first position of the output.

A consistent rule that can be inferred from the data given is that ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence. The inconsistent color (yellow) appearances in examples 1 and 2 could be related to other words in the input or some other rule, which is not discernible from the provided examples alone.

Rule: wif -> red",-0.10592425234805193,181,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we can analyze each input and its corresponding output, looking for patterns that correlate with the appearance of ""wif.""

Let's examine the outputs where ""wif"" appears and note the output color that corresponds with it:

1. lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   ""wif"" correlates with ""red""

2. dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   ""wif"" correlates with ""red""

3. wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   ""wif"" correlates with ""red""

4. lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   ""wif"" correlates with ""red""

5. wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   ""wif"" correlates with ""red""

In all cases, regardless of position, the presence of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the rule for the meaning of ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red",-0.10699143520181817,181,wif
"From the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" doesn't have a fixed color associated with it. Instead, the color that ""wif"" corresponds to changes depending on its position in the sequence or possibly its relation to other words. Let's examine the examples to deduce the rule.

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
2. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
3. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. wif zup -> red yellow

Now, let's identify patterns:

- In examples 3-5, where ""wif"" appears first or second, it translates to ""red.""
- In example 1, ""wif"" is the final word and translates to ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""wif"" is third in a sequence and translates to ""red.""

From these observations, we can notice a plausible pattern:

- When ""wif"" is the first or second word in the sequence, it seems to correspond to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is the third word, it's not consistent (in example 2 it is ""red,"" but no example shows ""wif"" in the third position that would contradict this).
- When ""wif"" is the last word in the sequence, it corresponds to ""yellow.""

However, there is limited data to fully confirm these assertions, especially for the third position where we only have one example. We might be missing additional context or rules for other positions due to a lack of examples.

Given the available examples, the tentative rule is:

Rule: When ""wif"" is at the beginning or second in the sequence, it corresponds to ""red."" When it is the last word in the sequence, it corresponds to ""yellow."" There isn't enough data to conclusively determine the meaning when ""wif"" is in the third position or other positions, but there is a suggestion that it could still mean ""red"" in the third position. More examples would be needed for a definitive rule.",-0.10919085994628572,181,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's identify patterns based on the examples given:

- Example 1: lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
- Example 2: dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
- Example 3: wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
- Example 4: lug wif bluf -> blue red red
- Example 5: wif zup -> red yellow

We notice that ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup"" seem to correspond to consistent colors: ""lug"" to blue, ""walm"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow. ""Dax"" appears once and corresponds to green. Considering this consistency, we can try to isolate the effect of ""wif"" in the following manner:

- In Example 1, we have four colors followed by ""wif,"" which result in three blues followed by a yellow and red. Since ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup"" already correspond to blue, blue, and yellow, respectively, we could infer that ""wif"" corresponds to red since that is the additional color appearing in the output.
  
- In Example 2, ""wif"" is between ""walm"" and ""zup."" Since ""walm"" is green in this case and ""zup"" is yellow, the appearance of ""red"" after green and before yellow could be attributed to ""wif.""
  
- In Example 3, ""wif"" is the first term, followed by ""lug walm,"" resulting in red followed by three blues. The sequence starts with red, which suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to red.
  
- In Example 4, ""lug wif bluf"" results in blue red red. Since ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""bluf"" is not defined but the sequence ends with red, we could deduce that ""wif"" contributes to the first red.
  
- In Example 5, ""wif zup"" results in red yellow. Given that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" should correspond to red.

From these observations, it appears that ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red"" being part of the output, regardless of position. This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red",-0.12444584730706496,181,wif

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" seems to be a typo or an untranslated word, possibly meant to be the same as ""lug"" (blue), given the output pattern

- dax -> green
- wif -> red

4. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> Output: red green yellow red green green
5. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: green green yellow yellow green

Based on the outputs, we can see that the word immediately following ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. Additionally, we see that distinct words such as ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" are consistently associated with unique colors: ""red,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

"Analyzing the examples provided where the nonce word ""walm"" appears, we can see that the output is always a series of the same color repeated a number of times. Specifically, the color is repeated as many times as there are syllables in the word preceding ""walm"". Below are the observations from the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" suggests that ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""dax"" (green) and repeats it for the number of syllables in ""dax"" (1 syllable, repeated 3 times).

2. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"" shows that ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) and repeats it for the number of syllables in ""zup"" (1 syllable, repeated 3 times).

3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" again shows the same pattern as in the previous example.

4. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow"" shows that ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""wif"" (red) and repeats it for the number of syllables in ""wif"" (1 syllable, repeated 3 times). The following ""zup"" does not influence the ""walm"" meaning.

5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"" confirms the pattern, with ""walm"" taking the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) and repeating it for the number of syllables in ""lug"" (1 syllable, repeated 3 times).

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the correspondence between the inputs that contain ""walm"" and their respective outputs.

- Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow
- Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

From the outputs, we can see that whenever ""walm"" appears, the color that precedes ""walm"" is repeated three times. For example:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" (green is repeated three times).
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" immediately following ""walm"" (yellow corresponds to zup, which is the word before ""walm"").
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (yellow is repeated three times).
- ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red"" immediately before ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"" (red corresponds to wif, which occurs right before ""walm"").
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue"" immediately following ""walm"" (blue corresponds to lug, which is the word before ""walm"").

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Explanation:
1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"": ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.
2. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"": Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.
3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" again repeats it three times.
4. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow"": ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" which is red, repeating it three times before moving on to the next color, which is ""zup"" (yellow).
5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"": ""walm"" causes ""lug""'s corresponding color (blue) to repeat three times, followed by a single ""zup"" (yellow), then ""lug"" again (blue), another ""zup"" (yellow), and finally ""wif"" (red). 

Therefore, ""walm"" means to take the color of the immediately following word and repeat it three times. If there is no word after ""walm,"" it is likely that a default rule might apply, but we do not have an example to deduce what that would be.",-0.13360558239600004,181,walm

   Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats the green three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",-0.0814810467305977,182,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in each example.

1. ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue.""
2. ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red.""
3. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red.""
4. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow.""
5. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green.""

In looking for patterns in the above examples, we can see that:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the corresponding output colors after ""blue"" (for ""lug"") are all ""blue,"" which suggests repetition of the previous color.
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the corresponding output colors after ""yellow"" (for ""zup"") are all ""yellow,"" suggesting the same rule of repetition.
- In example 3, the presence of ""walm"" and the subsequent color pattern are the same as in example 2.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output colors after ""red"" (for ""wif"") are repeated ""red.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is repeated ""green,"" the same color as ""dax.""

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, for a number of times equal to the number of times ""walm"" is used.

Rule:
walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word for as many times as ""walm"" appears in the sequence.",-0.11983033758326435,182,walm
"The nonce word ""walm"" appears to be related to colors in the output. To determine the rule, we should examine the associated colors in the outputs wherever ""walm"" appears:

1. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
2. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
3. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
4. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""
5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

Examining these examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Using this pattern, we can state the following:

1. ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", and the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
3. The same pattern holds for the third example with the repetition of ""yellow"".
4. ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and the color ""red"" is repeated twice.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and the color ""green"" is repeated twice more.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence, as in example 5, it causes the color associated with the first word to repeat for a total of three times.

Using this rule, we conclude:

walm -> The color of the preceding word is repeated three times.",-0.1289401957538391,182,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in each example:

- In the first example, the output for ""walm"" is blue-blue-blue.
- In the second and third examples, the output for ""walm"" is yellow-yellow-yellow.
- In the fourth example, the output for ""walm"" is red-red-red.
- In the last example, the output for ""walm"" alone is green-green-green.

We need to figure out what is special about ""walm"" in the context of the other words. Observing the other color outputs for non-""walm"" words, we notice that each non-""walm"" word is associated with a single color in the output. However, when ""walm"" appears, it produces three of the same color in succession.

From the input-output pairs given, it seems that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word, as follows:

1. In ""wif lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" repeats blue three times.
2. In ""zup walm lug wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" repeats yellow three times.
3. In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""zup"" still corresponds to yellow, resulting in the same repetition of yellow for ""walm"".
4. In ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" repeats red three times.
5. Finally, in ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""walm"" repeats green three times.

Since the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be consistently about repeating the color of the previous word thrice, the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.6142774013513107,182,walm
"Observing the patterns between the inputs and outputs, we can infer the following:

- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and ""wif,"" the word ""walm"" generates additional ""blue"" outputs. In the first and third examples, ""walm"" results in three extra ""blue"" outputs when it directly follows ""wif lug.""
- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" as in the fifth example, ""walm"" generates two more ""green"" outputs, matching the output of ""dax.""
- When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" as shown in the first two examples, the repeated output is ""yellow,"" the same as the output for ""zup."" However, the quantity of repeated ""yellow"" is one less than the quantity of ""green"" produced with ""dax.""

- The second example also shows ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""
- The third example supports this pattern, with ""wif"" resulting in ""red"" twice.

- ""zup"" on its own results in a single ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm zup"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow,"" where again, ""zup"" corresponds to the ""yellow"" at the end.

"From the given examples, we can induce a rule related to the nonce word ""bluf"" and its meaning.

In every example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that immediately follows it. Here is a breakdown of the examples to support this finding:

1. In ""dax bluf wif zup lug,"" the word ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color ""red."" The output is ""green green red yellow blue.""

2. In ""zup bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" is followed by nothing; however, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the repeated word in the output suggests that ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"" in this context.

3. In ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" ""bluf"" is again followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" This is consistent with the output ""blue green green red green.""

4. In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" is once again followed by nothing; however, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since the output is ""red red,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in this context.

5. In ""dax bluf wif lug,"" ""bluf"" comes before ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" The output ""green green red blue"" reflects this.

Based on these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" means the same as the color denoted by the word that immediately follows it; if ""bluf"" is the last word or not followed by another color word, it repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

Input: lug walm wif zup wif | Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
Input: lug walm dax | Output: blue blue blue green
Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow

The output sequence associated with ""walm"" in each example is a repetition of three of the color that immediately follows the word ""walm."" Here's the pattern:

5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (the color corresponding to ""zup"" is repeated three times, as there is no following word)

Based on the repetition occurring immediately after the use of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can derive the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that follows ""walm"" in the sequence to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the last word, then the color associated with the word preceding it is repeated three times.

- ""zup"" is matched with ""yellow"",
- ""dax"" is matched with ""green"".

With that in mind, whenever ""walm"" follows one of these words, the color associated with that word repeats in the output. This allows us to form the following associations:

- In the second input, we again see ""lug"" leading to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" leading to ""red."" ""Walm"" appears after ""lug"" and results in ""blue blue."" ""Zup"" at the end corresponds to ""yellow.""

Considering the given examples, ""dax"" does not seem to depend on its position or the words that come before or after it. The only consistent aspect across all examples is that ""dax"" always results in the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or surrounding context.",-1.3095216528522116,184,dax

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green.""",-1.630780738263463,184,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can reason about the word ""wif"" by looking at the correlation between its appearance and the colors in the output. We notice that every instance of ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red"" in the output. Here is the pattern that emerges:

- Every time ""wif"" appears, ""red"" follows in the output sequence.
- ""wif"" appears to be independent of position (beginning, middle, end of the input sequence).
- ""wif"" doesn't seem to affect the color output of other words; for instance, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" etc., irrespective of whether ""wif"" precedes or follows them.

"Inspecting the examples, it appears that 'bluf' takes on the color of the word that follows it in the pattern. Let's go through each example to confirm this hypothesis:

1. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" -> ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
   - Here bluf is followed by 'wif', which is represented as 'red'. Accordingly, bluf is given the output 'yellow', which actually corresponds to 'zup', the word before 'bluf'. This is consistent with subsequent examples.
   
2. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""
   - Here bluf is followed by 'wif', which is 'red'. However, bluf's output is 'green', representing 'dax', which precedes it.  
   
3. ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green""
   - In this instance, 'bluf' is again followed by 'dax', which is 'green'. Consistently, 'bluf' is represented as 'blue', showing that it took on the color of 'lug', the word before it.
   
4. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
   - In this example, 'bluf' follows 'zup', which is 'yellow' and hence bluf also outputs 'yellow', the color representing the word before it, 'zup'.

5. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""
   - Similarly, in this sequence, 'bluf' is followed by 'zup' which is 'yellow', but 'bluf' is represented by 'red', the color for 'wif', which precedes 'bluf'.

Based on these observations, the rule for 'bluf' seems to be that it takes on the color associated with the word that precedes it, not the one that follows it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",-0.06657637790220407,184,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is a mirror or copy instruction. In other words, when ""bluf"" is encountered, its output is the same color as the word that immediately precedes it. This is supported by the following observations:

1. In the first example ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup,"" the word that comes right before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" also outputs ""yellow.""

2. In the second example ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug,"" the word that comes right before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" hence ""bluf"" also outputs ""green.""

3. The third example ""dax lug bluf dax"" has ""lug"" before ""bluf,"" and since ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" so does ""bluf.""

4. The fourth example ""zup bluf"" is a straightforward repetition where ""zup"" is output as ""yellow,"" and so is ""bluf.""

5. In the fifth and final example ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif,"" the word ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"" and since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" also outputs ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word's output.",-0.4209072849436225,184,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in each example:

- When ""bluf"" is sandwiched between two identical words (e.g. ""zup bluf zup,"" ""lug bluf lug""), it takes on the color of those words.
- When ""bluf"" is adjacent to different words (e.g. ""dax bluf wif,"" ""wif bluf zup""), the output color for ""bluf"" does not appear to take on the color of the immediate neighbor words.
- The output color associated with ""bluf"" does not seem to depend on the position of the word in the sequence; rather, it depends on the surrounding words.

Based on the above observations, the possible rule for ""bluf"" could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word immediately preceding it.

However, this rule does not apply to the last example (""wif dax wif bluf zup wif""), where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" but does not translate to ""red."" Unless there is additional context or examples, the rule might need to be revised. Yet, with the current information, the most consistent pattern that can be derived is:

Bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word if there is a repetition of words; otherwise, it can differ.

With that said, applying this rule would mean:

- ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" -> ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, so it is yellow.
- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, but it is the same color as ""lug,"" so it turns blue.
- ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, so it is blue.
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, so it is yellow.
- ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> this example does not fit the rule well, but if ""bluf"" should be red as it follows ""wif,"" then the rule does not hold.

It is also possible that there is an error in the examples, or additional rules might be affecting the outcome which are not clear from the examples provided.

In light of the inconsistency in the last example, the rule needs further clarification with more consistent examples.",-0.5161440136866329,184,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze each line and see if there is a pattern that can help us infer the rule.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""

From these examples, we can observe that ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color value of the preceding word.",-0.8927921323040819,184,bluf
"Looking at the examples, we notice that the output does not contain a color that corresponds to ""bluf"" and that ""bluf"" seems to be a reflection or repetition of the word that comes immediately before it. Specifically, ""bluf"" produces a color that matches the one produced by the word right before ""bluf."" This is evident in the first example where the word ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and both result in the color ""yellow."" The same pattern holds in the other examples.

Based on the given data, the rule for ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.",-1.311386135204082,184,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should examine the patterns in which different inputs correspond to different outputs. Let's analyze each example closely.

- ""lug zup dax walm"" results in ""blue yellow green green green""
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red""
- ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green""
- ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red""

From the above examples, we can deduce the following:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" precedes ""red"" and doubles the color output
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

Now, looking at the occurrences of ""walm"", we see:
- In the first and the second example when ""walm"" follows a color, it seems to repeat that color three times.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which doubles the color output; thus, ""walm"" following this pattern results in three ""reds"" after the doubling.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the output is three ""yellows.""
- In the fifth example, we have two instances of ""walm,"" each producing ""red"" three times after the doubled output from ""wif.""

Considering the consistent pattern of repetition in the outputs related to ""walm,"" the rule seems to indicate that ""walm"" repeats the color generated by the preceding word thrice.

Rule: walm -> repeats the previous color three times.",-0.11185889268441382,184,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to affect the output by repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word. For instance, in the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", repeating the color output for ""dax"" which is green.

Here's the breakdown of the rule:

- In the first example, ""lug zup dax walm"", the ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which outputs ""green""), and the result is ""green green green"", which is a triplication of the ""dax"" output.
  
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which outputs ""blue""), and the result is ""blue blue blue"", triplicating the ""lug"" output.
  
- In the third example, ""dax walm wif bluf"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and therefore the output is ""green green green"" before moving on to ""wif bluf"" which outputs ""red red"".

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" before ""dax"" which outputs ""green"".

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" resulting in ""green green green"", then ""wif"" is ""red"", and the following ""walm"" repeats that output, giving ""red red red"".

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the color output of the immediately preceding word three times.",-0.23719211592252876,184,walm
"Based on the examples given, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. We can see this from the repetition of the color word that follows each instance of ""walm"". 

For example:
- In the first input ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with the color green and after ""walm"" we have ""green green green"" indicating that ""walm"" causes a repeat of the color associated with ""dax"".
- In the second input ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with the color blue and after ""walm"" we have ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"".
- In the third input ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""dax"" is green and ""walm"" follows, causing ""green green green"" to appear, and after ""wif"" which is associated with red, ""bluf"" is introduced, causing a repetition of red as indicated by the doubled output ""red red"".
- In the fourth input ""zup walm dax,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow and ""walm"" follows, which results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" before changing to green for ""dax"".
- The fifth input ""dax walm wif walm"" further solidifies the rule, as ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" which results in ""green green green"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" resulting in ""red red red"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",-0.26104692006282765,184,walm
"From the examples given, we can deduce that ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" for the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively plus one. We observe this by looking at the relationship between the words and their corresponding color outputs:

1. In the first example ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"" there are three greens instead of one, which means ""walm"" causes the repeating of ""green.""

2. In ""dax lug walm,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to blue and is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three blue outputs.

3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" - ""dax"" turns into green, and following ""walm,"" green is repeated twice more, and ""wif bluf"" results in two red outputs.

4. ""zup walm dax"" - ""zup"" is yellow and followed by ""walm,"" which results in three yellow outputs before we see a green output for ""dax.""

5. ""dax walm wif walm"" - The first ""dax"" corresponds to green, and it's followed by ""walm,"" which normally would just double the green, but it's followed by ""wif"" which correlates with red and another ""walm"" which triples the red.

Based on the pattern:

1 green (dax), 1 blue (lug), 1 red (wif), and 1 yellow (zup) followed by a walm results in an additional color of the preceding word.

1 green (dax), 2 greens because one ""walm"" follows.
1 blue (lug), 3 blues because one ""walm"" follows (extra blue because there's one preceding word before ""lug"").
1 green (dax), 2 greens, 1 red (wif), 2 reds because one ""walm"" follows ""wif.""
1 yellow (zup), 2 yellows because one ""walm"" follows, 1 green.
1 green (dax), 2 greens, 1 red (wif), 3 reds because one ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (an extra red due to ""walm"" repeating the color).

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word one additional time for each consecutive occurrence of walm.

"Rule: ""walm"" seems to result in the output being a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. 

For instance, in the first example, ""lug zup dax walm,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green."" Following the rule, ""walm"" results in the color ""green"" being repeated three times after ""dax.""

In the second example, ""dax lug walm,"" the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue."" Thus, ""walm"" results in the color ""blue"" being repeated three times.

Reviewing the examples, we see that ""bluf"" never corresponds to the same color across different examples: it is green in the first, yellow in the second and third, and blue in the fourth and fifth. What we can deduce is that ""bluf"" is likely a variable dependent on position or surrounding context, as it changes colors in different positions and differs when next to other words.

Observe that ""dax"" always corresponds to green and ""lug"" always corresponds to blue, so their outputs are consistent regardless of where they appear.

The ""bluf"" outputs are as follows:
- In the first line, ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow) and is green, taking on the color of ""dax.""
- In the second line, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" (yellow) on both sides and outputs yellow, matching ""zup.""
- In the third line, ""bluf"" is after ""zup"" (yellow) and outputs yellow again, suggesting that it might take the color of the preceding word when followed by ""zup.""
- In the fourth line, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and outputs blue, potentially indicating that here it takes the color of the word before it.
- In the fifth line, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is again blue, further supporting the idea that it may take on the color of the preceding word.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the pattern of inputs and outputs.

Looking at the outputs for each of the inputs, we can see that each English word seems to translate consistently to the same color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Since ""bluf"" is present in all the input strings and consistently translates to either ""blue"" or ""yellow"" in the output strings, we need to identify a pattern that can elucidate when it translates to ""blue"" and when it translates to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug

- When ""bluf"" is not immediately preceded by ""lug"" (examples 1, 2, and 3), it translates to ""yellow.""

- ""zup dax walm lug wif"": Output is ""yellow green green green blue red."" The word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""green"" is repeated three times after ""yellow.""

Based on this analysis, the rule that ""walm"" seems to follow is that the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> The word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.",-0.07190470761978024,185,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it two more times. In other words, ""walm"" takes the color output related to the word right before it and duplicates it twice, creating a sequence of three identical colors in the output.

Here are the deductions for each input/output pair:

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Rule: ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" twice more.

2. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" twice more. Then, ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" twice more.

3. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: The colors follow their respective words until ""zup"", after which ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" twice more.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Rule: ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" twice more.

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   Rule: ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" twice more. Then, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""wif"" with ""red"", without the influence of ""walm"" thereafter.

Therefore, we can define ""walm"" as follows:

"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" appears to cause the next color in the sequence to repeat an additional two times. For example, when 'walm' follows the word 'lug,' which corresponds to the color 'blue,' the output is 'blue blue blue.' Therefore:

"To deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the word ""dax,"" let's look at the given examples and their corresponding outputs, isolating the occurrences of ""dax"":

- In the first example, ""wif dax bluf"" translates into ""red green green."" Here, ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") and followed by ""bluf"" (which corresponds to ""green"").
  
- In the second example, ""dax lug wif"" becomes ""green blue red."" ""Dax"" comes before ""lug"" (translated as ""blue"") and after an implicit start of the sequence (no preceding color).

- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax"" becomes ""red red green."" Here, ""dax"" is preceded by ""bluf"" (red) and is at the end of the sequence.

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" ""Dax"" is preceded by ""bluf"" (red) and followed by ""walm"" (which corresponds to ""green green"").

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red."" Here, ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") and followed by ""walm"" (green green) and ""lug"" (blue).

From these examples, we can discern a relationship based on the position of ""dax"" and the colors that precede and follow it. The occurrences of ""dax"" are associated with the color ""green."" Let's examine the possible rule:

1. When ""dax"" appears after ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" which results in ""red"" output, ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" appears at the beginning or end of the sequence or is not immediately preceded by ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" the output next to ""dax"" remains ""green.""

However, there is a slight discrepancy with the second example, where ""dax"" should theoretically be followed by a ""green"" based on our rule, but the color that follows is ""blue."" This discrepancy may arise from a rule we have not identified yet, but based on the other instances, the rule for ""dax"" seems consistent with the color ""green.""

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, generally following the pattern where colors that come after ""dax"" in the sequence are also ""green,"" unless influenced by another rule not clearly identified in these examples.",-0.08228608224462651,186,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we will examine the examples and look for patterns. Let's map each instance of ""dax"" to its corresponding color in the output:

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green
2. dax lug wif -> green blue red
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
5. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red

Here are the observations:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, the word ""dax"" is followed by the word ""bluf"" or stands by itself at the end of the input, and the related output is ""green.""
- In example 1, ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" while in example 2, ""dax"" comes first. The colors for ""wif"" when it's the first word are ""red"" in example 1 and ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"" in example 5. This implies that the color for ""dax"" is independent of its position relative to ""wif.""
- In example 5, ""zup"" precedes ""dax,"" and the color output is ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" followed by ""green"" for ""dax."" Here, ""dax"" again has a color ""green.""

From these observations, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sentence. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.08330483286054219,186,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the positioning of ""dax"" within various inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green
2. dax lug wif -> green blue red
3. wif bluf dax -> red red green
4. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
5. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red

Analyzing the position of ""dax"" and its corresponding output color:
- When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the output color is green.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""lug wif,"" or is between ""zup"" and ""walm,"" the output color is green.
- When ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" the output color is green.
- When ""dax"" is the first word, the output color is green.

Based on the provided examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.09038137396402407,186,dax
"Based on the given examples, ""dax"" seems to correlate to the output ""green."" However, the position of ""dax"" in the input affects the color that comes after it. When ""dax"" is followed by a word that has not appeared before, that word is translated to ""green"" in the output. When ""dax"" is followed by a word that has appeared previously (such as ""wif"" or ""lug""), the color corresponding to that word is repeated in the output.

To summarize the observations:

1. ""wif"" seems to translate to ""red,"" as seen in all instances of its occurrence.
2. ""bluf"" correlates to ""red"" as well when it follows ""wif,"" but in the first example where it appears, it leads to ""green."" This suggests ""bluf"" might translate to ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""
3. ""lug"" appears to correlate with ""blue,"" but it maps to ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""
4. ""walm"" correlates to ""green"" every time it occurs.
5. ""zup"" only appears once and results in ""yellow.""

Here are the rules deduced from the given examples:

- ""dax"" before a new or unfamiliar word translates the unfamiliar word to ""green.""
- ""dax"" before a familiar word repeats the color associated with the familiar word.
  
The rule can now be stated as:

Rule: dax -> signals the color ""green"" when followed by a new or not previously mentioned word; it repeats the color of the previously mentioned word when the word has appeared before.",-0.781964656650241,186,dax
"From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here's what we can observe:

1. When ""dax"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is red followed by green.
2. When ""dax"" appears before ""wif,"" the output is green followed by red.
3. When ""dax"" appears after ""bluf,"" the output is red followed by green.
4. When ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" the output is green followed by blue.
5. When ""dax"" follows ""zup"" in a sequence with other words, it produces the output green, with subsequent color outputs related to the words that follow it.

The word ""dax"" seems to consistently result in the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. The other colors in the outputs relate to the words that surround ""dax,"" but there is a consistent pattern that when ""dax"" is present, green is in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.",-1.0594396111746986,186,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns that relate the input with its corresponding output:

1. Considering the first input: ""dax walm wif dax"" outputs ""green green green red green."" If we assume ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" then the introduction of ""wif"" coincides with a change of color from ""green"" to ""red.""

2. In the second input: ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red."" If ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" does not correspond to ""red"" (based on other inputs), the appearance of ""wif"" once again precedes the color ""red.""

3. The third example: ""dax wif zup dax"" gives ""green red yellow green."" Here ""dax"" is consistently ""green,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" The ""wif"" term is again followed by ""red.""

4. For the fourth sequence: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" the output is ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, aside from the established colors for ""dax"" and ""zup,"" we see that ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue."" Notably, only the first color after ""wif"" is ""red""; the following colors correspond to other non-wif words.

5. In the last case: ""wif lug dax,"" the output is ""red blue green."" Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" and ""dax"" by ""green,"" as before. The term ""wif"" stands alone at the start and is followed by ""red.""

From the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to a pattern where the output color after ""wif"" is ""red"" (except when ""wif"" is at the beginning or end of the sequence, but more examples would be needed to definitively determine its behavior in those positions). The rule doesn't seem to apply to subsequent color terms not immediately following ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> meaning. ""wif"" means that the next color in the output sequence will be red.",-0.08517442933638891,186,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we'll look for patterns in the examples provided. Here's the analysis:

- In each instance where ""wif"" appears, it is followed by a color change in the output that does not correspond to any single color consistently.
- ""wif"" does not seem to represent a static color itself, as its presence leads to different colors in different contexts.

Reviewing each example:

- 1st example: the sequence ""walm wif dax"" results in ""green red green,"" where ""green"" is the color for ""dax"" and ""walm,"" but the presence of ""wif"" changes the color after it to red.
- 2nd example: ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" indicating that the presence of ""wif"" changes the color associated with ""bluf.""
- 3rd example: ""wif zup dax"" leads to ""red yellow green,"" where the presence of ""wif"" again precedes a color change.
- 4th example: ""wif walm lug zup walm"" leads to ""red red red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""wif"" is followed by a color change to red, and three instances of the same color (yellow) following a string without the word ""wif.""
- 5th example: ""wif lug dax"" results in ""red blue green,"" where ""wif"" is associated with a color change again.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""wif"" triggers a color change. More specifically, it could signify a change to the color red when followed by a single word, but its rule might be more complex when considering subsequent words.

An attempt to define a rule might be:

**Rule: The word ""wif"" signals a change to red for the directly following word in the sequence, but the rule might be more nuanced, as subsequent words can deviate from this pattern depending on their own rules.**

So the meaning could be presented as:

**wif -> Indicates a change to red for the next word's associated color.**",-0.5421081436309441,186,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we will analyze how the output changes when the input contains this word compared to when it does not.

- In the first example, the output sequence contains a ""red"" surrounded by ""green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and the introduction of ""wif"" leads to the appearance of ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and the presence of ""wif"" again results in ""red"" in the output sequence.
- In the third example, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The presence of ""wif"" leads to the output of ""red"" in the position following ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" When ""wif"" appears in the sequence, ""red"" follows, and then the subsequent colors correspond to the input words, but ""red"" does not directly follow ""wif"" possibly because ""wif"" was at the beginning of the sequence.
- The fifth example suggests ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" with ""wif"" still leading to ""red"" in the subsequent position.

Based on these observations, the most consistent rule seems to be that ""wif"" causes the output to be ""red"" in the position immediately following it, except at the beginning of a sequence, where its effect may vary.

Rule: wif -> The presence of ""wif"" changes the output color to ""red"" immediately following its position in the sequence.",-1.0519440342488893,186,wif
"The word ""wif"" appears to change the output color associated with the subsequent word, while other words seem to have consistent output colors when not following ""wif."" For example, ""dax"" always produces ""green"" unless it directly follows ""wif,"" in which case it results in ""red."" Similarly, ""zup"" always produces ""yellow"" unless it follows ""wif,"" resulting in ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" unless following ""wif,"" in which case it also results in ""red.""

To summarize the observed pattern:

- dax -> green (unless dax follows wif, then it's red)
- zup -> yellow (unless zup follows wif, then it's red)
- walm -> yellow (unless walm follows wif, then it's red)
- lug -> blue (the pattern holds regardless of wif, as seen in the examples)

- In ""wif bluf lug,"" ""wif"" is again ""red,"" and with ""bluf"" following, it is repeated as ""red red."" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" without another word following, the pattern of duplicating the color holds. ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated once due to ""bluf.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" the same rule applies. ""lug"" is ""blue,"" then ""blue"" is repeated due to ""bluf.""
- Finally, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" shows that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" with ""bluf"" causing ""red"" to repeat.

"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that precedes it. Each instance of ""bluf"" is followed by a color repeated as many times as there are letters in the word that precedes ""bluf"". Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

- ""zup bluf"" is followed by ""yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" has 3 letters and ""yellow"" appears twice.
- ""wif bluf"" is followed by ""red red"". ""Wif"" has 3 letters and ""red"" appears twice.
- ""lug bluf"" is followed by ""blue blue"". ""Lug"" has 3 letters and ""blue"" appears twice.
- ""wif bluf lug"" is followed by ""red red blue"". This is a sequence of ""wif bluf"" followed by ""lug"".

3. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue

In the first example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" and the color green is repeated thrice following the single occurrence of green associated with ""dax."" In the second example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" and the color red is repeated thrice, which corresponds to the single red associated with ""wif."" In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color yellow is repeated thrice, again following the pattern where the color associated with the word in front of ""walm"" is repeated thrice.

Lastly, in the fifth example, ""dax wif walm,"" the output is ""green red red red."" Green is associated with ""dax,"" and red with ""wif""; ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and red is repeated thrice.

Here's the breakdown of how ""walm"" affects the output:

1. ""lug zup dax walm"" transforms to ""blue yellow green green green."" Here we see that ""dax"" correlates to ""green"", and ""walm"" causes the output to repeat ""green"" thrice.

2. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" transforms to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" In this case, ""walm"" occurs twice. After the first ""wif,"" which correlates to ""red,"" ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times. After the second ""wif,"" ""walm"" again repeats ""red"" three times.

3. ""lug zup walm lug"" transforms to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated thrice.

4. ""lug walm"" transforms to ""blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes three ""blue""s in the output.

5. ""dax wif walm"" transforms to ""green red red red."" Here, the word ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.

Rule: bluf -> blue.",-0.0647615271064045,187,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the given examples and determine how they correlate with the output.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""yellow"" immediately after ""bluf"" but changes to ""blue"" elsewhere, and ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" precedes a ""blue"" and all other words are ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" might indicate a change to blue.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Analysis: Here both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" could mean green in this context. However, looking at other examples, it seems ""bluf"" does not consistently mean green.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
Analysis: From this series, ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Noticing the pattern, ""bluf"" is again followed by a ""blue."" However, ""lug"" outputs differ based on their position relative to ""bluf.""

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green
Analysis: Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Once again, ""bluf"" is followed by a ""yellow"" that turns into ""green,"" consistent with the idea that ""bluf"" impacts the following word.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
Analysis: ""Lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" Following ""bluf,"" ""wif"" does not turn red, which is inconsistent with the earlier pattern. 

From the above examples, it appears that bluf affects the color output of the word that follows it, typically by making the following word blue. However, there are inconsistencies, most notably in the last example. Possibly ""bluf"" could mean ""change the color of the following word,"" but with exceptions or additional rules not immediately obvious from the examples provided.

Rule: ""Bluf"" likely means to change the output color of the following word, often to blue, but the exact rule may have exceptions or be influenced by words following ""bluf.""",-0.09921249277917978,187,bluf
"From reviewing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule:

   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
4. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
5. Input: lug wif bluf

The word bluf always seems to correspond to blue in the output.

However, I also notice that the color that comes before blue is repeated once after bluf. For example, in the third input 'wif zup bluf lug', the word before bluf is zup, which corresponds to yellow, and the color after bluf is also yellow. Similarly, in the forth input 'lug zup bluf dax', the word before bluf is zup which correlates with yellow, and the color after bluf is also yellow. This pattern is consistent across all examples provided.

Therefore, the rule for bluf could be deduced as follows:

- In the second example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""green green"" output, but considering the context of ""dax"" and its output, we can reason that ""dax"" adds a green regardless of position, hence ""bluf"" by itself would be blue.
  
- The third input provides further support since ""bluf"" is surrounded by other words, yet it still corresponds to ""blue.""
  
- The fourth input shows ""bluf"" between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" with the surrounding words corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively, indicating that ""bluf"" here corresponds to ""blue.""

- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" is associated with the color red, and the output is 'red' repeated three times.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. To verify this, I will analyze the examples in detail:

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup"" outputs ""green green green yellow,"" where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" The ""walm"" matches the color of ""dax.""

- In the second example, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" The ""walm"" matches the color of ""lug.""

- In the third example, ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" The ""walm"" matches the color of ""wif.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green,"" and later ""lug dax"" yields ""yellow blue green."" Here again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and takes on the color ""green,"" matching the color of ""dax.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif walm zup walm"" outputs ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" takes on the color ""red"" from ""wif"" and then the color ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug | Output: yellow red green green green blue

5. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue

From these examples, let's identify which words correlate to which colors:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.

In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the color red is outputted in the corresponding position. Thus, it seems that ""wif"" is consistently linked to the color red regardless of its position in the input string.

- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Every time the word ""wif"" is presented in the input, regardless of its position, the word ""red"" appears in the output. There are no examples where ""wif"" is presented and ""red"" is not included in the output. Thus, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as:

"To deduce the meaning or rules associated with the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns of the output in relation to the given inputs.

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

By comparing the inputs and outputs we can notice that:

1. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
2. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
3. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
4. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
5. ""walm"" translates to a repetition of green, hence we deduce it means ""green green"".

Now, looking at ""bluf"":

- It is mapped to ""red"" when it follows ""wif"".
- It is mapped to ""green"" when it follows ""dax"".
- It does not follow ""zup"", ""lug"", or ""walm"" in any example, so no direct relationship can be established with them.

Notice that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:
Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the sequence. If ""wif"" comes before it, ""bluf"" is red; if ""dax"" comes before it, ""bluf"" is green. There is no information about what happens if other words precede ""bluf"".

So, bluf -> the color of the preceding word.",-0.10379558402049996,189,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. To determine the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look at the consistent pattern in relation to ""bluf"" in the different examples. 

Here are the consistent patterns identified:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is outputted.
- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is outputted.

The appearance of ""bluf"" in the examples leads to the following observations:

1. Input: wif bluf zup -> Output: red red yellow
2. Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
3. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
4. Input: dax lug bluf wif -> Output: green blue blue red
5. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green

Observing these patterns, ""bluf"" results in ""red"" when immediately following ""wif"" and ""green"" when immediately following ""dax"". However, there is an example where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which individually leads to ""blue"") and ""bluf"" itself results in ""blue"".

From these observations, a potential rule could be that ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word that immediately precedes it. 

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word. If there's no preceding word example (as there isn't one for ""bluf"" occurring at the beginning of the input), additional context would be required to determine its color. 

Given the examples, the best approximation of the rule based on current evidence is:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word. If preceding word is ""wif"", ""bluf"" is red; if preceding word is ""dax"", ""bluf"" is green; if preceding word is ""lug"", ""bluf"" is blue.",-0.38650682047181406,189,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of the word ""bluf"" could be determined by the color it translates to in the output. Looking at each input and its corresponding output, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" When ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to a color in the output as follows:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and the corresponding colors are ""red yellow."" Since ""wif"" is known to be ""red,"" ""bluf"" in this context results in ""red"" as well.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif dax"" and before ""wif dax,"" translating to ""red green yellow red green green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" is represented as ""green"" because it is the only new color that appears in the sequence compared to the previous input.
- In the third input, there is only ""wif bluf"" with ""red red"" as the output. This reaffirms that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when following ""wif.""
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output colors are ""green blue blue red."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax"" with the output being ""red red green green green."" It shows that ""bluf"" is still represented as ""red"" after ""wif.""

Therefore, it seems that ""bluf"" may be taking on the color value of the word immediately preceding it in the input. So, if ""wif"" (red) comes before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is ""red."" If ""dax"" (green) comes before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is green, and if ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is blue.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

For example:

- After ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" means red.
- After ""dax"" (green), ""bluf"" means green.

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", so here, ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"".
- ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green"", again, ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"".
- ""dax lug bluf"" translates to ""green blue blue"", ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug"".

- ""zup walm dax lug"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". 'zup' becomes 'yellow' and is repeated three times, 'dax' to 'green', and 'lug' to 'blue'.

2. Input: wif zup

Examining each input-output pair in detail:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup

Looking at these examples, we can derive the following rule:

This suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the output. Furthermore, it seems that other words in the input lead to a one-to-one mapping to specific colors as well: ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and ""dax"" maps to ""green."" The word ""walm,"" however, seems to trigger an output color replicated by the number of words in the input before ""zup.""

- ""walm"" usually corresponds to ""red,"" but if ""zup"" precedes it, the output for ""walm"" changes to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it can also alter the color associated with ""walm"" if it comes before it.

Rule: zup -> yellow (with the additional property that if zup precedes walm, it changes the output color for walm from red to yellow).",-0.15207659122211262,190,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns in the Input and Output examples provided.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
3. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
4. Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
5. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red

From these examples, we can try to extract the pattern by looking at each case where ""zup"" appears and the corresponding output colors.

When ""zup"" follows ""wif walm dax,"" the output is yellow, indicating a possible relationship with the sequence of words before it. When ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" the output is yellow, suggesting a potential rule related to ""zup's"" position or the word preceding it.

Crucially, when ""zup"" is positioned before other words (examples 3 and 5), it seems to impose a yellow color to all following words. In example 3, ""walm"" which would typically correspond to ""red,"" is turned yellow by the preceding ""zup.""

Based on this observation, it appears that:

- ""zup"" on its own corresponds to yellow (see example 2).
- ""zup"" overrides the following words' default colors to yellow (see examples 3 and 5).

Putting this together, the rule for ""zup"" could be something like the following:

Rule: When ""zup"" appears in the input, it changes its own color to yellow, and any subsequent words will also be changed to yellow until the end of the sequence. If ""zup"" follows other words, it only changes its own color to yellow without affecting the previously listed words.",-0.16454367970302813,190,zup
"To figure out the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided.

In each instance, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Yet, in the third example, ""bluf"" is at the end and corresponds to ""red."" This implies that ""bluf"" might not have a fixed meaning but could be dependent on its position or the context in which it's used.

Let's analyze the position of ""bluf"":

1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
4. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
5. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green

When ""bluf"" is in the second position, it corresponds to ""green."" In the third example, when it's in the last position, it corresponds to ""red."" We also see that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Let's test the position theory using ""dax"" since it's the only word we're certain about:

- In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""dax"" is in the first position, followed by ""bluf,"" and both are translated as ""green.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" is in the second position and the last position, translating to ""green"" in both cases.

Given this, it seems like the word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" and ""red"" when it's at the end. However, the third rule does not apply to example 4 where ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif lug,"" and both are translated to ""green red.""

Since we don't have an example of ""bluf"" in the first position, it's challenging to confirm if its position solely affects its color representation.

Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

2. In both ""dax walm"" examples, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and the output is ""green green green"" after ""walm"", repeating the color green three times as indicated by ""walm"".
3. In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and the output is ""red red red"" after ""walm"", repeating the color red three times as indicated by ""walm"".

"Based on the examples provided, the output color changes with the presence and position of the word 'dax' and other words. It seems that each word is associated with a specific color, and 'dax' dictates the sequence to restart from 'green'. Following is the analysis of the examples:

- When 'dax' appears, the first output color is 'green'.
- 'dax' is followed by different colors based on the word that comes after it.
- In the absence of 'dax', the output has colors but does not start with 'green'.

Let's try to assign a color to each word based on the outputs:

- 'wif' seems to correspond to 'red'.
- 'zup' seems to correspond to 'yellow'.
- 'walm' might correspond to 'red' as well, since it is followed by 'red' in the first example.
- 'bluf' corresponds to 'green'.
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'.

Now, considering the 'dax' rule:

- Whenever 'dax' appears, the color sequence resets, and 'green' is the first color.
- After 'dax', the next color is determined by the word following it.

Applying this rule:

- Example 1: 'dax' starts with 'green', 'zup' leads to 'yellow', 'walm' is followed by 'red' repeated for every occurrence of 'walm'.
- Example 2: 'dax' starts with 'green', 'bluf' also leads to 'green', 'wif' goes to 'red', 'zup' to 'yellow', and 'lug' to 'blue'.
- Example 3: 'wif' starts with 'red' (no 'dax', no reset), 'walm' continues with 'red', then 'dax' resets to 'green', followed by 'zup' with 'yellow'.
- Example 4: 'dax' on its own is just 'green'.
- Example 5: 'wif' starts with 'red', 'zup' leads to 'yellow', 'walm' continues with 'red', then 'dax' resets to 'green', and 'zup' again leads to 'yellow'.

By induction, the rule seems to be: 

Rule: 'dax' resets the color sequence to 'green', and the subsequent colors are determined by the word that follows it. Words have specific color assignments, and 'dax' acts as a reset to 'green'.",-0.735376876925326,191,dax
"The examples provided give a sequence of inputs and corresponding outputs with colors. To understand what ""dax"" means, we need to analyze the position of ""dax"" and the color associated with it in the outputs.

Looking at each example:

1. When ""dax"" is at the beginning, followed by ""zup walm wif walm"", the output starts with green.
2. When ""dax"" is at the beginning again, followed by ""bluf wif zup lug"", the output starts with green yet again.
3. When ""dax"" is in the middle, preceded by ""wif walm"" and followed by ""zup"", the color associated with ""dax"" is green.
4. When ""dax"" is on its own, without any other words, the output is simply green.
5. When ""dax"" comes after ""wif zup walm"", the color associated with ""dax"" is yellow. However, the color that follows ""dax"" is also yellow, indicating that ""dax"" might not necessarily change the color. Other words such as ""zup"" seem to be more consistent predictors of yellow.

From these observations, the common pattern associated with ""dax"" is that it always results in the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.

"Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the pattern noticed:

- ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", and the output is ""red red"". So ""wif"" must mean ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color.
- ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", and the output is ""green green"". Thus, ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""bluf"" again repeats the color.
- In the third example, ""lug"" and ""wif"" come before ""bluf"", and the output is ""blue red red"". Since we know ""wif"" means ""red"", ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it giving us “red red”.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Explanation: ""Walm"" is second in the sequence, thus it leads to two instances of blue.

3. Input: lug walm (Repeated example)
   Output: blue blue blue
   Explanation: Identical to the second example, ""walm"" generates two blues.

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup

   Explanation: Here, ""walm"" occupies the fourth position, generating three instances of blue (4 - 1 = 3).

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Explanation: ""Walm"" is third in the sequence, resulting in producing two instances of blue as per the rule (3 - 1 = 2).

So based on the examples and the analysis of ""walm"" in different positions, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" produces a number of instances of the color blue that is one less than its position in the input sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the output colors corresponding to its appearance in the input sequences.

From the first input-output pair:
- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" maps to ""blue green yellow green green green red.""
The sequence of ""dax walm wif"" specifically leads to ""green green green red.""
We can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
The presence of ""walm"" here results in an additional ""green,"" implying that ""walm"" might mean ""green.""

From the second and third input-output pairs:
- ""lug walm"" maps to ""blue blue blue.""
Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the appearance of ""walm"" continues the sequence of ""blue.""

From the fourth input-output pair:
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" maps to ""blue red green green green yellow.""
Considering that ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and that ""wif"" maps to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" the presence of ""walm"" resulted in two additional ""green"" after ""dax.""

From the fifth input-output pair:
- ""wif lug walm"" maps to ""red blue blue blue.""
Here ""wif"" equals ""red,"" ""lug"" equals ""blue,"" and the presence of ""walm"" results in two additional ""blue.""

Looking at all these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes right before it in the sequence.

   The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which is associated with the color green, so ""walm"" generates the color green again. 

2. ""lug walm"":
   ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is associated with the color blue, and ""walm"" results in the color blue being repeated.

3. ""lug walm"":
   The same as the second example, ""lug"" associated with blue results in ""walm"" generating blue again.

4. ""lug wif dax walm zup"":
   Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which translates to green, and ""walm"" results in green again.

5. ""wif lug walm"":
   ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, and ""walm"" generates blue as the output.

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately previous word:

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes a repetition of the color of the preceding word in the sequence.",-0.7028069145344578,191,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be related to the color repetition of the word immediately preceding it. Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word. Here are the observations that lead to this rule deduction:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is ""green green"" after ""walm"" appears.
2. In the second and third examples, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""walm"" caused the color of ""lug"" to be repeated three times.
3. In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" once again results in ""green green,"" and then the sequence ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
4. Finally, in the last example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and duplicates the ""blue"" color in the output.

This pattern suggests that ""walm"" functions as a repeat indicator for the color of the preceding word. Hence, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""walm"".",-1.1701290906385544,191,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" has a pattern following its use. Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output changes to a repetition of the color that precedes ""walm"". Here are the observations that support this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, and the output after ""walm"" is a repetition of green.
- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and the output is a repetition of blue for as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" again, and the color green is repeated after it.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, and the output is a repetition of the color blue.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should analyze the patterns in the given examples and the corresponding outputs. The input words are listed alongside their output colors, and we will try to find any correlation or rule that applies consistently across these examples.

Example analysis:

1. In the first example, ""dax zup lug bluf"" produced ""green yellow blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, and its corresponding color is ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" resulted in ""blue blue blue red red."" The output has one more color than the input. However, ""bluf"" still corresponds with ""red,"" which is repeated as the final two output colors (""red red"").

3. The third example, ""wif bluf lug,"" gave us ""red red blue."" Again, the word ""bluf"" aligns with the ""red"" color but is repeated twice.

4. The fourth example, ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" In this instance, ""bluf"" correlates with a double occurrence of ""blue.""

5. The fifth example, ""wif zup bluf,"" became ""red yellow yellow."" Once again, ""bluf"" aligns with a repeated color, ""yellow"" this time.

Rule:
Upon inspecting these examples, we can infer that the nonce word ""bluf"" induces a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. For instance, if ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color ""red,"" the output includes ""red"" twice. Similarly, if it follows ""dax,"" which maps to ""green,"" we would expect the output to be ""green"" twice. Thus, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the previous color in the output sequence.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.",-0.08772789791630338,192,bluf
"From the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", ""lug"", or ""wif"", the output includes the color ""blue"".
2. ""bluf"" appears to produce varying output with different preceding words:
   - dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
   - wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
   - wif bluf lug -> red red blue

   In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and ""wif"", and the output color for ""bluf"" is different than when it follows ""dax"" or ""lug"".

3. The output color associated with ""bluf"" immediately follows the color associated with the word preceding it:
   - dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue (blue follows lug's blue)
   - wif bluf lug -> red red blue (red from wif is repeated before blue for lug)
   - zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow (following bluf, yellow from zup is repeated)

Given these patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" doubles the color of the word before it. If the word before ""bluf"" has a color associated with it, that color is said twice.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the preceding word, if there is one.",-0.6601443679173035,192,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" maps onto a color, but the color it represents seems to depend on the context, particularly what words precede it. Let's examine the patterns to determine the rules:

- When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug,"" the output is twice ""blue"" (Examples 1 and 2).
- When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif,"" the output is twice ""red"" (Example 2).
- When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup,"" the output is twice ""yellow"" (Example 5).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green blue"" (Example 4).

It appears that the word ""bluf"" outputs a sequence of colors, duplicating the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. The exception is ""dax,"" which results in a sequence of ""green"" followed by ""blue,"" suggesting that ""dax zup"" together may be required to result in ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: It outputs a sequence of colors, with the sequence being two of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, except when that word is ""dax,"" where it follows a different pattern of outputting ""green"" then ""blue.""

Despite this inconsistency, the most common pattern observed is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".

"Analyzing the given examples, we can identify a pattern based on the correspondence between the input and the output colors. It seems that the word 'walm' corresponds to a sequence of colors in the output. Let's observe the inputs and outputs closely:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'bluf' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
   - Following 'walm', there is an additional 'green'

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
   - Following 'zup', there is an additional 'yellow' before 'walm'
   - Following 'walm', there are two additional 'yellow'

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - Following 'walm', there is one additional 'red'
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - Following 'walm', there is an additional 'red'

5. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
   - Following 'walm', there are two additional 'yellow'
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'

From these examples, it is evident that 'walm' causes a repeat of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. The number of repetitions equals the number of times the preceding color has appeared before 'walm'. 

For instance:
- In example 1, 'bluf' corresponds to 'red,' and it appears once before 'walm'; thus, 'walm' adds one more 'red'.
- In example 2, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' and it appears twice before 'walm'; thus, 'walm' adds two additional 'yellow'.
- In example 4, 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' and it appears once before 'walm'; thus, 'walm' adds one 'red'.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correlation of its presence in the input and the output patterns.

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Here, ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", ""bluf"" with ""red"", ""dax"" with ""green"", and ""walm"" appears to add two extra ""green"".

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   ""wif"" -> ""red"", ""zup"" -> ""yellow"", ""lug"" -> ""blue"", ""dax"" -> ""green"", ""zup"" is repeated producing another ""yellow"". After ""walm"" there are three ""yellow"", indicating it affects ""zup"" and could be repeating it three times.

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   ""wif"" -> ""red"", ""walm"" -> ""red"", ""dax"" -> ""green"". But since ""wif"" is known to produce ""red"", ""walm"" here may potentially extend the presence of ""red"".

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   ""zup"" -> ""yellow"", ""wif"" -> ""red"". After ""walm"", the ""red"" is repeated two more times.

5. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   ""zup"" -> ""yellow"", ""walm"" -> ""yellow"", ""dax"" -> ""green"". Just like before, ""walm"" seems to amplify the presence of the color before it.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word before it. Specifically, it repeats the color equivalent to the previous word in the sequence a certain number of times before continuing with the sequence. From the examples, ""walm"" seems to repeat the previous color three times for ""wif"" and ""zup"" since these colors are already outputted once before ""walm"" occurs. For ""dax"", it adds two more greens to one that already occurred due to ""dax"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look at the color that corresponds to it in each example and try to find a pattern. Here's the breakdown:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   - The words correspond to ""red red green green green.""
   - ""Walm"" corresponds to ""green green.""

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   - The words correspond to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow.""
   - ""Walm"" corresponds to the triple ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif walm dax
   - The words correspond to ""red red red green.""
   - ""Walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   - The words correspond to ""yellow red red red.""
   - ""Walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: zup walm dax
   - The words correspond to ""yellow yellow yellow green.""
   - ""Walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, with the exception that it always ends with ""green"" if it follows ""dax"".

Looking at each input and its corresponding output:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
3. wif walm dax -> red red red green
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green

Analyzing the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can make the following observations:

- The word 'wif' consistently produces 'red.'
- The word 'zup' consistently produces 'yellow.'
- The word 'dax' consistently produces 'green' after 'walm' but otherwise does not correspond to 'green.'
- The word 'walm' always appears before 'dax' when 'dax' is in the sequence.
- In the outputs, immediately following the word 'walm,' there is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word right before 'walm.' Then the sequence is followed by 'green.'

From these observations, the rule for 'walm' seems to be that it signals the repeating of the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it, followed by 'green.' Based on that:

walm -> meaning is: repeat the color of the previous word and then follow with green.

Rule: When 'walm' is encountered in the input, repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding 'walm' and then add 'green' at the end.",-0.12522909093711113,192,walm
"Based on the given examples, each word seems to correspond to a specific color output, whereby 'wif' corresponds to red, 'dax' to green, and 'zup' to yellow. 

The word 'walm' appears to alter the pattern of the outputs by extending the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. Specifically:

- When 'walm' follows 'wif' (which corresponds to red), the output is an additional red.
- When 'walm' follows 'zup' (which corresponds to yellow), the output entails additional yellows.
- When 'walm' follows 'dax' (which corresponds to green), we don't see an example, but given the pattern, it would make sense if 'walm' resulted in an additional green.

Also of note is that 'walm' itself, when it appears at the end, yields a green output. Therefore, 'walm' has two functions: it repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it and represents the color green when it is the last word.

Example 2:
Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm zup lug,"" the repeated ""green"" suggests that ""walm"" and ""zup"" also result in ""green,"" but ""lug"" changes the output to ""yellow blue.""

Example 3:
Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Here, we see the pattern of ""green"" repeated for each occurrence of ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup,"" with an additional output of ""yellow"" for each ""walm.""

Example 4:
Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

The order has changed, but ""lug"" now results in ""blue"" when it comes before ""dax."" ""Dax"" and ""walm"" both still result in ""green.""

Example 5:
Input: wif dax zup dax

In these examples, every time the word ""zup"" appears, it corresponds with the color ""yellow."" No matter what word follows ""zup,"" the output remains ""yellow"" as long as ""zup"" is present.

Thus, it appears that the rule for ""zup"" is that it directly corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context.

  ""walm"" is not followed by ""zup,"" but it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

- Input: ""dax zup"" / Output: ""green yellow""
  ""zup"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" for ""zup"" it's ""yellow.""

- Input: ""zup lug"" / Output: ""yellow blue""
  ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" for ""zup"" it's ""yellow.""

- Input: ""zup wif zup dax"" / Output: ""yellow red yellow green""
  ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and is followed by ""dax,"" for which the outputs are ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively. ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" both times.

- Input: ""dax zup bluf"" / Output: ""green yellow yellow""
  ""zup"" is between ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" while no output is directly associated with ""bluf.""

From these observations, we can note:
- Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
- The presence of ""zup"" does not change the output color for other words.

This leads to the general rule that ""zup"" corresponds to the output color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. It's clear that each non-nonce word corresponds to a color: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The nonce word ""bluf"" should also correspond to a color based on the outputs given.

Let's consider each instance:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow yellow,"" which is the color corresponding to the word ""walm"" and ""zup."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red red,"" it's not immediately clear what ""bluf"" stands for here.

- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" alone corresponds to ""red,"" the same as ""wif.""

- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" which might suggest that ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" like ""lug.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow red,"" again showing that ""bluf"" might correspond to ""yellow,"" like ""zup.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" which once again aligns with ""zup"" being ""yellow,"" suggesting ""bluf"" may also mean ""yellow.""

Given the inconsistencies in what color ""bluf"" could represent, it appears that ""bluf"" reflects the color of the word that comes before it. Therefore, ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the last non-nonce word that appears before it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf.""

"In order to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the given examples and their outputs:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
3. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

Looking at the examples:

- In example 1, the word after ""walm"" is not provided, yet three ""yellow"" colors follow ""walm"" in the output.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output has three ""green"" colors followed by ""red"".
- In example 3, the pattern is similar to example 2, where ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and leads to three colors identical to the color that precedes ""walm"" followed by ""red"".
- In example 4, ""walm"" occurs twice and both times it is followed by repetitions of the color that precedes it, with three instances of ""green"".
- In example 5, the output that corresponds with ""walm"" is three ""red"" which is the output for the word ""wif"" that comes after ""walm"".

It seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word before it three times. When it appears at the end of a sequence, it repeats the last color mentioned. If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", the rule changes slightly to involve the color of ""wif"" (which is ""red"") being repeated instead.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times. If followed by ""wif"", repeat the color ""red"" three times instead.",-0.09015570303843749,193,walm
"By analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce what the nonce word ""walm"" might mean. Let's take a look at each instance where ""walm"" appears in the input and its effect on the output:

1. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow). It results in a repetition of yellow in the output.

2. dax walm wif -> green green green red

Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to green), and ""wif"" represents red. ""walm"" results in repetition of the color that precedes it (green in this case) making the first three words produce green.

3. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red

In this case, after ""zup,"" we see ""walm"" again causing a repetition of yellow.

4. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green

Here, the first ""dax walm"" results in green repeating, ""wif lug"" corresponds to red and blue, and ""dax walm"" again results in green repeating.

5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

This one is the odd one out since there is no word before ""walm"" for it to have caused a repetition effect as in the other examples. It's possible that ""bluf"" and ""wif"" stand for a particular color and ""walm"" causes the color before it (represented by ""wif"") to repeat.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word immediately before it to repeat in the output sequence until another color word or the end of the sequence is encountered.

Therefore: walm -> causes the preceding color word to repeat.",-0.11155719481212496,193,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in each example:

- In every sequence where ""walm"" appears, the word ""walm"" is directly followed by multiple instances of the same color.
- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" preceded by ""wif"" results in the color red repeated three times.
- It seems that ""walm"" can determine the repetition of the color that appears just before it, but not always the same amount of times, because in the first example it's followed by three yellow, and in the last one it's followed by two reds.

Looking at the first and last examples more closely, we can see that ""walm"" might also be a repetition indicator that repeats the color word before it, matching the number of letters in the color word:
- In the first example, ""lug zup walm"" results in blue (3 letters) yellow (6 letters) yellow yellow yellow, so ""walm"" might be causing the word yellow, which has six letters, to be repeated six times in total.
- In the fourth example, ""lug dax walm"" results in blue green green green green green green. Here, ""walm"" follows dax (green), which has five letters, resulting in green being repeated five additional times.
- However, this rule does not hold for the second and third examples, where red is only repeated twice after ""walm"".

Given these inconsistencies, we may consider that ""walm"" replicates the previous color an unspecified number of times, varying from example to example, possibly based on another rule or context not given in the examples. Therefore, the rule might be that ""walm"" repeats the color word before it a number of times that is dependent on the context, which is not fully clear from the given examples.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must identify patterns from the provided input and output pairs.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" appears once and is followed by the corresponding output ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since the word ""zup"" preceding ""walm"" corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" ""walm"" could imply a repetition of the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green green,"" which reinforces the idea that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word (""dax"" -> ""green"").

3. The third example is consistent with the second, where ""walm"" following ""zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" and supports the repetitive nature of ""walm.""

4. The fourth input includes ""walm"" twice after ""dax,"" and both times ""walm"" outputs three greens, which corresponds to the color associated with ""dax.""

5. The fifth example has ""walm"" at the end and the colors ""red red red"" correspond to it. In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" and thus ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""red"" three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

3. dax walm
Output: green green green

4. zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

5. zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Let's identify possible rules related to the word walm:

Looking at the colors associated with ""walm"" in each example:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red."" (Same as the first example)
3. When ""walm"" is preceded only by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red."" (Same as the first and second example)
5. When ""walm"" is the last word, the output color is repeated for each word preceding ""walm.""

From the above observations, we can deduce:

- The color green appears only when ""dax"" is present.
- The color red appears consistently when ""wif"" precedes ""walm.""
- The color blue appears only when ""lug"" is present.
- ""zup"" leads to yellow unless followed by ""lug,"" which leads to blue.
- The color red does not depend on the position of ""walm"" in the sequence (example 4).
- The color yellow appears to be a default for ""zup,"" but changes to a repeat of the previous color if ""walm"" is last (example 5).

Given these observations, the most consistent rule we can deduce for ""walm"" on its own is that it repeats the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes it. The exception to this rule is when ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, as in example 5, where its presence instead seems to trigger a repeat of the previous color for each word prior.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word walm repeats the color associated with the word that directly precedes it, except when it is the last word in the sequence, in which case it causes the color of each preceding word to repeat.",-0.10296787006465116,194,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at how its use affects the output. Here are the outputs with and without ""walm"" highlighted:

1. Input: wif **walm** dax - Output: red red red green
2. Input: zup wif **walm** lug - Output: yellow red red red blue
3. Input: dax **walm** - Output: green green green
4. Input: zup bluf wif **walm** - Output: yellow yellow red red red
5. Input: zup wif lug zup **walm** - Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

If we analyze the pattern, we can see that ""**walm**"" seems to repeat the output color prior to its appearance. For instance:

- In the first example, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and when ""**walm**"" occurs, we get ""red red red"" afterward.
- In the second example, ""**walm**"" follows ""wif"" which has an output of ""red,"" thus producing ""red red.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and we get ""green green"" when ""**walm**"" follows.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" yields ""yellow,"" then ""wif"" gives ""red,"" and then ""walm"" produces ""red red,"" repeating the output for ""wif"" which is ""red.""
- In the fifth example, the second ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" follows, leading to ""yellow yellow"" in the output.

Therefore, we can determine that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word that comes before it. If there are more colors before ""walm,"" it seems to repeat the last color output multiple times, equal to the number of total inputs including ""walm.""

Rule: **walm** -> Repeats the color output of the immediately preceding word in the sequence. If ""walm"" is the n-th word including itself, then the color repetition occurs n-1 times.",-0.20542533085034884,194,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns for each known word in the examples provided and their corresponding outputs:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"" when paired with ""walm,"" if alone, it outputs ""green"" as well.
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when following ""wif,"" but red when paired with ""walm.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" only in the given context.

Now, we'll focus on ""walm"" and how it affects the output:

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" outputs three reds and one green, with ""dax"" consistently color-coded as green, suggesting that ""walm"" has an influence on the color of ""wif"" which would normally be red alone.
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" outputs yellow (for ""zup""), red (for ""wif""), another red (affected by ""walm""), and lastly blue (for ""lug""), which also changes to red when preceded by ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" outputs three greens, indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color assigned to the previous word.
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs two yellows (the first for ""zup,"" the second suggests ""bluf"" might be a variant of ""zup"" or that ""bluf"" means yellow in this special case only due to ""walm""), followed by three reds (where ""walm"" affects ""wif"" again).
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" outputs a yellow (for ""zup""), a red (for ""wif""), a blue (for ""lug""), another yellow (for ""zup""), and finally three yellows, which suggests that ""walm"" changes the preceding word ""zup"" and its color to repeat.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" is a modifier that causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times in the output.

Walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to repeat three consecutive times in the output.",-0.2616172668170932,194,walm
"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the output colors corresponding to each instance of ""walm"" in the inputs, while also considering the colors associated with the words that come directly before ""walm.""

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" corresponds with ""red red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" 
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" again corresponds to ""red red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Analyzing the patterns, we see that whenever ""walm"" appears, it results in a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here are the rules we can deduce:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Every time ""walm"" is used after another word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated three times if the word is ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup."" However, after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" does not cause a triple repetition, but rather there is an additional color ""blue"" after it.

One potential discrepancy is the situation where ""walm"" comes after ""dax."" In the first and third examples, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is three greens each time, following the previous pattern of repetition. However, the extra ""green"" in the first example is due to the presence of another ""dax"" after ""walm.""

Given this information, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word three times, except when following ""lug,"" it results in one additional ""blue.""

So, walm -> causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word thrice (except after ""lug"").",-1.0293241816744183,194,walm

Rule: lug -> blue.",-2.175329119515625,195,lug
"Considering the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by observing its corresponding outputs in each case:

1. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue
2. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
3. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
4. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
5. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue

From these examples, we can identify the following patterns:
- When ""dax"" follows ""lug"", ""wif"", or ""bluf"", it translates to ""green"".
- ""lug"", ""wif"", and ""bluf"" consistently translate to ""blue"", ""red"", and ""yellow"", respectively, regardless of their position in the input.
- The position of ""dax"" does not seem to affect its color output which is consistently ""green"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be consistent regardless of its position or surrounding words:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.08449683561856249,195,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each non-dax word corresponds to a unique color:

- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow (note, not blue despite the similarity)
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow

Looking at the outputs, we can also see that ""dax"" corresponds to a color, but the color it corresponds to is not the same in each instance; it changes. Let's figure out the pattern.

In example 1, ""dax"" is placed after ""lug"" and ""bluf"". The colors for ""lug"" and ""bluf"" are blue and yellow, and the color output for ""dax"" is green, which can be seen as a mix of blue and yellow.

In example 2, ""dax"" is placed after ""lug"", which is blue, and the output color for ""dax"" is green again. However, this time there is no other color before ""dax"" to mix with blue.

In example 3, ""dax"" appears twice. The first ""dax"" comes after ""wif"" (red) and the output for ""dax"" is green. The second ""dax"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) and the color output for ""dax"" is yellow.

In example 4, ""dax"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) and the color for ""dax"" is green.

In example 5, ""dax"" comes after two occurrences of ""bluf"" (yellow), and the color output for ""dax"" is green.

Analyzing the examples, ""dax"" seems to commonly result in the color green. ""Dax"" might mean green when it follows certain colors or when in the context of particular color pairings. However, the rule for ""dax"" may not be about direct color mixing, as there are inconsistencies if we consider that approach alone.

Let's derive the rule based on the commonality between ""dax"" occurrences: every time ""dax"" appears, the output color is green. However, in example 3, the second ""dax"" results in yellow, following a ""zup"" (yellow), as opposed to resulting in green.

Given that ""zup"" is the only word that corresponds to the same color as ""bluf"" (both are yellow), the second ""dax"" in example 3 is yielding a direct repetition of the previous color rather than the expected green. Therefore, we could form two possible rules:

1. ""Dax"" usually means green.
2. ""Dax"" repeats the color of the preceding word if that color is yellow.

However, this rule does not entirely fit the first occurrence of ""dax"" in example 3, which follows ""wif"" (red) and results in green.

To conclude, the rules for ""dax"" cannot be definitively determined from the given data. We can say with some confidence that in many instances, ""dax"" -> green. However, there are exceptions that we cannot explicitly define, as there is an inconsistency in the examples provided.

Rule: Inconclusive; ""dax"" often corresponds to green, but there are exceptions that are not defined by the given examples, requiring more data for a solid rule.",-0.8822616937105727,195,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. When ""dax"" precedes a color word, the color word is represented in the output in its complementary color:
   - Example 1: ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue"" (green being the complement of red)
   - Example 2: ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green"" (again, green being the complement of red)
   - Example 3: ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"" (green being the complement of red)

2. When ""dax"" follows a color word, it takes on the same color:
   - Example 1: ""bluf dax"" translates to ""red green"" (green following the pattern of red)
   - Example 2: ""lug dax"" is ""blue green"" (again, green following blue)
   - Example 4: ""zup dax"" is ""yellow green"" (green following yellow)
   - Example 5: ""bluf dax"" is ""yellow green"" (green following yellow again)

3. However, in some cases, ""dax"" simply becomes ""green"" regardless of the surrounding words:
   - Example 1: ""dax lug"" is ""green blue""
   - Example 2: ""lug dax"" is ""blue green""
   - Example 3: ""dax wif"" and ""wif dax"" are both ""green red""
   - Example 4: ""zup dax"" is ""yellow green""
   - Example 5: ""bluf dax"" is ""yellow green""

Given the inconsistency in the first rule about ""dax"" preceding a color word and its color in the output, the only consistent pattern across all examples is that ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" in the output.

So the rule is:

"Given the examples, I will try to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf"".

1) In the first example, ""dax zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow"". We know from this that ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow"".

2) In the second example, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""red red yellow yellow red"". This again shows us that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", since both instances of ""bluf"" result in ""yellow"".

3) The third example, ""wif bluf zup"", becomes ""red red yellow"", which is consistent with the previous cases, reinforcing that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".

4) In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug bluf"", we get ""blue red blue blue"". The position of ""bluf"" in this example still results in ""blue"", not ""yellow"". However, this could be due to a surrounding rule based on the word ""lug"" preceding ""bluf"". It is possible that ""lug"" changes the color associated with ""bluf"".

5) The fifth example, ""wif bluf dax"", equates to ""red red green"". Here, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""wif"" and ""dax"". Given that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"", it is not clear from this example alone why ""bluf"" is ""red"", since we would expect ""yellow"" based on previous examples.

6) Given the evidence, there appears to be a rule change dependent on context or surrounding words. The most consistent rule from the data provided is that ""bluf"" alone translates to ""yellow"". However, the fourth example breaks this consistency by showing ""bluf"" as ""blue"", which suggests there may be a modifier rule when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"".

Rule: In isolation or when not preceded by ""lug"", ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"". However, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"", it translates to ""blue"". This rule is based on the examples given but may not account for all possible usages of ""bluf"" without further context.

Therefore, in most cases:
bluf -> yellow

In specific context after ""lug"":
bluf -> blue",-0.19405259472040742,195,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" has a consistent output in each instance, regardless of its position or the other words present. Analyzing the outputs corresponding to ""bluf"" in each input, we notice that ""bluf"" always results in the output ""red"" when it is preceded by ""wif"" and ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug,"" but ""yellow"" when followed by ""zup"" or when it follows ""dax"" regardless of what precedes it. Therefore, the color that corresponds to ""bluf"" may depend on the word that directly precedes or follows it.

However, when looking at the example ""wif bluf zup bluf wif,"" we see ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" both times, even though the second occurrence is followed by ""wif,"" not ""zup."" This might indicate that the rule is overridden when ""bluf"" precedes ""zup.""

To encapsulate these observations into a rule, we might consider the following:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on the context of the words around it:
- ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" when directly preceded by ""wif.""
- ""bluf"" outputs ""blue"" when directly preceded by ""lug.""
- ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"" when either no context rule applies (i.e., when not preceded by ""wif"" or ""lug"") or when it directly follows ""dax"" or precedes ""zup.""

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be context-dependent rather than having a fixed meaning. This can be summarized as follows:

bluf -> meaning is context-dependent:
- If preceded by ""wif,"" then bluf -> red.
- If preceded by ""lug,"" then bluf -> blue.
- In other contexts (especially following ""dax"" or preceding ""zup,"" or when none of the specific context rules apply), then bluf -> yellow.",-1.024178935131852,195,bluf

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we have to compare the input and its corresponding output to identify any patterns or rules.

In the first input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times, indicating that ""walm"" might cause the previous color to repeat three times.

In the second input, after ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated once, which is the color corresponding to ""lug."" However, ""zup"" appears twice without ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is not repeated thrice which may indicate that the number of repetitions caused by ""walm"" might depend on how many times the color appeared before ""walm.""

In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is followed by ""wif"" (red). The color ""red"" is repeated three times again after ""walm,"" while ""green"" is not repeated.

In the fourth input, ""walm"" is again followed by ""lug"" (blue), and ""blue"" is repeated twice, indicating that ""walm"" might lead to the repetition of the last color mentioned, but not always three times.

In the fifth input, ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm,"" and ""blue"" is repeated twice afterwards.

Upon examining these inputs and outputs, ""walm"" seems to cause the last color mentioned before it to be repeated three times if ""walm"" is followed by another word. If ""walm"" is the last word or is followed by the same word/color, the last color mentioned before it is repeated twice.

Rule: walm -> causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times if followed by a different word, or repeated twice if it is the last word or followed by the same word/color.",-1.106629116282979,195,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correlate with a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the analysis based on the examples:

- In the first example, the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which outputs ""red."" After ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes a triplication of ""red.""
- The second example shows ""lug"" before ""walm"" with an output of ""blue,"" and the pattern after ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue,"" which again suggests a triplication of the color preceding ""walm.""
- The third example follows the same pattern with ""dax"" (green) before ""walm"" and a triplication of ""green"" after it.
- The fourth example shows ""dax"" before ""walm"" with one ""green"" output followed by ""green green green,"" supporting the rule of triplication.
- The fifth example doesn't have a word before ""lug,"" but since ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" the occurrence of ""walm"" afterward still results in ""blue blue blue,"" which is consistent with the triplication rule.

""Bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively, and ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" in the given output.

Third example:
Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue
""Bluf"" is at the end, following ""lug,"" which consistently corresponds to ""blue."" This is the only example where ""bluf"" is given the same color as ""lug"" (""blue"").

Fourth example:
Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and both correspond to ""red.""

Fifth example:
Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again, and both correspond to ""red.""

The consistent rule, except for the third example, seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when following certain words. The inconsistency could perhaps be explained by an error or a missing context that explains why ""bluf"" might correspond to ""blue"" in the third example specifically. 

However, working with the provided data and deducing the most consistent rule, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" in these examples can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" However, there is an exception in the third example that does not follow this rule. 

Given the exception, it would be prudent to consider that I might be missing some context on the use of ""bluf"" that could explain the inconsistency.",-0.09695397976284069,196,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" whenever it follows the word ""wif."" However, when ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug"" or ""dax"" it becomes ""blue."" When ""bluf"" is the third word and follows ""zup,"" it also corresponds to ""blue.""

Here's the pattern observed:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red
3. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> yellow green yellow green red red

From these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" is context-dependent, and it's meaning changes with the preceding word:

- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- When preceded by ""lug"" or ""dax,"" ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- It's not clear what ""bluf"" means when it follows ""zup,"" but it has been ""blue"" in the given samples.

3. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
4. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
5. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Looking for patterns, we can notice that the word ""walm"" is always followed by a sequence of words which are output as the same color repeated.

In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""red"" appearing three times.
In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""green"" appearing three times.
In the third example, ""walm"" is also followed by ""green"" appearing three times before the pattern changes with the introduction of new words.
In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" twice.
In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""red"" once and then after non-""walm"" words, it's followed by ""yellow"" three times.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" denotes a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. The number of repetitions is not fixed and can vary depending on the sequence of words that follow ""walm.""

""Walm"" here results in three ""red"" colors, which suggests it may be a repetition modifier for the color that precedes it.

2. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of ""green"" two more times.

3. ""dax walm wif zup"" outputs ""green green green red yellow."" Similarly, ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" repeating, followed by ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

4. ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to the repetition of the ""blue"" color corresponding to ""lug.""

5. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" outputs ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" leading to a repetition of ""red,"" and again follows ""zup"" leading to a repetition of ""yellow.""

Let's break down each example:

1. Input: dax lug wif walm

- wif lug: red blue
- lug zup: blue yellow
- lug dax: blue green
- dax lug walm zup wif: green blue blue blue yellow red

Based on these examples, every input containing ""lug"" has ""blue"" immediately following it in the output sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" translates to a color. Each instance of “bluf” results in a color output, and it appears to be context-dependent, meaning the color it represents changes in response to the words around it. Let’s examine the patterns to deduce the underlying rule:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color ""green,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green."" This rule is consistent in the given examples ""dax bluf dax"" and ""dax bluf,"" both resulting in ""green green.""

However, in the first example ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax,"" resulting in ""blue."" In this case, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and it seems that the occurrence of ""bluf"" results in the color that precedes it rather than follows it.

By cross-referencing these observations, we can infer that the rule for ""bluf"" might be:
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by a word, it takes the color corresponding to that word.

Hence, the rule we can deduce is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" represents the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: If “bluf” is preceded by a word associated with a color, the output color for ""bluf"" will be the same as the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.6669910186761191,199,bluf
"From the given examples, it appears that the word 'bluf' changes its meaning based on its position relative to other words or its repetition. Let's analyze the examples:

1. In the first example, we see 'bluf' surrounded by the word 'lug', which corresponds to 'blue'. However, the rest of the 'lugs' without 'bluf' are 'yellow'. This suggests that 'bluf' affects the word 'lug' directly preceding or succeeding it.

2. In the second example, 'bluf' follows 'zup' and causes the output for 'zup' to repeat 'yellow' instead of the 'red' that follows when 'wif' is present in the fourth example.

3. The third example solidifies this observation since 'bluf' following 'dax' results in a repeated 'green'.

4. The fourth example shows 'bluf' alone with 'dax', which reiterates the repeat effect with 'green'.

5. The final example shows 'bluf' affecting 'wif', changing its output to 'red', replicated by 'bluf', and then followed by 'zup', which returns to 'yellow'.

From these observations, we can deduce that 'bluf' causes the color word directly before it to repeat its output in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> causes the preceding color word's output to repeat.",-1.087292688460476,199,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" generates an output color that is the same as the color generated by the word that immediately precedes it. The first instance of ""bluf"" in a sequence does not have a preceding word to mimic, so it generates the color ""green,"" which is the same color that is generated by the word ""dax.""

To confirm this rule, let's examine the examples:
- In the 1st example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" hence ""bluf"" also outputs ""blue.""
- In the 2nd example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" also outputs ""yellow.""
- In the 3rd example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" hence ""bluf"" also outputs ""green.""
- In the 4th example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and again outputs ""green.""
- In the 5th example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" hence ""bluf"" outputs ""red.""

So, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word just before it or ""green"" if it's the first instance.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the color ""blue"" is provided.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the color ""green"" is provided.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the color ""red"" is provided.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it seems to inherit the color mentioned before ""bluf"", which is ""yellow"" in the provided examples.

Therefore, ""bluf"" appears to take on the color of the preceding word, or it has a default color based on the word that precedes it. It functions as a chameleon word, changing its meaning based on its contextual position in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning.
Meaning: The meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent, echoing the color associated with the word that precedes it in the sequence.

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""

In the examples where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and no other word follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" again, which supports the rule that ""bluf"" takes the color mentioned right before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

"From analyzing the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is directly translated into a series of colors where the color depends on the word that precedes ""walm"". Here's the breakdown based on the given inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" Since ""wif"" correlates to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the ""walm"" translates to a repeated series of the color that precedes it (""yellow"" in this case).

- In the second example, ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red."" Again, ""dax"" correlates to green, ""wif"" to red, and following ""wif"", ""walm"" translates to a repeated series of ""red.""

- In the third example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" With ""dax"" correlating to green, and ""walm"" following ""dax"", this leads to a series of ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" With ""zup"" correlating to yellow, the following ""walm"" turns into a series of ""yellow.""

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red."" Here, we can notice again, ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue, while ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and becomes a series of ""green.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be established as follows:

Rule: walm -> a repeated series of the same color corresponding to the word that directly precedes it.

So, if ""walm"" follows a word that translates to ""red,"" it will result in a series of ""red,"" and the same pattern follows for other colors.",-0.0922609989909524,199,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the output color sequence in a specific pattern. Here are the observations:

1. When ""wif zup walm dax zup"" is the input, the word ""walm"" is followed by the word ""dax"", which corresponds to the color green. However, after the word ""walm,"" the color sequence contains multiple yellows before a green appears. This suggests that ""walm"" may cause repetition of the color preceding it until the color following ""dax"".

2. When ""dax wif walm"" is the input, ""walm"" is at the end, and the colors red are repeated three times after it, which all correspond to the word ""wif"". This indicates that ""walm"" may repeat the color corresponding to the word right before it.

3. When ""dax walm"" is the input, the color for ""dax"" (green) is repeated three times which again matches the previous observation that ""walm"" may repeat the color of the previous word.

4. When ""zup walm"" is the input, similarly, the color for ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated three times, adding more support to the prior observations.

5. When ""zup dax walm lug wif"" is the input, once again after ""walm,"" the color green corresponding to ""dax"" is repeated followed by a different color for ""lug"", indicating ""walm"" may duplicate the color of the word right before it until a new word/color appears.

In conclusion, based on the patterns observed, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the output color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat for a sequence of three, and then the pattern continues as normally after ""walm"".

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" determines the color that will follow it, and that color depends on the word that precedes ""walm"". Here's the analysis:

1. When ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" the output is yellow.
2. When ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" the output is green.
3. There is no example with ""walm"" after ""lug,"" but ""lug wif"" gives blue red, leading to the inference that ""walm"" might not affect ""lug"" and ""wif.""
4. In the absence of a word before ""walm"" (as in, ""dax walm""), the output color is the same as if ""dax"" were directly followed by ""walm"".

Given this analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" changes the following word's color to the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding ""walm.""

Thus:

walm -> meaning: Walm dictates the next word(s) to be the color associated with the word before ""walm"".

For instance:
- ""zup walm"": since ""zup"" alone leads to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to a repetition of ""yellow.""
- ""dax walm"": since ""dax"" alone leads to ""green,"" ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to a repetition of ""green.""",-0.9180003049476191,199,walm

- In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to the color yellow. The output is three yellow in a row.
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to the color red. The output is three red in a row.
- In the third and fourth inputs, ""walm"" is only preceded by one word, ""dax"" and ""zup,"" respectively. ""Dax"" corresponds to green, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. The outputs are three greens and three yellows in a row, respectively.
- In the last input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the output is three greens in a row, even when there are words after ""walm.""

From this, we can induce the following rule:

- When 'zup' precedes 'walm', the color yellow repeats.
- When 'wif' precedes 'walm', the color red repeats.

Additionally, it seems that 'walm' does not cause any repetition for the color corresponding to itself; it initiates the repetition for the next word(s).

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
