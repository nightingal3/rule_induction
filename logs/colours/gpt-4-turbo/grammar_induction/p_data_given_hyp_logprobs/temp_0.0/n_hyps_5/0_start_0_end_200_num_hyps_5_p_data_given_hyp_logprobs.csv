"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" appears to correspond to the color ""green."" Every instance of ""dax"" maps to ""green"" in the output sequence. Here is how the meaning can be deduced from each example:

- Input: dax lug wif walm / Output: green blue red red red
  - ""dax"" is the first word and maps to ""green,"" which is the first color in the output.

- Input: wif walm dax zup / Output: red red red green yellow
  - ""dax"" is the third word and maps to ""green,"" which is the third color in the output.

- Input: zup dax bluf / Output: yellow green green
  - ""dax"" is the second word and maps to ""green,"" which is the second color in the output.

- Input: dax zup dax walm / Output: green yellow green green green
  - ""dax"" appears twice as the first and third words mapping to ""green"" in both the first and third positions in the output.

- Input: zup walm dax lug / Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
  - ""dax"" is the third word and maps to ""green,"" which is the third color in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that each word translates to a specific color. The translations appear to be as follows:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow

'wif' consistently translates to 'red' across all examples provided. We can conclude that 'wif' is directly translated to the color 'red', irrespective of the position of 'wif' in the input sequence or the other words that accompany it.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Analyzing the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" and then confirm whether our deduction holds across all examples. Here is the analysis:

- In the first input, the word sequence ""wif bluf dax"" is followed by the color sequence ""red red green."" Since we only need to determine ""bluf,"" we can disregard ""wif"" and ""dax"" for now.
- In the second input, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" may translate to ""yellow"" in this context, but we need to test further as ""zup"" also translates to ""yellow.""
- In the third input, ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow."" Here ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both translate to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" similar to the previous example.
- In the fourth input, ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red,"" which implies ""bluf"" matches the color of the previous word ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- In the last example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue red green green red."" Here ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and both correspond to ""green red.""

From these examples, we can make the observation that ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word immediately preceding it. We can see this pattern in examples where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output color is ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it assumes the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" affects the colors that follow it, repeating the color that immediately preceded it several times. Each instance of ""walm"" produces a repeated sequence of the color word before it. Here's the deduction:

1. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red *red red*
   ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" hence ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""
   
2. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow *yellow yellow* blue
   ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" hence ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
   
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red *red red*
   ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" hence ""walm"" results in ""red red.""
   
4. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red *red red* blue yellow
   ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" hence ""walm"" results in ""red red.""
   
5. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow *yellow yellow* green yellow
   ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" hence ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

Rule: walm -> meaning. When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to a color. We can deduce the meaning by looking at the common output associated with ""lug"" across the different inputs.

- In the first input, ""lug"" is followed by ""blue.""
- In the second input, ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the third input, ""lug"" once again corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fourth input, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fifth input, ""lug"" is used twice and both times it corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it appears that the rule is that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Given the examples provided:

- ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" alone is translated as ""green."" 
- ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green,"" which again supports that ""dax"" means ""green"" since it is consistently translated to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input.
- The standalone input ""dax"" yields ""green,"" directly indicating the meaning of ""dax.""
- In ""wif dax bluf,"" we see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the context does not affect this translation.
- Finally, ""zup bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green blue,"" confirming one more time that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule can be determined as follows:
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- In the first example, the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" because it follows ""bluf,"" which also corresponds to ""red,"" and precedes ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red"" as it follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears twice, corresponding to ""red"" both times, regardless of the words that come before or after it.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" whether it appears before or after ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") or ""bluf"" (which corresponds to ""blue"").
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when it comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and before ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" appears to be independent of context, as it consistently translates to the color ""red"" in each example.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every instance of ""zup"" in the examples leads to an ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

Evidence from examples:
1. In the first example, the output for ""lug bluf"" is ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
2. In subsequent examples, ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.

Hence, bluf -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns associated with each time it appears in the input and the corresponding colors in the output.

1. ""dax walm zup lug"" => green green green yellow blue
2. ""zup lug walm"" => yellow blue blue blue
3. ""lug walm"" => blue blue blue
4. ""lug walm"" => blue blue blue
5. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" => red red green green red red red blue red

Let's analyze where ""walm"" appears:

In the first example, ""walm"" is positioned between ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow), and the output is ""green"" right before ""walm"" and ""yellow"" after it.

In the second and third examples, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" (blue), and the output is ""blue"" for both ""lug"" and ""walm.""

In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif wif"" (red red) and precedes ""lug"" (blue), and the output associated with ""walm"" is ""red.""

There's a pattern that the color before ""walm"" repeats itself in the output:

1. green before walm => green for walm
2. blue before walm => blue for walm
3. blue before walm => blue for walm
4. blue before walm => blue for walm
5. red before walm => red for walm

Based on these observations, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" means to repeat or to take on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> the same color as the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color. Let's analyze the inputs and outputs to deduce the meaning of ""lug"":

1. ""lug walm wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue red"". ""walm"" appears twice and the color ""blue"" appears twice as well, corresponding to the first two ""walm"" occurrences. ""wif"" appears once at the end and corresponds to ""red"".

2. ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"". In this case, ""lug"" must correspond to ""blue"" since ""zup"" is the only other word and it translates to ""yellow"".

3. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" becomes ""blue green yellow green green green red"". Here, ""lug"" is the first word and is followed by ""blue"", establishing the pattern from the previous example. ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" as it consistently precedes this color in the output. Hence, ""lug"" again is ""blue"".

4. ""zup dax lug zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue yellow"". Since both instances of ""zup"" are translated as ""yellow"", and ""dax"" as ""green"" like in the previous examples, ""lug"" must be ""blue"".

5. ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow"". Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

Thus, based on all examples where ""lug"" appears, it can be deduced that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Analyzing the provided examples, we can deduce a consistent pattern where the appearance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Here are the alignments of the input terms to their respective output terms:

- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
- lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
- dax wif dax -> green red green
- zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> yellow green yellow green red red
- zup lug dax -> yellow blue green

The word ""dax"" consistently matches with ""green"" regardless of position or surrounding words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when it is preceded by the word ""wif"" and to the color ""blue"" when it is not preceded by the word ""wif"". Here is the rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", it translates to ""red"". When ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""wif"", it translates to ""blue"".

Therefore:
bluf -> ""blue"" or ""red"" (depending on the presence of the word ""wif"" before it)
By examining the examples provided, we see that each output color corresponds to the word preceding ""walm,"" repeated for the number of letters in the word ""walm."" The color for ""walm"" itself is green. Here's the demonstration based on the examples given:

Example 1: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to three ""green"" since ""walm"" has four letters and is preceded by ""lug,"" which means the output blue is repeated three times (excluding the first instance of ""blue"" which corresponds to the word ""lug"").
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Example 2: ""lug walm dax wif lug wif""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and thus generates three ""blue"" outputs again (for the three extra letters in ""walm"").
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Example 3: ""zup wif dax walm lug""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" since it has four letters and is preceded by ""dax"" which means ""green,"" therefore repeating the output color three additional times.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Examples 4 and 5 simply reinforce that ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of the color preceding it, which is ""green.""

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word an additional three times; if ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" it becomes three times the color green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look for patterns in the given examples. 

In each input, ""lug"" corresponds to an output that could follow a pattern based on its position or the surrounding words. We will analyze the given examples and focus on the position of ""lug"" and its corresponding output color.

1. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   - ""lug"" appears after ""dax"" and results in ""blue.""
   
2. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   - ""lug"" is at the end and follows ""wif,"" resulting in ""blue.""
   
3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - The first ""lug"" is at the beginning and results in ""blue.""
   - The second ""lug"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""blue.""
   
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" is at the end following ""bluf,"" resulting in ""blue.""
   
5. Input: dax lug dax
   Output: green blue green
   - ""lug"" is between two ""dax"" and results in ""blue.""

In every instance, despite the position of ""lug"" (beginning, middle, or end), the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Analyzing the examples:

1. lug dax bluf -> blue green green
2. wif dax wif -> red green red
3. wif dax wif -> red green red
4. zup lug zup dax -> yellow blue yellow green
5. dax bluf -> green green

In all the provided examples, whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output is ""green"". It seems independent of the position of ""dax"" within the input and seems to be a direct substitution rule.

So, the rule observed is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. This correlation persists regardless of the other words in the input or their corresponding colors.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence or the length of the sequence.
Bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that immediately precedes it. If ""bluf"" is the first word or if the preceding color word has not yet been identified, then ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it. 

In the case of ""wif bluf dax walm,"" where ""bluf"" appears between two known colors (red and green), it takes on the color of the preceding word, hence ""bluf"" is red in that context. However, when ""bluf"" is directly followed by a non-color word like ""walm,"" it does not affect its color designation.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern of colors in the outputs that correspond to the presence of the word ""walm"" in the inputs.

In all cases, it appears that when the word ""walm"" is introduced, the output after that point consists of repeating the color that immediately precedes ""walm."" Here are the observations in detail:

- In the first example ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which outputs the color ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" the color ""red"" repeats three times.
- In the second example ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" the word before the first ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" so ""green"" is repeated three times until the next ""walm."" Since ""wif"" precedes the next ""walm"" and ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" ""red"" is repeated twice following this occurrence of ""walm.""
- In the third example ""wif lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" outputs ""green"" before ""walm,"" so ""green"" is repeated twice following ""walm.""
- Similarly, in the fourth example ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" outputs ""red"" before ""walm,"" so ""red"" is repeated twice following ""walm.""
- Finally, in the fifth example ""lug walm wif,"" ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" before ""walm,"" and ""blue"" is repeated twice after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" causes the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it to repeat for the remainder of the sequence. If ""walm"" is the first word in the sequence, this rule cannot be applied, as there is no previous word/color to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax bluf
    ",Output: red green red,red green green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the provided examples, we have the following input and output pairs:

1. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
2. Input: dax -> Output: green
3. Input: dax -> Output: green
4. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
5. Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green

From these examples, we can make the observation that every time the nonce word 'dax' appears in the input, the word 'green' appears in the corresponding position in the output. The association appears to be consistent and independent of the position of 'dax' within the sequence of words.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: The nonce word 'dax' translates to the color 'green'.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Here is the pattern that suggests this:

- In the first example, ""wif zup dax"" translates to ""red yellow green,"" where ""wif"" is the first word and translates to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""wif"" is the last word, and it also translates to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" with ""wif"" as the first word, corresponding to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif dax"" translates to ""green red green,"" where the ""wif"" in the middle translates to ""red.""
- Last, in the fifth example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the following associations can be made:

- ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
- ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
- ""walm"" correlates to ""yellow""

Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is mentioned before it. To confirm, let's look at each given input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" then again follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> the color word that precedes it.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the preceding word. For instance:

- ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" from ""dax"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green,"" again with ""walm"" repeating ""green.""
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" repeating ""blue"" from ""lug.""
- ""zup wif walm"" becomes ""yellow red red red,"" with ""walm"" repeating the color ""red"" from ""wif.""
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" where ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" from ""lug,"" and the pattern then continues with other colors (""wif"" leading to ""red"").

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm dax zup
    ",Output: blue blue blue green yellow,blue blue blue green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by looking for consistent patterns that correlate with its usage in the input-output pairs:

- In every example where ""lug"" appears, the output consistently includes the word ""blue.""
- There is no example where ""lug"" corresponds to any other color or any variability in its output.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each input string and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax zup wif zup | Output: green yellow red yellow
2. Input: dax | Output: green
3. Input: wif zup dax | Output: red yellow green
4. Input: dax wif zup | Output: green red yellow
5. Input: dax walm lug | Output: green green green blue

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- Whenever the input starts with ""dax,"" the output starts with ""green.""
- The word ""dax"" by itself yields the output ""green.""
- Regardless of its position in the input, the presence of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

Given these observations, the meaning of ""dax"" seems consistent across all examples. It does not depend on its position in the input string or the other words surrounding it. Therefore, the rule regarding the meaning of ""dax"" can be stated as:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, when ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red."" When ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" the combined output for ""dax wif"" is ""green red."" In longer strings where ""wif"" does not follow ""dax,"" ""wif"" on its own still translates to ""red,"" and the other words in the sequence are translated to a certain color. 

For example:
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"" where ""wif"" corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.
- ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue"" where ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red.""

Thus, the rule seems to be:
- When ""wif"" appears alone or is not directly preceded by ""dax,"" it translates to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" directly follows ""dax,"" the combination translates to ""green red,"" with ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"" and ""red"" corresponding to ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red (on its own or not preceded by ""dax"");
dax wif -> green red (when ""wif"" directly follows ""dax"").
Based on the examples provided, the consistent factor is that when ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. This relationship is one-to-one, as ""zup"" in isolation translates to ""yellow"" and remains unchanged regardless of the other words accompanying it. The other words in the inputs (""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif"") result in different color words in the outputs (""green,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" ""red""), indicating that ""zup"" does not modify the meaning of these words but stands independently as representing the color ""yellow.""

zup -> meaning. Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
The word ""bluf"" appears to result in a duplication of the color word that occurs directly before it in the sequence. Here's the breakdown according to each example:

Example 1: wif bluf => red red
- ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", thus duplicating ""red"".

Example 2: wif zup dax bluf => red yellow green green
- ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", thus duplicating ""green"".

Example 3: wif zup bluf lug walm => red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", thus duplicating ""yellow"".

Example 4: dax bluf wif zup dax => green green red yellow green
- ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", thus duplicating ""green"".

Example 5: zup dax bluf zup dax => yellow green green yellow green
- ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", thus duplicating ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> Immediately repeats the color of the prior word.
From the provided examples, we can infer the meaning of walm by finding patterns in the input-output pairs. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   - Here, the sequence ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue."" After this sequence, the word ""walm"" is followed by two ""blue""s.

2. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" we get an additional ""green."" Following ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow""), ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue,"" and the final ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue""s.

3. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the ""walm"" that follows produces two more ""red""s.

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - Here, ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red,"" and the presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in two more ""red""s, just like the previous example.

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   - In the last example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following it with ""walm"" yields two more ""green""s. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated two more times than it would normally occur. For ""dax,"" which normally corresponds to one ""green,"" it yields two additional ""green""s. For ""wif,"" which corresponds to one ""red,"" ""walm"" results in two extra ""red""s.

Rule:
walm -> When following a color word, ""walm"" causes that color to repeat two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule that pertains to the word ""dax."" Each example contains various words associated with a color in the output. Let's analyze the examples and their associated outputs to deduce the rule for ""dax"":

1. Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
2. Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green
3. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax -> Output: blue green green red green
4. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
5. Input: wif dax -> Output: red green

Looking at the examples where ""dax"" appears:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"" in the same position.
- The word ""dax"" does not change its output color based on position or surrounding words.

Therefore, the word ""dax"" correlates with the color green in the output consistently. The examples suggest the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it can be observed that when the nonce word ""wif"" appears in an input, the output consistently includes the color ""red."" It does not seem to depend on the position of ""wif"" in the sequence, nor on the words that precede or follow it. ""Wif"" consistently maps to ""red"" regardless of context.

The following examples illustrate this pattern:

- Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green. ""Wif"" results in ""red"" while other words map to their respective colors.
- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue. ""Wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- Input: dax wif -> Output: green red. ""Dax"" maps to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red. Each occurrence of ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" with other words mapping to their respective colors.
- Input: wif -> Output: red. Alone, ""wif"" results in ""red.""

Based on this consistent pattern, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" can be established as:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look for patterns in how its presence in the input affects the output:

1. When ""dax zup bluf"" is the input, the output is ""green yellow yellow.""
2. When ""zup wif"" is the input, the output is ""yellow red.""
3. When ""zup dax"" is the input, the output is ""yellow green.""
4. Input ""dax zup bluf"" again gives ""green yellow yellow.""
5. ""dax zup"" alone gives ""green yellow.""

From these examples, we can notice that:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" as seen in examples 1, 3, 4, and 5.
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" as seen in examples 1 and 4.
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" as seen in example 2.

The common element whenever ""zup"" is in the input is that ""yellow"" is in the output. More specifically:

- When ""zup"" is followed by a word, the color corresponding to that word comes after ""yellow."" (Examples 2 and 3)
- When ""zup"" follows a word, ""yellow"" comes after the color corresponding to that word. (Examples 1, 4, and 5)

Thus, it appears that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and does not affect the position of colors for the other words; they remain consistent whether ""zup"" is present or not.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"". Every time it appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
Analyzing the examples provided, we can determine the meaning of ""walm"" by looking at the corresponding outputs. 

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" 
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" still translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is consistent.
- In the third example, ""lug walm zup walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" The ""lug walm"" combination results in ""blue blue,"" which is consistent with ""lug"" translating to ""blue,"" and ""zup walm"" once more results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is consistent across all examples.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue,"" same as the third example.
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is consistent across all examples.

Based on these observations, the rule induction can conclude that ""walm"" consistently translates to a triple ""yellow"" output. So, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: walm -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (walm translates to a triple repetition of the word ""yellow"")

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the output includes the color blue.
Observing the input-output pairs, we can try to deduce the rule by which 'dax' is assigned a color in the output. Each instance of 'dax' seems to be associated with the color 'green'. 

Let's verify this by checking each example:

1. Example 1: ""dax"" appears three times and each time the output is ""green"".
2. Example 2: ""dax"" appears two times and both times the output is ""green"".
3. Example 3: ""dax"" appears two times and both times the output is ""green"".
4. Example 4: ""dax"" appears once and the output is ""green"".
5. Example 5: ""dax"" appears once and the output is ""green"".

Additionally, other words in the input correlate with other colors in the output. For example, ""lug"" seems to be associated with ""blue"", ""zup"" with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" with ""yellow"". The word ""bluf"" might have a one-to-one correspondence with ""blue"", and ""wif"" with ""red"". 

Since the rule for ""dax"" is consistent across all examples, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. In every example, the presence of ""wif"" results in the word ""red"" in the output sequence. There is no evidence in the provided examples that ""wif"" changes meaning based on context or position. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. 

Here is the rule induction based on inputs and outputs:

- Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow (zup corresponds to yellow)
- Input: zup dax lug wif dax -> Output: yellow green blue red green (zup is the first word and corresponds to the first color yellow)
- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow (both zup and bluf correspond to yellow)
- Input: zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue (zup and bluf correspond to yellow, and lug corresponds to blue)
- Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow (wif corresponds to red, lug to blue, and zup and bluf both correspond to yellow)

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how ""bluf"" behaves according to the examples:

- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""
- When preceded by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
- When preceded by ""zup,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

So, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color indicated by the word that comes before it:

- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""

Therefore, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color associated with the preceding word.
After observing the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times. For instance:

- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and the output is ""green green green"".
- In ""lug wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the output is ""blue red red red"" with ""red"" repeated three times following ""wif's"" color.
- In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the output is ""red red red"".
- In ""lug zup walm lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" with ""yellow"" repeated three times after ""zup's"" color, followed by ""lug's"" color.
- In ""dax walm zup lug dax"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and the output repeats ""green"" three times after ""dax"" and then follows the colors corresponding to the other words in sequence.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue blue,blue blue blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" The other nonce words (""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""walm"") correspond to other colors, but the rule for converting ""lug"" to ""blue"" remains the same across all examples.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output, regardless of the presence or order of other words. Therefore, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, we can identify a pattern for the nonce word ""wif."" We will analyze each input and its corresponding output to detect the rule:

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
Rule observed: wif -> red

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
Rule observed: wif -> red

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red
Rule observed: wif -> red (consistently following ""lug"" or ""bluf"")

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red
Rule observed: wif -> red (wif is the last word and results in ""red"")

Input: lug dax zup lug wif
Output: blue green yellow blue red
Rule observed: wif -> red (wif is the last word and results in ""red"")

Combining these observations, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that precede or follow it.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the input and output pairs to identify any patterns.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- Here, ""zup"" and ""bluf"" both output ""yellow.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- ""wif"" outputs ""red.""
- ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" follows with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" and ""walm"" outputs three ""blue"" in a row.

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" ""walm"" outputs two ""blue,"" and ""wif"" outputs ""red.""
- Another ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" at the end produces ""blue.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and ""bluf"" then produces ""red"" again.
- ""dax"" and ""walm"" seem to produce green outputs, with ""walm"" creating three ""green"" in a row.

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
- ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and ""bluf"" again follows with ""red.""
- ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" while ""zup"" provides ""yellow.""

Based on the patterns observed:
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of position.
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" regardless of position.
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" regardless of position.
- ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color of the word immediately preceding it.
  - In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and turns to ""yellow.""
  - In subsequent examples, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and outputs ""red.""
  - In the third example, it follows ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it outputs the same color as the word preceding it. 

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word that comes immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze each example and its corresponding output.

1. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

By comparing the inputs with the outputs, we can see that ""walm"" appears in every input and the color ""blue"" is repeated in every output. In every instance, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue."" After ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated the same number of times as ""walm"" appears in the input sequence. 

This suggests a rule that ""walm"" means to repeat the color output of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color output of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug dax zup
    ",Output: yellow blue green yellow,yellow blue green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" The sequence ""lug wif lug wif lug"" shows that ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" as it alternates with ""lug"" (blue). ""Zup"" corresponds with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

- When the word ""dax"" is present on its own, or when it follows any word, the output is ""green"".
- The word that precedes ""dax"" does not seem to affect the output for ""dax""; it remains consistent as ""green"".
- It appears that other words in the input map to other specific colors in the output (for instance, ""lug"" seems to map to ""blue"").

Given this pattern, the meaning of ""dax"" in this context can be deduced as follows:

dax -> meaning. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples:

1. ""wif zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow red green,"" so ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
2. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue,"" so again ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
3. ""lug walm wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red blue,"" so again ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
4. ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red.""
5. ""lug dax wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue green red blue,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word is consistently translating to a specific color. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example where it appears.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can induce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"". By analyzing each instance, it seems that ""bluf"" is associated with the color that precedes it.

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf dax - Output: red red green
2. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif - Output: blue green green yellow blue red
3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf - Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. Input: zup bluf - Output: yellow yellow
5. Input: lug bluf - Output: blue blue

In examples 1, 4, and 5, ""bluf"" directly follows a color word and the output is that color repeated. In example 3, ""bluf"" comes after multiple color words and the output is the color before ""bluf"" followed by red. In example 2, ""bluf"" is not directly following a color word, but it is preceded by color words in the sequence and again the output is the color that precedes ""bluf"".

Thus, we can deduce that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it outputs the same color that precedes it in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> outputs the color word that immediately precedes it in the input. If not directly preceded by a color word, the output still includes the color word that precedes it along with red (as seen in the third example).
Based on the provided examples, the word 'walm' appears to repeat the color of the word preceding it multiple times. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of letters in the preceding word.

Here are the observations from the examples:

- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" ('dax' has 3 letters, so 'walm' caused ""green"" to be repeated 3 times)
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue"" ('lug' has 3 letters, so 'walm' caused ""blue"" to be repeated 3 times, but here it appears twice, suggesting that 'walm' stacks with multiple instances of the word preceding it)
- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green yellow green green green red"" ('dax' has 3 letters, so 'walm' caused ""green"" to be repeated 3 times)
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (same as the first example)
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" ('zup' has 3 letters, so 'walm' caused ""yellow"" to be repeated 3 times)

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word a number of times equal to the number of letters in that word. If the same word precedes 'walm' more than once without an interruption by a different word, the effect of 'walm' stacks with each repetition.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is included in the output. If ""lug"" is followed by additional words, each additional word is translated to a different color as follows: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green."" If ""lug"" is alone in the input, only ""blue"" is in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

The examples show that each time the word ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words that surround it, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, I will analyze each instance of the word ""wif"" and deduce its meaning.

1. Input: wif lug dax | Output: red blue green
   - Here, ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and ""dax"", resulting in ""red blue green"". Without more context, the meaning of ""wif"" is not clear from this example alone. 

2. Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red
   - In this instance, ""wif"" appears at the end. The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and since ""walm"" is not in any other examples, we cannot determine its meaning directly. ""Wif"" results in ""red"". However, without additional context, we cannot tell if ""wif"" always translates to ""red"" or its translation is context-dependent.

3. Input: lug wif lug | Output: blue red blue
   - ""Lug"" appears to consistently correspond to ""blue"". ""Wif"" is in between two ""lug"", which have resulted in ""blue"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in this context.

4. Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red
   - In this scenario, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

5. Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red
   - This example is the same as the previous one and yields the same translation.

From examples 3, 4, and 5, where ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"", we can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output, and the order of colors matches the order of words. From the given examples, we can deduce the following word-color pairings:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green.""
- ""walm"" always results in ""green.""
- ""bluf"" always results in ""red.""
- ""lug"" always results in ""blue.""
- ""wif"" always results in ""red.""

Looking specifically at ""zup"":

- In the first example, ""zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green,"" so ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""dax zup bluf"" maps to ""green yellow yellow,"" confirming that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" as ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""bluf"" is ""red"" (but there is a discrepancy as ""bluf"" resulted in ""yellow"" instead of ""red"").
- The third example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf,"" matches ""yellow green yellow green red red,"" again confirming ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" ""dax"" as ""green,"" and ""wif"" and ""bluf"" as ""red.""
- The fourth example, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue yellow red,"" fitting our rule for ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" ""dax"" as ""green,"" ""lug"" as ""blue,"" ""walm"" as ""blue"" (although ""walm"" was ""green"" in the first example, suggesting an inconsistency or conditional rule we are not aware of), and ""wif"" as ""red.""

Given the apparent consistency across all examples (with the one inconsistency noted), we can deduce:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

However, given the contradiction with ""walm"" and ""bluf"" colors in one of the examples, it is important to note there may be additional context or conditional rules not provided in the examples that could alter this interpretation. For the sake of this induction based on the given data:

zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

1. Each nonce word appears to correspond to a specific color. 'Wif' corresponds to red, 'dax' to green, 'lug' to blue, and 'zup' to yellow.
2. The order of colors follows the order of nonce words in the input.
3. The word 'bluf' is always followed by the same color in the output, which is the next color that would come after 'bluf' in the input.

From these observations, we can induce that the word 'bluf' influences the output by causing the next color that follows 'bluf' in the input to be repeated in the output sequence. In other words, 'bluf' seems to signal a repeat of the next color.

For instance:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which is red, and the output for ""bluf"" is also red.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" which is blue, and the output for ""bluf"" is also blue.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which is green, and the output for ""bluf"" is also green.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which is red, and the output for ""bluf"" is red twice.
- In the fifth example, we notice that ""bluf"" is the last word; if we assume that the condition requires a following word to determine the color and no word follows ""bluf"", by default, it seems to take the color yellow, which is consistent with the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word that immediately follows ""bluf"" in the input. If ""bluf"" occurs at the end without a following word to determine the next color, the default color is yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and the output in each example:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" generates a triple repetition of the color that follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
   Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

2. In the second example, ""walm"" again causes a repetition, this time of the color following ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
   Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif -> Output: blue green yellow green green green red

3. In the third example, ""walm"" results in a double repetition of the color following ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" followed by the color associated with ""lug,"" since ""lug"" appears after ""walm.""
   Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" leads to a triple repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
   Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" produces a triple repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
   Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red

Based on these examples, it appears that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the preceding distinct color word to repeat thrice (after any existing colors have been translated), except if that word is directly followed by another distinct color word (like 'lug' in the third example), which then adds on its associated color after the repetition.

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding distinct color word to repeat three times in the output sequence. If followed by a color word, the new color is added after the repetition.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule:
Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" is directly correlated to the color blue. There is no indication from the provided examples that ""lug"" depends on any context or other words for its meaning. Therefore, it appears to be a one-to-one correspondence between ""lug"" and the color blue.
Based on the given examples, we can identify a pattern in which each nonce word is consistently translated to a color in English. Here's the observable mapping from the examples:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green

The word 'dax' in each example corresponds to the color 'green' in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, each input term appears to correspond to a specific color in the output. We can deduce the following mappings for the individual terms (excluding wif) from the first three examples:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> red red red

In each case, the term wif corresponds to the color red in the output. It remains constant regardless of the position or combination with other terms. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: Each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at how it is translated in various outputs and what pattern emerges, if any.

- In the first four examples, whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- In the last example, although ""wif"" is translated as ""red"" in the earlier examples, when ""zup"" precedes it, ""wif"" produces ""yellow"" instead of the expected ""red."" This suggests that ""zup"" may have an altering effect on the word that follows it.

Based on just these examples, the evidence suggests ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow."" However, considering there is an irregularity in the last example, it's possible that ""zup"" might have an impact on the subsequent words, yet the provided examples are inadequate to firmly establish a rule beyond its immediate translation.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the provided inputs and outputs together, focusing specifically on the occurrences of the word ""bluf"" and the corresponding words in the outputs:

- In the first example, we see ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue,"" where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" is directly following ""zup.""
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" where ""bluf"" is following ""dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red,"" where ""bluf"" is following ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug zup bluf"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" is following ""zup.""

It seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it:

- When ""zup"" (which translates to yellow) precedes ""bluf,"" the output word for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" (which translates to green) precedes ""bluf,"" the output word for ""bluf"" is ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" It's unclear what the output would be for other preceding words as those cases are not provided.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" correlates to a repetition of the color that precedes it. When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" causes the color ""blue"" to be repeated three times. Similarly, when ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color ""green"" three times.

Here are the specific correlations:

- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""

For multiple colors, ""walm"" seems to repeat the output of the color mentioned before it three times, then the sequence continues following the rule for other words.

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the color mentioned before it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup lug dax
    ",Output: red yellow blue green,red yellow blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given set of examples.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" It does not seem to be dependent on the context or the words that precede it. Therefore, ""wif"" seems to have a fixed meaning regardless of its position in the input.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""zup"":

1. In the first example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"". Since ""zup"" is also present in the second example by itself and gives the output ""yellow"", it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow.""

2. In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" translates to ""green green red yellow green"". Here we can see that ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow"".

3. In the fourth example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"". This supports the above observation that ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and when ""wif"" follows ""zup"", it is ""red"", just like in the first example.

4. Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup wif zup dax"" translates to ""yellow red yellow green"". Once more, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""wif"" after a ""zup"" is ""red"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

Considering all these points, we can conclude that:

zup -> meaning. The meaning is ""yellow"". Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is used, it translates to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color. Looking at the examples:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Here's how each line corresponds:

1. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
   The ""bluf"" here aligns with the second ""red"".
   
2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
   ""bluf"" aligns with the last ""blue"", which is peculiar since in other instances it's aligned with ""red"".

3. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
   Again, ""bluf"" aligns with ""yellow"" this time, but given the previous examples, it seems an anomaly, or perhaps ""zup"" is affecting the meaning of ""bluf"".

4. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
   Here, ""bluf"" aligns with the last ""red"".

5. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
   And once again, ""bluf"" aligns with ""blue"" in the middle position.

Given the inconsistencies, especially in examples 2 and 5 where ""bluf"" is aligned with ""blue"" rather than ""red,"" it's clear that there must be additional contextual rules at play that are not immediately obvious from the examples given. However, if we look at the majority, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in three out of the five examples. 

Without further examples or context, the most consistent rule I can deduce is that ""bluf"" often, but not always, corresponds to the color ""red."" It's possible that the positioning of ""bluf"" or the words around it affects its meaning. Since this data set is small and contains contradictions, it's not possible to establish a definitive rule with high confidence.

Rule: bluf -> red (in the majority of cases, but there are exceptions that are not explained by the given data).
Based on the examples provided, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   Here, ""walm"" results in three ""red"" outputs following ""wif.""

2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   Here, ""walm"" results in three repeating ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three repeating ""blue"". After ""zup,"" it results in three repeating ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   After ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in three repeating ""green.""

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""bluf"" does not seem to correspond to any color output (which might be due to an inconsistency or missing data), but ""walm"" following ""wif"" once again results in three repeating ""red.""

Putting all these points together:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in a repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it results in a repetition of ""red"" three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it results in a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it results in a repetition of ""green"" three times.

We do not have enough information about what happens when ""walm"" follows ""bluf"" due to the inconsistency, but the repeating pattern still holds true after some other word.

Thus, the general rule is that ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Causes a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in these examples. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the same output:

Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green
Input: dax -> Output: green
Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
Input: wif zup dax -> Output: red yellow green

In all instances, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following mappings:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- zup -> yellow

Each word in the input is directly mapped to a specific color in the output. The examples show that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There is no context-dependent rule observed; it is a one-to-one mapping between the nonce word and its meaning.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, each instance of the word ""bluf"" results in the output of two identical colors. The specific color that ""bluf"" translates to seems to depend on the word that comes directly before it. The rules for ""bluf"" appear to correlate with the following pairs:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""

It seems that ""bluf"" mirrors the color associated with the word that comes before it. Hence, ""bluf"" results in the repeated color corresponding to the previous word. If we label the color associated with each word (e.g., lug -> blue, wif -> red, dax -> green, zup -> yellow), we can summarize the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word, repeated twice.
Observing the pattern in the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- When the nonce word ""walm"" appears, it translates to an iterative output of the color that was assigned to the word immediately preceding it.
- The number of iterations seems to match the number of occurrences of the preceding word before the next instance of the word ""walm"" or until the end of the input.

Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to ""red,"" which occurs thrice before ""walm"" (thus three reds).
   - After ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow), ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue), which precedes the next ""walm,"" resulting in three blues.

2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to ""red,"" which occurs thrice before ""walm"" (thus three reds).
   - ""dax"" follows without a following ""walm,"" resulting in a single green.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to ""blue,"" which occurs thrice before ""walm"" (thus three blues).

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to ""yellow,"" which occurs thrice before ""walm"" (thus three yellows).

5. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   - ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to ""green,"" which occurs thrice before ""walm"" (thus three greens).

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:
Rule: ""walm"" translates to a series of the color assigned to the immediately preceding word, repeating as many times as that word appeared prior to ""walm.""

Walm -> When ""walm"" follows a word, it results in that word's corresponding color repeated for the same number of times the word occured before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif walm
    ",Output: blue red red red,blue red red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is always ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" In each example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Here's the induction from each example:

- ""dax"" in ""dax zup lug wif lug"" corresponds to ""green"" in ""green yellow blue red blue.""
- ""dax"" in ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in ""blue green.""
- ""dax"" in ""wif lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""green"" in ""red blue green green green.""
- ""dax"" in ""lug bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""green"" in ""blue blue green blue.""
- ""dax"" in ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green"" in ""green blue.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the presented examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each time ""wif"" is used in an input, the output includes the color red in the corresponding position.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. For instance:

- When ""wif"" (red) comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- When ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" (green) comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

Hence, the rule is:

bluf -> The color of bluf is the same as the color of the word immediately preceding it.
walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" appears to indicate that the following color should be repeated the same number of times as there were unique words before ""walm"" in the sequence.

Rule: 
- ""walm"" is followed by repetitions of the color associated with the word directly preceding it.
- The number of repetitions equals the number of unique words that have appeared in the sequence before ""walm"". 

In the provided examples:
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"": ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and there are four unique words before ""walm"" (""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax""), so the output is four yellows.
- ""lug walm zup"": ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and there's one unique word before ""walm"" (""lug""), so the output is one blue.
- ""dax walm"": ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and there's one unique word before ""walm"" (""dax""), so the output is one green.
- ""zup wif walm"": ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and there are two unique words before ""walm"" (""zup,"" ""wif""), hence there are two reds.
- ""wif walm dax zup"": ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and there's one unique word before ""walm"" (""wif""), so the output is one red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When you see the word ""lug,"" it corresponds to the color blue, irrespective of the context or the words that follow or precede it.
Based on the provided examples, we observe the following:

- ""zup wif dax"" corresponds with ""yellow red green.""
- ""lug dax"" corresponds with ""blue green.""
- ""dax"" on its own corresponds with ""green.""
- ""dax zup dax zup wif"" corresponds with ""green yellow green yellow red.""
- ""lug dax wif lug"" corresponds with ""blue green red blue.""

From this, we can deduce that:

- The word ""dax"" on its own corresponds to the color ""green.""
- It seems like each word has a color associated with it:
  - ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds with ""red.""
  - ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue.""
- The order of the words in the input matches the order of the colors in the outputs.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

dax -> green. Rule: Each word in the input is transformed into a specific color, and the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Here is how the meaning can be deduced from each example:

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- The word ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" which outputs ""red"" before ""blue.""

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red
- Here we see ""lug"" once again, and it is followed by ""blue."" ""Wif"" comes after ""lug"" and is followed by ""red."" ""Zup"" seems to translate to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" continues to be followed by ""red."" ""Walm"" stands for three reds, as evidenced by the triple repetition of ""red"" at the end.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- The pattern is consistent with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" translating to ""red.""

Input: wif
Output: red
- On its own, ""wif"" translates directly to ""red,"" confirming it represents a single color.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""Wif"" is followed by ""red"" and ""walm"" seems to be associated with two additional reds, reinforcing that ""wif"" is red and ""walm"" amplifies that with additional reds.

Based on the output of all examples, the consistent rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is:

Rule: ""wif"" -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Analyzing the examples provided:

Input: zup wif zup dax
Output: yellow red yellow green

Input: lug zup dax zup
Output: blue yellow green yellow

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow

In each instance where the word ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of ""zup"" in the given context is the color yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" represents the color that was most recently mentioned before it. Following the pattern, when the word ""bluf"" appears, we replace it with the last color word that came before it. If ""bluf"" appears as the first word, it defaults to being interpreted as ""blue."" Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""lug bluf wif"", ""lug"" represents ""blue,"" and so ""bluf"" following it also maps to ""blue."" ""wif"" then is red.
- In the second example, ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" takes the color previously mentioned which is ""yellow."" Later, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" so the last ""lug"" retains its ""blue"" color.
- In the third example, ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" represents ""green,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which also becomes ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" the pattern continues with ""lug"" as ""blue,"" ""wif"" as ""red,"" and ""dax"" as ""green."" Since ""dax"" is the most recent color word before ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" we follow the same pattern. ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" so the following ""bluf"" represents ""yellow."" Then ""dax"" is ""green,"" followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue."" Then again ""bluf"" which takes the color of the most recently mentioned color word which is ""blue,"" followed by ""dax"" as ""green,"" and ending with ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> the color denoted by the last mentioned color word prior to ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is the first word, it means ""blue.""
Given the examples above, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of colors based on the previous word.

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green
Here, we see ""walm"" following ""dax,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, which is then repeated thrice.

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and we see ""blue"" repeated thrice.

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
Again, ""walm"" is used after ""dax,"" and green is repeated thrice.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and blue is repeated thrice.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
In this example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and we see yellow repeated thrice.

Based on these examples, the following rule for ""walm"" can be deduced:

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

For instance, if 'lug' precedes 'walm', and 'lug' is associated with blue, then 'walm' would translate to ""blue blue blue"". If 'dax' precedes 'walm', and 'dax' is associated with green, then 'walm' translates to ""green green green"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules:

- Each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output.
- The word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color 'blue'.
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'bluf' corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.

Applying this pattern across all examples provided, we can conclude:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Additional inputs such as ""zup"" and ""lug"" correspond to other colors (""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively). The rule can be written as:

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" means the color green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In each instance where ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red.""

Here is the evidence from the examples that supports this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes the output ""red.""
- In the second example, inputting ""wif"" alone results in the output ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is the fourth word in the sequence and corresponds to the fourth color ""red"" in the output sequence.
- In the fourth example, when ""wif"" is second in sequence, the second color in the output is ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is consistently giving the output ""red"" every time it appears.

So the rule seems to be:

wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, bluf seems to translate to the color that is mentioned right before it. Here is the observed pattern and the corresponding rule:

- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" translates to blue, so bluf also translates to blue.
- In ""wif lug bluf wif zup,"" ""lug"" before bluf translates to blue, so bluf translates to blue.
- In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" before bluf translates to yellow, so bluf translates to yellow.
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""dax"" before bluf translates to green, so bluf translates to green.
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" before bluf translates to green, so bluf translates to green.

Rule: bluf translates to the color word preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" we need to look at the pattern in which it appears and the corresponding output colors.

Here's the analysis of the given input-output examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""wif"" correlates to a single ""red,"" followed by ""walm"" which correlates to two additional ""red"" outputs and then ""zup walm"" corresponds to three ""yellow"" outputs.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" ""wif"" again to ""red,"" followed by ""walm"" which again correlates to two additional ""red"" outputs. ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and the ""zup walm"" sequence again results in three ""yellow"" outputs. 

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
   ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" once again results in a sequence of three ""red"" outputs.

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
   ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" ""wif walm"" sequence again correlates to three ""red"" outputs, and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   
   Each instance of ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color output of the word before it: ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and ""dax zup"" then ""dax wif"" sequence correlates to ""green yellow green red"".

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to replicate the color output of the previous word, generating the same color again. If ""walm"" immediately follows ""zup,"" it generates two additional ""yellow"" outputs.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" replicates the color output associated with the word that comes immediately before it. If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it generates two additional ""yellow"" outputs after the initial ""yellow"" associated with ""zup"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

(Rule: ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" corresponding to ""green"" following ""red"" in the output, and ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the previous color twice)

Rule: dax -> green
Reviewing the given examples, we can derive the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by examining the patterns relating the inputs and the outputs:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""walm"" results in a sequence of ""yellow yellow yellow"", and we see that ""wif"" is directly followed by ""red"".

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Analysis: Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" to a sequence of ""red red red"", and ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   Analysis: Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" seems to have changed to ""blue blue blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and then again ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".

4. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", followed by ""wif"" and ""red"".

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", followed by ""wif"" and ""red"".

Combining the observations from all the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is linked with the color ""red"". It doesn't seem to cause a transformation or change in the preceding or following words. Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. The meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as the color ""yellow.""

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates directly to the color that is listed before it. Here's the reasoning:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow."" In another instance in the same input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green.""
- In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red.""
- In the third input, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows both ""wif"" and ""lug"" in different instances, resulting in ""red red"" and ""blue blue"" respectively.
- The fifth input consists of only ""dax bluf,"" and the output is ""green green.""

So the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the output for ""walm"" changes depending on the surrounding or preceding words. To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each example:

1. ""wif dax lug walm"" produces ""red green blue blue blue."" We can see that ""walm"" generates three ""blue"" in a row, following the sequence of colors in reverse order as they appear in the input before ""walm"" (red, green, blue).

2. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" produces ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and mirrors the colors before it (blue, red) backward twice and adds an extra ""red.""

3. ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red."" The output for ""walm"" is ""red"" repeated thrice, following the colors before ""walm"" (yellow, red) in reverse order.

4. ""zup walm dax"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Here, ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup,"" three times before moving to the next color, which is ""green"" for ""dax.""

5. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" produces ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" The output for ""walm"" is ""yellow"" repeated thrice, just like the color associated with ""zup"" before it. It seems to ignore other previous colors in this case.

Taking these observations into account, we can infer a general rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times in the output.

Therefore, we can write:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the given context.
Based on the presented examples, we can induce a pattern for the nonce word ""dax"" and what it represents. Let's analyze the examples provided:

1. When ""dax"" is used in ""dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""green red red."" ""Wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" to ""red"" in other examples, so ""dax"" likely corresponds to ""green"" here.

2. In ""zup wif dax walm,"" the output is ""yellow red green green green."" We already know from previous examples that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""Walm"" is likely ""green green green"" since it is a new word we haven't seen yet. Hence, ""dax"" is ""green"" again.

3. ""Zup lug zup dax"" produces ""yellow blue yellow green."" From previous examples, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Since ""dax"" is the only new word, it corresponds to ""green.""

4. For ""dax lug wif,"" the output is ""green blue red."" We know ""lug"" to be ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to be ""red,"" so ""dax"" must be ""green"" as in the previous patterns.

5. Finally, ""lug dax zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""blue green yellow green red."" With ""lug"" as ""blue,"" ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" as ""red,"" the two instances of ""dax"" produce ""green.""

From these examples, it is possible to infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples:

Input: lug dax lug wif -> Output: blue green blue red
Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
Input: zup wif zup -> Output: yellow red yellow
Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red

It appears that each word in the input corresponds to a certain color in the output.  
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""bluf"" corresponds to red
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow

Regardless of the position or context, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" 

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we'll compare the inputs and outputs to find any consistent patterns.

Here are the given examples:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

3. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

4. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue

Looking at the outputs, we notice that whenever ""zup"" is present, the color ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. Additionally, the position of ""yellow"" in the output corresponds to the position of ""zup"" in the input:

1. ""zup"" is the second word; ""yellow"" is the second color.
2. ""zup"" is the second word; ""yellow"" is the second color.
3. ""zup"" is the fifth word; ""yellow"" is the fifth color.
4. ""zup"" is the first word; ""yellow"" is the first color.
5. ""zup"" is the fourth word; ""yellow"" is the fourth color.

Also, ""zup"" does not seem to affect the translation of other words around it, which retain their respective color outputs (""dax"" consistently leads to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and so on).

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" with the position of ""zup"" in the input mirrored by the position of ""yellow"" in the output.
Examining the input-output pairs, it seems that ""bluf"" translates into a repeating color based on the color immediately preceding it. Let's look at each example in more detail:

1. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   Here, the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"". The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" as well, which is the same as the color before it.

2. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   In this case, ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and the following ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"".

3. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", and so does ""bluf"".

4. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   The color before ""bluf"" is ""red"", and the word ""bluf"" itself corresponds to ""red"" again.

5. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"".

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> The same color as the word immediately before it.
Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word, three times. 

For instance:
- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, so ""walm"" here means ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, so the first ""walm"" after ""dax"" means ""green green green"". Later, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so the ""walm"" following ""lug dax"" means ""green green green"" again because ""dax"" was the last color before ""walm"".
- In ""zup wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, so ""walm"" means ""red red red"".
- In ""zup dax walm zup wif"", ""dax"" is the word preceding the first ""walm"", which corresponds to green, hence ""walm"" here means ""green green green"". In ""wif"", which corresponds to red, ""walm"" is not present, so there's no repetition.
- In ""zup wif walm lug"", ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to red, so ""walm"" means ""red red red"". There is no repetition for ""lug"" since ""walm"" does not follow it directly.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax lug
    ",Output: red yellow green blue,red yellow green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in each instance it appears. The context of other words (""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""walm"") influences the number of colors that appear or their order, but ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" each time it is present.
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"". Observing the outputs that correspond with the presence of ""dax"" in the inputs, we can find a pattern:

Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" (second word in both input and output)
- ""walm"" is not directly followed by ""blue"" in the Output. However, we can see that ""walm"" might represent multiple ""blue"" since it follows a ""lug"" which we know is ""blue"".

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (the first and fourth words in both input and output)
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" within the sequence (fourth word in the input, fifth in the output)
- ""wif"" might be ""red"" (coming before ""dax"" which has been green in every output)

Input: dax -> Output: green
- ""dax"" stands alone here and corresponds to ""green""

Input: lug dax wif lug -> Output: blue green red blue
- ""lug"" is confirmed again as ""blue""
- ""wif"" again appears to be ""red""

Based on the consistent presence of ""green"" in the output when ""dax"" is in the input, we can deduce:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of 'wif,' let's examine each usage of the word 'wif' and the corresponding output color:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - 'wif' corresponds to the first 'red.'

2. Input: zup dax zup wif
   Output: yellow green yellow red
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red.'

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - 'wif' corresponds to the first 'red.'

4. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red.'

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   - The first 'wif' corresponds to the first 'red' and the second 'wif' to the second 'red.'

In every instance, the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red.' So the rule for the nonce word 'wif' is consistently resulting in the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow"". Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears an equivalent number of times in the output. However, in the last example, ""dax zup bluf"", ""zup"" is followed by two instances of ""yellow"" in the output, which seems to break the pattern.

Here are the observations from the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" is at a different position and still corresponds to ""yellow"" and also doubles the color following it, which in this case is ""yellow yellow"".
- In the third and fourth examples, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in each instance.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is again followed by ""yellow"", but it also repeats the color ""yellow"" for the word ""bluf."" This suggests that “zup” causes the next word to be repeated twice in the output sequence.

Reviewing the data, the rule seems to be:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" precedes another word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated in the output.

From the last example (""dax zup bluf""), we cannot ascertain the exact meaning of ""bluf"", but we can deduce the behavior of ""zup"" in the sequence. Assuming ""bluf"" means a new color (let's say ""purple"" for argument's sake), ""zup"" would make it output as ""yellow purple purple"".

Rule: zup -> Corresponds to the color ""yellow"" and causes the color that would represent the following word to be repeated once. If zup is the last word, only ""yellow"" is output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it. 

For instance:

- In the first example (wif lug bluf wif zup), ""wif"" corresponds to red, and when ""bluf"" follows it, the output is ""red blue blue red yellow"". The blue presumably comes from ""lug"" and it's doubled by ""bluf"". ""wif"" at the end produces another red.
- In the second example (wif bluf), ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" results in red being repeated.
- In the third example (zup bluf), ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" results in yellow being repeated.
- In the fourth example (dax lug bluf dax), ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""bluf"" doubles the blue, while ""dax"" at the end produces another green.
- Lastly, in the fifth example (dax wif bluf), ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" repeats the red.

Thus, the rule seems to be: bluf repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the color red in the output when followed by the word ""wif"", but with the color blue when it's followed by other words such as ""lug"" or ""dax"". When ""wif"" is not present, the color repeated in the output corresponds to the color assigned to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Note that when ""wif"" is present and is immediately followed by ""walm"", both words correspond to red in the output.

Let's examine the examples more closely:

1. Input: ""wif walm dax zup""
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" also corresponds to red (since it directly follows ""wif""), ""dax"" corresponds to red (perhaps taking the color from the preceding ""walm""), and ""zup"" to green, followed by yellow.

2. Input: ""zup bluf wif walm""
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" to red (since it directly follows ""wif"").

3. Input: ""wif walm dax zup""
   Output: red red red green yellow
   This is a repetition of the first example and the logic is consistent.

4. Input: ""dax lug walm""
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" to blue (since it directly follows ""lug"", it seems to take on the same color).

5. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: green green green
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" also corresponds to green (since it follows ""dax"" it repeats the color).

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it takes on the same color as the output for the word that immediately precedes it, except when it directly follows ""wif"" where ""walm"" always corresponds to red.

Rule: walm -> Takes on the color output of the word directly preceding it, unless following ""wif"", in which case it is always red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each time the word ""lug"" is used in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. 

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the correlation between its position and the color output:

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
- ""dax"" is first and correlates with ""green""
- ""lug"" is second and correlates with ""blue""
- ""wif"" is third and correlates with ""red""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" is first and correlates with ""green""
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and all outputs are ""green""

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and correlates with ""green""
- ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and correlates with ""red""

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""dax"" follows ""lug"" and correlates with the first ""green""
- Since ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and is followed by ""walm,"" the subsequent colors are also ""green""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green""
- Following ""dax,"" ""wif"" and ""walm"" are before ""lug,"" so they both correspond to ""red""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""zup"" is last and correlates with ""yellow""

From the examples, it seems that ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green."" Furthermore, the placement of ""dax"" before another word turns the following outputs to ""green"" until a different color is represented by another word in the sequence, as seen in the third example.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". No matter the context or position in the sequence where ""wif"" appears, the output is the same color, ""red"". So the rule I can deduce is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" is associated with a repetition of the color output from the word just preceding it. To confirm this rule, let's analyze the examples:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red""
   Here, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", and the following ""bluf"" leads to another ""yellow"". After ""wif"" which leads to ""red"", there's no ""bluf"", but ""walm"" leads to two additional ""red"".

2. ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red""
   In this case, ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and ""bluf"" follows it with the same color, ""red"".

3. ""zup bluf dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow green blue""
   Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" followed by ""bluf"" which also corresponds to ""yellow"". The other words follow with their own colors with no ""bluf"" in between.

4. ""wif zup dax bluf"" outputs ""red yellow green green""
   ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""bluf"" copies the color of ""dax"", which is ""green"".

5. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""
   Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", another ""zup"" is ""yellow"", followed by ""bluf"" which repeats the ""yellow"", and a final ""lug"" gives ""blue"".

Bluf -> meaning: Based on the above analysis, ""bluf"" means repetition of the last color named.

Rule: If a word X has an associated color, then ""bluf"" following X will output the same color as X.
Rule: walm -> ""repeat the color associated with the previous word thrice."" 

Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to include three successive instances of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" 

- In the phrase ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and the output after ""walm"" is ""green green green."" 
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and following ""walm"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" 

This pattern continues consistently across all examples provided.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug bluf wif
    ",Output: green blue blue red,green blue blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the presented examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. There is no variation in the output in response to ""lug,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. 

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule:
- dax -> green

The evidence for this rule is that each time the word ""dax"" is presented in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the exact same position in the output. This consistency across different examples suggests that the meaning of ""dax"" is invariably associated with the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Hence, the rule in this context is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
According to the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the value of the color word preceding it. If there is no color word before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" resolves to blue by default. Let's check this hypothesis against each given example:

- Example 1: ""dax lug bluf"" -> ""green blue blue"". ""Lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" repeats this color.
- Example 2: ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow"". ""Wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" repeats this color.
- Example 3: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red"". The ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats this color.
- Example 4: ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats this color.
- Example 5: ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green"". ""Dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" repeats this color.

This rule seems consistent with all the given examples.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding color word, or defaults to blue if no color word precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the patterns to infer the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm.""

In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of three colors associated with the word preceding ""walm."" Let's look at each example:

1. ""dax walm wif walm"" outputs ""green green green red red red"":
   - ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""walm"" following it results in ""green"" being repeated three times.
   - Similarly, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and ""walm"" following it results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

2. ""dax walm lug"" outputs ""green green green blue"":
   - ""dax"" before ""walm"" leads to three ""green,"" consistent with the first example.
   - ""lug"" is a new word without ""walm"" after it, and it is associated directly with ""blue.""

3. ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"":
   - ""wif"" before ""walm"" leads to three ""red,"" which is also consistent with prior instances.

4. ""dax walm wif dax"" outputs ""green green green red green"":
   - ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and as before, results in three ""green.""
   - After ""walm,"" ""wif"" is not followed by ""walm,"" so it results in a single ""red.""
   - The final ""dax"" is also not followed by ""walm,"" so it only contributes a single ""green.""

5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" outputs ""red red green green green"":
   - ""wif"" starts the output with a single ""red"" because it's not followed by ""walm.""
   - ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""wif"" with no output associated, suggesting ""bluf"" might not contribute to the color sequence or that its rule is not defined by these examples.
   - ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in three ""green,"" maintaining the rule consistency.

From this analysis, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. 

Rule: walm -> When preceded by a word, output the color associated with that word three times. If ""walm"" immediately follows a word, it indicates a repeating pattern, where the associated color is stated three consecutive times. If there is no ""walm"" after a word, only one color associated with that preceding word is given in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word ""lug"":

1. When ""lug"" is present alongside ""wif,"" the output always includes ""red blue,"" regardless of other words. This occurs in the first, fourth, and fifth examples.

2. In the second example, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow red red blue."" We can see a direct correlation between ""lug"" and ""blue"" at the end of the sequence. Also, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""bluf"" doesn't appear in other examples, it might be similar to ""blue"" and thus also outputs ""red,"" which could explain the duplicate ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""lug dax lug"" corresponds to ""blue green blue."" Here, ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" both times it appears, and ""dax"" to ""green.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""lug"":

Rule: ""lug"" -> ""blue""

The rule seems to be consistent, as ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" in every instance in the provided output.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" immediately follows ""lug"", producing ""green"".

Input: dax -> Output: green
- ""dax"" on its own produces ""green"".

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug -> Output: green green red yellow blue
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", ""bluf"" with ""green"", ""wif"" with ""red"", ""zup"" with ""yellow"", and ""lug"" with ""blue"".

Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""lug"" with ""blue"".

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", ""wif"" with ""red"", ""dax"" with ""green"", ""bluf"" with ""green"", ""wif"" with ""red"", and ""lug"" with ""blue"".

From these examples, ""dax"" consistently produces ""green"", no matter its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Analyzing the given examples:

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: zup lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow blue yellow red green

The rule seems to be fairly straightforward. Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow"" in all given examples. Whenever ""zup"" appears as input, ""yellow"" is produced as output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to reflect the color that is mentioned before it. When ""bluf"" is used, the color mentioned immediately before it is repeated in the output. Here is the interpretation of ""bluf"" from the examples:

1. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" (bluf repeats the color ""blue"")
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (bluf repeats the color ""red"")
3. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red green green red"" (bluf repeats ""green"" because it follows ""dax,"" which outputs ""green"")
4. ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""red red yellow yellow red"" (bluf repeats ""red,"" then ""yellow,"" following ""wif"" and ""zup"" respectively)
5. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"" (bluf repeats ""red"" after ""wif"")

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color mentioned immediately before it.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in repeating the color output of the word that directly precedes ""walm,"" three times. Here is the breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   Rule: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". ""green"" is then repeated three times.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". ""green"" is then repeated three times.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Rule: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". ""green"" is then repeated three times.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Rule: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"". ""red"" is then repeated three times.

5. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Rule: ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"". ""blue"" is then repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug zup lug
    ",Output: blue green blue yellow blue,blue green blue yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is included at the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that 'dax' is consistently resulting in the output 'green'. There are no instances where 'dax' has led to a different output, regardless of the combination of other words it is used with.

So, the meaning of the nonce word 'dax' can be deduced as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever 'dax' appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'green'.
Observing the examples given, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Here's the analysis to derive the rule:

- Example 1: ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red""
  Here, ""zup"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""yellow"" each, and ""wif"" at the end corresponds to ""red.""
  
- Example 2: ""wif dax zup"" -> ""red green yellow""
  ""wif"" at the beginning translates to ""red,"" and the subsequent words ""dax"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

- Example 3: ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
  The word ""wif"" appears once and translates to ""red,"" same as ""walm,"" which also translates to ""red"" each time.

- Example 4: ""wif lug bluf"" -> ""red blue blue""
  ""wif"" at the beginning translates to ""red,"" followed by ""lug"" and ""bluf"" translating to ""blue.""

- Example 5: ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> ""red red green blue""
  The first word ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" followed by ""bluf"" which translates again to ""red,"" then ""dax"" to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""bluf,"" let's look at each input and corresponding output:

1. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""bluf"" follows both of these words, it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word it follows.

2. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats ""blue,"" consistent with the initial observation.

3. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and repeats ""green.""

4. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and repeats ""green.""

5. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and repeats ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, we can see that the word 'walm' correlates with a series of colors, specifically a repetition of the color that directly precedes it. 

For example:

- In the first input, 'walm' is preceded by 'lug' which corresponds to 'blue,' and the output for 'walm' is 'blue blue.'
- In the second input, 'walm' follows 'zup' which corresponds to 'yellow,' and the output for 'walm' is 'yellow yellow.'
- In the third input, 'walm' follows 'wif' which corresponds to 'red,' and the output for 'walm' is 'red red.'
- In the fourth input, 'walm' follows 'lug' again, meaning 'blue,' and the output is 'blue blue.'
- In the fifth input, 'walm' follows 'dax' which corresponds to 'green,' and the output for 'walm' is 'green green.'

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif
    ",Output: red blue red,red blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the term ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can induce that the rule is simply a direct association between the nonce word ""lug"" and the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, each input word appears to correlate with a specific color in the output. Here's the pattern observed from the examples:

""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Given that the word ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green"" no matter its position in the sequence, we can deduce the rule for ""dax"":

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a particular color. The consistent appearance of the word ""wif"" in each input corresponds to the color ""red"" in each output. No other information in the examples suggests that the meaning of ""wif"" changes depending on context or position. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is simply that it corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule I induce from these examples is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we notice that the word ""bluf"" translates differently depending on the word that comes right before it. Let's examine this further:

1. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"", and the output is ""blue"".

2. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", and the output is ""yellow"".

3. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", and the output is ""yellow"".

4. dax bluf wif -> green green red
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"", and the output is ""green"".

5. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", and the output is ""yellow"".

From these examples, it seems the word ""bluf"" translates to the color corresponding to the word that comes right before it.

Rule: bluf means the same color as the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's correlate the instances of ""walm"" with their respective outputs.

1. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to triple ""red""
   - First ""walm"" corresponds to double ""yellow""
   - Second ""zup"" after ""lug"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - Second ""walm"" in the sequence corresponds to double ""yellow""

2. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to triple ""red""
   - ""walm"" here precedes ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green""

3. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to triple ""red""
   - ""walm"" here has no direct output associated with it, but if it's following the same rule, it isn't affecting the output

4. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" here again follows ""dax"" and the output is triple ""green""

5. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to double ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and there is no change in color, still ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" does not seem to have a consistent output when it stands alone. However, we can establish a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word preceding it. When it follows ""zup,"" an output of double ""yellow"" is observed; when it follows ""dax,"" an output of ""green"" is observed. When ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, it continues the color pattern.

- In the first input, since ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" the following ""walm"" repeats the color.
- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the next color is green, indicating that ""dax"" might be defining that color.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and maintains the green color.

Given the provided examples, a possible meaning for ""walm"" could be as a rule-based word that requires one to repeat the color of the previous word, or to continue the established color pattern.

walm -> meaning: Repetition of the color output of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"". This is evident when lug appears in various positions within the input sequences:

- lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
- dax lug zup -> green blue yellow
- zup lug -> yellow blue
- wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
- wif dax wif lug wif -> red green red blue red

In each instance, lug corresponds to the color blue in the output, regardless of its position or the other words surrounding it.

Rule: lug -> blue
Using the provided examples, I will try to deduce the rule for what the nonce word ""dax"" means. By comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to see patterns associated with the word ""dax.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and both are translated as ""green.""

Input: zup dax zup lug
Output: yellow green yellow blue
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to blue. Notice that ""dax"" remains as ""green"" regardless of its position.

Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" still to ""green.""

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" remains ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue
- Again, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" remains ""green,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

From these examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule can be identified as:

Rule: dax -> green
Considering the examples provided:

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Input: wif zup lug zup lug
Output: red yellow blue yellow blue

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Based on these examples, ""wif"" seems to always correspond to the color red in the output. No matter what the context is or which words surround ""wif,"" its presence consistently results in the word ""red"" in the output sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that different nonce words (such as ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"") are consistently mapped to specific colors in the output. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here is the mapping from the input words to the output colors based on the examples:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the word that precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red."" There isn't an example with ""bluf"" following ""lug,"" but it seems reasonable to hypothesize that if it did, the output might be ""blue,"" following the pattern. So, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs that contain ""walm"" with their corresponding outputs while considering the variation in other words in the input. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
3. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
4. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Comparing the inputs and outputs, we notice that the appearance of ""walm"" consistently results in three repetitions of a color in the output. This color appears to be determined by the word that directly precedes ""walm"" in the input:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is three greens.
- Looking at the other inputs, other words such as ""wif"" and ""zup,"" do not demonstrate this pattern of three repeated colors; instead, they generate a single output color correlated with their presence (e.g., ""wif"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow).

Given this information, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

walm -> meaning: Replicates the color implied by the preceding word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is three instances of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: yellow green blue green,yellow green blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue, irrespective of its position or the context in which it is used.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following occurrences of ""wif"" and the respective outputs to deduce what it stands for:

1. ""dax bluf wif"" outputs ""green green red""
2. ""wif"" on its own outputs ""red""
3. ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green""
4. ""dax wif"" outputs ""green red""
5. ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red""

Comparing these outputs, it seems that the presence of ""wif"" always results in ""red"" in the corresponding position:

- In example 1, ""wif"" is the third word and the third color is red.
- In example 2, ""wif"" is the only word and the only color is red.
- In example 3, ""wif"" is the first word and the first color is red.
- In example 4, ""wif"" is the second word and the second color is red.
- In example 5, ""wif"" is the second word and the second color is red.

Given this pattern, we can induce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Here is the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to translate to ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the same position in the output.

Here are the correlations:

- In the first example, ""wif lug zup"" translates to ""red blue yellow."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""lug dax zup wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red."" ""Zup"" is the first word and translates to ""yellow.""
- The fourth example, ""zup wif lug,"" gives ""yellow red blue."" Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup,"" the translation is ""red red blue yellow,"" where ""zup"" is the last word and corresponds to ""yellow.""

The consistent correlation allows us to establish the rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""red,"" except when ""bluf"" directly follows the word ""lug,"" in which case ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue.""

Let's analyze the examples:

1. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
2. lug bluf -> blue blue
3. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
4. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
5. wif bluf -> red red

In the first, third, and fifth examples, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it does not directly follow ""lug."" In the second and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" when alone or not preceded by ""lug""; ""blue"" when directly preceded by ""lug"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs.

- For every instance of ""walm"" in the input, there are multiple ""blue"" in the corresponding output.
- The number of ""blue"" following ""walm"" seems to depend on the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input.

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

1. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   ""Walm"" is preceded by one word (""lug""), followed by three ""blue.""

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   ""Walm"" is preceded by one word (""wif""), followed by three ""blue.""

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" is preceded by three words (""wif dax lug""), followed by three ""blue.""

4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" is preceded by four words (""lug wif dax zup""), followed by three ""blue.""

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" is preceded by two words (""dax lug""), followed by three ""blue.""

From the examples, it's clear that ""walm"" is associated with the word ""blue"" appearing three times, regardless of how many words precede ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means three blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it is clear that ""lug"" corresponds to a specific color each time it is used. In every example, ""lug"" appears to directly translate to the color ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following correlations:

- Every single instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"".
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue"" when it appears after ""dax"", but it is ""red"" when ""bluf"" is adjacent to ""wif"".
- The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"".
- The output for ""wif"" is ""red"", as seen in the second input.
- The output for ""lug"" is ""blue"", as seen in the last input.
- The output for ""walm"" is ""yellow"", just like ""zup"".

Given these patterns, it is reasonable to induce the following rule:

Rule: dax always corresponds to the color ""green"".
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's look at each input and the corresponding output:

1. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
2. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""
3. ""wif dax zup dax"" -> ""red green yellow green""
4. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
5. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""

We can notice a consistent pattern where ""wif"" precedes a particular color in the output, which changes based on the word following ""wif.""

1. In the first example, ""wif dax"" is followed by ""red green.""
2. In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red.""
3. In the third example, ""wif dax"" is followed by ""red green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" is followed by ""red red.""
5. In the fifth example, ""wif dax"" gives us ""red green.""

Based on the examples, ""wif"" seems to change the color of the word that follows it. However, it appears to change it to a specific color each time:

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""red green,"" suggesting ""wif"" turns ""dax"" into red.
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""red red,"" suggesting ""wif"" turns ""walm"" into red.

The general rule derived from this pattern would then be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> changes the following word's color output to red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" appears, the word ""green"" is subsequently listed in the output, regardless of the other words' associated colors. Here's a breakdown of each example:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" which indicates that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow,"" suggesting that ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" in addition to ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both meaning ""green.""
- The third example reconfirms the meanings of ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" with ""bluf"" still consistently translating to ""green.""
- The fourth example introduces ""lug"" as ""blue"" and ""walm,"" which also appears to mean ""blue."" However, ""bluf"" still translates to ""green.""
- The final example with just ""lug bluf"" confirms ""lug"" as ""blue"" and maintains ""bluf"" as ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> green.
Observing the examples and the corresponding outputs provided, we can attempt to infer the meaning or rule that the nonce word ""walm"" is expressing in these instances.

Looking at the first example:
- ""zup walm lug"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
Here, ""zup"" and ""walm"" both produce ""yellow"" while ""lug"" results in ""blue"".

In the second example:
- ""zup wif dax walm"" produces ""yellow red green green green""
Here, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", ""wif"" results in ""red"", ""dax"" results in ""green"", and ""walm"" produces two additional ""green"".

In the third example:
- ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green""
This suggests that ""dax"" produces a ""green"" and ""walm"" produces two additional ""green"".

In the fourth example:
- ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow""
We have ""wif"" resulting in ""red"", ""dax"" resulting in ""green"", ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow"", and ""walm"" seems to be associated with ""red"" because it adds two more ""red"" to the output.

In the fifth example:
- ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red""
We observe ""zup"" producing ""yellow"", ""wif"" producing ""red"", and ""walm"" adds two more ""red"".

From these observations, we can deduce a potential meaning or rule for ""walm"". ""Walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it two more times. Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the output color of the preceding word two more times.

So, ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color given for the previous word. If the preceding word results in ""yellow"", ""walm"" makes it ""yellow yellow"". If the preceding word results in ""red"", ""walm"" makes it ""red red"". If the preceding word results in ""green"", ""walm"" adds ""green green"" to the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the given input-output pairs.

- When ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" always appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The presence of ""dax"" doesn't seem to affect the colors associated with the other non-dax words. For example, ""zup"" is consistently associated with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red,"" regardless of whether ""dax"" is present or not.
- There are no examples where ""dax"" appears alongside a color other than ""green"" in the output.

Based on the above observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> ""green"" (Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, it corresponds to ""green"" in the output.)
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples given:

Input: wif
Output: red

Both times ""wif"" is used as a single input, the output is ""red."" This suggests a direct correlation between ""wif"" and ""red."" However, when ""wif"" is included in a sequence with other words, we notice that ""wif"" corresponds specifically to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

In this example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""lug"" and the outputs are ""red red red"" for ""wif walm lug,"" respectively. ""dax"" outputs to ""green"" and we do not have enough information to definitely correlate ""zup"" and ""walm."" However, it is interesting to note that the output for ""walm"" is the same (""yellow"") both times it appears in the sequence.

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red

In this case, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" consistently with our observation so far.

Based on this, we can infer the following pattern:

""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore, our rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Regardless of its position in the sequence, it translates to the same color each time. Thus, it seems that ""zup"" is independent of context and its meaning is fixed.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color output each time it is mentioned. To deduce the rule, look at the word that precedes ""bluf"" and the color it corresponds to:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green blue"", so it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" when it follows ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- In the second and third examples, ""lug bluf"" also translates to ""blue blue,"" which confirms ""bluf"" as ""blue"" when it follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, the sequence ""lug bluf dax bluf"" translates to ""blue blue green green,"" which further supports ""bluf"" as ""blue"" following both ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green).
- The fifth example of ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" translating to ""green green yellow yellow green"" indicates consistency with ""bluf"" being translated as ""green"" following ""dax"" and ""yellow"" following ""zup.""

In all examples, regardless of the word that precedes it, ""bluf"" is consistently associated with the color ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> blue. The meaning of ""bluf"" is consistently the color ""blue"" in these examples.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" is probably directly correlated with the repeated color in the output. Let's examine the frequencies of the colors in the output corresponding to the presence of ""walm"" in the input:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
2. Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
3. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
4. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
5. Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue

In each case, ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that appears immediately before ""walm"":

1. ""dax"" before ""walm"" -> green is repeated three times.
2. ""wif"" before ""walm"" -> red is repeated three times.
3. ""lug"" before ""walm"" -> blue is repeated three times.

In examples where ""walm"" does not immediately follow another word (i.e., it is the last or only word), the color associated with the word right before ""walm"" is repeated three times:

4. ""dax"" is the last word before ""walm"" -> green is repeated three times.
5. ""lug"" is the last word before ""walm"" -> blue is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times. If there is no color associated with ""walm"", it repeats the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the input to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that ""lug"" translates to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a direct correlation between the nonce word ""dax"" and the color that it translates to in the output.

For each example, let's plot this out:

- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow"": Here, ""dax"" appears third in the input and corresponds to ""green"" which is the fourth color.
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" -> ""green yellow blue red blue"": ""dax"" is the first word and translates to ""green"" which is the first color.
- ""wif dax zup dax"" -> ""red green yellow green"": ""dax"" is second and fourth in the input, matching with ""green,"" which is second and fourth in the output.
- ""zup dax lug zup"" -> ""yellow green blue yellow"": ""dax"" is second in the input and ""green"" is second in the output.
- ""dax"" -> ""green"": ""dax"" stands alone here and the output is ""green"".

From these examples, every appearance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" acts as a delimiter or separator between different sets of words, where each unique word before ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color, and each unique word after ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. The word ""wif"" itself does not correspond to a color, but instead it marks the transition point where the color mapping changes to red for the subsequent words. 

Let's analyse each example:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""dax"" maps to ""green""
   - ""wif"" introduces the following words
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" maps consistently to ""red""
   
2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" introduces the following words
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" maps consistently to ""red""

3. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" introduces the following words
   - ""bluf"" after ""wif"" maps to ""red""
   - ""zup"" is repeated after ""wif,"" but it reverts to its original color mapping of ""yellow"" since it was before ""wif""

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" introduces the following words
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" maps to ""red""
   - ""lug,"" a new word after ""wif,"" maps to ""blue""

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" introduces the following words
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" maps to ""red""

Considering ""lug"" in Example 4 produces ""blue"" when it appears after ""wif,"" it's safe to conclude that there's an error, as all the other examples suggest that any word following ""wif"" should map to red. The consistent exception is when a word that appeared before ""wif"" is repeated after ""wif""; in such a case, the word retains its original color (as seen in example 3 with ""zup""). However, this is not applicable for ""lug"" in Example 4 because ""lug"" does not appear before ""wif.""

Given that there's a likely error in Example 4 with the word ""lug,"" and assuming all other mappings are correct, the rule appears to be:
- Words before ""wif"" have specific color associations.
- ""Wif"" serves as a transition point.
- Words after ""wif"" are mapped to ""red,"" with the exception of repeated words from before ""wif,"" which retain their original color.

Rule: wif -> Marks the transition between unique word color assignments and a consistent mapping of the color red for all unique words that follow, except when a preceding word is repeated, which retains its original color mapping.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following color associations for each word:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow."" Therefore:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, regardless of its position within the input sequence.
Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" However, when ""bluf"" is directly preceded by ""wif,"" the output color changes to ""red."" It seems that the presence of ""wif"" right before ""bluf"" alters the usual output. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is red.
If ""bluf"" appears without ""wif"" directly before it, the output is yellow.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""yellow"" unless preceded by ""wif,"" in which case -> ""red"".
From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in the Output. Each color is repeated three times. Here's the breakdown based on the examples given:

1. ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue"" (lug -> blue, walm repeats the color ""blue"" three times)
2. ""zup walm wif"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red"" (zup -> yellow, walm -> yellow repeated three times, wif -> red)
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: ""red red red green yellow"" (wif -> red, walm -> red repeated three times, dax -> green, zup -> yellow)
4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow red red red"" (zup -> yellow, bluf -> unknown but not relevant for walm, wif -> red, walm -> red repeated three times)
5. ""wif dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""red green blue blue blue"" (wif -> red, dax -> green, lug -> blue, walm -> blue repeated three times)

Rule:
walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each instance it is used. Regardless of the other words in the sequence, when ""wif"" appears, the output consistently includes ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word preceding it. Here are how the rules apply in each case:

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red
Rule Application: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" takes on the value of blue before it changes to red due to ""wif.""

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green
Rule Application: ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" takes on the value of green.

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
Rule Application: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" takes on the value of blue.

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
Rule Application: ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" takes on the value of green.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Rule Application: ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" takes on the value of red.

Rule: bluf -> takes the same color value as the word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each input and its corresponding output to identify patterns:

1. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" - Here, ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" results in two additional ""blue"" words, it suggests that ""walm"" might mean repeating the color given by the previous word two more times.

2. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"" - Following the pattern observed, ""dax"" gives ""green,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the ""blue"" two more times.

3. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red"" - ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two times, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" gives another ""red"".

4. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow"" - Here, the word ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" which gives ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in repeating ""red"" two more times, conforming to the pattern we have observed so far. ""lug"" again translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

5. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"" - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" results in two more ""yellow"" words following it, consistent with the pattern.

Based on these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" results in the duplication of the color word that immediately precedes it two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. This suggests that ""lug"" is a stand-alone term with a specific meaning, rather than a context-dependent one. No other words in the input are consistently associated with the same output whenever ""lug"" is present. Therefore, the rule can be inferred as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green every time it is mentioned. Thus, the rule is:

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" appears to consistently translate to the color ""red"" in all given examples. No matter the context or position in the input, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" directly corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every instance of ""zup"" in the input translates to ""yellow"" in the output. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when preceded by the word ""zup"", to the color ""green"" when following the word ""dax"", and to the color ""red"" when either preceding or following the word ""wif.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" is conditional on its context within a sequence of words. It changes according to the word it is paired with. 

Rule: 
- If ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" it means ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" it means ""green.""
- If ""bluf"" comes before or after ""wif,"" it means ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the following word. Examining the examples:

1. dax walm wif zup translates to green green green red yellow, where ""dax"" means green and after ""walm"" it is repeated three times.
2. lug walm dax wif lug wif translates to blue blue blue green red blue red, where ""lug"" means blue and after ""walm"" it is repeated three times, and then ""dax"" means green, which is not repeated since ""walm"" doesn't precede it here.
3. dax walm translates to green green green, again showing that ""dax"" means green and is repeated three times.
4. zup dax walm zup wif translates to yellow green green green yellow red, where ""zup"" means yellow and ""dax"" means green. ""Dax"" follows ""walm"" and is therefore repeated three times.
5. wif walm dax translates to red red red green, where ""wif"" means red and following ""walm,"" it's repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the following word to be repeated three times

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

    Input: wif zup walm
    ",Output: red yellow yellow yellow,red yellow yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in each input corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each input word (except ""wif"") has a corresponding color in the output:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

The word ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of where it appears in the input sequence. Therefore, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's focus on the occurrence of ""bluf"" in the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue blue""

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red red
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red""

3. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to a single ""yellow""

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""bluf"" followed by ""red""

5. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   - ""bluf"" followed by ""blue blue""

The consistent pattern here is the appearance of ""bluf"" in the input always corresponds to the duplication of the color indicated immediately after ""bluf"" in the output sequence. For instance, where we have ""bluf lug,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" and for ""bluf wif"" it is ""red red.""

Therefore, the rule for the word ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The non-bluf word following ""bluf"" is duplicated twice more in the color sequence in the output. It indicates the following word should be repeated twice more in the color output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the context in which it appears and its corresponding outputs.

1. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
2. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
3. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
4. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
5. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red

Analysing the outputs in relation to the appearance of ""walm,"" we notice the following patterns:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, a color is repeated in the output. Specifically, the color that corresponds to the input word that immediately precedes ""walm"" is repeated.
- The number of repetitions aligns with the order in which ""walm"" appears. For the first appearance of ""walm"", the previous color is repeated three times. For the second appearance of ""walm,"" the previous color is repeated three additional times to the already existing one, totaling six.

Let's verify this with the examples:

1. lug (blue) wif (red) walm -> blue red red red
2. zup (yellow) walm dax (green) lug (blue) -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
3. wif (red) bluf (red) dax (green) walm -> red red green green green
4. dax (green) walm zup (yellow) walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
5. lug (blue) dax (green) zup (yellow) dax (green) walm wif (red) -> blue green yellow green green green red

From this analysis, it appears that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the previous word for as many times as ""walm"" has appeared so far.

Rule: walm -> Triggers a repetition of the previous color. On its first appearance, this color repeats three times. If ""walm"" occurs again, the repetition extends by three additional instances for each subsequent ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is used, the output always includes the color ""blue,"" regardless of the presence of other words.
To induce the meaning or rule for ""dax"" from the given examples, let's first list each instance of the word ""dax"" and its corresponding output:

1. dax -> green
2. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
3. dax lug zup dax -> green blue yellow green
4. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
5. dax -> green
6. dax lug -> green blue

Let's analyze the output colors and their corresponding words:

- ""dax"" alone always maps to ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" ""lug,"" or ""walm,"" the word following ""dax"" corresponds to a new color:
  - ""dax zup"" -> green yellow
  - ""dax lug"" -> green blue
  - ""dax walm"" within a sequence leads to ""green"" followed by varying colors, but does not directly map to a single color thereafter.

From these examples, the pattern suggests that ""dax"" generates the color ""green"" as output. It seems to signal a reset or starting point for color outputs, and it influences the color output for the word immediately following it. The word following ""dax"" yields a specific color:

- ""zup"" when following ""dax"" leads to yellow.
- ""lug"" when following ""dax"" leads to blue.
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" does not have a consistent color following it, possibly because ""wif"" has not been directly preceded by ""dax"" in any example, but ""walm"" is affected by context.

Based on the given data, the rule for ""dax"" could be:

Rule: ""dax"" resets the output to the color ""green."" The word immediately following ""dax"" is assigned a specific color based on that word, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" leads to ""blue."" If ""dax"" stands alone, the output is simply ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, we can make the following observations:

1. When ""wif"" is between two identical words, such as ""zup wif zup"" or ""dax wif dax"", it translates to ""red"".
2. When ""wif"" is between two different words, like in ""lug wif dax"" or ""wif zup dax"", it also translates to ""red"".
3. ""Wif"" appears to take the position of a color in the sequence and is consistently translated as ""red"" regardless of its position or neighboring words.

From these observations, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""red"". Each time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is produced in the output at the corresponding position. The context does not appear to change the meaning of ""bluf"". 

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look at the patterns in the input and the corresponding colors in the output.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

From these examples, we can see that whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the same color is repeated in the output for as many words that precede ""walm."" The color that ""walm"" generates corresponds to the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Let's verify this:

1. ""dax walm"" generates ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and since there is only one ""dax"" before ""walm,"" the output is three greens.

2. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" generates ""yellow red green green green blue."" The word right before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" There are three words before ""walm,"" so it's ""green"" repeated three times.

3. ""wif walm"" generates ""red red red."" The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Since there's only one ""wif"" before ""walm,"" we get three reds.

4. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" generates ""blue red yellow red red red."" Again, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""red."" There are three words before ""walm,"" giving three reds.

5. ""lug walm zup"" generates ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" but since ""walm"" is not followed by another word, it seems the rule is slightly different at the end of the sequence. The ""walm"" here generates ""blue"" for each preceding word, but the final word ""zup"" simply follows with its own color, ""yellow.""

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it for the count of all the words that precede ""walm."" It does not affect the word(s) following ""walm"" (if any). 

Walm -> Meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word for an amount equal to the number of words prior to ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the outputs associated with the nonce word 'dax' whenever it appears in the input:

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   Here, 'dax' is followed by 'green' in the output twice.

2. Input: dax
   Output: green
   'dax' stands alone and corresponds with 'green'.

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   'dax' is followed by 'green'.

4. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
   'dax' is followed by 'green'.

5. Input: wif lug dax
   Output: red blue green
   'dax' is followed by 'green'.

In each instance, regardless of its position in the sequence, the word 'dax' directly correlates with the color 'green' in the output. Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the output each time ""walm"" appears in the input. 

- When ""wif walm dax"" is the input, the output is ""red red red green."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax,"" and ""wif"" and ""dax"" are associated with red and green, respectively. 
- For the input ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is associated with blue.
- In the input ""lug wif walm,"" the output is ""blue red red red."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is associated with red.
- With the input ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green,"" where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm,"" and is associated with red. ""Dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" occurs last.
- Finally, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in the output ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red,"" where ""walm"" is associated with blue in this instance.

Based on these outputs, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. The repetition count appears to be three times, except when ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, in which case it either repeats the color once or is green if ""dax"" precedes it.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" for a count of three, unless ""walm"" is at the end of the input, in which case repeat the color once or use the color green if preceded by ""dax.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color thrice or once at the end or use the color green if preceded by ""dax"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"". The consistent one-to-one relationship suggests that the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" is ""blue"". 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word dax corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. This can be confirmed through each example where the presence of the word dax always results in the color ""green"" in the output sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to determine the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""wif"". Let's analyze each input-output pair to see if there's a consistent pattern:

- In every output, the presence of ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""
- Each time ""wif"" appears, there is a sequence of colors, and the position of ""red"" corresponds to the position of ""wif"" in the input.

Let's confirm this with the examples:

1. Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" follows it, correlating with ""red.""

2. Input: lug wif | Output: blue red
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" follows it, correlating with ""red.""

3. Input: dax walm wif dax | Output: green green green red green
   - ""wif"" is in the third position, following two instances of ""dax walm,"" which correlates with ""green green."" Following ""wif"" is ""dax,"" correlating with ""green"" again.

4. Input: dax wif | Output: green red
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""wif"" follows it, correlating with ""red.""

5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup | Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""dax walm"" with ""green green,"" and finally ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

The consistency in these examples gives us a rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning every time ""wif"" appears in the sequence, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position or the context within the sentence. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. Here is the inferred meaning based on the examples:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples given, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The task is to map the nonce word ""bluf"" to its color equivalent. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".
2. ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".
3. ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"".
4. ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".

By examining the instances where ""bluf"" is present in the input and its corresponding color in the output, we can deduce its meaning:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red yellow red blue green"". ""Red"" corresponds to ""wif"", ""yellow"" to ""zup"", ""blue"" to ""lug"", and ""green"" to ""dax"". Since the color ""red"" is accounted for by ""wif"", and the only color that remains unpaired is ""green"", ""bluf"" must correspond to ""green"".

However, this conclusion contradicts the next examples, so we need to continue our analysis.

- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" immediately after the word ""wif"", which also corresponds to ""red"".

- In the third example, ""bluf"" again matches up with ""red"" when it comes after ""wif"".

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is at the end and corresponds to ""green"" like ""dax"", but there are two instances of ""green"" at the end of the output, which could be due to the repetition of ""dax"" before ""bluf"".

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is again corresponding to ""red"" after ""wif"".

Given these instances, there seems to be a pattern where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it directly follows ""wif"". However, in the fourth example ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" possibly because it follows ""dax"". Based on these conflicting instances, the consistent rule is not entirely clear.

If we prioritize the majority of evidence where ""bluf"" is present and corresponds to ""red"", we might conclude that ""bluf"" equals ""red"", although this rule is not without exceptions.

Rule: bluf -> red (though there may be conditions under which this rule does not apply, e.g., the fourth example).
Considering the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to repeatedly correspond with the word ""blue."" More specifically, it appears that whenever ""walm"" is used in the input, the word ""blue"" is written in the output for each word in front of it up to a word that changes its color or until the beginning of the input string. The word ""blue"" does not follow ""walm"" itself. This pattern is consistent across all examples given:

- In the first example, ""zup walm lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where both ""zup"" and ""lug"" before ""walm"" result in ""yellow"" followed by ""blue.""
- In the second and fourth examples, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue red green,"" where ""zup"" and ""lug"" before ""walm"" turn into ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively, followed by ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" outputs ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" following the same rule: ""dax"" and ""wif"" before ""walm"" result in ""green"" and ""red,"" both followed by ""red""; ""lug"" and ""zup"" before the second ""walm"" result in ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" followed by more ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output of the word ""blue"" for each word that precedes it up to a point of change or the beginning of the input string.

Rule: walm -> Turn all preceding words into the color ""blue,"" unless a change point occurs before. Blue does not follow ""walm"" itself.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue"". Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input is transformed into ""blue"" in the output. Hence, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: Each word corresponds to a specific color. ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" to ""blue"" as well. The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The output sequence of colors is directly related to the sequence of input words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" In each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, the output consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

The consistent element across all examples is that whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. The other words, ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug,"" have outputs that are green, red, blue, and blue respectively, according to their positions relative to ""zup."" Thus, the rule is that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned twice in a row directly after its occurrence. 

In the first input, ""lug bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In the second input, ""wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green green,"" so here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

In the third input, ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and later to ""blue"" according to their positions.

In the fourth input, ""wif dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In the fifth input, ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue,"" which indicates ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" is used to repeat the color word that immediately follows it in the sequence.

Therefore: bluf -> meaning is to repeat the color word that follows.
To determine the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each given example and note the patterns related to the word ""walm"":

1. ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red""
2. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green""
5. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue""

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- In the first example, the word ""walm"" corresponds to three occurrences of the color ""red.""
- In the second example, the word ""walm"" appears twice, and in both cases, it translates to three occurrences of the color ""red.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is at the end and corresponds to three occurrences of the color ""yellow,"" which follows the preceding color's pattern.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" implying that ""walm"" alone corresponds to two additional occurrences of the color ""green,"" which is the translation of ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" corresponds to additional occurrences of the color ""blue,"" immediately following the translation of ""lug.""

Given the examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the immediately preceding color word to repeat two additional times.

Rule: walm -> causes the immediate previous color to repeat two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Regardless of what other words are present in the input, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule would be:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it results in ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" correlates with the output ""red."" This direct mapping is consistent across all examples provided. Other words like ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" appear to have their own associated colors, suggesting that each nonce word directly translates to a specific color. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be that each nonce word is mapped to a specific color in the output:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Based on the given data, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position. The other words in the input seem to correspond to different colors: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" (when not adjacent to ""zup"") corresponds to ""red"". ""Bluf"" seems to repeat the color before it.

Here is the rule induction based on the given data:

1. lug -> blue
2. wif -> red (unless it is following ""zup"" where it repeats previous color)
3. zup -> yellow
4. ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color before it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine each instance where it occurs and see if there is a pattern in the corresponding outputs:

Example 1:
Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

Example 2:
Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Example 3:
Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green

Example 4:
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Example 5:
Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Analyzing the outputs, the color that corresponds to ""bluf"" is consistently red regardless of the words' position or the surrounding context in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a rule for what ""walm"" represents by analyzing the consistency in the output when ""walm"" is present in the input.

Looking at the outputs, the presence of ""walm"" in the input correlates with a repetition of a color word three times in a row in the output. 

Here's a breakdown:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""walm"" correlates with the triple repetition of the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green"": ""walm"" correlates with the triple repetition of the color ""blue.""
- ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red"": ""walm"" correlates with the triple repetition of the color ""red.""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow"": ""walm"" correlates with the triple repetition of the color ""red.""
- ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue"": ""walm"" correlates with the triple repetition of the color ""blue.""

The color word that is repeated three times corresponds to the word that appears immediately before ""walm."" 

Hence, we can infer the following rule:
- walm -> When followed by ""walm,"" the preceding word is output three times in a row.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of the context in which it is used.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"":

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output will include the color ""green.""
wif -> meaning. The meaning of the word ""wif"" appears to be ""red"" based on the provided examples. Each instance where ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red"". 

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word just before ""bluf"". 

Rule: If the word before ""bluf"" translates to a color, then ""bluf"" causes that color to be repeated. If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue"" repeated because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". If ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"" repeated because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", the output for ""bluf"" will be ""red"" repeated.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the colors associated with each word:

- `dax` consistently translates to green.
- `wif` consistently translates to red.
- `zup` consistently translates to yellow.
- `lug` consistently translates to blue.
- The examples suggest that the color for `walm` changes depending on its position in the list or possibly the words around it. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `walm` always results in the color output that follows the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

Let's test this rule:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"". The output for `walm` here is `green`, which follows the color output (`green`) for `dax`.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green"". The output for `walm` here is `blue`, following the color output (`blue`) for `lug`.

3. In the third example, ""dax walm wif zup"" translates to ""green green green red yellow"". The output for `walm` is `green`, following the color output (`green`) for `dax`.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Once again, the output for `walm` is `yellow`, following the color output (`yellow`) for `zup`.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"". The first `walm` follows `dax` with green, and the second `walm` follows `lug` with blue.

From these observations, we can conclude:

Rule: `walm` takes on the color output of the word directly preceding it.

Therefore:

walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to examine the outputs that correspond to the inputs containing ""dax.""

From the examples given:

1. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red green blue blue.""
2. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue.""
3. ""zup dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue.""
4. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green red blue red.""
5. ""dax zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow.""

We can see that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output. It suggests that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the word ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

1. Whenever 'wif' is present, the word 'red' is included in the output.

2. 'wif' occurs at any position within the input sequence and 'red' consequently appears at the corresponding position in the output sequence.

By analyzing the correlation between the presence of 'wif' and the output, it seems that 'wif' directly translates to 'red'. Let's confirm by looking at each example.

- In the first input (""wif lug""), 'wif' is first, and 'red' is the first word in the output, followed by 'lug' which translates to 'blue'.
- In the second input (""dax walm wif zup""), 'wif' is the third word, and similarly, 'red' is the third word in the output sequence.
- In the third input (""wif bluf lug""), 'wif' is first, and 'red' is again the first word in the output. Followed by 'bluf' which leads to 'red' as well, and 'lug' which corresponds to 'blue'.
- In the fourth input (""dax bluf wif zup dax""), 'wif' is third, and 'red' is the third word in the output.
- In the fifth input where only 'wif' is present, the output consists of only 'red'.

Considering this pattern, the rule for 'wif' can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Therefore:
bluf -> duplication of the preceding color

- ""zup bluf"" means ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" duplicates it.
- ""dax bluf"" means ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" duplicates it.
- ""lug bluf"" means ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" duplicates it.
- ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" means ""green green red yellow red"" because ""dax"" is green, followed by ""bluf"" which duplicates green, then ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow and ""wif"" again is red.
- ""zup dax bluf"" means ""yellow green green"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word that immediately precedes it, which is green.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to dictate the number of times a color is repeated in the output. Each example that contains ""walm"" repeats the color that precedes it multiple times in the output. The presence of ""walm"" does not seem to have an impact on the choice of color but rather on the repetition of the color that directly precedes it. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.

2. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times. ""wif"" comes after ""walm"" and does not influence the repetition.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   In this example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.

5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   The pattern repeats as in the previous example, with ""green"" repeated three times following ""dax walm."" ""lug"" comes after ""walm"" and is represented once by ""blue.""

It seems that whenever ""walm"" is present, the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color represented by the word that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently results in the output of ""blue."" Regardless of the context or the other words present in the input, ""lug"" is always associated with ""blue."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

lug -> blue

Rule: When the input contains the word ""lug,"" the output includes the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif bluf dax lug -> Output: red red green blue
Input: dax -> Output: green
Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
Input: zup wif dax walm lug -> Output: yellow red green green green blue
Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue

It appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the pattern of how the nonce word `wif` is translated into a color in the output:

1. Every occurrence of the word `wif` consistently results in the color `red` in the output.
2. There are no examples where `wif` appears more than once or in combination with another word that would affect its output, so the presence of `wif` translates to a single instance of `red` regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Given this information, the rule for the word `wif` is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

The meaning of `wif` in the given context is simply the color `red`.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, and its meaning changes dependent on the word that immediately precedes it. Here are the observations and the corresponding rules:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" is the first word or not preceded by any of the known context words (""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""dax""), it defaults to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
- bluf -> green by default
- The meaning of ""bluf"" changes to a different color based on the word immediately before it: ""lug"" changes ""bluf"" to blue, ""zup"" changes ""bluf"" to yellow, ""wif"" changes ""bluf"" to red, and ""dax"" changes ""bluf"" to green.

Rule: 
- bluf -> green, unless preceded by lug/zup/wif/dax 
  - lug bluf -> blue 
  - zup bluf -> yellow 
  - wif bluf -> red 
  - dax bluf -> green
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""walm"" by looking for patterns.

In the first example:
- ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red""
- The word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red""
- The output after ""walm"" is ""red red red"" which is a repetition of the color that corresponds to ""wif""

In the second example:
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red""
- Again, ""walm"" is following ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red""
- The output after ""walm"" is ""red red red"", again a repetition of the color for ""wif""

In the third example:
- ""zup dax walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green yellow red""
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green""
- After ""walm,"" we have ""green green green"" which is a repetition of the color for ""dax""

In the fourth example:
- ""wif lug walm"" corresponds to ""red blue blue blue""
- ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue""
- The output after ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue"", which is a repetition of the color for ""lug""

In the fifth example:
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green blue red""
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green""
- Immediately after ""walm,"" we have ""green green green"" a repetition of the color for ""dax""

From these examples, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Walm -> meaning. The presence of ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: If X is the color corresponding to the word before ""walm,"" the output after ""walm"" will be X repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input, it consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output. 

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" consistently results in the word ""red"" being used in the output. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, regardless of its position or the presence of other words, a ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Here are the sequence of observations that lead to this conclusion:

1. When ""wif"" is paired with ""lug"" (`Input: wif lug`), the output is ""red blue."" Here, ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

2. When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" (`Input: wif bluf`), the output is ""red red."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" in the output.

3. When ""lug"" precedes ""wif bluf"" (`Input: lug wif bluf`), the output is ""blue red red."" In this example, ""wif"" still corresponds to the first occurrence of ""red"" following it.

4. When only the word ""wif"" is inputted (`Input: wif`), the output is simply ""red.""

These observations all consistently point to the notion that ""wif"" maps to the word ""red."" The other words in the examples (e.g., ""lug"" and ""bluf"") appear to be mapping to other colors, but with just the word ""wif"" alone always resulting in ""red,"" it allows us to conclude:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" in any position in the input corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context.
Analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to match each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" with the corresponding word in the outputs:

1. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

3. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green

4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

5. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

In example 1, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""red"" followed by ""yellow"" in the output. This does not give us direct information about ""bluf"" since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in other examples. 

In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and is followed by ""lug"" (blue), which corresponds in the output to ""red"" followed by ""blue"". Again, the relationship seems unclear.

In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is the last word in the input, which corresponds to ""green"" being followed by another ""green"" in the output.

In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and is the last word in the input, which corresponds to ""red"" followed by another ""red"" in the output.

In example 5, ""bluf"" is the last word in the input, preceded by ""zup"" (yellow), and corresponds to a sequence that ends with ""yellow"" followed by another ""yellow"" in the output.

From examples 3, 4, and 5, we can see a pattern: when ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, it seems to duplicate the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Thus, the rule appears to be:
Rule: ""bluf"" -> duplicates the color of the preceding word when it is the last word in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to isolate the instances of ""walm"" from the examples and identify the elements in the output that correspond to these instances. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   After ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated.

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   After ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated and it also precedes it.

3. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   After ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated and it also precedes it.

4. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   After the first ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated. After the second ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated.

5. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   After ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated and it also precedes it.

Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" indicates that the color which comes after ""walm"" will be repeated. Additionally, if a color precedes ""walm"", it seems that ""walm"" will first repeat this color before repeating the following color, which is evident from examples 2, 3, and 5.

Rule: walm -> The output color immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated; afterwards, the output color immediately following ""walm"" is repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence (before or after another word), ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

- When ""dax"" appears alone (Input: ""dax""), the output is ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green when it is the only word or perhaps the first word encountered.
  
- When ""dax"" appears with ""wif"" and ""lug"" (Input: ""wif lug dax""), the output order is ""red blue green."" This indicates that ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""dax"" to green, retaining the association of ""dax"" with the color green.
  
- In the case of repeated usage with ""zup"" (Input: ""dax zup dax zup""), the output sequence is ""green yellow green yellow,"" which confirms that ""dax"" corresponds to green and introduces ""zup"" as yellow.
  
- Finally, ""lug zup dax lug"" (Input) results in ""blue yellow green blue"" (Output), which is consistent with the previously identified meanings of ""dax"" as green, ""lug"" as blue, and ""zup"" as yellow.
  
Rule: ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position or the words surrounding it.
Based on the examples given, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Regardless of the words that precede or follow ""wif"" (with the exception of ""walm,"" which outputs ""red"" synonymously), ""wif"" always results in the color ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" because each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output in its corresponding position. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

- In the first input, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm."" The output is ""yellow yellow red red red,"" with ""yellow"" corresponding directly to ""zup.""
- In the second input, where ""lug"" and ""bluf"" are also present, ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, following ""blue"" which corresponds to ""bluf.""
- In the third input, ""zup bluf"" directly translates to ""yellow yellow"" in the output.
- In the fourth input, ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red,"" with the first ""red"" corresponding to ""wif,"" which suggests ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the last input, ""zup wif zup,"" we see that ""zup"" maps to both instances of ""yellow"" in the output, with ""red"" corresponding to ""wif.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the given examples, we should look at the patterns where ""bluf"" appears and what output it corresponds to in each case.

- In the first example: ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" results in ""yellow yellow red green red yellow."" If we note, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Therefore, the appearance of ""bluf"" here corresponds to the second 'yellow' output.

- In the second example: ""lug bluf wif"" results in ""blue blue red."" Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Thus, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second 'blue.'

- In the third example: ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red."" We already know ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" appears twice and both times it corresponds to green, the same color output as ""dax.""

- In the fourth example: ""wif zup bluf"" results in ""red yellow yellow."" We can see that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and thus ""bluf"" corresponds to the second 'yellow.'

- In the fifth example: ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" has consistently corresponded to ""red"" in prior examples.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" must mean repeating the color corresponding to the word that just preceded it in the sequence. If the word prior to it was ""zup"" (""yellow""), then ""bluf"" meant repeating ""yellow"". If the word before it was ""lug"" (""blue""), ""bluf"" meant repeating ""blue"", and when it followed ""wif"" (""red""), ""bluf"" meant repeating ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word directly before it. Here's how the rule applies in each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   Rule Application: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""walm"" which repeats blue twice, then ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, followed by ""wif"" which is red.

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Rule Application: ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""walm"" which repeats red twice.

3. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Rule Application: After ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow twice.

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule Application: ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""walm"" which repeats green twice.

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Rule Application: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""walm"" which repeats yellow twice, then ending with ""wif"" which is red.

So, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm wif
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow red,yellow yellow yellow red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the meaning of ""lug"" by comparing the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

- In every instance, the appearance of the word ""lug"" corresponds with the color ""blue"" in the output. 

- ""dax lug wif bluf"" maps to ""green blue red red""
- ""zup lug dax"" maps to ""yellow blue green""
- ""wif lug wif"" maps to ""red blue red""
- ""lug zup dax walm"" maps to ""blue yellow green green green""
- ""zup lug"" maps to ""yellow blue""

In every case, the word that immediately follows ""lug"" in the input is reflected by its corresponding color in the output sequence. This consistency implies that ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue"" independent of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:
Rule: lug -> blue
From the provided examples, it is possible to infer the following pattern:

- ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green,"" and ""wif zup dax"" translates to ""red yellow green."" The word ""dax"" follows ""zup"" in both cases, and ""green"" is consistent in the output, suggesting that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it is introduced in the input and ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""

- ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red."" The word ""dax"" appears first and is followed by ""wif"" and ""walm."" The output sequence starts with ""green"" corresponding to ""dax,"" while ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" based on previous examples and ""walm"" also appears to correspond to ""red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" and ""walm"" both translate to ""red.""

- ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green."" In this sequence, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and ""bluf"" follows. Given the output is ""green green,"" the interpretation is that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""

- ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green."" The input order is reversed compared to the other examples, but the output colors are still associated with the individual words (""wif"" as ""red"" and ""dax"" as ""green"") regardless of their position.

Given these observations, the rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of position or other words in the sequence, ""wif"" always translates to ""red.""
Based on the given examples, 'zup' translates to 'yellow'. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates directly to a color associated with the preceding word. The rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color translation of the word that comes directly before it. Here are the associations we can deduce from the inputs and outputs:

- ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" must translate to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red,"" implying ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" again repeats that color.
- ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue,"" indicating ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" repeats it.
- With ""wif bluf zup bluf wif,"" we see that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word each time it is used.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, we can induce a rule regarding the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" 

Looking at the examples:

1. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" Here, every word except ""walm"" has a single corresponding color. After ""walm,"" the previously mentioned color (""blue"" from ""lug"") is repeated twice before moving on to the next color.

2. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated twice more.

3. ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" In this example, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated twice. The same pattern holds for ""zup"" with the color ""yellow"" after ""walm.""

4. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" The pattern repeats with ""zup"" being ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" there are two more ""yellow"" before the pattern continues.

5. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Following the established pattern, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes the next two outputs to be the same color as the one immediately preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears the word ""dax"" has a consistent output regardless of its position:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
2. The presence of ""dax"" itself does not seem to influence the color output of other words.
3. ""zup"" seems to yield a consistent output of ""yellow"" when it appears before or after ""dax,"" which indicates that ""zup"" also has a specific meaning that doesn't change based on ""dax’s"" presence.
4. ""lug"" and ""walm"" are followed by ""blue,"" but because we don't have examples of these words in isolation, we cannot conclusively determine their individual meanings without additional context.

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red

Given that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in every example, regardless of position or other words present, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" translates consistently to a single color, regardless of the context in which it's used.

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: dax zup dax zup wif
Output: green yellow green yellow red

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow

In every example where ""zup"" appears, the output is always ""yellow"", independent of the other words surrounding it. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
From the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word right before it.

- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" causes the previous color to repeat, hence another ""green.""

- In ""wif lug bluf,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" again causes the previous color, ""blue,"" to repeat.

- ""dax bluf wif zup"" leads to ""green green red yellow."" Here ""wif"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, and ""bluf"" right after ""dax"" causes ""green"" to repeat.

- ""dax bluf"" still translates to ""green green,"" reinforcing the rule.

- Finally, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red blue blue yellow yellow green."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" causing the color to repeat. ""Bluf"" also follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and again the color repeats.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and see how it translates to the output.

Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" seems to add two additional instances of the color that precedes it.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- Considering the previous rule for ""walm,"" it seems to add two additional ""blue"" instances after ""lug""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- Again, ""walm"" follows the rule of adding two more instances of the preceding color.

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" adds two more yellows after ""zup""
- The second ""lug"" output is simply ""blue"" once more, as ""walm"" has already been applied.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" adds two more yellows following the rule
- ""wif"" is ""red"" and comes after the effect of ""walm""

Based on these inputs and outputs, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" is used, it adds two additional instances of the color that immediately precedes it in the input sequence. 

Therefore:

walm -> meaning is to triple the color word that comes before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples given, the meaning of ""dax"" can be derived by examining the output each time the word ""dax"" appears. In all instances, irrespective of what comes before or after ""dax,"" the output associated with ""dax"" is ""green.""

Here is the pattern deduction from the examples:

In the first example, ""dax walm"" produces ""green green"", and since each instance of the input corresponds to an instance of the output, we can infer that ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green.""

In the second and third examples, ""dax"" is the only input, and the output is a single ""green,"" further supporting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In the fourth example, ""dax zup dax"" gives us ""green yellow green,"" which implies that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and the position of ""dax"" in the sequence does not affect its meaning. Each ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green.""

The fifth example also supports that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" with the output ""yellow green"" for the input ""zup dax.""

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: dax -> green

Meaning: dax corresponds to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

Every time ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. It does not seem to matter where ""zup"" is placed within the input or which other words it is combined with; ""zup"" consistently equates to ""yellow."" Thus, we can induce the rule:

zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, each word appears to correspond to a color, as follows:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

The word ""bluf"" appears after a word and is repeated the number of times corresponding to the number of syllables in the word that precedes it. Let's verify this with the given examples:

Example 1:
- ""dax"" has one syllable, so ""bluf"" is repeated once resulting in one output - ""green green green red.""
- ""walm"" has one syllable, so ""bluf"" is repeated once resulting in one output - ""green green green red red.""

Example 2:
- ""wif"" has one syllable, so ""bluf"" is repeated once resulting in one output - ""red red.""
- ""zup"" has one syllable, so ""bluf"" is repeated once resulting in one output - ""yellow yellow.""
- Following the pattern, the second ""wif bluf"" produces ""red red"" just like the first.

Example 3:
- ""zup"" has one syllable, so ""bluf"" is repeated once resulting in one output - ""yellow blue.""
- ""lug"" has one syllable, so ""bluf"" is repeated once resulting in one output - ""blue yellow.""
- Following the pattern, the second ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow"" just like the first.

Example 4:
- Since ""wif"" has one syllable, ""bluf"" is repeated once, resulting in one output - ""red red.""

Example 5:
- ""zup"" has one syllable, so ""bluf"" is repeated once resulting in one output - ""yellow green.""
- ""dax"" has one syllable, ""bluf"" is repeated once resulting in one output - ""green green.""

Hence, the rule seems to be: ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, the number of repeats being equal to the number of syllables in the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word, the number of times equal to the number of syllables in that word.
Analyzing the examples given:

1. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
2. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
3. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
4. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

Looking at the pattern, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it. For instance:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output is ""yellow"" for each occurrence of ""walm"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", and the output is ""blue"" for ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", and the output is ""red"" for ""walm"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", and the output is ""blue"" for ""walm"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" again follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output is ""yellow"" for ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> the word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the word that precedes it. 

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" is included in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"". Thus, the meaning of ""dax"" in this context is ""green"".
From the provided examples, we can infer a pattern by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

Here's what we can deduce from each example:

Input: wif zup bluf lug / Output: red yellow yellow blue
- 'wif' precedes 'zup', 'bluf', and 'lug', which are translated to 'yellow', 'yellow', and 'blue' respectively. Since 'wif' comes before 'yellow' and 'blue', we might initially suspect that 'wif' translates to 'red'.

Input: wif lug dax / Output: red blue green
- The appearance of 'wif' followed by 'lug' and 'dax' yields 'red', 'blue', and 'green'. This is consistent with our initial guess that 'wif' translates to 'red'.

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf / Output: blue red red green blue blue
- 'wif' follows 'lug' and is followed by 'bluf'. The output sequence places 'red' in the position following 'blue' (which corresponds to 'lug'), further supporting the idea that 'wif' might translate to 'red'.

Input: dax wif lug / Output: green red blue
- Again, 'wif' is bracketed by 'dax' and 'lug', translating to 'green' and 'blue', with 'wif' corresponding to 'red'.

Input: zup bluf wif walm / Output: yellow yellow red red red
- 'wif' follows two instances of 'yellow' and is followed by 'walm', which corresponds to 'red', yet it still translates to 'red'.

Based on the consistent translation of 'wif' to 'red' regardless of its position or the words around it, we can conclude that 'wif' directly translates to the color 'red'.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it seems like ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, it is possible to infer the following:

- The first example shows that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug,"" which is translated to ""blue,"" and followed by ""wif,"" which translates to ""red.""
- The second example demonstrates that ""bluf"" following ""wif"" is translated to ""red.""
- The third example repeats the first part of the sequence in the first example and results in the same translations for ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""wif.""
- The fourth example shows ""bluf"" following ""lug"" and ""dax,"" which are correspondingly translated to ""blue"" and ""green."" In this case, ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""
- The fifth example contains ""dax"" and ""zup"" at either end of ""bluf."" ""Dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and in this context, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Considering the above, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> Translated to the color word immediately preceding it in the sequence when that color word refers to a color (yellow, blue, green, etc.) and not to a word like ""bluf"" itself.

Rule: bluf corresponds to the color word directly before it in the given set of words. If preceded by ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" becomes ""blue;"" if preceded by ""dax"" (green), ""bluf"" becomes ""green,"" etc. If such a word is not present, it might default to ""red,"" as in the second example, but this rule is not clearly defined and might be incidental or based on a different, unspecified context rule.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the inputs and corresponding outputs to find a pattern.

Looking at each input where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

Let's look at the outputs after each ""walm"":

1. After the first ""walm"" there are three blues, and after the second ""walm"" there are three yellows.
2. There are three greens following the ""walm.""
3. There are three greens following the ""walm,"" which remains consistent with example 2.
4. There are two additional blues following the ""walm.""
5. There are three reds following the ""walm.""

It seems that each time ""walm"" is mentioned, a color repeats three times (except in example 4, where it repeats twice, but that may be due to only one word ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" instead of two). The color that is repeated appears to be the color corresponding to the word that comes just before ""walm.""

Using that logic, ""walm"" makes the color associated with the preceding word repeat three times. However, if ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence just after the starting word, the pattern repeats only for the number of words preceding ""walm"" (which is why in example 4, ""blue"" repeats only twice).

Rule: walm -> Makes the color of the previous word in the sequence repeat three times or repeats for the count of words preceding ""walm"" if fewer than three words precede it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words.
To infer the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we shall look for patterns within the given examples. We will try to match the inputs with their corresponding outputs to deduce what ""dax"" represents.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Here, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   In this example, ""dax"" also corresponds to the color ""green.""

3. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   Consistently, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   Again, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and the other words correspond to their respective colors.

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   Here, ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to the color ""green.""

From these examples, we can see that regardless of position within the sequence, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

This rule implies that the nonce word ""dax"" signifies the color green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" In every instance where ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the output, regardless of the presence or order of other words. Additionally, ""wif"" by itself translates directly to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

The rule can be deduced from the fact that every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears at the corresponding position in the output. For instance, in the first example ""zup dax bluf zup dax"", the positions of ""zup"" are replaced with ""yellow"" in the output, yielding ""yellow green green yellow green"". This pattern repeats consistently across all examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be dependent on its position in relation to the other words. To identify the pattern, let's map each distinct word with its corresponding color as output:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> green (from the third input where ""walm"" is not preceded by anything, but follows ""dax"" which is green)

Now, let's consider the occurrences of ""bluf"" and their outputs:

1. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and precedes ""wif"" (red), and the output for ""bluf"" is green.

2. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
   ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue), and the output for ""bluf"" is red.

3. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
   ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" (red) and ""dax"" (green), and the output for ""bluf"" is red.

4. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the output for ""bluf"" is yellow.

5. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the output for ""bluf"" is red.

By analyzing the patterns:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or precedes ""wif,"" its color is the same as the color of the word just preceding it (Rule 1).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""lug,"" its color is red, regardless of the preceding word (Rule 2).

Rule 1 seems to be an exception because it is specifically related to the combination of ""dax"" and ""wif."" In all other cases, ""bluf"" defaults to red, as shown in examples 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Hence, the rule we can deduce for ""bluf"" is that it turns red unless it specifically follows ""dax,"" in which case it will be green.

Rule: bluf -> red (default), except when following dax, then bluf -> green.
Upon examining the given examples, it can be deduced that the word ""walm"" changes the following word to the color represented by the preceding word. More concisely, ""walm"" carries the color value of the word before it and applies it to the word after it. 

Here are the breakdowns:

- dax lug walm zup wif => green blue blue blue yellow red
  ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" makes ""zup"" also blue, ""wif"" is red.
  
- dax walm => green green green
  ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" makes the following unspecified term also green.
  
- wif walm => red red red
  ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" makes the following unspecified term also red.
  
- zup walm wif => yellow yellow yellow red
  ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" makes ""wif"" also yellow, the last ""wif"" is red as standalone.
  
- zup walm => yellow yellow yellow
  ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" makes the following unspecified term also yellow.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word and applies it to the following word. If no word follows, the color is carried forward as if there is an implicit term that is colored accordingly.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, it seems the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each instance. 

The rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:

- ""wif"" alone results in ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red,"" which suggests ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green red,"" which suggests ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- When ""wif"" follows the word ""bluf"" and precedes ""dax,"" with ""lug"" at the end, the output is ""red red green blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

In every instance, ""wif"" results in the color ""red."" Therefore, regardless of context or word order, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the patterns observed in the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can induce the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" as follows:

Input pattern: lug walm zup lug walm
Output pattern: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

When ""zup"" is present, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output. In cases where ""zup"" is followed by the same pattern that precedes it (e.g., ""lug walm zup lug walm""), the output for ""zup"" remains ""yellow"" and the sequence continues normally after ""zup"".

Input pattern: dax zup wif
Output pattern: green yellow red

The pattern here confirms the finding that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the output.

Input pattern: zup lug walm wif walm
Output pattern: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at the beginning of the sequence. After the ""zup,"" the pattern continues normally, suggesting that the placement of ""zup"" does not change the output of the words that follow it.

Input pattern: zup lug
Output pattern: yellow blue

Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"" while ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Input pattern: dax lug walm zup wif
Output pattern: green blue blue blue yellow red

In this pattern, we find that ""zup"" is once again represented by ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule:
Based on these examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be stated as follows:

zup -> meaning. ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to find a consistent pattern between the input with ""bluf"" and the corresponding output.

1. Input: ""wif bluf"" -> Output: ""red red"" 
2. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green""
3. Input: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> Output: ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
4. Input: ""zup wif bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow red red""
5. Input: ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> Output: ""red green red red yellow red""

From these examples, it seems that:
- ""wif"" correlates to a single ""red""
- ""dax"" correlates to a single ""green""
- ""zup"" correlates to a single ""yellow""
- ""walm"" seems to correlate to repeated ""green"" 

Every instance where ""bluf"" appears, an additional ""red"" follows the pattern established for ""wif."" For example, in the first input, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" showing that ""bluf"" also results in ""red."" This pattern holds for all the given examples.

Rule: bluf -> ""red""
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to represent a series of colors that are dependent on the word that precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" takes on the rule of repeating the color represented by the word before it three times. Here is how ""walm"" relates to the preceding word in each example:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" meaning ""lug"" maps to the color blue and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" meaning ""wif"" maps to the color red and ""walm"" repeats it three times. Also, ""lug walm"" within the same sequence results in ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with the first example.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""wif walm"" consistently results in ""red red red,"" reinforcing the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color linked to ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" maps to the color yellow and ""walm"" repeats that color three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is: It repeats the color signified by the word directly in front of it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color represented by the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue blue blue green,red blue blue blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". There is no indication that the meaning of ""lug"" changes depending on context. Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" means ""blue.""
Based on the provided input-output pairs, we can deduce the following rules:

- The word ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"" in every instance it appears.
- The word ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"".
- The word ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"".
- The word ""walm"" following ""wif"" is also translated to ""red"", as seen in the second and fourth examples, but when it follows ""zup"", it's translated to ""yellow"", which suggests that ""walm"" inherits the color of the word immediately preceding it.
- The word ""bluf"" is translated to ""green"", which is the same as ""dax"", as seen in the fifth example.

From these observations, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: Each word has a specific color associated with it, except for the word ""walm"" which inherits the color of the word preceding it. ""Dax"" is associated with the color green, ""wif"" with red, and ""zup"" with yellow. ""Bluf"" also appears to be associated with the color green, either because it means ""green"" as well or it inherits the color from ""dax"".

Therefore, the meaning of the word ""dax"" could be inferred as green.

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the examples provided. Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. The other words in the inputs also correspond to colors, with ""lug"" consistently translating to ""blue"", ""walm"" to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means the color word that directly follows it in the input should be outputted twice in the output.

Examples and application of the rule:
- In the first example, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" results in ""red red yellow yellow red."" The word ""bluf"" precedes ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and in the output, both ""yellow"" and ""red"" are repeated once, respectively.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" The word ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" and in the output, ""green"" is repeated once.
- In the third example, ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" results in ""blue red red blue red,"" where ""bluf"" precedes ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated once in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red."" Here ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated once.
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" results in ""red red blue yellow."" The word ""bluf"" precedes ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated once in the output.

Therefore: bluf -> The following color word appears twice in sequence in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here's how we can deduce the rule:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue and ""walm"" means repeating that color three times.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" relates to red and ""walm"" repeats the color three times.
- ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""walm"" again repeats the color three times.

When ""walm"" follows two or more words that have associated colors, the pattern of repetition only applies to the color directly preceding ""walm"":

- ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""wif walm"" repeats red three times and ""zup walm"" repeats yellow three times.
- In ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" the ""walm"" only repeats the green color that is associated with ""dax,"" leading to ""green green green,"" and ""lug"" is blue at the end.
- Similarly, ""dax walm zup lug"" has ""walm"" repeating green three times after ""dax,"" followed by the individual colors for ""zup"" and ""lug.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the immediate preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" It does not appear to change based on position or surrounding words. Each time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the output consistently includes the color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
From analyzing the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" correlates with the color green every time it appears in the input. Each time ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output includes green in the first position.

Here are the mappings we can deduce from each example:
- ""dax wif lug"" -> ""green red blue""
  ""dax"" is mapped to ""green"", ""wif"" mapped to ""red"", and ""lug"" mapped to ""blue"".

- ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red""
  ""dax"" is mapped to ""green"", ""lug"" is mapped to ""blue"", ""bluf"" is also mapped to ""blue"" (assuming ""bluf"" and ""lug"" are synonyms or have the same meaning in this context), and ""wif"" is mapped to ""red"".

- ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
  ""dax"" is mapped to ""green"", and ""zup"" is mapped to ""yellow"".

- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
  ""dax"" is mapped to ""green"", and ""walm"", because it results in ""green green green"", seems to be a repetition rule where it duplicates the previous color, in this case, ""green"".

- ""lug bluf dax bluf"" -> ""blue blue green green""
  ""lug"" is mapped to ""blue"", ""bluf"" is then consistent with ""blue"", ""dax"" is mapped to ""green"", and ""bluf"" following ""dax"" maintains its ""blue"" mapping.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be that it always corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the list of words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that `wif` indicates a change in the pattern that affects the color associated with the subsequent word. When `wif` appears, the color that would have normally been associated with the following word is changed to red. 

Here is how it aligns with the examples:

- Example 1: ""dax walm wif dax"" - dax would be green, walm would be green, but because wif precedes the next dax, that dax becomes red rather than green.
- Example 2: ""dax lug wif"" - dax is green, lug is blue, and wif turns the color that would follow (if there was an additional word) into red.
- Example 3: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" - dax is green, wif changes the following zup into red, bluf is yellow, and the following wif changes walm into red.
- Example 4: ""zup dax wif"" – zup is yellow, dax is green, and wif turns the color that would follow into red.
- Example 5: ""wif lug zup"" – wif changes the following lug into red, and zup is yellow.

Therefore, the rule for wif appears to be that it changes the color association of the word that directly follows it to red.

Rule: wif -> changes the next word's color association to red.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules for each of the words, including the nonce word zup:

- Each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- Each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- Each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- Each instance of ""walm"" that follows ""zup"" or ""lug"" is repeated the same number of times as the previous color word (""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"").

Given this information, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word zup:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the prior word. Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" follows another word, it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated. For example, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" and ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
walm -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, walm seems to take on the color specification of the word that immediately follows it. So, walm is essentially a rule that dictates ""repeat the color that is associated with the next word.""

Rule: When walm precedes a word, it takes on the color associated with that following word. 

- dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green (walm is green because zup is green)
- lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue (walm is blue because wif is red)
- zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue (walm is yellow because lug is blue)
- lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow (walm is blue because zup is yellow)
- wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow (walm is yellow because dax is green)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Whenever ""lug"" appears as an input, the output is ""blue.""
Based on the examples given, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by looking at the output associated with the input where ""dax"" appears.

Input: wif walm dax zup

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup lug wif dax lug
Output: yellow blue red green blue

The word ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Input: wif dax zup wif
Output: red green yellow red

Once more, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the output.

Based on all the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that:

- When ""lug"" is in the input, the output is ""blue"".
- When ""dax"" is in the input, the output is ""green"".
- When ""zup"" is in the input, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" is in the input, the output is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is in the input, the output is also ""red"".

From these observations, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input. Hence, we can establish a rule as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output contains the word ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs. However, before I can deduce the meaning, it is necessary to identify the patterns for other words as well.

From the provided examples, we can derive the following associations:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Now, knowing the association of these words, let's examine ""bluf"" within the context.

- The first example shows that the sequence ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" corresponds to ""red red yellow yellow red."" If ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" must be repeating the color of the word immediately preceding it.
  
- The second example confirms this, as ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif.""

- The third example shows that ""dax lug bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue blue green,"" where again ""bluf"" is repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word, ""lug.""

- The fourth example with ""zup bluf"" yielding ""yellow yellow"" indicates that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup.""

- The fifth example ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Here, ""bluf"" once again repeats the color of the word immediately before it, ""lug.""

Based on this analysis of examples, we can conclude the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> meaning is that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each example:

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue (Since 'lug' precedes 'walm' and 'blue' is repeated three times)
2. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow (Here 'zup' is yellow, 'dax' is green, 'lug' is followed by 'walm,' we get 'blue blue blue' and then 'yellow' again for 'zup')
3. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red (Here 'dax' is green, 'wif' is red, 'zup' is yellow, 'bluf' seems non-repetitive. 'Wif' followed by 'walm' gives us 'red red red')
4. wif walm -> red red red ('wif' followed by 'walm' results in 'red red red')
5. wif walm dax -> red red red green ('wif' followed by 'walm' gives 'red red red,' then 'green' for 'dax')

Based on the above examples, we can infer the following rule concerning the nonce word ""walm"":
- ""walm"" repeated three times leads to the color preceding ""walm"" to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the word before walm three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug bluf dax wif
    ",Output: yellow green green green green blue blue green red,yellow green green green blue blue green red,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Observing the examples provided, we can attempt to discern a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"". Here's the analysis:

1. In ""wif bluf dax lug"", the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
2. ""zup lug wif"" shows ""lug"" again corresponding to ""blue"".
3. ""wif lug"" and ""wif lug bluf"" continue to show ""lug"" as ""blue"".
4. The final example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"", repeatedly translates ""lug"" to ""blue"" except in the last position after ""zup"", where ""lug"" is not present, and ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"". However, considering all the previous examples, the ""bluf"" transformation to ""yellow"" here appears inconsistent with the repeated link between ""bluf"" and ""red"" in earlier examples. Therefore, this last output seems to contain an error, assuming the previously established patterns hold.

Based on the consistent translations in the other examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output. Consistently across all examples, wherever the word 'wif' appears in the input, the word 'red' appears in the corresponding position in the output. There's a direct one-to-one mapping between 'wif' and 'red', meaning that in this context, 'wif' translates to the color 'red'.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" Each input contains a sequence of nonce words followed by an output of color words. It appears that each nonce word translates directly to a color word in the output.

Here's a breakdown of input-output pairs seen in the examples:

1. dax -> green
2. wif -> red
3. bluf -> yellow
4. lug -> blue
5. zup -> unknown

By examining the patterns, we can analyze the outputs to figure out what ""zup"" might translate to:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" with the output being ""yellow red red blue."" Since ""wif"" already corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" the only unaccounted color that appears when ""zup"" is present is ""yellow."" 

2. In the second example, ""zup"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" with the output sequence ""red yellow green."" We already know that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" so again, the only unaccounted color for ""zup"" here is ""yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""zup"" is next to ""bluf."" Since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" we see the output is ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" which is known to correspond to ""blue."" The sequence output for ""lug zup"" is ""blue yellow."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" by elimination ""zup"" corresponds again to ""yellow.""

5. The fifth example is similar to the fourth, with ""lug"" followed by ""zup"" and the output being ""blue yellow,"" signaling that ""zup"" stands for ""yellow.""

Combining our findings from all these examples, it seems clear that the rule is that ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, it defaults to green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" has the following rule:

Walm -> The preceding color word is repeated three times in the output.

Here are the supporting observations from the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug"" which means blue is followed by ""walm"", and the output repeats blue three times.
- In the second example, ""zup"" which means yellow is followed by ""walm"", and the output repeats yellow three times.
- In the third example, again ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm"", and the output repeats blue three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" which means green is followed by ""walm"", and the output is green repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" which means red is followed by ""walm"", and the output is red repeated three times.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" is preceded by a color word, the output is that color word repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm wif walm dax lug dax
    ",Output: green green green red red red green blue green,green green green red red red green blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, it seems that:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax"" from the examples provided, let us examine the input and corresponding output in each case.

1. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - Observing that each word converts to a specific color, we must determine what color ""dax"" corresponds to.

2. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   - We know ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"" from the previous example.
   - Given this, ""dax"" must correspond to ""green.""

3. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   - This confirms ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

4. Input: lug zup dax wif
   Output: blue yellow green red
   - Again, we see ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""
   - ""dax"" comes out as ""green"" once more.

5. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   - From the output, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""dax"" is consistent across all examples. ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" There do not appear to be any examples where ""wif"" corresponds to a different color, and the position of ""wif"" within the input does not seem to affect its output. Thus, one can deduce that ""wif"" translates directly to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Analyzing the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" based on the context in which it is used:

1. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   In the output sequence, after ""walm"" which is translated to ""green"", we see the new color ""yellow"" which corresponds to the word ""zup"".

2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. Input: zup lug zup lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue
   Each instance of ""zup"" corresponds directly to ""yellow"", while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   It appears that ""bluf"" is not given an independent color and the output is ""yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

5. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   ""wif"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""red"" here, followed by ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be consistent across all inputs, regardless of the surrounding words:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that it doubles the color associated with the word directly before it. The sequence always ends with a repetition of the previous color followed by blue. Here is the breakdown according to the examples:

1. lug bluf -> blue blue (lug corresponds to blue, followed by blue again)
2. wif bluf -> red red blue (wif corresponds to red, followed by red again, ending with blue)
3. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red (after the bluf sequence, the color corresponding to wif, which is red, appears)
4. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red (dax is green, so bluf causes it to repeat, followed by red for wif, then yellow for zup and red for the final wif)
5. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue (here bluf is preceded by lug, which corresponds to blue, so it is repeated after the red for wif and walm)

Rule: bluf -> Doubles the color of the previous word and adds blue at the end.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the immediately preceding word. 

For example:
- In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" repeats the color yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" repeats the color yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" repeats the color blue, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" ""wif"" is red, so ""walm"" repeats the color red, resulting in ""red red red.""
- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" repeats the color yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug
    ",Output: blue green blue,blue green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given examples. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red."" Here is the pattern observed:

- When ""wif"" is paired with ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), the output is ""red blue.""
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow""), the output is ""yellow red.""
- Regardless of what ""wif"" is surrounded by (""lug dax"" or ""dax lug"" etc.), the color ""red"" is consistently in the output whenever ""wif"" is present.

Thus, we can deduce:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each given example, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.
Based on the given examples, we can hypothesize a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's analyze each pair of input and output closely for patterns:

1. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and it would seem ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" as well.

2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   - In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the second instance of ""bluf"" corresponds again to ""blue.""

3. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: red red yellow yellow red
   - Here, when ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the ""bluf"" still translates to ""red."" However, when ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""walm"" seems to have a pattern of meaning ""red"" regardless of position, while ""bluf"" again translates to the color that precedes it.

5. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" after ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and after ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

By examining these examples, we deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color word that immediately precedes it three times. In each instance ""walm"" is used, the color word that comes right before ""walm"" is outputted three times. Here are the examples that support this:

- Input: lug walm translates to Output: blue blue blue.
- Input: lug walm zup leads to Output: blue blue blue yellow, where ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times, followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup"".
- Input: zup walm translates to Output: yellow yellow yellow, with ""walm"" causing ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.
- Input: dax lug dax lug walm leads to Output: green blue green blue blue blue, with ""walm"" causing ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- Input: wif lug walm translates to Output: red blue blue blue, with ""walm"" causing ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is included in the output. 

Here are the mappings from the inputs to the outputs:

- Input: zup wif lug -> Output: yellow red blue
  - ""lug"" corresponds to the final ""blue"" in this sequence.

- Input: lug -> Output: blue
  - ""lug"" is the sole word in the input and directly corresponds to ""blue"".

- Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
  - ""lug"" corresponds to the final ""blue"" in this sequence following the pattern established above.

- Input: lug wif zup wif -> Output: blue red yellow red
  - ""lug"" appears first and corresponds to the first output color ""blue"".

- Input: lug dax zup dax wif -> Output: blue green yellow green red
  - ""lug"" once again corresponds to ""blue"" at the beginning of both the input and output sequences.

Rule:
lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output. No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input string or the surrounding words, the output always contains ""green"" at the position where ""dax"" is in the input.

Here is the analysis of each example:

1. Input: ""wif lug dax"" -> Output: ""red blue green"" (dax correlates with green)
2. Input: ""zup bluf dax"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow green"" (dax correlates with green)
3. Input: ""lug dax"" -> Output: ""blue green"" (dax correlates with green)
4. Input: ""wif dax bluf"" -> Output: ""red green green"" (dax correlates with green, independent of position)
5. Input: ""wif bluf dax"" -> Output: ""red red green"" (dax correlates with green, independent of position)

Comparing these, it's clear that the input word ""dax"" consistently equals ""green"" in the output regardless of position or other context.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""wif"" by itself results in ""red.""
- When combined with other nonce words, ""wif"" still translates to ""red,"" but the position of ""red"" in the output corresponds to the position of ""wif"" in the input.

The other words also seem to consistently translate to specific colors:
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""walm"" seems to repeat the following color multiple times, based on the third example (""walm zup"" resulted in ""red red yellow""), increasing the count of the color that appears immediately after ""walm.""

Thus, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Each appearance of ""wif"" in the input string directly corresponds to a single instance of ""red"" in the output string, regardless of the position and combination with other nonce words.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" follows in the output sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the input and corresponding output.

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

2. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

By comparing inputs with their outputs, it seems that each occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the previous word, but when ""walm"" is followed by a different word (e.g., ""zup""), an extra ""yellow"" is added after the repetitions. For instance, in example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" so the output is ""red red red yellow."" Similarly, in example 2, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" resulting in ""green green green yellow."" In example 3, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is not followed by another word; hence the output is a repetition of ""blue"" corresponding to the number of letters in ""walm.""

Considering all these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated a number of times equal to the number of letters in ""walm"" (which is 4). If ""walm"" is followed by a different word, a ""yellow"" is added after the repetitions.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word four times (or add ""yellow"" if followed by another word).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue."" In every input-output pairing, wherever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" corresponds to it in the output. Here are the specific instances to support this conclusion:

- Input: lug zup | Output: blue yellow (lug maps to blue)
- Input: zup dax lug | Output: yellow green blue (lug maps to blue)
- Input: zup lug | Output: yellow blue (lug maps to blue)
- Input: dax zup lug zup bluf | Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow (lug maps to blue)
- Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug | Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue (lug maps to blue every time it appears)

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, where ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color in the output, we can deduce the following:

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

From these examples, whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output. It seems that other words in the input correspond to other specific colors in the output, but we are only focusing on the meaning of ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
dax -> green.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples. It seems that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. I'll list the repeated words and their corresponding colors:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> green
- bluf -> red

Now, let's examine the contexts where ""wif"" appears:

1. Input: ""lug wif dax"" -> Output: ""blue red green""
   - After ""lug"" (blue), ""wif"" translates to red.

2. Input: ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> Output: ""blue green yellow green green green red""
   - ""wif"" is at the end and translates to red.

3. Input: ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" -> Output: ""red blue blue yellow yellow green""
   - ""wif"" is at the beginning and translates to red.

4. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green""
   - ""wif"" at the beginning translates to red.

5. Input: ""dax wif"" -> Output: ""green red""
   - After ""dax"" (green), ""wif"" translates to red.

In every instance, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sentence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the meaning of ""zup"" is not context-dependent, as it consistently translates to the same word regardless of the words around it. Every instance of 'zup' in different contexts yields the same output, which is 'yellow'. This suggests that 'zup' is a one-to-one substitution for the color yellow in this system.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the color that is replicated in the output immediately after it. When ""bluf"" appears in the sequence, it takes on the color of the word that precedes it. Here are the observations:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which is the same as the color assigned to ""wif.""
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" comes after different words, and it again takes on the color of the preceding word. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow,"" the same color as ""zup."" In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green,"" which is the color that “dax” corresponds with.
- The fourth example confirms the pattern; ""bluf"" appears twice, and each time it matches the color of the preceding word.
- The fifth example also supports this observation, with ""bluf"" reproducing the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns and the associated colors in the output:

- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" corresponds to red (like ""wif""), and ""dax"" corresponds to green. After ""walm"" is introduced, the color green is repeated twice.

- In ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" the output is ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and we see new color patterns initiated after each ""walm."" After the first ""walm,"" we see the repetition of blue and after the second ""walm,"" we see a sequence of yellow.

- In ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" continues the color green.

- In ""lug wif walm,"" the output is ""blue red red red,"" showing that after ""walm"" is introduced, the color red is repeated.

- In ""dax walm,"" the output is repeated from an earlier example and confirms that ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to repeated greens.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" has the function of repeating the color associated with the real word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug
    ",Output: yellow green green blue,yellow green green green blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output. Each instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that irrespective of its position in a sequence, the word ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green."" Here are the examples confirming this pattern:

- Input: dax walm lug -> Output: green green green blue (dax corresponds to the first ""green"")
- Input: dax -> Output: green (dax is the only word and therefore corresponds to ""green"")
- Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red (dax corresponds to ""green"")
- Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> Output: red red yellow red blue green (dax corresponds to the last ""green"")
- Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue (dax corresponds to the first ""green"")

Based on this analysis, the rule is consistent and is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can surmise that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"". Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the same relative position. 

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the input (beginning, middle, or end), it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. The number of times ""zup"" appears in the input is equal to the number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: When preceded by the word ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means ""red."" When followed by the word ""lug,"" ""bluf"" maintains its meaning as ""red,"" but the word ""lug"" means ""blue."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the meaning switches from ""red"" to ""yellow,"" but as there is only one example of this (""zup bluf lug"" leading to ""yellow yellow blue""), this rule might not be reliable for ""bluf"" alone without more examples. However, in all provided examples where ""bluf"" is not following ""zup,"" it translates to ""red.""
Rule: The word ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word.""

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue,"" followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""
  
- In the second example, ""zup lug walm"" becomes ""yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue.""

- In the third example, ""dax wif walm"" turns into ""green red red red."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""red.""

- The fourth example, ""wif walm zup,"" is ""red red red yellow,"" where ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""walm"" repeats that color, and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red green green green blue."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" again repeats the color ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" functions to repeat the color that was mentioned just before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax bluf wif
    ",Output: green red red,green green red,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, each time the word ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. There is no varying context or additional information that changes the meaning of ""lug"" across the examples, so it's reasonable to deduce that the word ""lug"" means ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

The given examples consistently show that each time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output:

- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue green blue blue blue"", with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" each time it appears.
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"", where ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"".
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", where ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is used alone as input, the output is simply ""green"".
- Lastly, ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" outputs ""green green red yellow blue"", with ""dax"" corresponding to the first ""green"".

Therefore, based on the examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the contexts where it appears and the outputs for those contexts.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup      -> Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
Input: wif dax zup wif            -> Output: red green yellow red
Input: dax lug wif                    -> Output: green blue red
Input: wif bluf                           -> Output: red red
Input: wif lug dax walm           -> Output: red blue green green green

From these inputs and outputs, we can draw the following observations:

1. Every time the input starts with ""wif,"" the output starts with ""red.""
2. Matching the outputs to the inputs, ""wif"" does not seem to correspond to any other single color: it always results in ""red,"" regardless of what follows it.
3. ""wif"" at the end of an input sequence also results in a ""red"" output, suggesting the term itself leads to the output ""red"" independent of position.

Given the above observations, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: wif -> ""red"". The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. ""Wif"" results in ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""walm,"" which only appears once, also corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is represented by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". 

Here are the rules based on each example:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"", meaning ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", so ""bluf"" is taking the meaning of ""wif"" which is ""red"".
- The third example, ""lug bluf"", translates to ""blue blue"", again showing that ""bluf"" mimics the meaning of ""lug"", which is ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, the sequence ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"". Since ""zup"" means ""yellow"", ""bluf"" here is taking the meaning of ""zup"".
- Finally, in the fifth example ""dax bluf"" again translates to ""green green"", solidifying the evidence that ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of the word preceding it.

So the rule for ""bluf"" is:
bluf -> Takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the correlations between the inputs and outputs, looking for patterns that coincide with the appearance of ""walm.""

1. Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
2. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
3. Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
4. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug -> Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

It seems that each word in the input correlates with a color in the output. When ""walm"" is present, the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" is repeated three times:

1. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" causes the color of ""wif"" to be repeated three times.
2. ""lug walm"" -> Again, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" leads to the blue color being repeated three times.
3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" causes green to be repeated three times, then ""wif"" as red, followed by ""bluf"" as red.
4. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" leads to the blue color being repeated three times.
5. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" causes the yellow to be repeated three times, then ""wif"" as red, and finally ""lug"" as blue once more.

Rule:
""Walm"" causes the color associated with the word preceding it to be repeated three times in the output sequence. If there are more words after ""walm,"" their corresponding colors continue as usual after the three repetitions.

Therefore, we can deduce the meaning or function of ""walm"":
walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word 'lug' corresponds to the color blue. Here's the reasoning for each example:

- Every instance of 'lug' on its own has produced the output 'blue'.
- When combined with other words like 'bluf,' 'wif,' and 'walm,' the outputs are colors, and 'lug' consistently translates to 'blue'.
- Even in a sequence with other words and repeated uses of 'lug,' the word 'lug' always corresponds to the output 'blue'.

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"". Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is part of the corresponding output:

- Example 1: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""dax"" is directly followed by the word ""green"" in the output.
- Example 2: ""lug dax bluf"" outputs ""blue green green"", once again associating ""dax"" with ""green"".
- Example 3: ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"", where the first word ""dax"" corresponds to the first color ""green"" in the output.
- Example 4: ""dax"" by itself outputs ""green"", reinforcing ""dax"" as ""green"".
- Example 5: ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" outputs ""yellow green yellow green red red"", consistently pairing ""dax"" with the color ""green"".

Putting this information into the requested format:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color red regardless of its position in a sequence of words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following rules:

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- Other words consistently translate to other colors:
  - ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
  - ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
  - ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
  - The word ""bluf"" has only been used in sequence with ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow.""
  - The word ""walm"" has only appeared once and is followed by triple ""green,"" which does not provide enough information to deduce what ""walm"" means on its own.

Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:
Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Observing the examples, it appears the output is directly related to the input sequence with ""bluf"" affecting the color that is outputted after it. Let's try to deduce the rule by focusing on the ""bluf"" occurrences.

- In the first input ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and after ""bluf"", it is ""green"" again.
- In the second input ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"", ""wif"" is before ""bluf"", and both occurrences of ""wif"" correspond to ""red red"".
- In the third input ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" before ""bluf"" results in ""red red"" and ""dax"" after ""bluf"" results in ""green"".
- In the fourth input ""wif bluf lug zup"", ""wif"" before ""bluf"" leads to ""red red"", ""lug"" after ""bluf"" results in ""blue"", and ""zup"" results in ""yellow"".
- In the fifth input ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", we have ""lug"" before ""bluf"" leading to ""blue blue"", and ""wif"" immediately after ""bluf"" again results in ""red"".

Based on the above, it seems that the word ""bluf"" results in the output color repeating it twice from the word that comes directly before it. If that is the pattern, the rule would be as follows:

Rule: bluf causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated twice in the output. 

Thus: bluf -> the color of the preceding word is outputted twice.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to adopt the color associated with the color that immediately precedes it, repeated three times. Here is the supporting evidence for this rule:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in ""green green green.""
2. In the second example, ""dax"" again corresponds to green and is followed by ""walm,"" leading to another series of ""green green green.""
3. In the third example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" once more, and the output is again ""green green green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow; therefore, ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
5. In the final example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and again, it corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

According to these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> When preceded by a word that corresponds to a color, ""walm"" causes the output to repeat that color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm dax
    ",Output: blue blue blue green,blue blue blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". The output is unchanged regardless of the position or repetition of ""dax"" within the input sequence. Additionally, the presence of other words (e.g., ""lug"" or ""zup"") alongside ""dax"" results in the additional colors (e.g., ""blue"" or ""yellow"") appended to ""green"" in the output, but ""green"" always appears whenever ""dax"" is present.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color ""green"" in the output.
The examples given appear to show that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red when translated to English colors, based on its placement within sequences of colors. Here is the analysis of each example:

1. Input: ""dax wif lug dax"" 
   Output: ""green red blue green""
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

2. Input: ""wif walm lug bluf""
   Output: ""red red red blue blue""
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" but without other examples of ""walm"" and ""bluf,"" it is hard to definitively assign them colors. However, since ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue,"" this suggests ""walm"" might also correspond to ""red"" and ""bluf"" decomposes into ""blue"" twice, though this is not demonstrated by any other example given.

3. Input: ""zup wif""
   Output: ""yellow red""
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

4. Input: ""zup wif zup""
   Output: ""yellow red yellow""
   Consistent with other examples, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

5. Input: ""zup wif""
   Output: ""yellow red""
   Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Given the consistent translation of ""wif"" to ""red"" in every instance it appears, we can determine:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to repeating the color denoted by the following word twice. Analyzing each input-output pair confirms this:

- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow, and ""zup"" causes it to be repeated twice.
- ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green"": In addition to ""zup bluf"" yielding ""yellow yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green once.
- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red"": ""wif"" is red once, while ""zup wif"" leads to ""yellow red,"" with ""yellow"" being repeated by the presence of ""zup.""
- ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"": ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" is repeated three times based on its occurrence, and ""zup walm"" adds two more instances of ""yellow,"" demonstrating ""zup"" causes the color to repeat.
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": This is identical to the first example and reinforces the prior rule.

Given this consistent pattern, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> Repeat the color of the following word twice

Rule: When ""zup"" is followed by a word that correlates with a color, the output is that color repeated twice.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule about the meaning of ""bluf"":

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
3. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
4. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue
5. lug bluf zup -> blue blue yellow

Looking at the patterns, whenever ""bluf"" is used in the examples, it is translated into the color of the word that immediately precedes it. That is:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""bluf"" follows, also resulting in red.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow, and hence ""bluf"" results in yellow as well.
- In all other examples, we see the same pattern where ""bluf"" takes the same color value as the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> The color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"".
From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" by looking for patterns associated with its usage and the resulting outputs.

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" After ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   ""Wif"" is ""red"" again, and ""dax"" is ""green."" ""Walm"" is followed by two additional ""red"" before ""green.""

3. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" is also ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" there are two extra occurrences of ""yellow"" followed by ""blue.""

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" again, ""wif"" is ""red."" After ""walm,"" we see ""red"" repeated twice.

5. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" After ""walm,"" there are three ""red.""

By looking at these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that preceded it to be repeated. However, since three repetitions occur even when ""walm"" is the second word, as in the first example, the rule seems to be the following:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input, the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is the previous word color repeated three times. Rule:

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by examining its usage and output in each case:

Input: zup lug wif dax lug  
Output: yellow blue red green blue  
Here, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Input: lug zup dax zup  
Output: blue yellow green yellow  
Again, ""lug"" is the first word and corresponds to blue.

Input: lug zup  
Output: blue yellow  
The word ""lug"" again corresponds to blue.

Input: lug dax zup  
Output: blue green yellow  
Again, ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Input: dax lug walm  
Output: green blue blue blue  
Here, ""lug"" is seen after ""dax,"" which corresponds to green. ""lug"" still corresponds to blue, even when it is repeated multiple times (""blue blue blue"").

We see a consistent pattern where ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the series or the number of times it appears. 

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we can analyze the given input-output pairs. Here is the analysis:

- When the input is a single ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears before ""bluf"" and ""zup,"" it becomes ""green,"" while ""bluf"" becomes ""green,"" and ""zup"" becomes ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" appears twice with ""lug"" and ""zup"" in between, it is ""green"" each time, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""
- When ""dax"" appears before ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" it is ""green,"" while both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""red.""

From these patterns, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green."" The meaning of ""dax"" doesn't appear to be dependent on the context since it's always translating to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

dax -> green. Rule:
""Dax"" consistently translates to the word ""green,"" regardless of context.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the color 'red'. Whenever 'wif' appears in the input, 'red' appears in the output. The presence of 'wif' does not seem to be affected by the presence of other words such as 'dax' and 'lug', which correspond to 'green' and 'blue', respectively. Hence, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word 'wif' represents the color 'red'.
Analyzing the provided input and output pairs:

Input 1: zup wif walm
Output 1: yellow red red red

Input 2: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output 2: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input 3: zup lug bluf wif
Output 3: yellow blue blue red

Input 4: lug walm zup walm
Output 4: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

Input 5: wif zup bluf lug
Output 5: red yellow yellow blue

We can observe that the outputs are colors and each input word corresponds to a color word in the output. Let's look at words that we can match directly:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in every instance.
- ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of ""red red red"" when alone or ""yellow yellow yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" as well.

When ""zup"" is present, the word following ""zup"" changes color:
- In inputs 1 and 3, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow"" instead of ""red.""
- In input 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow"" instead of ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to involve changing the color associated with the following word. It appears to be changing the color to ""yellow"" regardless of what that next word normally translates to. Given this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" changes the color associated with the following word to ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should analyze the context in which it appears and identify any patterns or rules that lead to its output.

In the first example, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue."" Here, it's not clear what ""bluf"" means, but we can see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" 

In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow red red red."" We see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The term ""bluf"" must then be corresponding to a repeated color here again. Since ""walm"" is not repeated and doesn't correspond to ""bluf,"" it doesn't help identify ""bluf.""

The third input provides more context. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue."" Here, ""dax"" must correspond to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" again to ""blue."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it precedes ""lug"" (blue), it's possible that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color that follows it, therefore it's ""green"" in this context.

Continuing to the fourth input, which is the same as the first, the pattern holds: ""lug bluf"" still results in ""blue blue,"" strengthening the idea that ""bluf"" means repeat the following color.

In the fifth input, ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" becomes ""red yellow yellow red green."" Here again, ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeated color, which is ""yellow,"" the color following ""bluf.""

Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color word that follows it.

Bluf -> meaning: Repeat the following color word.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by examining the context in which it appears and the corresponding output. First, let's check each example:

1. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The presence of ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated twice before ""green.""

2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
Similarly, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and with ""walm"" present, the word ""blue"" is repeated two more times.

3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
In this case, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and with ""walm"" present, ""green"" is repeated two more times.

4. ""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red""
Here, each word ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""red"" respectively. When ""walm"" is added, the last color before it, ""red,"" is repeated two more times.

5. ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
In this example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated two more times.

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated two more times in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns based on the given input-output pairs:

1. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

2. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

3. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue

4. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

5. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green

From the examples, the output seems to change color with each input word. The word ""dax"" appears both at the beginning and at the end of the inputs, and regardless of its position, it is always translated to the output color ""green.""

Hence, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Every instance where the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the correlation between the input words and their respective output colors. The input 'zup' consistently corresponds to the output 'yellow' across all the examples. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, the input ""zup bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow yellow,"" indicating both 'zup' and 'bluf' translate to 'yellow.'
- In the second example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" from which we can deduce 'wif' translates to 'red' and 'zup' to 'yellow.'
- In the third example, ""wif zup wif dax"" results in ""red yellow red green."" From previous deductions, 'wif' is 'red,' 'zup' is 'yellow,' and the new word 'dax' corresponds to 'green.'
- The fourth example, ""zup bluf,"" repeats the first and thus confirms that both 'zup' and 'bluf' translate to 'yellow.'
- Finally, the fifth example, ""dax zup lug wif lug,"" results in ""green yellow blue red blue."" We already deduced that 'dax' is 'green,' 'zup' is 'yellow,' and 'wif' is 'red'; thus 'lug' must correspond to 'blue.'

Taking the consistent output for 'zup' across all instances, we can induce that:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word. For instance:

- wif bluf -> red red (because wif corresponds to red)
- dax bluf -> green green (because dax corresponds to green)
- lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue (because bluf follows lug, which corresponds to blue)
- wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow (because bluf follows lug, which corresponds to blue)
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (because zup corresponds to yellow)
Based on the given examples, we can see a pattern where the word ""walm"" affects the color output in the sequence that follows. To deduce the meaning or rule of ""walm,"" let's examine each example:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - Here, 'walm' is followed by 'zup,' and the output color 'blue' is repeated until 'zup' changes the color to 'yellow.'

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - 'walm' first follows 'dax,' and 'green' is repeated. 'Walm' then appears at the end after 'dax,' and 'green' is repeated again.

3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - 'walm' follows 'dax,' and 'green' is again repeated until 'wif' changes the color to 'red.'

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - 'walm' occurs after 'wif,' and the output color 'red' is repeated.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - 'walm' follows 'lug,' and the output color 'blue' is repeated.

From observing the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the previous color to repeat until a new color word appears. Therefore, we can write the meaning of ""walm"" as a rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color in the output until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue"" no matter its position in the input sequence. No other input word (""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax"") appears to influence the output associated with ""lug,"" as ""blue"" follows ""lug"" systematically. The meanings of other words do not seem to impact the meaning conveyed by ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to link the nonce word ""dax"" with the color ""green."" Every time the word ""dax"" is mentioned in an input, the corresponding output features the color ""green."" There does not seem to be variation in this pattern, suggesting the meaning of ""dax"" remains constant regardless of its position in the sequence. The other words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"" seem to correlate with the colors ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green,"" respectively. However, ""walm"" always appears in a repetition of ""green,"" perhaps indicating that ""walm"" means ""repeat previous color.""

Using this analysis, the rule can be deduced as: 

dax -> green.

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color: ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" seems to function as an instruction to repeat the color mentioned right before it.
Based on the examples provided, we can make the following observations:

1. Each time the word ""wif"" appears by itself, the output is ""red"".
2. When ""wif"" is combined with other words like ""lug"" or ""walm"", it seems to produce an output of ""red"", followed by other colors that correspond to those words.
3. The word ""wif"" doesn't change output color based on position, as it always results in ""red"" regardless of its position in a sequence.

Considering these observations, we can deduce the following:

Rule: wif -> the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" given that ""lug"" matches ""blue"" and ""dax"" matches ""green.""
- The second example confirms this rule as ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" each time, while ""lug"" and ""dax"" consistently output ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The third and fourth examples feature ""zup"" in isolation, both resulting in the output ""yellow,"" further confirming its correspondence.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow,"" ""lug"" in ""blue,"" ""dax"" in ""green,"" and ""wif"" in ""red."" ""Bluf"" results in a doubled word ""red red,"" which may indicate that ""bluf"" means to repeat the next color or to double the output, but since there is only one instance of ""bluf,"" this rule is not as solidly confirmed as the meaning of ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, one can deduce the following patterns:

1. ""wif"" consistently correlates with the output ""red.""
2. ""lug"" consistently correlates with the output ""blue.""
3. ""zup"" consistently correlates with the output ""yellow.""
4. ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green.""

From the examples provided, when ""bluf"" is used, it repeats the color of the word immediately before it. Let's see how this applies to each input:

- In ""wif lug zup bluf"": ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow."" Therefore, ""bluf"" also outputs ""yellow.""
- In ""wif bluf"": ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red."" Therefore, ""bluf"" also outputs ""red.""
- In ""zup bluf dax"": ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow."" Therefore, ""bluf"" also outputs ""yellow.""
- In ""zup bluf wif"": ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow."" Therefore, ""bluf"" also outputs ""yellow.""
- In ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"": ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red."" Therefore, ""bluf"" also outputs ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the word's position and the corresponding color in each example:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow

2. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

4. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

5. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Looking at these examples, we can observe that the color red always follows the word ""walm,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. This correlation is consistent in all provided examples, so it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: walm -> red

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we should look at the output each time ""lug"" appears in the input and look for patterns.

Let's go through each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""walm"" is not given directly, but because it's followed by three ""blue,"" we cannot determine if it's the ""lug"" or ""walm"" that translates to ""blue.""

2. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax | Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" is corresponding to ""yellow.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: dax bluf lug wif | Output: green green blue red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" here, which is different from the previous example where it corresponded to ""blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might change according to context or there's an error.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: lug wif bluf | Output: blue red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" here, which adds to the context-dependency hypothesis, but still leaves ""lug"" unexplained.

5. Input: dax lug wif | Output: green blue red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Now, let's look for the pattern for ""lug"":

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the out immediately following it is ""blue.""
- Considering the other words translate consistently to the same color except for ""bluf"" (which varies, indicating an error or that it's not directly translated into a color), we can surmise that ""lug"" directly translates to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green."" In situations where ""dax"" is present, the immediate output is the word ""green."" Meanwhile, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""walm"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

Therefore, we can deduce that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output, with the position of the word in the input directly matching the position of the color in the output. 

Given this information, the rule appears to be:
Each nonce word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. The sequence of colors matches the sequence of words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Each input example includes ""wif,"" and the corresponding output always includes ""red"" in the exact position where ""wif"" appears:

- lug wif -> blue red
- dax lug wif lug -> green blue red blue
- lug walm wif -> blue blue blue red
- wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- lug dax zup wif -> blue green yellow red

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" consistently each time it appears. Each example where ""zup"" is an input, ""yellow"" is consistently in the output. Other nonce words like ""dax"" and ""lug"" are paired with ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively, and their positions in the input also correspond to their positions in the output.

Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow"".
From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is a nonce word that translates directly to the color word that immediately precedes it. Let's analyze each example to confirm this hypothesis:

Example 1:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Here, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and translates to ""red"". The output for ""bluf"" is also ""red"".

Example 2:
Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
""Bluf"" is placed after ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"". The output for ""bluf"" here is also ""yellow"".

Example 3:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
In this case, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the corresponding color is ""yellow"". The output for ""bluf"" matches this and is ""yellow"".

Example 4:
Input: lug bluf dax lug
Output: blue blue green blue
""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is translated as ""blue"", indicating that ""bluf"" is also ""blue"".

Example 5:
Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Here, ""dax"" comes right before ""bluf"" and the translation for ""dax"" is ""green"". Consistently, ""bluf"" is also output as ""green"".

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, the rule can be determined as follows:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the color word that precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color generated by the word that directly precedes ""walm"". Here is the interpretation according to the examples:

1. In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", the color ""red"" is repeated before the final ""lug"" which is ""blue"". ""Wif"" means ""red"" and is repeated twice due to ""walm"".

2. In ""lug walm"", the color ""blue"" is repeated three times, indicating that ""walm"" caused the repetition of the color generated by ""lug"".

3. In ""lug walm dax"", the color ""blue"" is repeated three times before ""dax"" which generates ""green"".

4. In ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"", ""blue"" is repeated three times following ""lug walm"", and this sequence is surrounded by ""zup lug"" generating ""yellow blue"".

5. In ""lug zup dax walm"", ""green"" is generated by ""dax"" and repeated three times due to ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the word directly before it to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif bluf
    ",Output: blue green red red,blue green red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Considering the examples given:

1. Input: dax lug | Output: green blue
2. Input: wif lug dax | Output: red blue green
3. Input: dax lug bluf wif | Output: green blue blue red
4. Input: lug walm wif | Output: blue blue blue red
5. Input: dax lug | Output: green blue

Let's analyze what happens with and without ""lug"":

- In examples 1 and 5, ""dax lug"" consistently corresponds to ""green blue"".
- In example 2, ""wif"" is before ""lug"", and after ""dax"", with the output being ""red blue green"".
- In example 3, ""dax"" is before ""lug"" and ""bluf wif"" are after, translating to ""green blue blue red"".
- In example 4, ""lug"" is at the beginning, followed by ""walm wif"", with the output translating to ""blue blue blue red"".

An immediate observation is that ""lug"" appears to consistently result in the word ""blue"" appearing in the output, regardless of its position in the input. Its position relative to other words does not change this.

The other words also correspond to specific colors:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" as well, similar to ""lug"".
- ""walm"" has not been shown in isolation, but in example 4, it is likely that it also corresponds to ""blue"" considering the output is ""blue blue blue red"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Given the examples provided, the rule appears to be that particular words map to specific colors. We can analyze each occurrence of the words to determine their corresponding colors:

- ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in both instances it appears.
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" when it comes after ""dax,"" but is ""red"" when it comes after ""wif.""
- ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and is followed by ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" is also preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""yellow.""

Since ""wif"" always results in ""red"" without exception, regardless of whether it is followed by other words or not, we can establish that:

wif -> red. Rule: The word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'.
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Additionally, it seems to insert ""yellow"" twice in the output. Each remaining word corresponds to a single color in the output.

Here are the words and their corresponding colors from the examples:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (given by the first example)
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red"" in the third example but ""blue"" in the other examples. This discrepancy could imply that ""walm"" takes the color of the word immediately following it. Since there is no word after ""walm"" in the third example, it defaults to ""red"".

By using the given examples and analyzing the patterns, the rule for ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> inserts ""yellow"" twice into the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" results in an output of two consecutive colors that match the color preceding it. Here's the analysis:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which translates to ""red,"" resulting in ""red red.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again, yielding ""red red.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which translates to ""green,"" resulting in ""green green.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which translates to ""blue,"" yielding ""blue blue.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: *bluf* results in two consecutive occurrences of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repeated color that immediately follows in the sequence. The color that is repeated is the one that was last mentioned before ""walm"". Below is the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""...zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" - ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""yellow"" which follows ""zup"".
- Example 2: ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red"" - ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""green"" which follows ""dax"".
- Example 3: ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"" - ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""blue"" which follows ""lug"".
- Example 4: ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green"" - ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""blue"" after ""lug"".
- Example 5: ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red"" - ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""red"" which follows ""wif"".

Rule: walm -> repeat the last mentioned color immediately before ""walm""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" There are no instances in which the context changes the meaning of ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the term ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Regardless of the other words present (like ""zup"" or ""lug"" which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively, as seen from the third example), ""dax"" always results in the output ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Here is the rule induction from the examples:

- ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue red blue blue"": ""wif"" is surrounded by ""lug"" which results in ""blue"", translating ""wif"" to ""red"".
- ""wif"" -> ""red"": ""wif"" stands alone and the output is simply ""red"".
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue"": Here, ""wif"" produces ""red"" and is followed by ""walm"" and ""lug"" which also produce ""red"", with ""bluf"" translating to ""blue"".
- ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red"": ""lug"" and ""bluf"" are associated with ""blue"" and ""wif"" at the end translates to ""red"".
- ""zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow red green"": ""wif"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax"", which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively, and ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by looking at the correlations in each example.

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Here, ""zup"" by itself translates directly to ""yellow.""

Input: wif dax zup
Output: red green yellow

In this example, ""zup"" still translates to ""yellow."" Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" might translate to ""red,"" and ""dax"" might translate to ""green.""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Again, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and following the previous assumption, ""wif"" is ""red.""

Input: zup
Output: yellow

The same as the first input, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

In this longer sequence, ""zup"" appears three times and each time it translates to ""yellow."" ""Dax"" appears twice, translating to ""green"" each time, and ""wif"" appears once, translating to ""red,"" which is consistent with the previous example. ""Bluf"" might translate to ""green,"" and ""lug"" is not associated with ""zup,"" but it could mean ""blue"" given the output.

Considering all the examples, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent. It always translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of the other words in the sequence. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it. Let's see if this hypothesis holds true for each example:

1. lug wif dax bluf wif lug outputs blue red green green red blue. Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and the output is green, which is the same color assigned to ""dax"".

2. dax bluf outputs green green. Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is green, which again is the same as ""dax"".

3. dax bluf wif zup dax outputs green green red yellow green. In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is green, which matches ""dax"".

4. zup lug bluf outputs yellow blue blue. In this sequence, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and the output is blue, which matches ""lug"".

5. wif bluf lug zup outputs red red blue yellow. In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is red, which matches ""wif"".

Every instance of ""bluf"" has the same color output as the word before it. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to function as a repeater of the preceding color.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I'll look for patterns associated with the output colors every time ""walm"" appears in the input:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   
3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Looking at these examples:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, the color immediately following ""walm"" is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm.""
- In the first example, ""wif"" outputs red, and ""walm"" is followed by red.
- In the third example, ""zup"" outputs yellow, and ""walm"" is followed by yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" outputs green, and ""walm"" is followed by green.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to indicate that the following color should be a repetition of the previous color.

Rule: walm -> makes the next output color repeat the previous output color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" appears to consistently translate to the color ""blue."" We can infer this because every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Consider each example:

1. wif dax zup wif -> red green yellow red
2. zup dax -> yellow green
3. lug zup dax lug -> blue yellow green blue
4. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
5. wif dax lug dax -> red green blue green

In every instance where the word ""dax"" appears, it is translated to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words surrounding it. Therefore, the rule is quite straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green
Through the analysis of the given examples, it is possible to derive a rule for the nonce word 'wif'.

1. When 'wif' is followed by 'lug', the output is 'red blue'.
2. When 'wif' appears before 'dax', the output starts with 'red green'.
3. 'Wif' followed by 'bluf' results in 'red red'.
4. In the sequence 'lug wif lug', the output is 'blue red blue'.
5. When 'wif' is at the end of a sequence, like in 'zup wif', the output ends with 'yellow red'.

Based on the pattern that 'wif' consistently translates to 'red' when it precedes another color, we can infer its meaning.

Rule: wif -> 'red'

This implies that 'wif' represents the color 'red', and in every instance where 'wif' appears, the corresponding output includes the color 'red' at the exact position where 'wif' is located in the input.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided context and the observable patterns in the examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf.""

Let's look at the word associations in the outputs:

- ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and occurs twice when ""bluf"" is also present.
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and occurs once after ""bluf.""

Given that ""lug"" means blue and appears alongside ""bluf"" and ""bluf"" results in two color outputs ""blue red,"" we can also observe that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a single color output but rather gives two outputs: ""blue red.""

Now, if we carefully examine the first and last example:

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

The ""lug bluf"" sequence in the first input gives us ""blue red red,"" while in the last input, where ""bluf"" is directly following ""lug,"" we get ""blue blue."" It seems that ""bluf"" may take on the color of the word before it (in the last example, ""lug"" meaning ""blue""), followed by the color ""red."" In other examples, ""bluf"" follows this pattern.

Thus, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, followed by the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, 'walm' appears to correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, three times. Here is the analysis:

- 'zup walm' outputs 'yellow yellow yellow'; 'zup' must represent 'yellow'.
- 'lug walm wif lug bluf' outputs 'blue blue blue red blue blue'; 'lug' must represent 'blue', and 'walm' causes the preceding color 'blue' to be repeated three times.
- 'lug zup dax walm' outputs 'blue yellow green green green'; 'dax' must represent 'green', with 'walm' repeating it three times.
- 'dax walm' outputs 'green green green'; similarly, 'walm' repeats the color 'green' associated with 'dax'.
- 'zup walm lug' outputs 'yellow yellow yellow blue'; again 'walm' repeats the color 'yellow' associated with 'zup' before 'lug' represents blue.

Rule: walm -> the repetition of the color represented by the word immediately before it, three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Evidence for this rule can be found in every example where the input contains ""lug"" and the corresponding output always contains ""blue,"" irrespective of the other words present:

- ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue""
- ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue""
- ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" has ""lug"" resulting in ""blue"" amid other colors linked to other inputs like ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm.""
- ""lug dax zup lug wif"" sees ""lug"" translated to ""blue"" on two separate occasions.
- ""lug dax"" leads to ""blue green"" with ""lug"" resulting in ""blue"" once again.
Analyzing the input and output pairs:

1. lug dax lug -> blue green blue
2. dax bluf wif -> green green red
3. dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
4. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
5. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Based on the given input-output pairs, we can deduce the following:

- The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""bluf"" seems to be a variant of ""blue,"" but it also gets translated to ""green"" in pair 2, which may initially appear conflicting.

When ""dax"" appears:

- In pairs 1 and 5, it is preceded or followed by the word ""lug,"" and it turns into ""green.""
- In pairs 2, 3, and 4, it is followed by different words, and each occurrence of a new word after ""dax"" results in the word ""green.""

It seems that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" but it may also have a rule associated with it where it affects the color following it. However, this rule is not entirely clear because in pair 2, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in ""green green,"" whereas in pair 5, ""bluf"" without a preceding ""dax"" results in a ""blue"" as the first instance of ""bluf.""

Given these inconsistencies, we need a rule to explain the transformation of ""bluf"" and the exact implication of ""dax"" on subsequent words. One might hypothesize that ""dax"" turns the following color word into ""green,"" except if it is ""red"" (as seen with ""wif""). 

However, without additional clear and consistent data, deriving an exact rule is challenging. Assuming ""dax"" simply translates to ""green,"" and considering it might influence the following word under certain conditions, which are not entirely clear from the given examples, the rule stands as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green"" (with a potential secondary rule affecting the following color word, but this is not conclusively defined by the examples provided).
Based on the given examples, every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" There does not appear to be any dependency on the position or context of ""wif"" in the input sequence; it consistently maps to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the output ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in an input, ""yellow"" is in the corresponding output at the same position where ""zup"" appeared. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is that it corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided:

- When ""lug walm wif bluf"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue red red"". Here, lug seems to correspond to blue, walm corresponds to blue, wif corresponds to red, and bluf appears associated with red.
- ""wif bluf"" inputs consistently result in ""red red"" outputs, indicating that both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" may correspond to the color red.
- The input ""zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow red red red"", where zup corresponds to yellow, wif corresponds to red, and walm as previously seen corresponds to blue, but the output does not reflect blue. Instead, an additional red is present, again suggesting a connection to bluf.
- Finally, ""lug bluf"" input results in ""blue blue"", tying back to the association of lug with blue, and potentially bluf if we consider blue as being represented twice.

Given these observations, bluf seems to consistently correspond to the color red in the output, even though it appears alongside different words representing other colors. It seems that the presence of bluf overrides any other color word it is paired with and enforces a red output.

bluf -> meaning. Rule: bluf corresponds to the color red.
Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with the previous word as the primary rule, and if it is the first word in a sequence it defaults to ""blue"". 

Let's analyze the examples.

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red; then ""walm"" repeats the red for the next two outputs.

2. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue; then ""walm"" repeats the blue, and finally, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
- It starts with ""zup"" corresponding to yellow, followed by ""dax"" for green, then ""lug"" for blue; ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (twice), then we go back to ""zup"" for yellow and ""lug"" for blue again.

4. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- It starts with ""zup"" corresponding to yellow; ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" then ""lug"" changes it to blue, and ""wif"" to red.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
- It starts with ""lug"" corresponding to blue; ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug.""

Given this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: walm -> When following a word, repeats the color associated with the preceding word. If it is the first word, defaults to blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words. Every instance where ""lug"" appears, the output includes ""blue"" in the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided:

Input: dax zup lug wif lug  
Output: green yellow blue red blue  

Input: wif dax  
Output: red green  

Input: zup dax bluf  
Output: yellow green green  

Input: lug walm dax  
Output: blue blue blue green  

Input: dax  
Output: green  

We can deduce:

zup -> yellow  
lug -> blue  
wif -> red  
bluf and walm are not directly translated, but 'dax' appears after them and results in the color green. Therefore, their specific color translation is not required for this exercise.

The word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green', regardless of its position in the list.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"", as every output containing ""wif"" also contains ""red"". Here is how that relationship works in each example:

- ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow"": ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""zup wif lug"" -> ""yellow red blue"": ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red"": ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""wif"" -> ""red"": ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red"".
- ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red"": ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided. Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the presence of other words, ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" in the output.
Analyzing the given examples:

1. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
2. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
3. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
4. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
5. wif bluf dax -> red red green

Looking at these examples, the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in Outputs 1, 2, and 3, to ""blue"" in Output 4, and to ""red"" in Output 5.

The pattern here is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned just before it:

- In Output 1, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" we get ""bluf"" = ""yellow.""
- In Output 3, ""zup"" is again before ""bluf,"" which results in ""bluf"" = ""yellow.""
- In Output 4, ""lug"" is before ""bluf,"" which translates to ""blue,"" hence ""bluf"" = ""blue.""
- In Output 5, ""wif"" is before ""bluf,"" which means ""red,"" thus ""bluf"" = ""red.""

The rule is: bluf refers to the same color as the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: bluf adopts the color of the word that comes right before it.
walm -> repeated color of the preceding word. Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is used after a word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times. 

For ""zup walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" which means ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated thrice. Similarly, for ""dax walm"", the output is ""green green green"", indicating ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats it thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif
    ",Output: yellow red,yellow red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> repeats the color word that follows it.

Rule: If a color word follows ""lug"", the output will be the color word repeated the same number of times as the number of ""lug"" preceding it. If ""lug"" precedes a non-color word, the output is simply ""blue"" for each ""lug"".
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. Input: ""dax"" alone results in Output: ""green."" This shows that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in a one-to-one relationship when it's the only word.

2. ""zup lug zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow red green"". Here, ""zup"" is repeated and each ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and “wif” corresponds to ""red."" ""dax"" at the end of the sequence corresponds to ""green.""

3. ""wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red blue green."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

4. ""zup walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" appears to repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word (as it is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""yellow""), and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""dax"" in the sequence corresponds to ""green.""

5. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green."" From this, it can be inferred that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word or sequence of words (""dax"" representing ""green""). Thus, ""dax"" retains its meaning of ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes repetition.

dax -> green. Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of context within the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of the position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""previous color mentioned""

Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes immediately before it (if there is one). Here's the breakdown:

Example 1: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug""
- ""wif"" yields red.
- ""zup"" comes next and yields yellow.
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", so it takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- ""lug"" yields blue.
- ""walm"" has no associated color, so it's skipped.
- ""dax"" yields green.
- ""lug"" again yields blue.
- ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" this time, so it takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.

Example 2: ""zup lug bluf""
- ""zup"" yields yellow.
- ""lug"" yields blue.
- ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and takes the color blue.

Example 3: ""zup bluf""
- ""zup"" yields yellow.
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and takes the color yellow.

Example 4: ""lug zup bluf dax""
- ""lug"" yields blue.
- ""zup"" yields yellow.
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and takes the color yellow.
- ""dax"" yields green.

Example 5: ""dax bluf wif zup wif""
- ""dax"" yields green.
- ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and takes the color green.
- ""wif"" yields red.
- ""zup"" yields yellow.
- ""wif"" again yields red.

This rule consistently explains the transformation from the input to the output in all provided examples.
walm -> repeated sequence of three colors based on the first word's color, followed by the fourth color which is based on the second word's color.

Rule:  
- Identify the color associated with the first word in the sequence.
- Repeat that color three times.
- Identify the color associated with the second word in the sequence.
- Place the second word's associated color after the three repeated colors.

Let's test this rule with the given examples:

For ""zup walm lug"":
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Repeat ""yellow"" three times: ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- Combine the repeated color with the fourth color: ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""
The output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which matches.

For ""wif walm dax"":
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- Repeat ""red"" three times: ""red red red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- Combine the repeated color with the fourth color: ""red red red green.""
The output is ""red red red green,"" which matches.

This rule seems to apply to all provided examples correctly.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the outputs. Regardless of the context or the words that come before or after ""lug,"" whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word (dax, zup, lug, wif) is mapped to a specific color:

- The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the sequence. Here is the rule deduction:

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
- In this sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" both times it appears.

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- ""Zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow"".

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
- Again, ""zup"" is ""yellow"" both times, and the other words correspond to different colors without affecting the meaning of ""zup"".

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"" as in the previous examples.

Input: dax zup lug
Output: green yellow blue
- ""Zup"" is ""yellow"", and the presence of other words (such as ""dax"" which seems to mean ""green"" and ""lug"" which seems to mean ""blue"") does not change this.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of the context or position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. The word ""walm"" is always translated to a sequence of repeated colors. We will compare the input and output sequences to find the rule.

- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, it is followed by the same color word repeated a number of times.
- The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of words in the input sequence before ""walm.""

For examples:
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow,"" with ""green"" being repeated three times, corresponding to the three words (""lug wif dax"") that precede ""walm.""
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" with ""green"" repeated twice, corresponding to the one word (""dax"") that precedes ""walm.""
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue,"" with ""red"" repeated three times corresponding to the single word (""wif"") that precedes ""walm.""
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red,"" with ""blue"" being repeated three times, matching the single word (""lug"") before ""walm.""

From this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word, as many times as there are words that precede ""walm.""

Therefore,

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word, equal to the number of words that precede ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the input and output examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Here are the deductions:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""red red blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue,"" supporting the previous deduction that ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- The third example, ""lug zup,"" corresponds to ""blue yellow,"" with ""lug"" being the first word to be translated, aligning again with ""blue.""
- The fourth example includes multiple instances where the pattern of color translation is consistent with previous examples, and ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"" each time it appears.
- The fifth example, ""lug zup lug,"" directly translates to ""blue yellow blue,"" which reinforces that ""lug"" consistently means ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the given input and corresponding output patterns:

1. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
2. ""dax"" -> ""green""
3. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""dax"" -> ""green""
5. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""

Looking at the patterns, it seems clear that whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" No matter what other words are present or their order, ""dax"" consistently yields ""green."" 

Therefore, we can induce that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is in the output.
- The words ""bluf"", ""lug"", and ""zup"" correspond to specific colors in the output.
- The word ""wif"" does not seem to change its output depending on position or surrounding words.

From the examples:

1. ""wif bluf"" maps to ""red red""
2. ""wif lug"" maps to ""red blue""
3. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" maps to ""red red yellow red blue green""

These examples suggest that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". The word ""bluf"" is always followed by ""red"" in the output (except when preceded by ""wif""), which also hints that ""bluf"" itself may mean ""red"". The other words translate to colors that are not ""red"", based on their positions and consistent output in the examples.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be consistent. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Thus, the rule can be written as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue. Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is produced in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color that is represented by the word that comes immediately before it. The rule can be identified as follows:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is green repeated three times, suggesting that ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is red repeated three times, indicating that ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is blue repeated three times, implying that ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.

Therefore, the rule is that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes just before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup dax
    ",Output: blue yellow green,blue yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to look at its position relative to the other words and the corresponding output colors in each example. Let's analyze each instance:

1. Input: dax wif zup
   Output: green red yellow

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow

3. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green

4. Input: zup dax lug zup
   Output: yellow green blue yellow

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

From the examples, we can observe the following correlations:

- ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red.""
- ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" seems to be associated with ""red,"" similar to ""wif,"" whenever it appears directly after ""wif.""

Now, focusing on ""dax,"" we notice that:
- When ""dax"" appears at the beginning (as in examples 1 and 2), the first color is always ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears after ""wif lug"" (as in example 3) or before ""walm"" (as in example 3), the color for ""dax"" is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears directly after ""zup"" (as in example 4) or ""wif walm"" (as in example 5), the color for ""dax"" is ""green.""

In all instances, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: dax -> green
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" has a consistent corresponding output of ""red"". However, the word ""wif"" also affects the words following it. To determine the pattern, let's consider other words and their outputs:

- ""dax"" results in ""green"" when it comes after ""wif.""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" when it follows ""wif dax.""
- ""lug"" and ""walm"" result in ""blue"" when they precede ""wif.""
- ""bluf"" results in ""red"" only when following ""wif""; otherwise, it contributes to a ""blue"" output as in ""lug walm.""

Based on this analysis, the word ""wif"" seems to transform the following words to specific colors. Here's a tentative rule based on the given examples:

- ""wif"" by itself results in ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by a word, that word transforms to ""red,"" and each subsequent word follows a pattern, transforming based on its position after ""wif"" but not its inherent order in the list (green, yellow, green, etc.).
- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"" or ""walm,"" they become ""blue,"" and following ""wif,"" they result in ""green.""
- The effect of ""wif"" only applies to words that come after it, not before.

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" is that it means ""red"" and may influence the color transformation of the words that follow it.

Rule: wif -> red (and influences the color transformation of subsequent words)
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input sentences is translated to ""yellow"" in the output sentences, regardless of the position of the word in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word"".

Explanation:

1. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to red; therefore, ""bluf"" is also red.

2. ""lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue green green"". Again, the word ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to green; hence, ""bluf"" repeats the color green.

3. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue"". The first ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is green, so ""bluf"" is green; the second ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, so the second ""bluf"" is yellow.

4. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". ""Bluf"" directly follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, hence ""bluf"" also becomes yellow.

5. ""lug bluf dax lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue"". ""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, so ""bluf"" is blue.

bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
Given the examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated word in the color output sequence. Looking at the colors, there seems to be a consistent rule where each input word translates to a specific color. Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to yellow.
- ""dax"" seems to consistently translate to green.
- ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to red.
- ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to blue.

Now examining the occurrences of ""walm"":

1. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and leads to an additional ""yellow"" being added to the output.

2. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and leads to an additional ""green"" being added to the output.

3. dax wif walm -> green red red red
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and leads to additional ""red"" being added to the output.

4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and leads to additional ""red"" being added to the output.

5. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- The first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and three additional ""red"" are added to the output.
- The second ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and leads to two additional ""yellow"" being added to the output.

From these observations, it looks like ""walm"" duplicates the color output of the immediately preceding input word. Here is the induction rule:

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before it in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's observe the patterns based on the input and output pairs provided.

In the first pair, “lug dax” translates to “blue green”.
In the second pair, we see that the sequence “lug” is consistently translated to “green” as it does in the first pair, and “wif” is consistently translated to “red”. The presence of “dax” in the second sequence does not seem to disrupt the pattern of the translations for “lug,” “wif,” or “walm,” which seems to consistently translate to “green.”
In the third pair, “wif walm dax zup” translates to “red red red green yellow.” Here, “zup” at the end of the sequence translates to “yellow,” as it does in the beginning of the second pair. “wif” and “walm” are consistent in their translation as “red” and “green” respectively, regardless of “dax”'s position in the sequence.
In the fourth pair, 'lug dax lug' translates sequentially as “blue green blue,” reinforcing the consistent translation of “lug” to “blue” or “green.”
In the fifth pair, ""zup dax walm"" translates to “yellow green green green,” which again shows that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" to ""green,"" irrespective of ""dax"" being between them.

From these examples, we can see that “lug,” “zup,” “walm,” and “wif” consistently translate to specific colors, regardless of their position relative to “dax.”

However, we need to determine what “dax” itself translates to, and more importantly, we should define what rule “dax” might be following. As we analyze the examples, we see that “dax” follows “lug” or “walm” but does not alter their translations. ""Dax"" is always associated with a “green” output after it, which is independent of the word before “dax” (except in pairs where ""dax"" is at the end of the sequence, where we don't have an output to compare).

Considering the data provided, “dax” does not seem to have a direct translation on its own, but rather it seems to induce the following word to be translated as “green,” irrespective of what that word might translate to in absence of “dax.”

Rule: dax -> When following a word, it causes the next word to translate to ""green"".
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: zup lug wif dax lug -> Output: yellow blue red green blue
Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
Input: dax zup walm wif walm -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

From these examples, the constant element is that each time the term ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. In contrast, other words in the input result in different color words in the output.

Rule: wif -> red

Hence, the meaning of ""wif"" is ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following associations for each word:

- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""

It looks like each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"". This suggests that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"". So, in every instance where ""zup"" is present, ""yellow"" is a corresponding output in the same position. 

The rule can be stated as: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" is a word that duplicates the color directly associated with the word before it. Here is the observed pattern:

- lug bluf -> blue blue
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
- wif bluf -> red red
- wif bluf dax -> red red green

From the examples, we see that each time ""bluf"" is used, the color word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. Additionally, any color word that follows ""bluf"" is not duplicated but is simply translated into its corresponding color in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

bluf -> Repeat the color word that precedes it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color-indicating word, it causes that word to be repeated in the output. If a color word follows ""bluf,"" it is not duplicated but rather translated normally.
To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in each input and its corresponding output.

In each example where ""walm"" appears, the word that comes right after it corresponds to the color ""red."" Hence, it seems that ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color ""red"" in the output. Let's verify this with each example:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""red"" three times.

2. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   Here ""walm"" is followed by a single ""red.""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   In this example, ""walm"" appears twice: once followed by three ""red"" and once by one ""red"" respectively.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Again, ""walm"" corresponds to three ""red"" here.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Just like the first example, ""walm"" is followed by three ""red.""

Consistently, ""walm"" triggers the appearance of ""red"" in the output. However, the number of times ""red"" appears after ""walm"" varies. It seems that ""walm"" is not responsible for the number of times ""red"" appears; it just signals that ""red"" should appear at that position in the output. The number of ""red"" that follows seems to be determined by another element of the input.

Hence, the rule we can induce from these examples is that ""walm"" indicates the presence of the color ""red"" in the output, with the number of reds determined separately.

Rule: walm -> Indicates the color ""red"" in the output. The quantity is determined by another factor.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm
    ",Output: yellow green blue red red red,yellow green blue blue blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we observe that every time the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" is present in the corresponding output. However, the position of ""lug"" in the input does not appear to determine its position in the output. 

Other words in the examples seem to correspond to specific colors consistently as well:
- ""wif"" correlates with the output ""red""
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"" (Note: ""bluf"" appears in the input twice and corresponds with ""red"" in both instances in the output)
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""

Given this, the rule for ""lug"" can be summarized as:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look at the corresponding outputs in each example and find the common factor.

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as well, while ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" still matches ""green"", with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""zup"" again to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is ""green"" once more, and ""lug"" is ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again, while ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"".

The common rule for all of these examples is that no matter the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the other words present, it always corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:

- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- The word ""walm"" has a repeated pattern indicating that each occurrence translates to an additional ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the output reflects the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> red

Rule: Each word corresponds to a color name. ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". In all the given input examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"". Thus, the nonce word ""bluf"" means ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns based on the given inputs and outputs.

In the provided examples, ""walm"" consistently corresponds to a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it in the output. Here are the instances of ""walm"" and the output that follows it:

1. walm lug -> red red red blue
    - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputted as ""red,"" thus ""walm"" results in three additional ""red"" before the next word's color (lug -> blue).

2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
    - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputted as ""blue,"" thus ""walm"" results in three ""blue.""

3. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
    - The first ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs as ""green,"" resulting in two additional ""green."" The second ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs as ""red,"" thus it results in two additional ""red.""

4. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
    - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputted as ""green,"" thus ""walm"" results in two more ""green.""

5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
    - ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputted as ""yellow,"" thus ""walm"" results in three additional ""yellow.""

In every case, the word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that preceded it. If the first word in the sequence is immediately followed by ""walm,"" then ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the first word.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color output of the word before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup lug wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue red green blue""
- ""lug wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue blue""
- ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
- ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue""
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue red blue""

It appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"". 

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, the rule can be deduced as follows:

- When ""dax"" appears in the input, the first output color is always ""green.""
- There seems to be a one-to-one correspondence between each additional word in the input and a color in the output, with the same word corresponding to the same color each time (e.g., ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"").
- The position of ""dax"" in the input does not affect the output color it corresponds to; it always corresponds to ""green.""
- The presence of ""dax"" does not alter the correspondence of subsequent words to their respective colors.

Rule: dax -> green. When ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words in the sequence correspond to other specific colors.
Upon examining the given examples, we can deduce a pattern that ascribes a particular color to each nonce word. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the same color across all examples. To identify what ""wif"" represents, let's compare the outputs taking into consideration the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence.

Considering the following pairs:

- ""dax lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green blue red red""
- ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" corresponds to ""red green red red yellow red""
- ""dax wif zup dax"" corresponds to ""green red yellow green""
- ""dax zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
- ""wif dax wif"" corresponds to ""red green red""

The word ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" appears multiple times and consistently maps to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule we deduce is:

Rule: wif corresponds to the color red.

So, the rule is:

wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following representations of each input word:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow

Therefore, in every instance where ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"". It seems that ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. 

Hence, the rule can be written as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the output color to be repeated. For each instance of ""bluf"" in the input, the color word just before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.

Examples to support the rule:
1. ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" – ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"" from ""wif"".
2. ""zup bluf"" in the second example leads to ""yellow yellow"".
3. ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red"" – ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"" from ""wif"".
4. ""wif dax bluf"" turns into ""red green green"" – ""bluf"" repeats the color ""green"" from ""dax"".
5. ""dax zup lug bluf"" produces ""green yellow blue blue"" – ""bluf"" repeats the color ""blue"" from ""lug"".

Rule: bluf -> causes the previous color to be repeated in the output.
Through analyzing the given examples, it becomes apparent that each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of colors in the outputs provided. Based on the examples, ""walm"" induces a pattern in which whatever color is mentioned just before ""walm"" is repeated until a different color word appears. We can apply this rule to the provided examples to understand how it works:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   Rule application: ""lug"" is blue, so repeat blue for ""walm"" until a different color, ""zup"" which is yellow, is mentioned.

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Rule application: Similarly, the last color mentioned before ""walm"" is red (""wif""), so it repeats until ""lug"" which is blue.

3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Rule application: ""lug"" is blue before the first ""walm"", so blue repeats. Then ""wif"" is red before the second ""walm"", so red repeats.

4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   Rule application: The color before ""walm"" is ""dax"" which corresponds to green, so green is repeated.

5. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Rule application: The color before the first ""walm"" is ""wif"" which is red, so red is repeated. The last color before the second ""walm"" is ""zup"" which is yellow, so yellow is repeated.

Based on the rule observed, we can define ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color word preceding ""walm"" until a new color word appears.

Rule: If the word before ""walm"" is a color word, repeat the corresponding color until another color word is encountered in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule:
- Each instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples provided, where the input word ""dax"" always corresponds to the output color ""green"", we can deduce that the word ""dax"" represents the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that each nonce word corresponds to a color:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Rule: wif means red.
Based on the use of the nonce word ""zup"" in the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each instance of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output. Here's the induction based on the examples:

- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""walm"" -> repeating the immediately preceding color thrice

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, output ""yellow"".
Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

In the first example, every instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

In the second example, the single occurrence of ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color ""green.""

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green

The third and fourth examples further reinforce the idea that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" as every occurrence of ""bluf"" results in the color ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax lug bluf dax
Output: green blue blue green

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

The fifth example, which contains only ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" yields ""green green,"" showing that ""bluf"" by itself is still ""green.""

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Rule:
bluf -> green

Meaning:
""bluf"" means ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to take on the color of the word that precedes it. The output colors match the colors typically associated with the input words directly before ""walm."" For example, ""dax"" seems to correspond to green, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow. When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output for ""walm"" matches the color of the proceeding word.

Thus, considering the presented examples:

- ""dax lug wif walm"" results in ""green blue red red red,"" with ""walm"" matching the color of the preceding ""wif,"" which is red.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""walm"" matching the color of the preceding ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red,"" with ""walm"" matching the color of the preceding ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" with ""walm"" matching the color of the preceding ""wif,"" which is red.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green,"" with ""walm"" matching the color of the preceding ""dax,"" which is green.

Rule: walm -> the color of the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". In each example, whenever the word ""lug"" is present, the color ""blue"" is in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Given the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Regardless of position or surrounding words, ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"". Additionally, it seems other words represent different colors: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can try to determine what the word ""wif"" corresponds to in terms of color. Let's look at each example and the placement of ""wif"" within the input sequences:

1. Input: wif dax zup -> Output: red green yellow
2. Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
3. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red
4. Input: zup lug wif -> Output: yellow blue red
5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Looking at the outputs, when ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" follows in the output sequence, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, it seems that the rule is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Analyzing the examples you've provided, here is what I'm observing:

- In every case where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- All other words in the input correspond to different colors in the output, and those colors are consistent for each unique word. For instance, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""green,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- The number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output is directly related to the number of times ""zup"" appears in the input - one ""yellow"" for each ""zup.""

Based on the provided examples and the observed patterns, the rule we can deduce is as follows:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

This suggests that ""zup"" stands for the color ""yellow"" in the example inputs and outputs given.
Following the given examples, we can attempt to induce the rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf.""

Firstly, let's lay out the data given:
1. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
2. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
3. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow
4. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green
5. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green

Now, analyze how ""bluf"" relates to the colors that follow it:

Example 1: ""bluf"" is followed by two yellows.
Example 2: ""bluf"" is immediately followed by a red.
Example 3: ""bluf"" is followed by a red and then a blue.
Example 4: ""bluf"" is followed by two yellows and later by another green.
Example 5: ""bluf"" is followed by a green.

It appears that ""bluf"" does not correspond to one consistent color; instead, the color that follows seems dependent on the word preceding ""bluf."" Let's look for a pattern:

- In examples 1 and 4, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and is followed by yellow, so ""zup bluf"" seems to correspond to ""yellow yellow.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and is followed by a red, so ""dax bluf"" seems to correspond to ""green red.""
- However, example 5 contradicts the pattern of example 3, as ""zup bluf dax"" results in ""yellow yellow green"" and not ""yellow red green.""

Given the conflicting evidence in example 5 and the limited dataset, it's challenging to derive a concrete rule for ""bluf."" However, the evidence could potentially suggest that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word right before it (as it does in examples 1 and 4 for ""zup,"" and example 2 for ""wif""), with the color afterward perhaps dependent on the word that follows ""bluf."" But the rule has exceptions as seen in example 5.

Rule: ""bluf"" seems to possibly duplicate the color associated with the word that occurs immediately before it, but the pattern is not consistently applicable with the given examples. Further examples would be needed to clarify the rule for ""bluf.""
The examples provided show a pattern where the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. Here's the deduction:

- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color red twice after ""wif,"" which translates to red once.
- ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"", where ""walm"" repeats the color blue twice after ""lug,"" which is blue once.
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green,"" which aligns with the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it twice.
- ""lug wif zup wif walm"" turns into ""blue red yellow red red red,"" where once again, ""walm"" repeats the color red, which is associated with ""wif,"" twice more after it appears once.
- ""wif walm zup walm"" becomes ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" showing that ""walm"" repeats both ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow) twice following their initial instances.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it two times.

So, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: If the word preceding ""walm"" is associated with a color, then ""walm"" means to repeat that color twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the other words present. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue

This means that ""lug"" consistently means the color blue in these examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at its position relative to other words in the input and observe its corresponding color in the output.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

In this example, ""dax"" comes after two instances of ""red"" and is followed by ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" could mean ""red,"" but we need more examples to confirm.

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Here, ""dax"" follows ""red"" and is followed by ""red"" again. This suggests that ""dax"" causes the word following it to repeat the color of the word before it.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue

In this sequence, ""dax"" is at the beginning, followed by ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""red."" Since ""dax"" came before a ""yellow,"" it is possible that ""dax"" triggers the next word to be the color following its natural sequence.

Input: zup dax lug wif dax
Output: yellow green blue red green

Again, ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red) and the corresponding output color is the next color in the sequence (""green"").

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

In this case, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" which becomes ""blue,"" retaining the concept of ""dax"" advancing the next word's color in sequence.

From these examples, ""dax"" seems to modify the color output of the word that follows it in the sequence, advancing it to the next color in the set [red, yellow, blue, green]. Specifically, if the color sequence is a cycle, ""dax"" would make the next word's output the next color in the cycle after its typical color.

Thus, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""dax"" makes the following word's output color advance to the next color in the set [red, yellow, blue, green].
Based on the examples provided, the rule can be deduced as follows:

- Whenever 'wif' appears on its own, the output is 'red'.
- When 'wif' is combined with other words, it maintains its association with the color 'red', but the position of 'wif' does not change the color it represents.

Hence, the rule for the meaning of wif seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The word 'wif' consistently correlates with the color 'red' regardless of its position in a sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples given:

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because the first part of the output is yellow, and the second instance of ""zup"" confirms it.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

However, if we look at the other examples, we discover contradictions with this initial conclusion:

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
- Here ""bluf"" is in the third position, but the output is ""red,"" not ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
- In this example, ""bluf"" produces ""red"" again.

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in this example, following ""dax,"" which also corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow
- Finally, in this example, like the second one, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Given these contradictions, it seems clear that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a single color. Instead, it seems to replicate the color of the word immediately preceding it. This consistency is seen across all examples.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the preceding word's corresponding color.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Explanation:
- The word ""dax"" is associated with the color green. When followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- The word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. When followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In the example ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" the pattern continues with ""dax"" leading to ""green green green,"" ""zup"" leading to a single ""yellow"" (because ""walm"" was not immediately following ""zup""), ""lug"" associated with color blue followed by ""walm"" giving ""blue blue blue.""
- The example ""lug walm zup wif"" shows that ""lug"" is associated with blue and followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""blue blue blue."" The ""zup"" followed by ""wif"" does not involve ""walm,"" so only a single ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and a single ""red"" for ""wif"" are outputted.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the context in which it appears.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"" in the output. There is a one-to-one relationship between ""dax"" and ""green,"" regardless of the context or the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif dax bluf Output: red green green
   - wif correlates with red
   - dax and bluf likely correspond with green

2. Input: lug walm zup wif Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - wif correlates with red
   - lug, walm, and zup likely correspond with blue, and the sequence matters for determining which instance of blue they correlate with
   - yellow is a new color introduced in the sequence, which could be related to the position of wif in the sequence or may correspond with zup or walm; however, given other examples, this is less likely

3. Input: wif dax zup walm Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - wif correlates with red again
   - dax correlates with green again (consistent with the first example)
   - zup and walm, which had different colors in the second example, both now correlate with yellow, which suggests that their colors may depend on position or other context

4. Input: lug wif Output: blue red
   - lug correlates with blue
   - wif correlates with red

5. Input: wif Output: red
   - wif correlates with red when it's the only word in the input

From the given examples, we can see that ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words. Therefore, we can define the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the other words around it. Every instance of the word ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to a color. Furthermore, the color that ""bluf"" corresponds to seems to change based on some aspect of the preceding word. Let's examine the instances:

1. dax bluf -> green blue
2. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
5. lug dax bluf -> blue green green

Considering the information above, we can notice that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence:

- In example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" which follows it also corresponds to green.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" is yellow as well.
- In example 3, ""wif"" is red, and so is ""bluf"".
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, making ""bluf"" also red.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" is green here too.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color tied to the word that immediately precedes it three times. Here's the breakdown:

- ""dax wif walm"" correlates with ""green red red red,"" with ""wif"" associated with the color red, and ""walm"" causing it to repeat three times.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" correlates with ""red red green green green,"" with ""dax"" associated with green, and ""walm"" causing it to repeat three times.
- ""zup walm dax"" correlates with ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" with ""zup"" associated with yellow and ""walm"" causing it to repeat three times before moving onto the next word ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""zup walm"" correlates with ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again with ""zup"" associated with yellow and ""walm"" causing it to repeat three times.
- ""lug zup dax walm"" correlates with ""blue yellow green green green,"" with ""dax"" associated with green, and ""walm"" causing it to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> When followed by walm, the color associated with the immediately preceding word is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". There is no contextual variance in the translation provided for ""lug"", as it results in ""blue"" every time it appears. Thus, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug"" as follows:

lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be straightforward. In every example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

Here are the correlations:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Thus, the rule can be written as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position within the input sequence, ""wif"" always results in ""red"" in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Input: zup dax walm -> Output: yellow green green green
Input: zup -> Output: yellow
Input: zup bluf lug zup -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
Input: zup wif dax walm lug -> Output: yellow red green green green blue
Input: dax zup lug -> Output: green yellow blue

From these inputs and outputs, we can deduce:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. The word that precedes ""bluf"" indicates which color to repeat. Here's the breakdown of each input and output:

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated.
2. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green; ""bluf"" causes the color before it ('green' from 'dax') to be repeated.
3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated.

So the rule appears as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is repeated a number of times in the output equal to the number of colors produced by the word that precedes it. In each instance where ""walm"" is used, it results in the repetition of the color attributed to the last word before ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

- ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue""; ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the color ""blue"" three times.
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""; here ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""; ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""walm"" repeats it twice more.
- ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red""; ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats it two more times.
- ""lug wif zup wif walm"" results in ""blue red yellow red red red""; the last color before ""walm"" is ""red"" (from ""wif""), which ""walm"" repeats three more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word the same number of times as the number of colors generated before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" the corresponding output is ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.

Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" and in the output, ""red"" is followed by ""green.""
- In the second example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is preceded by ""bluf"" and the output sequence corresponds with ""red"" preceded by ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue,"" where ""wif"" matches ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" converts to ""green green red blue yellow,"" with ""wif"" aligning with ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output consists of color words, and ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow.

Here's how the ""zup"" correspondence works in each example:

- Input: wif zup => Output: red yellow (zup corresponds to the second color, yellow)
- Input: zup => Output: yellow (zup is the only word and corresponds to yellow)
- Input: zup wif bluf => Output: yellow red red (zup corresponds to the first color, yellow)
- Input: zup => Output: yellow (again, zup is the only word and corresponds to yellow)
- Input: lug zup => Output: blue yellow (zup corresponds to the second color, yellow)

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow.""

2. ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""

3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green.""

4. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue green green yellow blue red.""

5. ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red.""

Now, let's analyze the outputs to deduce a pattern that could explain the meaning of ""bluf"":

- In examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeated color; ""yellow"" in the first and ""red"" in the third.

- In example 2, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is the same color as the preceding word ""dax.""

- In example 4, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" again, and ""dax"" is before it, like in examples 1, 2, and 3.

- In example 5, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is the same color as the preceding word ""wif.""

From these observations, it appears that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it corresponds to the color of the word immediately before it. Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: bluf corresponds to the same color as the previous word.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

When the word ""walm"" appears, the output color is repeated as many times as the number of words that precede ""walm"" in the input.

Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Walm"" is preceded by 4 words, hence ""yellow"" is repeated 4 times.

2. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   - ""Walm"" is preceded by 3 words, hence ""green"" is repeated 3 times.

3. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""Walm"" is preceded by 1 word, hence ""yellow"" is repeated 1 time.

4. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""Walm"" is preceded by 1 word, hence ""green"" is repeated 1 time.

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""Walm"" is preceded by 5 words, hence ""red"" is repeated 5 times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" as many times as the number of words that precede ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" can be deduced by observing its consistent correlation with a particular output:

Input: lug wif dax -> Output: blue red green
Input: lug dax lug -> Output: blue green blue
Input: lug -> Output: blue
Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red

Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. No other input words consistently result in ""blue"" in the output, and ""lug"" does not correspond to any other color in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the output ""green,"" regardless of the context or position in the input sequence. Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color green in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""wif"" by examining the context in which it appears, and the corresponding outputs. 

- In example 1, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red"". ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it appears both at the beginning and near the end before ""wif"". ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green"" and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red"" when it appears after ""wif"".
- In example 2, ""wif dax"" leads to ""red green"". Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In example 3, ""wif walm"" translates into ""red red red"". Thus, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" when following ""wif"".
- In example 4, ""zup wif dax"" becomes ""yellow red green"". ""zup"" remains ""yellow"", ""dax"" remains ""green"", and ""wif"" is ""red"" when in the middle.
- Lastly, in example 5, ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red"". ""dax"" is once more ""green"", and ""wif"" is ""red"".

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", and doesn't depend on its position in the sequence. It's also noted that ""wif"" does not seem to affect the color designation of words that come after it, as ""dax"" remains ""green"" regardless of whether it comes before or after ""wif"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" follows. It does not matter what other word follows ""zup""; the output is consistently yellow before any other color that comes after ""zup"". Therefore, we can deduce that:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" signifies the color yellow in the given context.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to a color. By examining the outputs in correspondence to the inputs, we can infer the following:

1. ""wif zup dax bluf"" outputs ""red yellow green green"", and since ""wif"", ""zup"", and ""dax"" correspond to ""red"", ""yellow"", and ""green"" respectively, ""bluf"" must also correspond to ""green"".

2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"", implying that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

3. ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"", which suggests ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" here.

4. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" outputs ""blue red red green blue blue""; since we know ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""dax"" is ""green"", it is implied that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in the first occurrence and ""blue"" in the second occurrence.

5. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" outputs ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"", which suggests ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the first occurrence and ""yellow"" in the second occurrence.

From these examples, it can be concluded that the meaning of ""bluf"" is not consistent across examples, hence it does not have a fixed color associated with it. However, a pattern arises where ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is ""green"" and is followed by ""bluf"", which is also ""green"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" is ""yellow"" twice, followed by ""bluf"" which is also ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, the first ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red"" and the second ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, the two occurrences of ""bluf"" correspond to the colors of the words immediately before them, ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow).

Accordingly, we deduce:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Below are explanations for each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green. Thus, ""walm"" repeats the color green twice, following the instance of ""dax.""

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   In this instance, ""walm"" is immediately preceded by ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow. Therefore, ""walm"" results in the color yellow being repeated three times.

3. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   Here, the first ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, repeating red twice. The second ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, and it repeats the color yellow three times.

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue. Consequently, ""walm"" results in the color blue being repeated three times.

5. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   The first ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" corresponding to green, repeated twice. The second ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" corresponding to yellow, repeated three times.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples. Every instance of ""lug"" in the input translates directly to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" The other words in the input, such as ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm,"" seem to correspond to their own unique colors consistently: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Given this information, the meaning of ""dax"" in the context of the examples can be deduced as follows:

dax -> ""green""

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently means the color ""green"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output. This deduction comes from observing that every instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input string or the presence of other words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

zup -> meaning: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".

Rule: When the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the input-output pairs provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word that precedes it. This is evidenced by the fact that each time ""bluf"" appears, the color in the output matches that of the previous word. 

Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
   bluf mimics the color of the preceding word ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

2. lug bluf -> blue blue
   bluf mimics the color of the preceding word ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

3. zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   Each occurrence of bluf copies the color of the preceding word, ""zup"" and ""lug,"" resulting in ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively.

4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow (repetition of the first example)
   Again, bluf takes the color of the preceding word ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
   bluf takes the color of the preceding word ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

The pattern is consistent across all given examples, supporting the deduced rule.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.
To determine what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples.

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" to ""blue"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". ""Walm"" leads to a repetition of the last color, which is ""yellow"".

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""Zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red"". ""Walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Each occurrence of ""walm"" leads to a triple repetition of the last color before it.

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   - ""Zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""Walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated twice more before moving on to the next color.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""Wif"" is ""red"", ""bluf"" is still ""blue"" (not present in the output), ""dax"" is ""green"". ""Walm"" leads to the last color, ""green"", being repeated twice more.

Based on the preceding examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be a triple repetition of the last color mentioned before ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> repeat the last mentioned color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs, looking for patterns that can help us understand the role of ""dax"" in determining the output.

- In examples where ""dax"" is present, the first color in the output is always green.
- The first example, ""dax bluf,"" provides an output of ""green green."" Since there are only two words in the input and two in the output, it suggests a direct correspondence. The presence of ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green.""
- The second example, ""wif dax,"" leads to ""red green."" Here ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- The third example, ""dax lug walm,"" has ""green blue blue blue"" as an output. ""Dax"" again corresponds to the first ""green,"" and since ""lug"" is a new word not associated with color in previous examples, it seems to correspond to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" repeats, and the output has ""blue"" repeating too, indicating ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the following example, ""dax wif,"" the output is ""green red."" This continues to support the notion that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- The last example, ""dax walm wif walm,"" outputs ""green green green red red red."" This reinforces the earlier associations: ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green,"" ""walm"" is linked to a repeated ""green,"" and ""wif"" is linked to repeated ""red."" It's important to note the repeats could be a rhythmic expansion based on the length of the word; ""walm,"" consisting of four letters, corresponds to three repetitions of ""green,"" and ""wif,"" consisting of three letters, corresponds to two repetitions of ""red.""

With these observations, we can derive the rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when placed at the beginning of an input string. Subsequent words in the input may have specific color associations and may repeat the color as many times as there are letters in the word (e.g., ""walm"" = ""green"" repeated 3 times). 

dax -> green
To establish the rule, let's analyze the occurrences of ""wif"" in relation to the outputs:

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"".
2. When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", the output is ""red green"".
3. When ""wif"" precedes ""zup"" or ""bluf"", the output after ""wif"" is ""red yellow"" or ""red red"", respectively.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" always results in the output starting with ""red"". The number of times ""red"" appears seems to correlate to the number of syllables in the word that follows ""wif"".

- ""walm"" (one syllable) -> ""red red red""
- ""dax"" (one syllable) -> ""red green""
- ""lug"" (one syllable) -> ""red blue""
- ""zup"" (one syllable) -> ""red yellow""
- ""bluf"" (one syllable) -> ""red red"" (however, it's followed by another ""red"" which is likely due to ""wif walm"" where ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", resulting in ""red red red"")

However, the subsequent color does not appear to be directly related to the word that follows ""wif"" but rather to the word itself regardless of its position.

Therefore, the consistent rule we can deduce is:
""wif"" translates into ""red"" followed by the color that corresponds to the word directly after it.

Rule: wif -> (always starts with red, followed by the specific color associated with the word that comes after ""wif"").
Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation:
In all provided examples, whenever the term ""zup"" is used in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. This direct correspondence suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Other terms in the examples (""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf"") are associated with their own colors, but consistently, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""
bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" is always translated to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repeated color output. The color that is repeated correlates with the preceding word:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (repeating the color blue which corresponds to ""lug"")
- ""lug zup dax walm"" results in ""blue yellow green green green"" (repeating the color green which corresponds to ""dax"")
- ""wif dax zup walm"" results in ""red green yellow yellow yellow"" (repeating the color yellow which corresponds to ""zup"")
- ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green"" (repeating the color green which corresponds to ""dax"")
- ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"" (repeating the color red which corresponds to ""wif"" for the first ""walm"", and then yellow which corresponds to ""zup"" for the second ""walm"").

From this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green green,green red yellow green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax"" from the examples provided, we'll first look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
4. lug dax -> blue green
5. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red

From the above, we can isolate the occurrences of ""dax"" and see what color it corresponds with in the output:

1. ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
2. ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
3. ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
4. ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
5. ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""

Every instance of ""dax"" in these inputs results in ""green"" in the output. The other words correspond with different colors and the sequences of words produce a pattern of colors in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in an input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

So, the answer is:

dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a color in the output. Through analyzing the examples, we can determine that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Here are the pattern observations:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is the second word and is again followed by ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is the only word and results in ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is the first word and is followed by ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is the second word and is again followed by ""red.""

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we can induce that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first establish what each unique word in the input corresponds to in the output:

- ""wif"" matches ""red""
- ""lug"" matches ""blue""
- ""zup"" matches ""yellow""
- ""dax"" matches ""green""

We can see from the examples that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output, and it repeats the color of the word immediately before it:

- In the first example, ""wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue blue"".
- In the second example, ""zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue"".
- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow"".
- In the last example, ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red blue green"".

It seems that ""bluf"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
The examples show a consistent pattern when the word ""walm"" is used. In the sequences where ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm."" Analyzing the examples:

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which correlates to ""red."" After ""walm,"" the color red is repeated three times before returning to ""lug,"" which correlates to ""blue.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
In this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which correlates to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated twice more.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which correlates to ""red."" After ""walm,"" the color red is repeated twice before continuing to the next color.

Combining these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated in the pattern. However, the total number of repetitions after ""walm"" corresponds to the number of times the color has appeared before ""walm"" (including the instance directly before ""walm"").

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output. The number of repetitions is equal to the total number of times that color has appeared in the sequence so far, including the instance directly before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can examine the placement and repetition of ""dax"" and the corresponding color output.

Example 1:
Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
- ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" which corresponds to ""green green.""

Example 2:
Input: wif dax zup wif
Output: red green yellow red
- ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""green yellow.""

Example 3:
Input: dax lug wif lug
Output: green blue red blue
- ""dax"" is preceded by output ""green"" and then followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

Example 4:
Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- Similar to Example 1.

Example 5:
Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" which corresponds to ""green green green.""

From the examples, we can derive that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" as well as inducing the following rule related to color repetition:

Rule: When ""dax"" is present before a word that corresponds to a particular color, the output color is repeated as many times as the word following ""dax"" repeats until a different word appears.

Therefore:
dax -> green

And the general rule is that ""dax"" indicates the next color to be repeated until a new word/color is introduced.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the term ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Here is the induction from the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and so do ""walm"" and ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" lead to ""blue,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively.
- In the third example, both ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue.""

No matter what the surrounding words are, the output for ""wif"" is always ""red."" Therefore, the rule seems to be quite straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze the given examples and the corresponding outputs:

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red
Analyzing this, we see that ""zup"" is followed by the word ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: zup
Output: yellow
When ""zup"" is presented as the only input, the output is simply ""yellow"".

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
In this case, ""zup"" appears multiple times and consistently translates to ""yellow"" each time it appears.

Input: zup
Output: yellow
Again, when ""zup"" is the only input, the output is ""yellow"".

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue
Here ""zup"" is followed by another word ""lug,"" and the sequence of ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"" in the output.

Based on these examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words around it.
Analyzing the examples given, it seems that ""bluf"" refers to or results in the word it follows taking on the same color as the word that comes just before ""bluf"". To clarify with examples:

- In ""lug dax bluf wif dax"", ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif"". After ""bluf"", ""wif"" becomes ""red"", which is the color associated with ""dax"".

- In ""lug bluf dax bluf"", the first occurrence of ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax"". ""Dax"" after this ""bluf"" turns ""blue"", which is the color of ""lug"". The next ""bluf"" does not have a word to follow it, but if we follow the pattern, then ""dax"" before it should become ""green"", the color associated with itself.

- In ""dax zup lug bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by nothing, but if we follow the established rule, we would expect that if there was a word after ""bluf,"" it would be ""blue,"" following the pattern of ""lug.""

- In ""zup wif bluf zup"", ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup"". After ""bluf"", ""zup"" turns ""red"", which is the color of ""wif"".

- In ""zup bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is not followed by any other word, but if we follow the rule, we would expect that if there was a word after ""bluf,"" it would be ""yellow,"" the color associated with ""zup"".

Given this pattern, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the following word to adopt the color associated with the word preceding ""bluf"". If there's no word after ""bluf"", the effect is not observed.

Rule: bluf -> causes the following word to take on the color of the preceding word. If bluf is the last word, the effect is not seen or is not applicable.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine the patterns between the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and appears before ""walm"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and appears after ""walm"".

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again and appears before ""walm"".
   - There are no words after ""walm"" in this example.

3. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue"".
   - ""walm"" is followed by two additional ""blue"", suggesting that it may cause the following word to repeat.
   - However, there's no word after ""walm""; only colors are repeated.

4. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif | Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and appears both before and after ""walm"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and appears after ""green"", which follows ""walm"".

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm | Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - The pattern of repeating the word before ""walm"" continues here where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is repeated after ""walm"".

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat.

So, ""walm"" seems to take the last color mentioned before it, and repeat that color in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> Causes the last color before it to repeat in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"". Looking at the outputs, we can see that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output includes the color ""green"". Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   In this case, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"", and ""walm"" seems to correspond to two additional ""green"" colors, indicating repetition. 

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"". ""wif"" appears twice and corresponds to ""red"" both times, so ""wif"" likely means ""red"". ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" to the second ""yellow"". Finally, ""walm"", while corresponding to three ""red"" colors here, can be interpreted as 'repeating the previous color', since in the previous example it repeated the green.

4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to the first ""yellow"". ""walm"" at the end repeats the color before it, which is ""yellow"" in this case.

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   Finally, ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green"" and ""bluf"", which has corresponded to ""yellow"" previously, here seems to repeat the previously mentioned color, which is ""green"".

From these observations, we can conclude with the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats the previous color mentioned.

So the final deduction is: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" functions as a delimiter or indicator that changes the color of the word that follows it. More specifically, when a word follows ""wif,"" it is translated to red, while the same word not following ""wif"" is translated into a different color.

Let's break down the examples:

1. ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""
Here, ""dax"" normally translates to ""green,"" but following ""wif,"" it changes to ""red.""

2. ""lug wif lug"" -> ""blue red blue""
Normally, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" but when it comes after ""wif,"" it becomes ""red.""

3. ""lug zup dax wif zup"" -> ""blue yellow green red yellow""
Each word has its own color, but ""zup"" changes to ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""

4. ""wif lug wif"" -> ""red blue red""
Here, ""wif"" is not followed by any word, so we might infer that it defaults to ""red"" on its own. The word ""lug"" in the middle remains ""blue,"" consistent with its translation when not following ""wif.""

5. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green""
Again, ""lug"" after ""wif"" becomes ""red,"" while on its own, it is ""blue."" The rest of the words maintain their initial translations when not following ""wif.""

Rule:
wif -> changes the color of the word that follows it to red. If ""wif"" is not followed by a word or is the last word in the sequence, it is red by default.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. There is no variation in the output that correlates with any changes in the surrounding words, suggesting that ""zup"" has a specific and unchanging meaning as opposed to a contextual one.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that 'bluf' represents the color red when it appears after 'wif' and blue when it appears after 'lug'. When it appears after 'zup', it turns the preceding color sequence to yellow.

More specifically:
- In input 1, 'lug bluf' translates to 'blue blue', with 'bluf' following 'lug'.
- In input 2, 'lug bluf wif lug bluf zup' translates to a pattern where 'bluf' after 'lug' is blue, after 'wif' is red, and 'zup' changes the sequence to include yellow at the end.
- In input 3, 'zup lug bluf zup bluf wif' shows a pattern where 'bluf' follows 'lug' for blue, but 'zup' preceding changes the pattern colors to yellow, and 'wif' turning to red.
- In input 4, 'wif bluf zup' follows the rule with 'bluf' turning red after 'wif' and yellow after 'zup'.
- In input 5, 'lug walm wif bluf' does not clearly define what 'walm' means, but following the rule for 'bluf', after 'lug' it's blue, and after 'wif' it's red.

Based on the inputs and outputs provided, this is the rule I have induced:

Rule: 'bluf' represents the color red when preceded by 'wif', blue when preceded by 'lug', and turns the overall sequence yellow when it follows 'zup'.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the output color associated with the word that follows ""walm"". If a word follows ""walm"", the output color for that word is repeated three times, while the color for ""walm"" itself takes on the color of the following word once. If there is no word following ""walm"", it simply repeats its own associated color three times.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow""
   - Hence, ""walm"" takes on the color of ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", but only once, followed by repeating the color of ""zup"" thrice.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" is not followed by any word, so it repeats the color blue three times.

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue""
   - Hence, ""walm"" takes on the color of ""lug"" once, followed by repeating the color of ""lug"" thrice.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" is not followed by any word, so it repeats the color blue three times.

5. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue""
   - Hence, ""walm"" takes on the color of ""lug"" once, followed by repeating the color of ""lug"" thrice.

Rule: ""walm"" -> When ""walm"" is followed by a word, the output for ""walm"" is the color of the following word once, then the color associated with the following word is repeated three times. If ""walm"" is not followed by a word, the color associated with the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times as the output for ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by looking at the patterns of input and corresponding output.

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

From this first example, we can determine that ""lug"" might mean ""blue,"" as it directly translates to ""blue"" in the output while the other words translate to different colors.

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red

Here, ""lug"" appears again and the output is ""blue"" in the corresponding position, supporting our initial guess.

Input: zup dax zup lug
Output: yellow green yellow blue

Again, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" further reinforcing our initial speculation.

Input: zup dax lug dax
Output: yellow green blue green

In this example, ""lug"" is still matched with ""blue.""

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Once more, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue.""

Based on these examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in every case. Therefore, the rule we have derived is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word dax corresponds to the color green, regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the word ""red."" Hence, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
The examples provided suggest that the output colors are associated with the input words. By analyzing the patterns in the given examples, one can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""zup.""

Let's look at the instances of ""zup"" in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue.""
2. ""zup"" on its own results in ""yellow.""
3. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow.""
4. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
5. ""dax bluf zup"" results in ""green green yellow.""

From the outputs, we can observe that each time ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""yellow."" The other words in the input seem to correspond to their own colors consistently: ""dax"" with green, ""walm"" with red, and ""lug"" with blue, for example.

Given this, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be determined as:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

Thus:

zup -> meaning: yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems like the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color. In each input line, ""bluf"" is associated with a specific color in the output, and that color appears to depend on the word just before ""bluf"". Here's the pattern derived from the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output color is green (examples 1, 3, and 4).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output color is blue (examples 3 and 5).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output color becomes red (example 5).

There are not enough examples to definitively conclude what happens when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", as in example 2, ""wif dax zup bluf"" results in ""red green yellow yellow"". One might guess that ""bluf"" would turn red if its pattern of taking the color of the word immediately preceding it were to continue. However, the previous instances of ""zup"" being followed by a color resulted in ""yellow"". Considering the inconsistency, we cannot derive a reliable pattern for ""bluf"" following ""zup"".

Given this incomplete dataset, the best rule we can induce is:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color output of the word that immediately precedes it.

Bluf -> meaning: The color is determined by the word that precedes ""bluf"". If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the color is green. If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the color is blue. If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the color is red. The color that occurs when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" cannot be established from the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes it. The number of repetitions seems to be three. Here's the pattern according to each input:

- ""dax walm wif dax"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to ""green green green,"" followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and then ""dax"" again which is ""green.""
- ""dax walm"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" once again leads to ""green green green.""
- ""lug dax walm wif"": ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" so ""walm"" makes ""green green green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""
- ""zup lug walm"": ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- ""wif zup walm dax zup"": ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" followed by ""dax"" which is ""green,"" and ""zup"" again which is ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. Each usage of ""lug"" results in the word ""blue"" being in the output at the same position.

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" seems to be:

lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each time the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is produced in the output. Also, the colors that follow are directly related to the other words in the sequence. Here is what each word seems to translate to:

- dax -> green
- walm -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

The rule appears to be that each unique word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The exception is ""walm"" and ""lug,"" which both correspond to the color blue. It may be that similar or related words result in the same color.

Rule: Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output, with ""dax"" always resulting in the color green.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Therefore, the meaning is as follows:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" is presented in the input, the corresponding output contains the word ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning or the rule behind the word ""bluf,"" we must analyze the provided examples and look for a pattern in the relationship between the input and the output. Let's start by listing each unique word from the input and its corresponding color from the output:

- wif -> red (present in examples 1, 2, and 3, always with the output ""red"")
- dax -> green (present in all examples, always with the output ""green"")
- lug -> blue (present in examples 3, 4, and 5, always with the output ""blue"")
- bluf -> ? (color changes, must determine the rule)

Now let's look at the position of ""bluf"" and its corresponding color output:

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green
2. wif bluf dax -> red red green
3. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
4. dax lug bluf -> green blue blue
5. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green

By inspecting the outputs every time ""bluf"" appears, it seems that the color associated with ""bluf"" is dependent on the color that immediately precedes it:

1. ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the output is green.
2. ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and the output is red.
3. ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the output is green again.
4. ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output is blue.
5. ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the output is green.

From this pattern, we can infer that the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is it takes on the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> The output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to correlate the instances of ""walm"" with the colors in the corresponding outputs.

1. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
2. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- Every time ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the next three colors are green.
- ""walm"" after ""wif lug"" leads to three blues.
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in three yellows.
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" also leads to three blues (same as ""wif lug"").

Given these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of three of the same color that directly follows the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Therefore, if the preceding word is associated with a specific color, ""walm"" causes the output to have three instances of that color.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" appears to be a repetition modifier that causes the next color in sequence to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""lug,"" let's first identify the outputs for the nonce word across the given examples.

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- Here, lug corresponds to the second occurrence of ""blue.""

Input: zup lug dax lug
Output: yellow blue green blue
- Here, both occurrences of lug correspond to ""blue.""

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue
- Here, both occurrences of lug correspond to ""blue.""

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green
- Here, lug corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- The first and fourth occurrences of lug correspond to ""blue.""

From these examples, we can conclude that each time the word ""lug"" appears, it consistently corresponds with the word ""blue"" in the outputs. Therefore, we can confidently deduce the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by looking at the corresponding output in each case. Here's how ""dax"" is represented in each example:

1. Input: zup dax lug zup
   Output: yellow green blue yellow
   - dax corresponds to green.

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   - dax corresponds to green.

3. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - dax corresponds to green.

4. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - dax corresponds to green.

5. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow
   - dax corresponds to green.

From all the examples, it is clear that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" is included in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following patterns for the colors: lug corresponds to blue, walm to yellow, wif to red, and dax to green. Now, in each sequence where zup is present, it is followed by a different word except the last example where it is followed by itself, but it always results in the color 'yellow' regardless of the preceding or following words.

Here are the observations:

- ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which suggests zup translates to yellow.
- ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" which independently supports that zup translates to yellow.
- ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow,"" which suggests zup translates to yellow.
- ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow,"" which suggests zup translates to yellow.
- ""zup wif bluf zup"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow,"" which suggests zup translates to yellow irrespective of its position.

From the examples above, zup consistently translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the list of words or the words around it. This indicates that zup maps directly to the color yellow without dependency on surrounding context.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, we can identify a pattern that associates each nonce word with a specific color. These associations are consistent across different examples. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the pattern.

From the first example:

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow

We can infer that:
- ""wif"" likely corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" likely corresponds to ""yellow""

And the word ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" in the output, which seems to be the only color repeated. This suggests that ""bluf"" could signify a repetition of the previous color.

Let's confirm this hypothesis with the rest of the examples:

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" the previous color.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow"" in the output once again.

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

Again, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Based on the pattern observed in these examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> means to repeat the color of the previous word.
The examples suggest that the meaning of ""walm"" depends on the word that precedes it. To understand the rule, we can look at the output sequence where ""walm"" appears and identify the pattern:

1. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
2. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
3. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
4. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

Let's break down the examples.

In examples 1 and 4, the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output color is blue repeated three times.

In examples 2 and 5, the word ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output color is red repeated three times.

In example 3, the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output color is green repeated three times.

In example 1, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" but since ""zup"" does not directly precede ""walm,"" it doesn't seem to affect the rule for ""walm."" This is further supported by example 2, where ""zup"" is in the sequence but not directly preceding ""walm,"" and so the output color is not influenced by ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output to be the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" each time it is used. Here is how the meaning of ""dax"" is derived from the examples:

1. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""dax"" is directly followed by the color ""green.""

2. ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red."" The word ""dax"" is followed by the color ""green"" again.

3. ""dax"" alone translates to ""green."" This single usage confirms that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" independently of other words.

4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Although ""walm"" is not previously defined, we can infer each occurrence of ""dax"" still translates to ""green.""

5. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green."" Again, ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" consistently represents the color green in all given contexts.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each time ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Therefore, we could deduce that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the pattern of the ""zup"" placement and corresponding outputs:

1. dax zup bluf → green yellow yellow
2. zup wif walm lug → yellow red red red blue
3. zup walm → yellow yellow yellow
4. wif bluf zup → red red yellow
5. wif dax zup → red green yellow

Looking at examples 1 and 3, where ""zup"" directly follows ""dax"" in example 1, we get ""green"" for ""dax"" and two ""yellow"" colors. In example 3, ""zup"" directly precedes ""walm,"" and we get three ""yellow"" colors. 

However, notice that in examples 2, 4, and 5, when ""zup"" is present, the output always includes at least one ""yellow,"" regardless of the position of ""zup."" 

Based on these observations, we can deduce a rule that ""zup"" indicates the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here's the rule expressed as requested:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the provided examples, I'll examine the inputs and their corresponding outputs to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"".

1. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

2. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

5. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green

The overarching pattern seems to be that each word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. From this, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Focusing on the word ""bluf"":

- In example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax"", both of which have a fixed color: ""red"" and ""green"" respectively. The output for ""bluf"" in this context is ""red green"", suggesting perhaps that ""bluf"" could mean a repetition of the color of the word immediately preceding it.
- However, in example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif"". ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"", but the output for ""bluf"" is not ""yellow"". Instead, it's red, the same as the color for ""wif"".
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and its output color is ""yellow"".
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and its output color is ""green"", the same as the output color for ""dax"".
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and its output is ""blue"", which is also the color output for ""lug"".

Looking at these instances, a clear pattern arises. Whenever ""bluf"" follows another word, it duplicates the output color of the word that precedes it. Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> Replicate the color of the preceding word.
To find the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the correlation between the input and the output in each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
2. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   
4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

In every instance of ""walm,"" the color that follows repeats three times, which are the colors corresponding to the word directly preceding ""walm"". For example, in line 1, ""lug"" would correspond to ""blue,"" thus ""walm"" after ""lug"" generates ""blue blue blue.""

Now applying this rule to the other examples:
- In line 2, ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" so when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it results in ""red red red."" The same applies to ""zup,"" which seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" making ""walm"" after ""zup"" result in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In line 3, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green.""
- In line 4, the pattern continues with ""walm"" tripling the color of the word just before it: ""dax"" leads to ""green green green,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red red red,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In line 5, without any other words to confuse the matter, ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" confirms the pattern of ""green green green.""

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes triple repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue blue blue green,red blue blue blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the same position. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" seems consistent:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- In all subsequent examples, ""dax"" still corresponds to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:

dax -> green. Meaning: ""dax"" consistently means the color green, irrespective of context.

Rule: dax means ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" acts as a modifier that changes the color associated with the word that follows it to red. To illustrate:

- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" where ""lug,"" which normally corresponds to blue, is changed to red only when it follows ""wif.""
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" indicating that the normal output for ""zup,"" which is yellow, is changed to red when it follows ""wif.""
- Similarly, ""dax wif"" becomes ""green red,"" so ""dax,"" which typically translates to green, is changed to red when it comes after ""wif.""

When ""wif"" appears at the beginning of a sequence, as seen in the example ""wif dax zup bluf,"" it is translated simply as ""red,"" and it doesn't appear to change the subsequent colors in the sequence. However, in ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" ""bluf"" normally translates to yellow, and after ""wif,"" it becomes red but doesn't affect the subsequent ""zup"" or ""lug.""

Rule: wif -> changes the following color to red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each provided example, regardless of the position it appears in the sequence or the other words (lug, dax, wif, bluf) it is combined with.
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color word that comes before it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears after a color word, it indicates that the color word should be repeated.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
3. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
4. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
5. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow

First, we observe that each nonce word maps to a color:
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Next, we look at each instance of ""walm"" to understand its relationship to the colors:
- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the color changes from red to red red. This doesn't provide a clear indication of the meaning of ""walm.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the color changes from blue to blue blue. ""Walm"" preceded by ""lug"" results in two blue outputs.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" (green) and followed by ""zup"" (yellow). The output is green green yellow, meaning ""walm"" followed by ""zup"" results in two green outputs and then yellow.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), resulting in green green yellow. Later ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output is blue blue blue.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), which again results in green green yellow.

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it, two times. Then, if it is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), it also produces a yellow color after the repeated colors.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated two times, and if followed by ""zup,"" it is followed by a yellow color in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""lug"" directly corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""blue"" is present in the same position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

- In every example, the presence of the nonce word 'dax' always corresponds to the output 'green'.
- No other word seems to correspond uniformly to 'green'.
- Other words ('lug', 'wif', 'zup') correspond to different output colors, which remain consistent across the examples: 'lug' to 'blue', 'wif' to 'red', 'zup' to 'yellow'.
- The word 'dax' appears at different positions in the input sequence, but its output 'green' is always at the same position, indicating that the position of 'dax' in the input is linked to the position of 'green' in the output.

From these observations, the meaning of 'dax' can be deduced as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' in the input sequence corresponds directly to the color 'green' in the output sequence, with its positional occurrence in the input maintaining the same position in the output.
Rule: wif -> red. The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in every given example.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the context, specifically the word that precedes it. Each time ""bluf"" appears, it takes on the color associated with the word right before it, thus:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is yellow (from ""zup bluf"" to ""yellow yellow"").
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is green (from ""dax bluf"" to ""green green"").
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is red (from ""wif bluf"" to ""red red"").
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is blue (from ""lug bluf"" to ""blue blue"").

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" inherits the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word the same number of times as there are syllables in the previous word.

Explanation:
In the first example, ""lug zup dax walm,"" the color before ""walm"" is ""green"" for ""dax,"" which has one syllable. So, ""walm"" means ""green"" repeated one time - ""green green.""

In the second example, ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""blue"" for ""lug,"" which has one syllable. So, ""walm"" again means ""blue"" repeated one time - ""blue blue.""

In the third example, ""wif lug walm,"" the color before ""walm"" is ""blue"" for ""lug,"" and again ""lug"" has one syllable. So, ""walm"" continues to mean ""blue"" repeated one time - ""blue blue.""

In the fourth example, ""wif walm,"" the color before ""walm"" is ""red"" for ""wif,"" which has one syllable. So, ""walm"" here means ""red"" repeated one time - ""red red.""

In the final example, ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" the first ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which has one syllable, making the output ""yellow yellow."" The second ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which again has one syllable, so the output is ""red red red.""

In all cases, ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word, as many times as there are syllables in the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" can be established as follows:

Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" appears in the output.

Therefore:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input sequence, the output must contain the color ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the input translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position in the sequence or the words that come before or after it.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, we see ""red"" in the output, irrespective of the other words' position or repetition. Additionally, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow"" while ""bluf"" is consistently ""blue.""

Thus, the rule appears to be: 

wif -> red

Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to an instance of ""red"" in the output.
Given the examples, it is possible to deduce the meaning of ""zup"" by analyzing the patterns in which it appears and the resulting colours. Here are the relevant observations:

1. ""lug zup bluf dax"" results in ""blue yellow yellow green"". ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" seems to be a misspelling that still translates to ""blue"", and ""dax"" corresponds to green. The unknown ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".
   
2. ""zup dax lug dax"" results in ""yellow green blue green"". Following from the previous example, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""zup"" occurs where ""yellow"" is in the output.

3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""yellow/blue"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" also to ""blue"". ""zup"" correlates once again with ""yellow"".

4. ""dax zup dax zup wif"" results in ""green yellow green yellow red"". ""dax"" is ""green"", ""zup"" is where ""yellow"" appears, and ""wif"" is at the position of ""red"".

5. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" results in ""blue red green green green yellow"". ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""walm"" correlates with a repeated ""green"", and ""zup"" occurs where ""yellow"" is seen in the output.

From the examples, ""zup"" consistently aligns with the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be formulated as follows:

zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" causes the output color to match the color generated by the word immediately preceding it. Here's the rule in a more formal structure:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

- In ""zup bluf dax,"" ""zup"" yields yellow, followed by ""bluf,"" which repeats the color generated by ""zup,"" so it also yields yellow, and ""dax"" yields green.
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" yields yellow, and ""bluf"" again repeats the color of ""zup,"" yielding another yellow.
- In ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" ""dax"" yields green, ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"" yielding green, ""wif"" yields red, ""zup"" yields yellow, and the final ""wif"" yields red.
- In ""wif bluf lug,"" ""wif"" yields red, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" so it yields red, while ""lug"" yields blue.
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" yields blue, and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" yielding blue again.

Therefore, the rule induced is: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by looking for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's examine each case:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
2. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
3. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
4. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""

One thing that stands out is that the output associated with ""walm"" is consistently green or yellow, which is not immediately obvious in its relation to the other words and their corresponding colors. However, there's a pattern to notice: whenever ""walm"" appears, the color of the output is repeated. 

Let's state the observed rule in terms of ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated in the output. 

So, let's apply the rule to the examples:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red"" (for wif bluf), ""green"" (for dax), and ""green green"" (walm repeats the green from dax).
2. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow"" (for zup), ""red"" (for wif), ""green"" (for dax), ""green green"" (walm repeats the green), and ""blue"" (for lug).
3. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow"" (for zup), ""yellow yellow"" (walm repeats the yellow), ""blue"" (for lug), and ""red red"" (for wif bluf).
4. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow"" (for zup) and ""yellow yellow"" (walm repeats the yellow).
5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue"" (for lug), ""blue blue"" (walm repeats the blue), ""yellow"" (for zup), ""blue"" (for another lug), ""yellow"" (for another zup), ""red"" (for wif).

Therefore, the rule seems to consistently explain the relationship between walm and the repeated color in the output. However, because walm has the property of repetition and not a direct color association like the other words might, its meaning is contextual rather than absolute when it comes to color.

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm dax
    ",Output: red red red green,red red red green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the meaning of the word ""dax"" is consistent, while ""wif"" and ""zup"" before ""dax"" change the color output. The examples show that when ""dax"" is on its own, the output is ""green"". When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" there is no direct example, but when it precedes ""zup"" which is followed by another ""dax,"" the output is ""red green yellow green"". The presence of ""zup"" also affects the output related to ""dax,"" as seen in the example ""zup wif dax,"" which yields ""yellow red green"".

To deduce a rule, we will consider ""wif"" and ""zup"" as modifiers that precede ""dax"" and ""green"" as the default output for ""dax"".

Rule: 
- dax on its own translates to the word ""green"".
- When ""dax"" is combined with other words such as ""wif"" or ""zup"", it may change the order or the output color, but ""dax"" itself consistently translates to ""green"". 

Therefore: 
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Whenever ""wif"" is presented in the input, it translates to ""red"" in the output. The word that follows ""wif"" determines the next color in the sequence. For instance, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the rule, let's look for patterns in the use of the word 'zup' in the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

1. Input: lug dax zup
   Output: blue green yellow

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

3. Input: dax lug zup
   Output: green blue yellow

4. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

From these examples, it appears that 'zup' consistently translates as 'yellow.' Additionally, the word 'zup' does not seem to affect the translation of the words around it, which further suggests that 'zup' is a stand-alone term with a direct translation rather than a word whose meaning changes based on context.

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Here's the analysis:

1. ""dax lug bluf wif"" translates to ""green blue blue red.""
2. ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow.""
3. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue.""
4. ""lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue green green.""
5. ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" translates to ""green green red blue yellow.""

From these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" always translates to the color that directly precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the color named right before ""bluf"" is repeated.

Therefore when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which stands for ""blue,"" ""bluf"" also means ""blue,"" when it follows ""dax,"" which stands for ""green,"" ""bluf"" means ""green,"" and when it follows ""zup,"" which stands for ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" means ""yellow"". In cases where ""bluf"" is the first word, it would default to repeating ""green"" as seen in the second example.
Analyzing the given examples, the output generated appears to depend on the input word. Each input word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output. Here's the observed correspondence:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

When the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the output repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. Here is the analysis of each example:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" Thus, ""green"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

2. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Thus, ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" yielding three ""green""s.

4. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
   Here again, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" yielding three ""blue""s.

5. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
   Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in three ""yellow""s.

Rule: walm -> When the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it generates three instances of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red blue red yellow yellow,red blue red yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in the Outputs. Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" appears to be the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" independent of context. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of ""wif"" directly corresponds to the word ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. There are no examples that contradict this direct correspondence.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup.""

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow

Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Analyzing the pattern, we can see that every time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" Therefore, it appears that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
The provided examples suggest that the word ""bluf"" takes its meaning from the immediately preceding word. Let's examine the examples to deduce the rule:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the color associated with ""wif.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" in a sequence of ""zup wif bluf zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red yellow""; again, ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the preceding word (""wif"" in this case).
3. In the sequence ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows a ""zup"" with the output being ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" in this case adopted the color associated with ""zup.""
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" in ""wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green green,"" where ""green"" is repeated for ""bluf,"" indicating that it again took the color associated with the preceding word (""dax"" in this case).
5. Finally, in ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""yellow red green red red,"" where ""red"" is the color associated with ""wif"" and is duplicated for ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it repeats the output color of the word that immediately precedes it. 

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color output of the immediately preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word just before ""walm."" To confirm the rule, let's analyze each example.

1. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows, ""green"" is repeated.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated.

3. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated.

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated.

5. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated.

Therefore, the general rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the input correlates to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the patterns and correlations between the input sequences and their corresponding outputs. Let's compare the sequences to see where ""dax"" appears and what output it generates.

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Based on the inputs and outputs provided:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green"" in the output.
- It does not seem to be position-dependent as ""dax"" produces ""green"" whether it is in the beginning, middle, or end, of the sequence.
- No other word in the sequences reliably corresponds to ""green"" in the output, so ""dax"" is very likely the trigger for ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
From the given examples, let's deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the inputs and outputs:

- Example 1:
  Input: zup wif dax
  Output: yellow red green
  Here, ""wif"" seems to translate to ""red.""

- Example 2:
  Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
  Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
  Here, ""wif lug"" is repeated and corresponds to ""red blue"" both times. ""wif"" alone still seems to correspond to ""red.""

- Example 3:
  Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
  Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
  Again, ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red."" ""wif lug"" also corresponds to ""red blue,"" and ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""

- Example 4:
  Input: dax lug wif
  Output: green blue red
  At the end of the sequence, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

- Example 5:
  Input: lug zup wif lug
  Output: blue yellow red blue
  At the third position, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by the word ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on the patterns observed, ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red"" consistently in each output. The presence of ""wif"" before other words does not seem to change its output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each instance it appears. Here is the breakdown:

- ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" is a bit uncertain with only two examples, but it could correspond to ""yellow,"" or it might repeat the previously mentioned color.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" could be ""red,"" as it produces ""red"" in the output, noting that ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red.""

However, given that ""walm"" and ""bluf"" have limited appearances, their exact rules are not as clear as the others. With the information available, ""zup"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding nonce word. Here's the breakdown of the rule as observed:

- ""dax"" is associated with the color green, so ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
- ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow,"" and with the addition of ""bluf"" it becomes ""green yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" is repeating the color associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- ""wif"" is associated with the color red, so ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red.""
- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, so ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, so ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue.""

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:
Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the preceding nonce word.
Analyzing the given examples, let's deduce the meaning of walm.

1. Example:
   - Input: lug walm
   - Output: blue blue blue

2. Example:
   - Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   - Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

3. Example:
   - Input: lug wif walm
   - Output: blue red red red

4. Example:
   - Input: zup walm
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Example:
   - Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   - Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

From the examples, we can deduce the following:

- The word ""lug"" always results in a single ""blue"" in the output.
- The word ""wif"" always results in a triple ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""zup"" always results in a triple ""yellow"" in the output.
- The word ""walm"" seems to result in repeating the color associated with the preceding word an additional two times, making it a total of three times.

Examining the first example, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and adding ""walm"" results in two additional ""blue,"" confirming that ""walm"" after ""lug"" repeats ""blue"" two more times.

In the second example, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" following it results in two additional ""yellow."" Similarly, ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" with ""walm"" after it again adding two more ""blue."" Then ""wif"" gives ""red,"" with ""walm"" following it, adding two more ""red.""

By following this pattern for all other examples, the rule stays consistent. Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: walm repeats the color associated with the preceding word two additional times, making it a total of three times in sequence.

So, walm -> meaning is to repeat the color of the previous word for a total of three repetitions.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax
    ",Output: green yellow green,green yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, whether it appears alone or with other words, ""lug"" leads to the same output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" means the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the appearance of the word ""dax"" is consistently followed by the color ""green"" in the outputs:

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red

Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Other words in the examples have different corresponding colors, but ""dax"" is always mapped to ""green"". Therefore, the rule seems to be:

dax -> green. Rule: When the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is produced in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" associates with the color ""red."" Furthermore, it seems that the other words correspond to distinct colors: ""bluf"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""walm"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue. The output consists of a sequence of colors corresponding to the input words.

Here is the assessment based on the input-output pairs:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red,"" which suggests ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" is green again, and ""wif"" is red.
- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""zup"" seems to be yellow, ""bluf"" is green but the output is yellow which could be an error in the pattern or the examples given are inconsistent, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" is also red.
- The third input ""lug walm wif zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red yellow red,"" where ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" is red, ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""wif"" is red again.
- The fourth sequence ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" where ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" is red, and ""lug"" is blue.
- Finally, the fifth example ""wif dax"" results in ""red green,"" with ""wif"" being red and ""dax"" as green.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" seems consistent across the examples, regardless of position:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we need to analyze its placement and the corresponding output in each example:

- In the first example, ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and since ""bluf"" is repeated in the output as another ""yellow,"" ""zup"" is likely the cause of the first ""yellow.""

- The second example, ""dax lug zup dax,"" results in ""green blue yellow green."" Here ""lug"" is new and corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" is consistently ""green,"" and ""zup"" shows up before the second mention of ""green,"" paired with a ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""dax walm zup lug,"" the output is ""green green green yellow blue."" We see that ""dax"" equals ""green,"" and ""lug"" equals ""blue"" from the previous example. ""Walm"" is new and corresponds to the second ""green."" Since ""zup"" appears after ""walm"" and before ""lug,"" it likely corresponds to ""yellow.""

- The fourth example, ""wif dax zup,"" gives ""red green yellow."" We can see that ""dax"" is ""green"" again, and ""wif"" is ""red,"" leaving ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

- Finally, the example ""zup wif"" yields ""yellow red."" ""Wif"" is consistent as ""red,"" which would imply ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

In all examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" irrespective of the position of the word in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Analyzing the input and output sequences, we can make the following observations for each word:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output is ""red red red"".
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue blue blue"".

Now let's examine the outputs where ""bluf"" appears:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow."" 
   Since ""dax"" is followed by a single ""green"" and ""zup"" by a single ""yellow,"" it appears that ""bluf"" here translates into a single ""yellow.""

2. ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red.""
   Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Given that ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red"" and ""walm"" to ""red red red,"" the ""bluf"" in this case corresponds to a ""yellow.""

3. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""
   As we know ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red,"" so ""bluf"" in this case corresponds to another ""red.""

4. ""dax bluf wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green red yellow.""
   ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" It then seems ""bluf"" here corresponds to ""green.""

5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red red red red.""
   ""lug"" is ""blue blue blue,"" ""walm"" is ""red red red,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" With the outputs corresponding respectively to their preceding word, the ""bluf"" in this case appears to represent ""red red.""

Considering all these observations, it's apparent that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color. Instead, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent and its output color is influenced by the color given to the word immediately before it in the sequence; ""bluf"" repeats the color output of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the given examples and corresponding outputs.

Let's consider the position of ""walm"" in the inputs and the color outputs:

1. ""wif walm dax"" -> red red red green
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax."" The output for ""dax"" is consistent with green across examples, and ""wif"" seems to be red.

2. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> blue blue blue red yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which consistently leads to the output blue.

3. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which seems to correlate consistently with yellow, and ""dax"" follows ""walm,"" which correlates with green as previously noted.

4. ""lug zup dax walm"" -> blue yellow green green green
   - In this example, ""walm"" is at the end, following ""dax"" (green). The output is a series of greens after ""dax.""

5. ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" leading to blue, which is consistent with the output for ""lug.""

From these observations, we can ascertain that ""walm"" replicates the color of the word that precedes it. If ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" (red), it outputs red. If it comes after ""lug"" (blue), it outputs blue, and if it comes after ""zup"" (yellow), it outputs yellow. When ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, it appears to repeat the color of the last non-""walm"" word, as seen in examples 4 and 5.

Rule: walm -> replicates the color of the preceding word in the sequence. If at the end, repeat the color of the last non-""walm"" word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm zup
    ",Output: blue blue blue yellow,blue blue blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From analyzing the given examples, the rule for what ""lug"" means can be deduced as follows:

Example 1: ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow"" suggests that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in this sentence, coming after ""bluf"" which translates to ""red.""

Example 2: ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue"" confirms that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" coming after ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow.""

Example 3: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> ""green green green yellow blue green"" again suggests that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" coming after ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow.""

Example 4: ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow green green green blue red"" continues to support the idea that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" coming after ""walm"" which translates to ""green.""

Example 5: ""wif zup lug zup lug"" -> ""red yellow blue yellow blue"" further reinforces that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" coming after ""zup""/""yellow"" in both cases.

Rule:
lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output consistently contains the word ""green."" Thus, we can conclude that the nonce word ""dax"" means ""green.""
To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif,"" we can compare the inputs and corresponding outputs to identify patterns. Here is what we can infer from the inputs and outputs:

- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the outputs are ""red yellow.""
- When ""wif"" appears between other words, it contributes a ""red"" to the sequence.
- ""wif"" doesn't seem to change the output of the other words around it.
- The presence of other words like ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" contributes their respective colors to the output.

From the examples provided, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Additionally, the other words in the sequences have their own respective color outputs which are invariant to the position of ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it is replaced by ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word 'bluf' represents a color. In each example, 'bluf' translates to the color that preceded it in the input. Here are the observed patterns:

- In the first input, 'wig' translates to 'red', and 'bluf' that follows translates to 'blue', which is the color indicated by 'lug' that immediately precedes 'bluf'.
- In the second input, 'lug' translates to 'blue', and 'bluf' that follows translates to 'green', which is the color indicated by 'dax' that precedes 'bluf'.
- In the third input, 'wif' is translated as 'red', but 'bluf' following it translates to 'green', which is the color indicated by 'dax' that precedes 'wif'.
- In the fourth input, 'lug' translates to 'blue', and 'bluf' that follows translates to 'green', consistent with the second input.
- In the fifth input, 'zup' translates to 'yellow', and 'bluf' that follows also translates to 'yellow'.

From these observations, the rule for 'bluf' appears to be that it translates to the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore, the rule for 'bluf' can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> the color represented by the word immediately preceding 'bluf'.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns related to the word ""walm"":

1. When ""lug walm"" appears, the output is ""blue blue blue"". Since ""lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue"", ""walm"" also seems to add ""blue blue"" to the sequence.

2. ""lug walm zup"": the output adds ""yellow"" to the end of ""blue blue blue"". We know from the other cases that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. For ""zup dax lug walm zup"", the output is ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"". Here, we can see that the presence of ""zup"" at the beginning and end of the sequence adds ""yellow"" at both ends of the output, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" adds two more ""blue"".

4. Again, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".

5. In ""zup walm lug"", ""walm"" seems to add two more ""yellow"" before the ""blue"" output. However, this contradicts the established pattern of ""walm"" adding two ""blue"" to the output. Therefore, we must find a rule that unifies all examples.

By examining the examples, it becomes evident that ""walm"" has different behaviors depending on its position with respect to ""lug"" and ""zup"":
- ""walm"" adds ""blue blue"" after ""lug"" and before ""zup"".
- ""walm"" adds twice the color that follows it when ""lug"" precedes it.
- ""walm"" adds twice the color that precedes it when ""zup"" follows it.

With the given examples, the most consistent rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately after it if that word is ""lug"", and it repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it if that word is ""zup"". However, without further examples, it's difficult to determine the exact rule for ""walm"" if those specific conditions are not met (i.e., without neighboring ""lug"" or ""zup""). 

Rule: 
- If ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output associated with ""walm"" is twice the output color corresponding to the word following ""walm"".
- If ""walm"" precedes ""zup"", the output associated with ""walm"" is twice the output color corresponding to the word preceding ""walm"".

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: When followed by ""lug"", it outputs ""blue blue"". When followed by ""zup"", it outputs the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm"" twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug zup bluf wif bluf
    ",Output: red blue yellow yellow red red,red blue yellow yellow red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems clear that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. None of the examples indicate that the meaning of ""lug"" depends on its position or context within the string of words; it is always associated with the same color in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following mapping for the words:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: wif
Output: red
- Here, ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red.""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- When paired with ""zup,"" the word ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- This is a repeat of the previous example and confirms the pairings: ""zup"" = ""yellow"" and ""wif"" = ""red.""

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- In this case, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is three times ""red."" We need to infer the meaning of ""walm."" One hypothesis could be that ""walm"" means to ""repeat the previous color,"" which in this context is ""red.""

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- This example repeats the previous one and thus confirms the pattern we observed.

When analyzing these inputs and outputs, we encounter a primary difficulty in that the meaning of ""wif"" has to remain constant throughout the examples for the rule to hold true. Given these examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" to be simply ""red,"" since it consistently translates to ""red"" in the output. The complications arise with interpreting ""walm,"" which seems to act as a repeating modifier, but since it's not consistent across more varied examples, this is just speculation based on the limited data provided.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" signals the start of a sequence where each subsequent word corresponds to a specific color and a number of repetitions. Here are the observations:

1. ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" means blue and is said once.
2. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" suggesting ""walm"" means red and is said three times.
3. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" suggesting ""wif"" means red and is said once.
4. ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" always corresponds to yellow and is said once.

Therefore, using these observations, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow, and it initiates a color sequence where each subsequent word indicates a specific color and the number of times it should be repeated. ""lug"" corresponds to blue once, ""wif"" corresponds to red once, and ""walm"" corresponds to red three times.
Rule: bluf duplicates the color associated with the word that appears just before it. 

Examples:

- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"" because the word before bluf is ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"" because the word before bluf is ""wif,"" which translates to ""red.""
- ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue"" because the word before bluf is ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue.""

Thus, bluf -> repeats the color denoted by the preceding word.
walm -> [color of the preceding word] [color of the preceding word] [color of the preceding word]

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to be three repetitions of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif"", both of which are associated with the colors ""blue"" and ""red"", respectively. Therefore, ""walm"" results in ""blue blue red red red"" being added to the output (since ""walm"" appears twice).

- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which is associated with the color ""green"". Therefore, ""walm"" results in ""green green green"" being added to the output.

- In the third example, it again follows ""dax"", and thus the result is three times ""green"".

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and therefore the output is three times ""green"".

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", and thus the output is three times ""yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Every instance of ""lug"" in the input directly translates to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the sequence or the words surrounding it.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce what ""dax"" means, let's look at the provided examples and see where ""dax"" appears and what output it corresponds with:

1. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"".

2. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green
   Here, ""dax"" appears twice and both times it corresponds with ""green"".

3. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   Again, every time ""dax"" appears, it corresponds with ""green"".

4. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   Here, ""dax"" appears after ""lug"" and it corresponds with ""green"".

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Here, ""dax"" appears before ""walm"" and both correspond with ""green"".

Considering these examples, it seems that no matter where ""dax"" appears in the sequence, it consistently corresponds with the output ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to identify patterns and consistencies in the examples provided. 

Let's examine each input and output pair:

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""walm"" is associated with ""red.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" is still associated with ""red."" ""Wif"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in an extra ""red.""

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the sequence, ""wif"" is still associated with ""red,"" but an extra ""red"" appears when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf.""

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""
- One inconsistency is that ""bluf"" does not result in a specific color output, so it might be a neutral or irrelevant term in this context.
- Each time ""wif"" appears, an extra ""red"" is added to the output.

From these observations, it does not appear that ""wif"" has a stable one-to-one correlation with a specific color. Instead, it suggests that ""wif"" serves as a doubling modifier for the color word that follows it. If there's no color-related word after ""wif,"" then ""wif"" by itself represents ""red.""

Rule: ""wif"" doubles the color output of the following color-associated word, or by itself, it corresponds to ""red.""
Based on the examples given:

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
Input: zup -> Output: yellow
Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green

From the provided examples, the constant element associated with the input ""zup"" is the output ""yellow"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence—whether it's at the beginning, in the middle, or follows another word—the output consistently includes the word ""yellow"".

Therefore, we can deduce the meaning as follows:

zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: Whenever the input contains the word ""zup"", the output will include the word ""yellow"" corresponding to its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, each nonce word seems to correspond to a particular color in the output. The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in each output sequence, regardless of its position or the words preceding or following it. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

bluf -> green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for consistencies across the provided examples. Here are the examples again with a focus on the occurrences of ""walm"":

1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
3. Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red
4. Input: wif dax zup walm -> Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: lug walm wif -> Output: blue blue blue red

Analyzing the examples, we can identify the following patterns:

- ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow,"" as seen by its repeated presence with the output ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" as seen by its repeated presence with the output ""red.""
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" as seen by its repeated presence with the output ""blue.""
- ""dax"" might correspond to ""green,"" as seen by its one occurrence with the output ""green.""
- ""bluf"" in the third example does not have a clear correspondence, but given that it comes after ""wif"" which seems to correspond to ""red,"" ""bluf"" could be hypothesized to mean ""red"" based upon the output ""red red"" following it. However, there's not enough evidence to conclusively determine its meaning.

Given this information, let's look specifically at the occurrences of ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" we get three times yellow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup wif,"" we get four times red.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" we get three times blue.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif dax zup,"" we get three times yellow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug wif,"" we get three times blue and a red.

From these examples, ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. In instances where multiple colors are outputted after ""walm,"" the repeated color is the one associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" For example, in ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" In ""lug walm wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" to red, so the output is ""blue blue blue"" from ""lug walm"" and an additional ""red"" from ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the word immediately before it to repeat its associated color three times in the output. If a different color word comes after ""walm,"" that color appears in the sequence once after the three repeated colors.

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding color word to repeat its corresponding color three times in the output. If followed by a different color word, that color is outputted once after the repeated colors.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm dax wif lug
    ",Output: green yellow yellow yellow green red blue,green yellow yellow yellow green red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning

Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""lug"" can be consistently identified. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. There are no examples where ""lug"" corresponds to anything other than ""blue"". This suggests a direct mapping between the nonce word ""lug"" and the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug means blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the given examples and their outputs.

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   
2. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   
3. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   
4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

Based on the above examples, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is in the corresponding output. The word ""dax"" is thus consistently associated with the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the list of input words or the other words present. The other words (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"") seem to correlate with different colors as well (""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red""), but those are not part of the task to define.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs provided. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. The appearance of ""zup"" in the input does not seem to be affected by adjacent words like ""wif"" or ""bluf"" since ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"" regardless of context.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" 

Based on the provided examples, every occurrence of ""bluf"" has an associated output of the color ""blue,"" regardless of the position of the word in the sequence or the surrounding words. Thus, ""bluf"" consistently represents the color blue.

bluf -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" generates a sequence of ""yellow"" unless interrupted by another color word (like ""wif"" which translates to red). Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is a repetition of ""yellow"" for each word until another color is mentioned or the input sequence ends.

Here are the observations leading to this conclusion:

1. In the first example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color word preceding it, which is ""yellow"" associated with ""zup.""

2. In the second example, ""zup dax walm lug wif"" leads to ""yellow green green green blue red."" We see that ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which translates to green) and results in repeated ""green"" until ""lug"" (which translates to blue) and ""wif"" (which translates to red) are listed, ending the repetition.

3. The third example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" Here ""walm"" again causes a repetition of the color word preceding it (""zup"" for yellow) until another color word is encountered (""wif"" for red).

4. The fourth example, ""zup dax walm,"" has no other color word following ""walm"" and thus only results in repeated ""green"" following ""dax.""

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" ""Walm"" causes repeated ""yellow"" after ""zup"" up until ""wif"" which is red.

Rule: walm -> triggers a repetition of the color word that precedes it, continuing until interrupted by another color word or the end of the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the translation of the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be consistent. In each instance where ""lug"" appears, it is translated as ""blue."" Therefore, the rule for the word ""lug"" can be deduced as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" consistently. In the context of these examples, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the additional words around it, the output is always ""green"" when ""dax"" is present. Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can observe a pattern concerning the placement of the word ""wif"" and its corresponding output in color. I will list the occurrences:

- ""wif zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow red green""
- ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red""
- ""lug wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red blue""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow""
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""

From these examples, it is clear that every occurrence of ""wif"" maps to the color ""red."" There don’t appear to be any other conditions affecting this output, as ""wif"" precedes and follows different words in the examples but consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" at both the beginning and at the end of the sequence corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" once again corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" appears both at the beginning and end of the sequence, and in both instances, it corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" once more.

It seems consistent across all examples that whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow."" Therefore, based on the examples given, it can be deduced that the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to represent a sequence of two color words. When ""bluf"" is used, it results in the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. Observing the patterns in the inputs and outputs, the rule for ""bluf"" can be summarized as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The repetition of the color word that comes right before it in the sequence.

Here's how it works with each example:

- ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red"", meaning ""bluf"" caused the word before it, ""red (wif)"", to repeat.
- ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" results in ""green blue yellow red red green"", meaning ""bluf"" caused ""red (wif)"" to repeat.
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", meaning ""bluf"" caused ""blue (lug)"" to repeat.
- ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"", meaning ""bluf"" caused ""yellow (zup)"" to repeat.
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", meaning ""bluf"" caused ""red (wif)"" to repeat.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated color output. Notably, the repetitions are of the color that precedes the ""walm."" 

Here are the mappings derived from the input-output examples:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in repeating ""red.""

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in repeating ""blue.""

3. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" continues the ""blue"" and is followed by ""wif,"" which changes it to ""red.""

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" changes the color to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red,"" followed by ""lug,"" which changes it to ""blue.""

5. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" changes the color to ""red,"" ""dax"" changes the color to ""green,"" ""zup"" changes it to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" results in repeating ""yellow.""

With these mappings in mind, here's the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that directly precedes ""walm"" multiple times (specifically, three times based on the examples provided).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When the word ""lug"" is used in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, each input word corresponds to a specific output color. We can find the meaning of ""dax"" by comparing inputs and their outputs where ""dax"" is the only shared element.

To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we examine each instance it appears and the associated output:

1. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""
2. ""zup lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue yellow red green""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow""
5. ""dax"" -> ""green""

Except for example 1, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in every instance. In example 1, ""wif"" likely corresponds to ""red,"" making ""dax"" correspond to ""green."" Thus, we can conclude that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be as follows:

- When the word ""zup"" is preceded by the nonsense word ""dax,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- The word following ""zup"" dictates the color following ""yellow."" In every example, ""lug"" follows ""zup,"" and ""blue"" follows ""yellow.""
- Other nonce words like ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" seem to correspond to specific colors regardless of their position relative to ""zup."" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" has been seen to correspond to ""green"" as well.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" followed by a color corresponding to the word immediately after ""zup,"" if there is a word following it. In the given examples, this additional color has only been ""blue"" due to the presence of ""lug"" following ""zup.""

zup -> ""yellow"" (followed by a color corresponding to the next word, if present)
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. Here’s the breakdown:

1. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"". Hence, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" here.

2. wif bluf -> red red
   Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", taking on the corresponding color ""red"".

3. wif dax bluf -> red green green
   ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"". Therefore, ""bluf"" is ""green"" in this instance.

4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"". In this case, ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".

5. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   ""bluf"" follows the second occurrence of ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"". Hence, ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" in this example.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the word just before ""walm"" three times. 

- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" implying ""dax"" means ""green.""
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" implying ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow,"" suggesting ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and that ""dax"" and ""lug"" retain their meanings, with ""walm"" causing the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated three times.
- ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green,"" which again indicates that ""walm"" causes the preceding color (blue for ""lug"") to be repeated three times, and then ""dax"" is translated to ""green.""
- ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red,"" showing that ""walm"" caused the preceding ""green"" to be reiterated three times, and ""wif"" contributes the color ""red"" afterward.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Based on the provided examples, whenever the word 'lug' appears in the input, it corresponds to the color 'blue' in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples and the corresponding outputs, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to translate to the color ""red"". Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the inputs correlates with the word ""red"" in the outputs, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""bluf"" results in the output echoing the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The rule induction based on the given data is as follows:

- dax bluf -> green green (the word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green' and 'bluf' repeats the color)
- wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green (each 'bluf' repeats the color of the word right before it)
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (the word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' and 'bluf' repeats the color)
- wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue (the word before each 'bluf' has its color repeated as the output for 'bluf')
- lug bluf -> blue blue (the word 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue' and 'bluf' repeats the color)

Therefore, the rule induced for the nonce word ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding it.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the following word to replicate the color output of the preceding word multiple times.

Here is the pattern we observe:

1. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow"".
Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which outputs ""yellow"". After ""walm"", the word ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

2. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
Here, ""walm"" follows the second ""zup"", which outputs ""yellow"". After ""walm"", the word ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

3. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which outputs ""red"". After ""walm"", the word ""red"" is repeated three times.

4. ""zup dax walm"" -> ""yellow green green green""
Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which outputs ""green"". After ""walm"", the word ""green"" is repeated three times.

5. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which outputs ""blue"". After ""walm"", the word ""blue"" is repeated three times before moving on to new words ""wif"" and ""dax"" which output ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.

Rule:
walm -> causes the next output to repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" maps consistently to ""blue"". Each instance of ""lug"" in the inputs correlates with ""blue"" in the outputs.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it is represented as ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to infer the meaning of ""wif"" by looking for a pattern in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: wif
Output: red
- Here, ""wif"" translates directly to ""red.""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" follows as ""red.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue
- We see that ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as well, and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Input: dax wif dax
Output: green red green
- ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" is again ""red.""

Input: wif
Output: red
- This is a repetition of the first example, providing further confirmation that ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, each instance of a unique word corresponds to a specific color. Therefore, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples where ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors (red, green, yellow), it's evident that ""bluf"" does not directly translate to a specific color. Rather, it appears to represent a rule about how to determine the output color. To deduce the underlying rule, we should look for patterns related to the position of ""bluf"" and the colors it produces.

Analyzing the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output color is green:
  Input: ""dax wif bluf"" -> Output: green red red
  Input: ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> Output: green green red yellow red
  Input: ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" -> Output: green green yellow yellow green

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output color is red:
  Input: ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output color is yellow:
  Input: ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
  Input: ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" -> Output: green green yellow yellow green

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output color is blue:
  Input: ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> Output: green yellow red red blue

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" represents a rule where the output color changes depending on the word that comes before ""bluf"". Specifically:

- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" results in ""green""
- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" results in ""red""
- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" results in ""yellow""
- ""lug"" before ""bluf"" results in ""blue""

Rule: bluf -> outputs a color dependent on the preceding word; green after ""dax"", red after ""wif"", yellow after ""zup"", and blue after ""lug"".
Based on the given examples, it seems like the word ""walm"" translates into a sequence of colors that mimic the sequence of colors immediately preceding it. Here is the breakdown of each example:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". ""Walm"" copies the ""blue"" that comes before it, so it translates to ""blue"". ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and since ""walm"" continues to mimic, the next ""blue"" and ""yellow"" are also produced by ""walm"".

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Rule: The words translate as ""red red green"", and then ""walm"" mimics ""green"" twice, resulting in ""green green"".

3. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: The initial ""red"" is from ""wif"", and then ""walm"" duplicates this ""red"", leading to ""red red"". ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and the subsequent ""walm"" mimics this ""yellow"" twice, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"".

4. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""walm"" then mimics this color twice, and ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

5. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"". ""Walm"" copies this ""green"" twice, ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", another ""dax"" is ""green"", and then ""walm"" mimics the ""green"" thrice.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Walm -> meaning: ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the sequence of colors that appear immediately before it. 

Rule: Walm mimics the color or sequence of colors present immediately prior to its occurrence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. Here are the translations line by line:

1. lug zup wif lug -> blue yellow red blue
2. lug bluf -> blue blue
3. lug dax lug wif -> blue green blue red
4. lug zup dax wif -> blue yellow green red
5. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow

From this, we can deduce the rule that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Analyzing the examples provided:

1. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green""
2. ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green""
3. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
4. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
5. ""lug dax wif lug"" -> ""blue green red blue""

Considering each example:

- In examples 1 and 2, the word 'dax' is followed by 'walm', which correlates with ""green green"". This suggests that 'dax' might be associated with the color green, but 'walm' seems to represent a repeating sequence of green.
- In example 3, 'dax' precedes 'bluf', and the output is ""green green"", reinforcing the idea that 'dax' could be green, while 'bluf' also appears to mean green.
- Example 4 simply has 'dax wif' and correlates with ""green red"", suggesting 'dax' means green and 'wif' means red.
- Example 5 further solidifies the color associations, with 'dax' between 'lug' and 'wif', giving us ""blue green red"", where 'lug' means blue, 'dax' means green, and 'wif' means red.

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding outputs:

- When ""wif"" is the only input, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is in the middle of the sequence ""zup wif bluf,"" the outputs are ""yellow red red."" It seems that ""wif"" generates ""red,"" as do other inputs in this sequence.
- When ""wif"" comes right after ""lug,"" as in ""lug wif,"" the outputs are ""blue red."" This indicates that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and that ""wif"" is consistently giving ""red.""
- When ""wif"" comes before ""lug,"" as in ""wif lug,"" the outputs are ""red blue,"" further confirming that the order doesn't affect their individual outputs.
- In a longer sequence like ""dax zup lug wif lug,"" the output is ""green yellow blue red blue."" The appearance of ""wif"" still results in ""red.""

Based on these observations, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" no matter its position in the sequence. Thus, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be simply:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of zup, we should look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs.

- In ""Input: zup dax; Output: yellow green,"" zup is followed by another word and translates to ""yellow.""
- In ""Input: lug wif zup wif walm; Output: blue red yellow red red red,"" zup appears after two words and translates to ""yellow"" as well.
- In ""Input: wif zup; Output: red yellow,"" zup comes after one word and translates to ""yellow.""
- In ""Input: zup lug; Output: yellow blue,"" zup appears first and translates to ""yellow.""
- In ""Input: zup wif walm; Output: yellow red red red,"" zup comes first and translates to ""yellow.""

From these examples, it's clear that zup consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the context it's used in. Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we should look for consistent patterns in relation to it in the given examples. Analyzing the examples provided:

1. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
2. When ""lug"" and ""dax"" come before ""bluf,"" the output refers to the colors related to ""lug"" and ""dax,"" which are ""blue green green.""
3. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue.""
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output color representing ""bluf"" is ""green.""
5. When ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""lug"" and ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

From these examples, we can deduce that:

- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""

The output after ""bluf"" is always a repetition of the color before ""bluf."" Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the input and the corresponding output in each of the provided examples:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"" 
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   
2. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   
3. Input: ""wif walm""
   Output: ""red red red""

4. Input: ""dax walm wif""
   Output: ""green green green red""

5. Input: ""wif walm""
   Output: ""red red red""

Looking at examples (3) and (5), we see that the input ""wif walm"" consistently corresponds to ""red red red."" This indicates that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" likely means ""repeated.""

Similarly, in example (2), ""dax"" yields ""green,"" and since the output is ""green green green,"" this again suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to ""repeated.""

Example (1) introduces ""zup"" before ""wif walm"" and the output starts with ""yellow,"" so ""zup"" likely means ""yellow,"" followed by the ""red red red"" pattern consistent with ""wif walm.""

Example (4) contains ""dax walm wif"" and the output is ""green green green red,"" which confirms the meanings of ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"" as ""green,"" ""red,"" and ""repeated"" respectively.

Based on these observations, the following rule can be inferred:

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times.

walm -> meaning: repeated (three times, based on the given examples)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the examples provided, we can observe that every time the word ""dax"" is mentioned, the output color is ""green"". There doesn't appear to be any context that changes the resultant color. Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to ""red"". When examining the inputs and corresponding outputs, we see that every time ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" shows up in the output. Hence, ""wif"" does not seem to change its meaning based on context; it consistently corresponds to the same output across all examples.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" It also appears that other words may correspond to other colors; for example, ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and ""lug"" outputs ""blue."" Furthermore, repeating a word like ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in a repetition of the colors (""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"").

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the examples provided, it appears that 'bluf' duplicates the color word that immediately precedes it. Here is how the rule applies in each case:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"". Here, 'wif' represents the color 'red' and 'bluf' duplicates it.
- In the second example, ""lug dax bluf"" becomes ""blue green green"". So, 'dax' represents 'green', and 'bluf' duplicates the 'green'.
- In the third example, ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow"". Here, 'zup' represents 'yellow', and 'bluf' duplicates 'yellow'.
- In the fourth example, ""wif lug zup bluf"" becomes ""red blue yellow yellow"". Here, 'zup' is the color word immediately before 'bluf', representing 'yellow', and 'bluf' duplicates this 'yellow' color word.
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green green yellow green"". Again, 'bluf' duplicates the color word immediately before it, which is 'green' represented by 'dax', and later the sequence continues normally with 'zup' and 'dax' representing their respective colors without duplication.

Rule: bluf duplicates the color word that comes immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns within the given examples and their mappings between the inputs and outputs.

Let's examine where ""walm"" appears and its corresponding output color:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
3. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
4. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

From the examples, we can determine the following mappings for the words that are not ""walm"":

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> yellow (based on its appearance in example 3 only)

Now, let's isolate the positions where ""walm"" appears and look for a pattern:
- Example 1: wif (red) walm dax (red) zup (green)
- Example 2: zup (yellow) dax (green) walm lug (green) wif (blue)
- Example 3: wif (red) zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) lug (blue) walm dax (blue) lug
- Example 4: lug (blue) walm wif (blue) lug
- Example 5: zup (yellow) wif (red) walm

In all instances, the color that follows ""walm"" is red. There does seem to be a pattern that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the previous word's color. Hence, ""walm"" seems to induce the repetition of the preceding color in the sequence. 

We can write the rule as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

However, in the chance that there's more context needed or if this rule doesn't hold for future examples, this conclusion could be revised.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words around it.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output, regardless of the context or position of the word in the sequence.

dax -> ""green""

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, it translates to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif."" Let's observe the pattern:

- In the first example, ""wif"" comes after ""walm"" and corresponds to the color red.
- In the second example, ""wif"" stands alone following ""dax"" and results in red while ""wif"" preceeded by ""walm"" corresponds to red as well.
- In the third example, ""wif"" is at the beginning and corresponds to red.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""wif"" stands alone and also corresponds to red.

From these observations, regardless of position or neighboring words, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.
To decipher the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns:

1. ""lug wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue blue.""
   - ""wif"" -> red. 
   - ""lug"" before ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but ""lug"" also appears again after ""wif,"" still corresponding to ""blue.""

2. ""dax walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green green green red red.""
   - ""walm"" -> green. 
   - ""dax"" before ""wif"" corresponds to ""green,"" but when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color that follows is red instead.

3. ""zup wif bluf zup"" corresponds to ""yellow red red yellow.""
   - ""zup"" -> yellow.
   - ""bluf"" following ""wif"" again results in the color ""red."" 

4. ""zup bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green blue.""
   - ""bluf"" here is followed by ""dax"" and ""lug,"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""blue."" 

5. ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green green yellow green.""
   - ""bluf"" followed by ""zup"" yields ""green.""

According to these observations, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the word that follows it:

- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the color is blue.
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the color is green.
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" the only occurrence is followed by ""dax,"" making it green, but it's ambiguous whether it's because of the ""zup"" or ""dax"" as ""zup"" also appears alone at the start and end, mapping to ""yellow.""

However, when ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), it corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of the following word.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the following word unless it is directly after ""wif,"" in which case it is red.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the following word unless it follows ""wif,"" then it is red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" designates a repetition of the color immediately preceding it three times. We can verify this by looking at each example:

- In the first input ""lug wif walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" with ""walm"" causing ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- In the second input ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" causing ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.
- In the third input ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" we see ""red"" being repeated three times followed by ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and then ""yellow"" repeated three times again after another ""walm.""
- In the fourth input ""lug walm zup walm,"" ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" which is then repeated three times for ""walm,"" followed by ""yellow"" and another set of three ""yellow"" for the second ""walm.""
- In the fifth input ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" we see a pattern of ""blue,"" ""red,"" ""green,"" and then ""yellow"" repeated three times for ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, one can deduce the following:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears alone or as the first word in a sequence, it translates to a single ""blue"".
- If ""lug"" appears after ""wif"", it still translates to ""blue"", but does not seem to alter the translation of ""wif"" which is ""red"".
- The presence of ""lug"" does not seem to change based on its position, as it always translates to ""blue"".
- The number of times ""lug"" appears is directly proportional to the number of times ""blue"" appears in the output, signifying that ""lug"" does not represent a compound or multiple concepts.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue (In any context, ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".)
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the instances where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
2. zup lug wif dax lug -> yellow blue red green blue
3. dax zup wif zup -> green yellow red yellow
4. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
5. wif walm dax -> red red green

From these examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the given examples.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow. Every instance where zup appears in the input, the word yellow appears in the output at the corresponding position.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the examples:

Input: zup lug bluf
Output: yellow blue blue

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

From the provided examples, we can observe the following:

1. ""bluf"" always results in the word ""blue"" at least once in the output.
2. ""bluf"" seems to repeat ""blue"" in the output as many times as the word that directly precedes it. For example, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" based on other examples.
3. ""bluf"" stands alone without repetition only when it comes after a word not previously used in an example (""zup lug bluf"" with ""zup"" being a new word, resulting in only one ""blue"" in the output).
4. When ""bluf"" follows a word that has an identified color translation (""lug"" for ""blue,"" ""dax"" for ""green,"" ""wif"" for ""red""), it repeats that color.

Thus, ""bluf"" appears to be a rule-based command that causes the output to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word in the output.
Based on the examples provided where ""walm"" appears in the input and a repeated color appears in the output, we can induce that ""walm"" refers to a repetition of the color word that precedes it. We’ll demonstrate this rule with the given input-output pairs.

For the first example:

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" The output repeats ""yellow"" three times, which is the same number of times ""walm"" is used.

For the second example:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the output contains ""yellow"" repeated three times.
 
For the third example:

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and the output repeats ""blue"" three times.

For the fourth example:

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- In this example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the output has ""green"" repeated three times.

For the fifth example:

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- In this final example, ""walm"" follows the second to last ""wif"" (red), and the output shows ""red"" repeated three times just before the final ""blue"" for ""lug.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates a repetition of the color word preceding it the same number of times as ""walm"" appears in the sequence. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that precedes ""walm"" an equal number of times to the count of ""walm"" in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it is translated to the color ""blue"" in the output.
The given examples seem to associate the non-word ""dax"" with a color, specifically the color green. We can see that in every instance where ""dax"" is an input, the corresponding output includes the color green.

By examining the transformation from the input to the output, one by one, we note the following patterns:

1. ""dax wif lug"" -> ""green red blue"": Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" and ""lug"", which correspond to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively, and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

2. ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green"": ""dax"" appears twice and both times it corresponds to ""green"". ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"", which is similar to ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue"".

3. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

4. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green"": The first two terms ""wif"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively, and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""; ""walm"" seems to also correspond to ""green"".

5. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"", when coming after ""dax"", also corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Based on the output from the examples, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence. Additionally, ""walm"" appears to correspond to ""green"" when following ""dax"".

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" each time it appears in the input. Every instance of ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe that each time the word ""bluf"" appears, the output color that follows is the same as the color that precedes it. To explain in detail:

1. In the first example, ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue green blue"". The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the color following ""bluf"" is also ""yellow"".

2. In the second example, ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue"". The word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"", and the color following ""bluf"" is also ""green"".

3. In the third example, ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red"". Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the color following ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".

4. In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"". Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the color following ""bluf"" is ""red"".

5. In the fifth example, ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow"". The word ""zup"" is before ""bluf"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the color following ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".

From these observations, it seems that the rule is that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should focus on the transformation of ""walm"" into colors and its interaction with other words. 

For each instance where ""walm"" is used, let's analyze the output:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   * Here, ""walm"" correlates to three instances of ""red.""

2. Input: ""wif walm lug bluf""
   Output: ""red red red blue blue""
   * Again, ""walm"" correlates to three instances of ""red.""

3. Input: ""zup wif walm lug""
   Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
   * Here, ""walm"" correlates to three instances of ""red"" and ""lug"" adds one instance of ""blue.""

4. Input: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
   * We see ""walm"" as two instances of ""yellow"" after ""zup lug zup"" (+1 yellow from ""zup"" and +1 blue from ""lug"" but no blue is seen). It seems that ""walm"" negates the effect of the last ""lug"" (canceling the blue) and adds two more instances of ""yellow.""

5. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   * ""walm"" correlates to three instances of ""green"" following ""dax."" 

From these examples, we can see that ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of the color corresponding to the directly preceding word if there is one. If ""walm"" is the first word, the rule does not apply since we don't have an example to deduce its effect in that position.

Now let's turn this observation into a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be outputted three times. If the preceding word corresponds to multiple colors, ""walm"" negates any additional effects of the preceding word and repeats the primary color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup lug dax bluf
    ",Output: blue green yellow blue green green,blue green yellow blue green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given:

When presented alone:
- Input: lug
- Output: blue

It seems:

- lug -> blue

However, looking at the examples where lug is combined with other words:

- Input: wif zup lug wif
- Output: red yellow blue red

We can see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

- Input: lug zup
- Output: blue yellow

Again, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Looking at examples with ""dax"" and ""walm"":

- Input: dax lug walm
- Output: green blue blue blue

We also notice that ""dax"" outputs ""green"" once and “walm” outputs “blue” three times. The repetition following “walm” seems to indicate that ""walm"" results in repeating the color that precedes it three times, which in this case is ""blue"" (from ""lug"").

- Input: wif lug dax walm
- Output: red blue green green green

Here again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in the color from ""dax"" (which is ""green"") being repeated three times.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue. When we see the word ""lug,"" it translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position between other words. Other nonces like ""walm"" seem to have effects on repetition, but ""lug"" consistently means ""blue.""
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns and corresponding outputs in the given examples:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by different words (""bluf wif zup wif""), the output begins with green followed by another color corresponding to each additional word.

2. When ""dax"" is followed by just one word (""wif""), the output is green followed by red, suggesting that ""wif"" on its own triggers red.

3. When ""dax"" is followed by repeating words (""walm zup walm""), the output is a repeating pattern, starting with green for ""dax"" followed by green for each ""walm"" and yellow for the ""zup"". This indicates that ""walm"" may be associated with green, similar to ""dax.""

4. When ""dax"" appears twice with a word in between (""zup dax""), it yields green, yellow, green, reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" corresponds to green regardless of its position.

5. ""dax"" on its own results in green, solidifying that the presence of the word ""dax"" itself correlates to the color green.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" correlates to the color green; its presence in a sequence results in the output ""green"" for its position.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given input/output pairs:

1. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
2. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
3. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
4. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
5. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""

Looking at the examples, it seems that ""wif"" always results in the output ""red."" However, it's important to recognize the context of ""wif"" in each example:

1. When preceded by ""lug,"" the output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" but ""wif"" after the ""lug"" produces ""red.""
2. When followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""
3. In a string with multiple words, we see outputs corresponding to each individual word (""lug"" produces ""blue,"" ""walm"" is not given but the output after ""walm"" is ""blue"" which suggests ""walm"" might translate to ""blue"", ""zup"" produces ""yellow""), and for every instance of ""wif"" that follows, we get ""red.""
4. When ""wif"" precedes an unknown word ""bluf,"" there's an additional ""red"" in the output. Since we don't have another example including ""bluf,"" we cannot deduce its individual output, but we still see ""red"" for ""wif.""
5. When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" we get ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""

Therefore, the consistent rule regardless of context is that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Analyzing the given examples, we can try to infer a relationship between the presence of the nonce word ""zup"" in the input and its corresponding color in the output:

1. The sequence ""wif walm zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
2. The sequence ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow green blue"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
3. The sequence ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
4. The sequence ""zup dax lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
5. The sequence ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

In each case, the word ""zup"" in the input consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context of surrounding words. Therefore, the rule we can deduce from these examples is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. For instance, in ""wif dax bluf,"" we know that ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""dax"" to green. The output ""red green green"" implies that ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the color green, which is associated with the preceding word ""dax.""

Breaking down each example:

1. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green).
   
2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).
   
3. Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red
   - ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green), and then ""wif"" is red.
   
4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow
   - ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"" (blue), followed by ""wif"" being red, and ""zup"" being yellow.
   
5. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue
   - ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).

Bluf -> Meaning. Rule:
Bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""walm"" directly correlates to repeating the color associated with the word that comes directly before it three times. To determine the specific meaning and rule for ""walm"", let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" results in ""green"", followed by ""walm"" which results in ""green green green"".

2. Input: zup wif walm lug | Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" yields ""yellow"", ""wif"" yields ""red"", followed by ""walm"" which results in ""red red red"", and ""lug"" yields ""blue"".

3. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif | Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""lug"" yields ""blue"", ""dax"" yields ""green"", ""zup"" yields ""yellow"", ""dax"" again yields ""green"", followed by ""walm"" which yields ""green green green"" as it copies the color of ""dax"" three times, and finally ""wif"" yields ""red"".

4. Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" yields ""green"", ""walm"" follows and copies ""green"" three times, and ""wif"" yields ""red"".

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm | Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" yields ""red"", ""zup"" yields ""yellow"", ""lug"" yields ""blue"", ""dax"" yields ""green"", ""zup"" yields another ""yellow"", followed by ""walm"" which copies ""yellow"" three times as it comes after ""zup"".

Rule:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the word before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' appears in the input, the word 'blue' appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the examples provided:

- When the word 'dax' is used, the output is 'green'.
- Every other word in the input that is not 'dax' corresponds to different colors in the output, with each word consistently corresponding to the same color.

Here's a breakdown of the words and their corresponding colors, excluding 'dax':

- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'.
- 'walm' corresponds to 'yellow' (notice in the last example, 'walm' translates to 'green' following 'dax', but 'yellow' follows 'walm' towards the end, suggesting the change in output color might be influenced by the presence of 'dax' before it, which could be a special transitional rule).

Now considering the special case:

- In the sequence 'zup walm dax zup dax wif', 'walm' precedes 'dax' and is translated as 'yellow' but follows 'dax' and the output is 'green'. This might indicate a rule where 'dax' not only represents 'green' itself but also affects the previous word changing 'walm' to 'green' as well.

Given the examples and analysis above, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> 'green' and has the potential to change the color output of the word that immediately precedes it to 'green' as well.

However, there is not enough consistent evidence from the examples given to be certain about the impact 'dax' has on preceding words, so the main rule that we can infer is:

Rule: dax -> 'green'.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following associations:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> red (confirmed by repetition)
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Thus, from the examples given, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
From the given examples, we see that:

1. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow""
2. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red""
3. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow""
4. ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow""
5. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow""

According to these examples, every other word in the input (bluf, wif, walm, dax, lug) consistently translates to a specific color in the output: 

- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

No matter the position of these words in the input sequence, the translated color remains the same. 

The word ""zup"" appears in every input and is consistently followed by the word ""yellow"" in the output. However, the position of ""zup"" in the input doesn't appear to affect its corresponding output, as seen from the multiple positions ""zup"" takes across different inputs.

Given this information, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow."" There is no varying context or position-based rule discernible from the given examples; ""zup"" is always followed by ""yellow"" regardless of its position, suggesting a direct translation.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. To confirm this pattern, let's look at each example:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and then ""bluf"" repeats the ""red.""

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and then ""bluf"" repeats the ""green.""

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the ""blue"" from ""lug."" Lastly, ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow
- ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""bluf"" repeats the ""green,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Input: lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" repeats the ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

From these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it causes the word immediately before it to be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color output of the immediately preceding word. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

1. In the first input ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and after ""walm,"" the color green is repeated twice more.

2. In the second input ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" we get ""yellow green green green blue red."" The ""dax"" before ""walm"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"" we see the color green repeated two more times.

3. In the third input ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and after ""walm"" the color red is repeated twice more.

4. In the fourth input ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" After the first ""walm,"" ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow is repeated three times. After the second ""walm,"" ""wif"" which corresponds to red is repeated twice.

5. In the fifth input ""lug dax walm,"" the output is ""blue green green green."" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"" the color green is repeated twice more.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the immediately preceding word two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs. Additionally, the other words in the input correspond to their own color outputs. Let's look at the examples to confirm:

1. wif lug -> red blue
2. lug zup -> blue yellow
3. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
4. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
5. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue

In every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the equivalent position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the outputs. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output regardless of its position or the presence of other words.
Based on the examples provided, zup corresponds to a specific color. The word that appears in the same position as zup in the input translates to the color yellow in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> ""green"" when following the word ""dax""
 
Given the examples provided:

- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" signifying that ""bluf"" when following ""dax"" means ""green.""
- ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" contains ""dax bluf"" which once again translates to ""green green,"" but the standalone ""bluf"" following ""zup"" does not result in ""green,"" which could mean its translation is context-dependent with ""dax"" preceding it.
- ""lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue green green,"" again showing ""bluf"" as ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red,"" which shows that ""bluf"" by itself at the end is not directly translatable since it’s not preceded by ""dax.""
- ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" repeats the pattern, with ""dax bluf"" consistently translating to ""green green"" as long as ""dax"" directly precedes ""bluf.""

In conclusion: bluf -> ""green"" when the preceding word is ""dax"". If ""bluf"" does not have ""dax"" directly before it, it does not translate to ""green.""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can compare the input and output in each provided example and look for a pattern.

In the first example:
Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" 

In the second example:
Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

In the third example:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

In the fourth example:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

In the fifth example:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Looking at the patterns, we can see that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the list. In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" is repeated one more time in the output than it is in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color word to be repeated once more.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Upon examination of the input-output pairs provided in the examples, we can observe that ""lug"" always corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Here is the pattern I detected:

- Input: lug wif dax | Output: blue red green -> ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue -> ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- Input: wif lug bluf | Output: red blue blue -> ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- Input: dax zup lug wif lug | Output: green yellow blue red blue -> ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- Input: dax lug dax lug walm | Output: green blue green blue blue blue -> ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. None of the provided examples contradict this observation.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green"". Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, there is a corresponding ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Based on the provided examples, every instance of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the word ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" functions as a repeater of the previous word's associated color. In other words, when ""bluf"" occurs, it takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it.

To verify this, let's examine the examples:

1. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is associated with red, and thus ""bluf"" translates to red.

2. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" In this case, ""bluf"" follows a ""zup,"" which is yellow, leading ""bluf"" to also be yellow.

3. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green."" Here, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""bluf"" repeats that color value.

4. ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, and thus ""bluf"" is yellow.

5. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and so ""bluf"" is also blue.

Based on these examples:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.
In order to figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns associated with this word across all the examples. Let’s break down each input and its corresponding output to spot these patterns:

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
Analysis: ""lug"" results in ""blue"", ""dax"" results in ""green"", and ""walm"" comes in between, also resulting in ""blue"".

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
Analysis: ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", ""wif"" results in ""red"", ""dax"" results in ""green"", and ""lug"" results in ""blue"". ""Walm"" is followed by ""green"".

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Analysis: ""wif"" results in ""red"", ""dax"" results in ""green"", and ""zup"" results in ""yellow"". ""Walm"" is surrounded by ""red"".

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Analysis: ""lug"" results in ""blue"", ""zup"" in ""yellow"", ""wif"" in ""red"". ""Walm"" is followed by ""blue"".

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
Analysis: ""lug"" results in ""blue"", ""zup"" results in ""yellow"". ""Walm"" is followed by ""blue"".

Deduction:
Looking at the outputs, whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the color in the output it corresponds to is ""blue"". It does not seem to matter what its position in the input string is; whenever ""walm"" appears, the output is consistent.

Rule:
walm -> blue

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Analyzing the provided examples, the output words are consistent with the occurrence of ""lug"" and other words in the input. In all instances, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue in the output. Thus, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug"" based on this consistency.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green."" In every instance where ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output includes the color green, followed by a pattern that seems to depend on the word that comes after ""dax."" Specifically, the color green is repeated a number of times that corresponds to the number of syllables in the following word.

Here are the patterns that emerge from the examples given:

- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" results in ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" seems to correspond to three greens (as it has one syllable).
- ""zup dax zup lug"" results in ""yellow green yellow blue."" We see that ""dax"" is followed by only one green, as there is no word after ""dax.""
- ""lug dax lug wif"" results in ""blue green blue red,"" following the same pattern.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" once again, three greens for the one-syllable ""walm.""
- ""dax"" on its own yields a single green.

Thus, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, followed by a repetition of green for each syllable in the word immediately after ""dax."" If ""dax"" is the last word, only one green is outputted.

dax -> green (with repetition based on the following word’s syllables).
Based on the given examples, each word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- ""lug"" always appears with the output ""blue"".
- ""walm"" appears twice, and both times the output includes a repetition of ""red"".
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"", but it results in ""blue"" in another instance.
- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in each of its occurrences, regardless of its position or what follows.
- ""zup"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively in the last example.

The outputs appear to be color words, and each input word corresponds to one or more color words in the output. ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red,"" as shown in the provided inputs and outputs.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the action of repeating the color associated with the next word in the sequence one fewer times than the number of times the last non-""zup"" word was repeated. Let's examine the examples in detail:

1. lug walm zup walm
   lug -> blue (repeated once)
   walm -> yellow (repeated twice due to ""zup"" following the first ""walm"" indicating that ""walm"" should now be repeated three times)

   Output: blue blue (for lug) blue yellow (for first walm) yellow yellow (for zup walm)

2. zup dax wif
   Since ""zup"" is at the beginning, it doesn't have a previous color to determine the number of repetitions, so it defaults to one occurrence of yellow.
   dax -> green (repeated once)
   wif -> red (repeated once)

   Output: yellow (for zup) green (for dax) red (for wif)

3. wif dax zup walm
   wif -> red
   dax -> green
   zup walm -> zup makes ""walm"" repeat once because ""dax"" was only mentioned once before ""zup.""

   Output: red (for wif) green (for dax) yellow (for zup walm)

4. zup wif walm lug
   zup wif -> zup is at the beginning, so wif is yellow.
   walm -> red (repeated twice due to ""wif"" being mentioned before ""walm"" indicating a single repetition)
   lug -> blue (repeated three times because ""walm"" before it was mentioned twice, ""zup"" ignored)

   Output: yellow (for zup wif) red red (for walm) blue (for lug, repeated thrice because the previous word, not counting ""zup,"" is ""walm"" which was mentioned twice)

5. dax zup
   dax -> green
   zup -> yellow (since ""dax"" is mentioned before ""zup"" once, ""zup"" triggers a single repetition)

   Output: green (for dax) yellow (for zup)

Given these observations, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

zup -> Repeat the color of the subsequent word one fewer times than the preceding word (ignoring any previous ""zup""), defaulting to one repetition if ""zup"" is the first word or if there is no clear precedence for repetition.

Rule: ""zup"" -> Repeat the color of the next word fewer a single time, with the number of repetitions based on the previous word's occurrences minus one, or default to once if ""zup"" appears at the beginning or after another ""zup"".
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the word that precedes it. Below is the observed pattern:

- When preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue."" Therefore, in the context of ""lug bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
- For ""wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green green,"" indicating in the context of ""dax bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- With ""dax bluf zup,"" the output is ""green green yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" still means ""green"" when following ""dax.""
- In the case of ""wif bluf zup bluf wif,"" where ""bluf"" follows different words (here ""wif"" and ""zup""), it takes on the colors ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, depending on the preceding word.
- Finally, ""zup lug bluf"" produces ""yellow blue blue,"" which signifies that ""bluf"" means ""blue"" when following ""lug"" again.

Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of ""bluf"" is to duplicate the color denoted by the word immediately before it. The rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color denoted by the preceding word.
walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. 

Rule: If the previous word is 'lug', 'walm' translates to 'blue'. If the previous word is 'zup', 'walm' translates to 'yellow'. If the previous word is 'dax', 'walm' translates to 'green', and so on. It essentially means to repeat the color associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup walm dax lug zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it's clear that each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue"". There is no variation in meaning regardless of the context or the position of the word ""lug"" in the sentence. 

Rule: lug -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the input-output relationships across the given examples:

1. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
- Here, ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and ""walm,"" resulting in an output of ""green"" followed by three instances of ""blue.""

2. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
- ""Dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is three instances of ""green.""

3. Input: zup walm dax | Output: yellow yellow yellow green
- ""Dax"" follows ""zup"" and ""walm,"" with the output sequence including three ""yellow"" followed by a single ""green.""

4. Input: lug dax walm wif | Output: blue green green green red
- The sequence of ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue,"" followed by three ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug | Output: green green red yellow blue
- ""Dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug,"" yielding ""green,"" ""green,"" ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue"" respectively.

Based on the patterns observed in these examples, the following can be deduced:

- Each time the nonce word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- The appearance of ""dax"" does not influence the colors associated with other words (except for ""walm"").
- ""Walm"" consistently results in ""blue"" unless directly preceded by ""dax,"" in which case the output is ""green.""
- Other words seem to have a consistent color associated with them: ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" ""wif"" -> ""red,"" and ""zup"" -> ""yellow.""

From this analysis, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the output sequence, and it overrides the usual color association of the word that follows it if that word is ""walm.""
Based on the input and output examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. 

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we shall analyze its position and output in different examples.

Given the following pairs of input and output:

1. Input: zup dax walm zup wif 
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

2. Input: zup dax wif 
   Output: yellow green red

3. Input: lug zup lug 
   Output: blue yellow blue

4. Input: zup wif 
   Output: yellow red

5. Input: dax zup 
   Output: green yellow

By examining these examples, we can see that ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. From this pattern, we can deduce that the meaning of ""zup"" is directly translated to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here are the rules as derived from the inputs and outputs:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red"".
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. If ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""green"". If ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""red"". If ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow"". If ""lug"" comes after ""bluf"", it does not change the color of ""bluf"" but rather represents a standalone color ""blue"".

Bluf -> The color corresponding to the word that precedes it.
Analyzing the given examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a color. Let's first deduce the colors associated with some of the recurring words:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to red.
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to blue.
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to yellow.
- ""dax"" appears once and corresponds to green.

Now let's analyze the word ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""wif walm zup,"" ""wif"" is red, and ""zup"" is yellow. ""Walm"" gives the output red, just like ""wif.""
   
2. In the second example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""wif"" is red. ""Walm"" appears after ""lug"" and again the output is the color following it, which is yellow.

3. In the third example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" both ""lug"" before and after ""walm"" correspond to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. The output for ""walm"" is yellow.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green. The output for ""walm"" is blue, matching the color following it.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""zup"" is yellow. The output for ""walm"" here is yellow, matching the color following it.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the color of the word that follows it in the sequence. If there is no word after ""walm"", then it repeats the color from the word before it.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the following word. If there is no following word, it repeats the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples, regardless of context or position within the sequence of words.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" There are no examples that deviate from this pattern. Thus, the rule is that the word ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif"".

Let's analyze the association of colors to the use of ""wif"" in each input and output:

1. Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" is paired with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" follows and is paired with ""red""

2. Input: wif -> Output: red
- ""wif"" stands alone and is paired with ""red""

3. Input: dax lug wif lug -> Output: green blue red blue
- ""dax"" is paired with ""green""
- ""lug"" is paired with ""blue""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
- ""lug"" repeats the pairing with ""blue""

4. Input: lug walm wif zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
- ""lug"" is paired with ""blue""
- ""walm"" is paired with ""blue"" again
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
- ""zup"" is paired with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" repeats the pairing with ""red""

5. Input: lug dax walm wif -> Output: blue green green green red
- ""lug"" is paired with ""blue""
- ""dax"" is paired with ""green""
- ""walm"" is paired with ""green"" again (noting that ""walm"" had a previous pairing with ""blue"")
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

Based on the pattern observed, it appears that ""wif"" is consistently paired with the color ""red"". Each instance in the input where ""wif"" appears corresponds to an output occurrence of ""red"". Additionally, the other words are paired with colors, but the pairings for ""walm"" vary (""walm"" is paired with ""blue"" in the third input and ""green"" in the fifth input), indicating that the appearance of ""wif"" does not affect those pairings.

Rule: wif -> red

This means the rule whereby ""wif"" translates or corresponds to the color ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""zup"" is presented in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. It does not seem to matter what other words accompany ""zup""; ""yellow"" is always the associated output.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to the word ""red."" However, there is an additional pattern where ""bluf"" also causes the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output with its corresponding translated color.

Let's detail the translations and patterns seen in each line:

1. Input: ""wif bluf"" | Output: ""red red""
   - ""wif"" maps to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" repeats the preceding word's output ""red.""

2. Input: ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" | Output: ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
   - ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""walm"" maps to ""blue,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" thus ""blue"" from ""lug"" is repeated, and ""bluf"" itself translates to ""red.""

3. Input: ""wif bluf dax"" | Output: ""red red green""
   - ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" repeats the preceding word's output ""red,"" and ""bluf"" itself translates to ""red.""

4. Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" | Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
   - ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""walm"" maps to ""blue,"" ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" thus ""yellow"" from ""zup"" is repeated, and ""bluf"" itself translates to ""red.""

5. Input: ""dax bluf lug wif"" | Output: ""green green blue red""
   - ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" thus ""green"" from ""dax"" is repeated, and ""bluf"" itself translates to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> replicates the color of the word before it and translates to ""red"".
walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it dictates that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times. For example, when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times because ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Similarly, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, so ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" The color associations appear to be as follows:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Hence, the word ""walm"" takes the color linked to the word just before it and repeats that color thrice in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue yellow blue,yellow blue yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Given the examples where the input involves the nonce word ""dax"" and the specific outputs resulting from these inputs, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by analyzing the consistent pattern. Here's the information provided:

- Input: dax lug / Output: green blue
- Input: lug dax walm wif / Output: blue green green green red
- Input: dax lug / Output: green blue
- Input: lug dax / Output: blue green
- Input: dax zup wif bluf lug / Output: green yellow red red blue

Every time ""dax"" appears, the output includes ""green."" Moreover, ""dax"" consistently appears as the first word in the input when it's immediately followed by ""lug,"" and this results in ""green blue"" as the output. When ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is reversed ""blue green.""

Based on this consistent pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

When the nonce word ""dax"" is in an input sequence, the corresponding output word is ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". When ""wif"" appears in a sequence, the word before it translates to a color, followed by ""red"", and if a word follows ""wif"", it also translates to its corresponding color. Let's analyze the examples given to understand this pattern:

- Input: lug wif
  Output: blue red
  Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

- Input: dax zup wif
  Output: green yellow red
  ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

- Input: dax wif
  Output: green red
  ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

- Input: wif lug
  Output: red blue
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

- Input: wif lug dax lug
  Output: red blue green blue
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the second ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue.""

Thus, the rule appears to be that each nonce word translates to a specific color, and ""wif"" in particular translates to ""red"" consistently. 

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

From the given examples, it appears that every time the word 'zup' is included in the input, the word 'yellow' appears in the same position in the output. Thus, the rule seems to be that 'zup' translates to 'yellow'. 

Rule: 'zup' means 'yellow'.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to be a placeholder for a variable in the sequence. The variable takes on the color of the previous word in the sequence. For example:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""wif"" with ""red"". When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", it takes on the color ""blue"". When it follows ""wif"", it takes on ""red"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" follows, taking on the color ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and ""bluf"" follows, taking on the color ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""wif"" with ""red"". ""Bluf"" takes on the color ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" and ""red"" when it follows ""wif"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and ""wif"" with ""red"", and ""bluf"" takes on the color ""red"" following ""wif"".

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the contexts in which it appears and the corresponding outputs.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Both of these examples indicate that ""dax"" translates to ""green."" The repetition of ""green"" before a change in the output color suggests that ""walm"" might also translate to ""green.""

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

In this sequence, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is associated with ""red."" There is one occurrence of ""walm,"" and it is followed by ""red"" in the output. This isn't consistent with the idea of ""walm"" being ""green,"" leaving us with inconclusive evidence for this input.

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Here, ""zup"" and ""dax"" are associated with ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively, and “walm” appearing between them gives ""yellow"" in the output, just like ""zup."" This supports the idea that ""walm"" may not have a fixed color association but may instead be context-dependent or have a different rule governing it.

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

In this last input, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" The word ""lug"" associates with ""blue."" The first ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds with ""yellow,"" while the second ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and produces ""blue"" in the output.

The changing outputs following ""walm"" suggest that the meaning of ""walm"" is not fixed but instead depends on the context or the word that follows it. Given that after ""walm,"" the output color matches the color associated with the word that comes immediately after ""walm,"" we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word that follows it in the input sequence.

If there is no word following ""walm,"" as in the second example, there is no change in color, which may imply that ""walm"" does not change the color of the word before it when not followed by another word.

Thus, the rule is:
walm -> takes the color associated with the following word in the sequence. If it is the last word, there is no change in color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow blue blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". The position of ""lug"" in the input does not affect its meaning.
Based on the provided examples, each word seems to correspond to a particular color output. The word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Meaning: The word ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" results in the word ""red"" to be added to the output right after the words that occurred before ""wif"" are translated to their corresponding colors. Here is the breakdown:

- In each case, ""wif"" is followed by at least one color word—after ""wif,"" the word ""red"" appears in the output, even when ""wif"" is at the beginning of the input.
- The words ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to the colors ""blue,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively.
- The word ""wif"" seems to represent the color ""red,"" but more importantly, it also indicates that the color ""red"" should follow the sequence of colors that were mentioned before it.

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be that it directs the insertion of ""red"" after the colors that precede ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> Insert ""red"" following the sequence of colors that come before ""wif.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" is translated to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
According to the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color green when preceded by ""dax,"" and to the color red when followed by ""wif."" However, ""bluf"" also translates to the color yellow when preceded by ""zup.""

Let's break it down by each input and output:

1. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> ""green green red yellow blue""
2. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
3. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
4. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
5. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue blue green red red green""

Given that ""bluf"" yields different colors based on the previous word, we can suggest that ""bluf"" is a conditional color word. It seems to be a placeholder for a color that changes depending on a specific condition in the sequence:

- When preceded by ""dax"", ""bluf"" translates to green.
- When preceded by ""zup"", ""bluf"" translates to yellow.
- When ""wif"" follows ""bluf"", the color red is between them, indicating a possible special rule when ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and another word which has been established to correspond to green.

However, since we have only one example where ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"", we do not have enough data to definitively conclude the rule for this specific sequence. Also, there is no direct occurrence of ""bluf"" followed immediately by ""wif,"" which would have provided more evidence. The output ""red"" could be due to the combination of ""wif bluf"" or ""wif"" alone, since ""wif"" by itself in other contexts translates to red.

In conclusion, given the current dataset:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to a color dependent on the word immediately preceding it:
- When preceded by ""dax,"" it is ""green.""
- When preceded by ""zup,"" it is ""yellow.""

There may be a further rule regarding sequences involving ""wif,"" but there is insufficient evidence to formulate a definitive rule based on the current examples.
The word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repetition of a color word multiple times. By examining the examples provided, we can infer a pattern where the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"" is repeated a number of times. Let's analyze each example:

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times before the pattern changes with ""zup.""

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""green"" is repeated three times after ""dax.""

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""green"" is repeated three times after ""dax.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Based on the given examples, we can deduce that each word corresponds to a color and that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green.

Here's the breakdown of the examples given:

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to red.

Input: lug dax bluf
Output: blue green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to green (note that here ""bluf"" corresponds to green which contradicts the previous translation, indicating there might be a context dependency, but following the prompt for ""dax,"" we continue to consider ""dax"" as green).

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""walm"" corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Input: zup bluf dax lug
Output: yellow yellow green blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow (note there is a change from the translation in the first example).
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Rule:
dax -> green
Given the provided examples, I will look for patterns in the sequences of ""wif"" and the corresponding colors.

1. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red""
   - ""bluf wif"" results in ""green red""
   - ""lug wif"" results in ""red blue red"". 

2. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue
   - ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red""
   - ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"".

3. wif dax -> red green
   - ""wif"" independently here is associated with ""red"".

4. dax lug wif -> green blue red
   - ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red""

5. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""wif"" by itself at the end is associated with ""red"".

Based on these examples, it is consistently observed that ""wif"" maps to ""red"" regardless of its position or subsequent word. It also seems that ""wif"" does not directly influence the color associated with the next word unless it's ""bluf,"" which results in green when preceded by ""wif"". 

With this pattern in mind, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" indicates that the color of the output word should be repeated as many times as the sequence of the three colors (excluding green) that precede it. If green is one of the preceding three colors, ""bluf"" is not repeated.

For example:

1. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, which is not counted because it's exclusive from the rule.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and since it's the only color (apart from green) before ""bluf,"" ""blue"" is repeated twice in the output, followed by the output for ""wif,"" which is red.

2. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- The sequence before ""bluf"" is ""red yellow,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the sequence ""yellow blue,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow blue blue blue.""

3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
- The sequence is ""blue red"" before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating ""red.""

4. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and since it is the only color before ""bluf,"" ""green"" is repeated once. 

5. wif bluf -> red red
- The only color before ""bluf"" is ""red,"" so it is repeated once.

Based on this induction, bluf -> meaning: repeat the sequence of the three colors that precede it once, excluding green. If green is one of the preceding three colors, ""bluf"" is not repeated.
To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each input with its respective output:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Observation: The presence of ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" results in three instances of ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Observation: The presence of ""dax wif"" before ""walm"" results in ""green red,"" followed by three instances of ""red.""

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Observation: The presence of ""wif bluf dax"" before ""walm"" results in ""red red green,"" followed by three instances of ""green.""

5. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Observation: The presence of ""wif dax lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""red green blue,"" followed by three instances of ""blue.""

Based on the observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be related to the word that precedes it and the number of repetitions. Specifically:
- If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and is followed by one or multiple words before ""walm,"" then the output consists of repeating the last color mentioned three times.
- The word before ""walm"" determines the color repeated. ""Zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" after ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and if followed by ""lug,"" it leads to ""blue."" The phrase ""wif bluf dax"" leads to ""green.""

Considering all observations, the general rule seems to be:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is seen, repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Thus:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern that corresponds to the appearance of ""dax"" and the corresponding output color.

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" follows in the output sequence.
- ""dax"" does not rely on the position in the sequence to determine its output color; regardless of its position, the output is always ""green"".
- There are no examples showing any different behavior linked to ""dax"".

Considering these observations, it seems that the rule for ""dax"" is independent of context and its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". It does not seem to be context-sensitive or order-dependent, as ""wif"" always maps to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Analyzing the given input/output pairs, the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently correlates with the color ""yellow"" in the output, except in one instance where it corresponds to ""green"". However, we notice that the other words (""wif"", ""dax"", ""lug"", ""zup"") in the examples also seem to be associated with specific colors: ""wif"" with ""red"", ""dax"" with ""green"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""zup"" with ""yellow"".

Input: zup bluf wif dax lug  
Output: yellow yellow red green blue  
Correlation: zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow, wif -> red, dax -> green, lug -> blue.

Input: wif dax bluf  
Output: red green green  
Correlation: wif -> red, dax -> green, bluf -> green (inconsistent with the first example).

Input: lug zup bluf dax  
Output: blue yellow yellow green  
Correlation: lug -> blue, zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow, dax -> green.

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug  
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue  
Correlation: zup -> yellow, dax -> green, bluf -> green (inconsistent with previous examples), wif -> red, zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow, lug -> blue.

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup  
Output: green green red blue yellow  
Correlation: dax -> green, bluf -> green, wif -> red, lug -> blue, zup -> yellow.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems inconsistent across the examples, but it primarily appears to be associated with ""yellow,"" with the exception of instances where it is followed by ""dax,"" in which case, it translates to ""green."" Therefore, ""bluf"" might mean ""yellow,"" but this is influenced by some other factor, potentially positional or contextual within the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> yellow (with the exception that when following ""dax,"" bluf -> green).
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" dictates the following rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the next color in the sequence is repeated until a new color word appears.

Here's the breakdown:

Example 1: ""lug zup walm lug""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- After ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated until a new color word, ""lug"" (blue), appears.

Example 2: ""zup walm lug zup wif dax""
- ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated.
- ""lug"" changes the color to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" is then ""yellow"" again.
- ""wif"" is ""red"".
- ""dax"" changes the color to ""green"".

Example 3: ""wif bluf dax walm""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- ""bluf"" has no prior translation but repeats ""red"".
- ""dax"" changes the color to ""green"".
- ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat.

Example 4: ""wif walm""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat.

Example 5: ""zup walm lug wif bluf""
- ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat.
- ""lug"" changes the color to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" switches to ""red"".
- ""bluf"" has no prior translation but follows the established pattern of ""red"".

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears, the next immediate unique color translates and the same color continues to repeat until a new unique color word appears.

Walm -> Meaning: The command to repeat the next color until a different color word is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To figure out the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs in each set of examples and identify any patterns:

1. In the first example: 
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue"" in the output.
   - ""lug"" appears twice and both times it corresponds to ""yellow blue"".
   
2. In the second example:
   - ""lug"" stands alone with ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow blue"" in the output.

3. In the third example:
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
   - It's preceded by ""dax"" which correlates with ""green"" and followed by ""wif"" which correlates with ""red"".

4. In the fourth example:
   - ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
   - It's followed by ""zup"" which correlates with ""yellow"".

5. In the fifth example:
   - ""lug"" appears three times and each time corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs. It does not seem to be dependent on context because regardless of its position or the words around it, the output is ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input is directly translated to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green. Meaning: ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the presented examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context of the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to colors, but the specific color it represents varies depending on the context of the other words around it. Let's break it down by example.

1. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
The word ""bluf"" results in two ""blue"" outputs, but it is preceded by three words each translating to ""red.""

2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and here ""bluf"" results in two ""yellow"" outputs.

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
""Bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and yields two ""green"" outputs.

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" similarly producing two ""yellow"" outputs.

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
Here, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" results in two ""red"" outputs.

From these examples, we can deduce a pattern. It seems that ""bluf"" translates to a double output of the color represented by the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means repeat the color output associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to dictate the color that follows it to be in multiple succession, equal to the number of times ""walm"" and the precedent color word appears consecutively. For instance:

- First example: ""lug wif dax zup walm"" leads to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which is translated to ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" occurs once, the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- Second example: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" leads to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" Here ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which means ""blue,"" and there are three occurrences of ""blue"" in the output since ""lug"" and ""walm"" appear consecutively.
- Third example: ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" means ""green,"" and since ""walm"" follows, the output is three ""green.""
- Fourth example: ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which represents ""blue,"" thus there are three ""blue"" before the ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
- Fifth example: ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue."" Much like the third example, ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and followed by ""walm,"" produces three ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> consecutive repetition of the color word that precedes it. The number of repetitions equals the total number of occurrences of ""walm"" and the precedent color word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue,yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can try to infer the meaning or the rule for the word ""lug."" Let's look at the positions where ""lug"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. lug -> blue
2. lug -> blue
3. lug -> blue
4. lug -> red (preceded by ""wif"")
5. lug -> blue

In every case except for the fourth input, ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" The fourth example, however, has ""wif"" right before ""lug"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""red."" 

We can hypothesize that the rule for ""lug"" might be it outputs ""blue,"" unless it is preceded by ""wif,"" in which case the output is ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" appears to be:

Rule: ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" unless it directly follows ""wif,"" in which case it outputs ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the output associated with each instance of ""wif"":

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue 
2. Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red
3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue
5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm -> Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, notice:
- Each time ""wif"" appears, a ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.
- Regardless of the words that come before or after ""wif,"" ""red"" remains constant in the output.

Rule:
wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in every given instance, regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we will analyze the relationship between the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. Input: ""dax bluf"" -> Output: ""green green""
2. Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
3. Input: ""dax bluf"" -> Output: ""green green""
4. Input: ""lug wif bluf"" -> Output: ""blue red red""
5. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green""

From these examples, let's attempt to apply rule induction to understand the pattern:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""dax bluf"" both times results in ""green green."" This suggests that both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" individually result in ""green"".
- In example 4, ""lug wif bluf"" results in ""blue red red."" Because ""lug"" is known to be blue and ""wif"" is known to be red from other examples, we can assume that ""bluf"" in this context also translates to ""red"".
- In example 5, ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" Given ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" is ""green"" based on prior examples, ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"" as well.
- In example 2, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" We know ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is ""blue."" If ""zup"" accounts for ""yellow yellow,"" the remaining ""yellow"" must be the result of ""bluf,"" which deviates from our previous observation.

Looking for a consistent rule for ""bluf,"" we face a contradiction with example 2. This suggests a contextual rule instead of a one-to-one correspondence. However, in every case where ""bluf"" is used, it results in the color of the word that precedes it:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""green"" which is the color of ""dax"".
- In example 4, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output following ""wif"" is ""red"" which is the color of ""wif"".
- In example 5, ""wif"" again precedes ""bluf"" and the output following ""wif"" is ""red"".
- In example 2, ""zup"" (which we don't have a direct color for) precedes ""bluf"" and presumably results in a ""yellow"" output immediately following ""zup.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be: bluf repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided, comparing the input and output to find a consistent association between the nonce word ""walm"" and the corresponding colors in the output.

Here are the inputs and outputs, with focus on ""walm"" and its translation in the output:

1. Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green
   The word ""walm"" translates to three greens.

2. Input: lug dax walm wif -> Output: blue green green green red
   Here, ""walm"" is again translated to three greens.

3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   In this instance, ""walm"" is translated to a single yellow.

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow
   ""Walm"" is translated to three reds in this case.

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" becomes five yellows.

From the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the last word mentioned before ""walm"" a variable number of times. To verify the consistency of this rule, we can check if the color that precedes ""walm"" in each input is indeed repeated in the output:

1. The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" we see green green green.
2. The word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" again, corresponding to green, followed by green green green.
3. The word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, followed by a single yellow.
4. The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" corresponding to red, followed by red red red.
5. The word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, followed by yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be summarized as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color of the preceding word a variable number of times in the output, determined by some criteria not discernible from the current examples alone.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif lug
    ",Output: green blue red blue,green blue red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each instance of a word is consistently translated into a specific color. There are no contextual clues that the meaning of ""dax"" changes depending on placement or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule appears to be a simple word-to-color mapping.

The word ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green"" in each example.

Rule: dax -> green.
From analyzing the examples provided:

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red
- wif occurs twice, before 'dax' and 'bluf,' both times followed by 'red.'

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
- 'wif' is followed by 'red,' before 'dax,' which is followed by 'green.'

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- 'wif' follows 'walm' and is followed by 'red,' while 'dax' and 'walm' precede it with 'green.'

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- 'wif' is followed by 'red,' and before it, 'zup' and 'bluf' are associated with 'yellow.'

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red
- 'wif' is followed by 'red.' Before it, 'zup,' 'lug,' and 'bluf' are associated with 'yellow,' 'blue,' and 'blue' respectively.

Based on the pattern in the examples, 'wif' appears to correspond with the color 'red.' Each time 'wif' is present in the input, 'red' appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a consistent pattern in which the word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, the output consistently contains the color ""yellow."" There is no indication that the meaning of ""zup"" depends on its context within the string; it always translates to the same output.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine instances where it appears and their corresponding outputs.

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug"" or ""walm"" or on its own after ""zup,"" the output is always ""yellow yellow"" followed by the colors that correspond to other words, except after ""bluf"" which corresponds to ""blue.""
   - Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   - Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

2. When ""bluf"" comes directly after ""zup"" and before ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow green.""
   - Input: zup bluf dax
   - Output: yellow yellow green

3. ""Bluf"" between two instances of ""dax"" results in the output ""green green.""
   - Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   - Output: yellow green green yellow green

4. When ""bluf"" is the only word following ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
   - Input: zup bluf
   - Output: yellow yellow

5. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is not immediately clear since ""dax"" follows it and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" However, we can decipher that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" leaving the relation of ""yellow"" and ""blue"" or ""green"" to ""bluf.""
   - Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   - Output: green blue yellow red red green

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" directly translates to ""yellow,"" except when it follows ""wif,"" in which case the output color relating to ""bluf"" seems to be ""red."" Because of the last example, the rule isn't entirely consistent for ""bluf,"" as it depends on the context of the surrounding words.

From these examples, it's not entirely deterministic as to what ""bluf"" stands for given the last example provided. The evidence is inconclusive to a specific rule, but here's an attempt at a probable rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" usually translates to ""yellow,"" except when following ""wif,"" where the data is insufficient to conclude the exact output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze each input and their corresponding output line by line, focusing on where ""walm"" appears and what happens in the output:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and before ""wif,"" causing the repetition of the ""zup"" color yellow and a red at the end. 

2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" leading to a repeated green before ""lug,"" which introduces a new color, blue.

3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - The first ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and repeats the blue color before switching to ""wif"" (red). The second ""walm"" causes a triple repetition of the red color.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and repeats the associated color yellow twice.

5. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats the color green twice before switching to ""wif"" and ""zup,"" leading to red and yellow, respectively.

From these examples, we can deduce a rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated twice more, except when ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, where it introduces a red.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word twice more before the sequence continues, and if it’s the last word in the sequence, it adds red at the end.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Rule: In every example provided, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue."" The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue,"" regardless of the context it appears in.
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"". The other words in the sequence seem to correspond to their own unique colors: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". Each word is associated with a specific color irrespective of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word (including the nonce word ""wif"") is consistently associated with a specific color in the output. 

Here is the analysis:

1. When ""wif"" appears, the output is always ""red"".
2. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds with the color ""green"".
3. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds with the color ""yellow"".
4. The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"".
5. The word ""walm"" also consistently corresponds to ""green"" when it appears.

Given that the color ""red"" in the output is exclusively linked to the appearance of ""wif"", irrespective of the position of the word ""wif"" in the input sequence, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word:

Rule: wif -> red. This means that ""wif"" represents the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of the position of the word ""zup"" in a sequence, the output is always ""yellow."" The position or the context does not affect the meaning of ""zup.""
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that immediately precedes it in the input sequence. Here is the deduction from the given examples:

- In ""wif dax zup bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow. Thus, the output for ""bluf"" is yellow.
- In ""dax bluf zup,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green. Thus, the output for ""bluf"" is green.
- In ""dax bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is again ""dax,"" so the output for ""bluf"" in this case is also green.
- The last example, ""zup bluf,"" follows the same pattern with ""bluf"" following ""zup,"" and the output being yellow following yellow.

The rule is not dependent on specific words preceding ""bluf,"" rather it is reliant on the color associated with the word that comes before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Observing the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color indicated by the word that comes before it. Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug dax walm"" outputs ""blue green green green,"" where ""dax"" seems to mean green, and ""walm"" repeats the color green three more times.
  
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red,"" where ""wif"" means red and ""walm"" again repeats the color red two additional times.

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" must mean yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the color yellow two more times.

- ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" which again suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color red two more times.

From these examples, ""walm"" does not always repeat the color the same number of times. It does, however, always repeat the previously mentioned color multiple times. The rule for the number of repetitions might not be explicitly stated in the provided examples, or it might depend on a rule not inferred from these examples alone.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated multiple times, but the specific number of repetitions is not consistent across the examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

Based on the given examples where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and appears consistently in isolation with this output, we can deduce the following:

- When ""lug"" appears by itself, the output is always ""blue"". Hence, the basic rule seems to be lug -> blue.

However, in the third example provided, ""lug"" appears alongside ""wif"" and ""bluf"", and the sequence ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red red blue red"". Here we must make an assumption to induce a rule for ""wif"" and ""bluf"" since there's no clear indication of what they independently mean:

- If ""lug"" by itself corresponds to ""blue"", then the presence of ""bluf"", which is new and differs by one letter, might imply a variation such as ""red"". Similarly, ""wif"", by being placed between ""lug"" and ""bluf"", could also signify ""red"". Therefore, ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" becomes ""blue red red blue red"".

In conclusion, the rule seems to be: lug -> blue, except in the context of the third example where ""lug"" appears in a sequence with other nonce words, which implies additional rules are at play for those specific sequences.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at each example and identify any patterns or associations. Let's analyze each example one by one.

- In the first example, ""zup wif zup dax"" translates to ""yellow red yellow green."" Here, ""dax"" is the only word that doesn't pair with a color visible in the other inputs, and it is translated to ""green.""

- In the second example, ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue."" We already suspected that ""dax"" means ""green,"" and this example confirms that since ""dax"" is still followed by ""green."" ""lug"" therefore appears to mean ""blue.""

- The third example, ""dax zup lug wif zup,"" translates to ""green yellow blue red yellow."" Once again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the previously identified colors for ""zup"" (yellow), ""lug"" (blue), and ""wif"" (red) are consistent with their previous usages.

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Again, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The new word ""walm"" seems to also translate to ""blue,"" but it's being repeated three times. This repetition may suggest a rule that ""walm"" reinforces the color that comes before it.

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" means ""green,"" and it appears that ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color it follows three times.

From these observations, we can deduce a potential rule:

- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""walm"" has the effect of tripling the color it follows.

Thus the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it would seem that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each instance. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it is translated to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is surrounded by ""lug"" and the output is ""yellow"" where ""lug"" becomes ""blue."" 
- In the second example, ""zup"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" yet ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" both times. 
- In the third example, ""zup"" comes first and is followed by ""bluf"" and ""dax,"" with ""dax"" again corresponding to ""green,"" indicating that the presence of ""dax"" after ""zup"" does not alter its meaning. 
- The fourth example again shows ""dax"" after ""zup,"" with ""wif"" both before and after ""zup,"" and ""zup"" still results in ""yellow."" 
- The fifth example is similar to the fourth with ""zup"" surrounded by ""dax,"" reinforcing ""yellow"" as the consistent output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.

Explanation: Regardless of its position or surrounding words, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue. It seems ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input string. 

Rule: bluf -> blue
walm -> meaning. Meaning: a sequence of colors that repeat for a set number of times depending on the preceding word.

Rule: The word ""walm"" represents a color sequence that follows the color associated with the word immediately before it. ""walm"" repeats the color three times if the color before it is red, and it repeats the preceding color twice if the color is anything other than red.

In the given context:

- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"" (because 'wif' is associated with 'red' and 'walm' repeats the color red three times)
- ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green red red red"" (because 'dax' is associated with 'green' and 'walm' repeats the color green three times, followed by 'wif' which is 'red' and 'walm' repeats red three times)
- ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue"" (because 'wif' is associated with 'red,' 'lug' with 'blue,' and 'walm' repeats the color blue three times since it comes after 'lug')
- ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" ('lug' is 'blue', 'zup' is 'yellow,' 'walm' repeats yellow three times, followed by 'lug' which is 'blue' again)
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (because 'dax' is associated with 'green' and 'walm' repeats the color green three times)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.
To determine the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax,"" let's observe its appearance in each example and the corresponding output:

- Example 1: ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" -> ""blue green green red green""
- Example 2: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
- Example 3: ""wif zup dax"" -> ""red yellow green""
- Example 4: ""dax wif zup"" -> ""green red yellow""
- Example 5: ""zup lug dax"" -> ""yellow blue green""

One common pattern for each instance of ""dax"" is that it always translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence:
- In example 1, both instances of ""dax"" result in ""green.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" and still produces ""green.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" is at the end and translates to ""green.""
- In example 4, ""dax"" is at the beginning and translates to ""green.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" follows ""lug"" and still results in ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule can be deduced as follows:

dax -> ""green""
Based on the given examples, we can induce that each unique word corresponds to a specific color and that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red. 

Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue""
- ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green""
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red""
- ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red""
- ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green""

From this, we can induce that regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input, the word ""wif"" always results in the output ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output. It does not appear to change meaning based on its position or the context within the list of words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or surrounding words in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, one can discern a pattern where the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a particular color. Each instance of ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""red"" in the output, but it's also observed that when ""bluf"" is not the first word, the color before ""bluf"" in the output is repeated. Here's how this pattern reconciles with the given input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which translates to ""red"", hence ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

2. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red"", so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" and the ""red"" repeats.

3. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   Again, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" but is repeated because it is not at the beginning.

4. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""lug"" which translate to ""yellow"" and ""blue"", respectively. Each time, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", but the color before it is repeated.

5. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   ""Bluf"" occurs at the end after ""zup"" (""yellow"") and the color repeats.

From these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears in a sequence, it corresponds to ""red"". However, if ""bluf"" is not the first word in the sequence, the color that precedes ""bluf"" in the output is repeated instead of translating ""bluf"" directly, thus creating a pattern of repetition for the color that comes just before ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is the first word, it is simply translated to ""red"".

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: ""red"", with a rule that if ""bluf"" is not the first word, repeat the color that precedes it in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to cause the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before ""walm"", for as many times as ""walm"" appears in the input.

Let's analyze the inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif""
   Output: ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""
   Here, ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and is translated to blue, and since ""walm"" follows ""lug"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.

2. ""lug wif walm""
   Output: ""blue red red red""
   Here, ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and is translated to red, and since ""walm"" follows ""wif"", ""red"" is repeated three times.

3. ""zup wif lug zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   Here, ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and is translated to yellow, and since ""walm"" follows ""zup"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

4. ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   Here, ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and is translated to green, and since ""walm"" follows ""dax"", ""green"" is repeated three times.

5. ""lug wif dax walm zup""
   Output: ""blue red green green green yellow""
   Here, ""dax"" is before ""walm"" and is translated to green, and since ""walm"" follows ""dax"", ""green"" is repeated three times.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" for as many times as ""walm"" appears in the input.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup bluf
    ",Output: green red yellow yellow,green red yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The meaning of ""lug"" is ""blue"" regardless of its position or the other words present in the input.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" appears to correlate with the color green in the output. Here's the analysis:

- When ""dax"" appears after ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red green,"" where ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- When ""dax"" appears first followed by ""zup wif,"" the output is ""green yellow red."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- When ""dax"" appears first followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""green blue."" Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" appears before ""dax zup,"" the output is ""red green yellow."" Once again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" is before ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""blue green green."" Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds with the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is presented in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> blue. When ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the examples given and note the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   
4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

The outputs corresponding to the inputs containing ""walm"" are sequences of the same color repeated. Based on the examples, we can infer the following:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might directly translate to ""blue blue blue"" in the context following ""lug.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" as in the second and third examples, the resulting output is ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" could translate to ""red red red"" following ""wif.""
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" could mean ""yellow yellow yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""

However, it seems that the word ""walm"" does not have a fixed meaning but rather causes the preceding color word to be repeated thrice. Therefore, ""lug walm"" means ""blue blue blue,"" ""wif walm"" means ""red red red,"" and ""zup walm"" means ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug bluf dax
    ",Output: blue blue green,blue blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

In all examples provided, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"". Despite the various combinations and positions of ""lug"" in the input, the output consistently translates ""lug"" to the color ""blue"". Thus, it seems that ""lug"" means ""blue"".
The given examples provide a sequence of inputs followed by a sequence of output colors. To figure out the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and output for each example.

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Input: dax
Output: green

Considering the given data:

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output.
- ""dax"" is always the first word in the output sequence to be associated with ""green,"" even when it appears later in the input sequence, as seen in the first example.
- ""dax"" by itself as an input gives a single ""green"" as an output.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow red red red""
   This suggests ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red"".

2. ""wif bluf zup"" leads to ""red red yellow""
   Since ""bluf"" previously corresponded to ""yellow"", and ""zup"" also to ""yellow"", it confirms ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

3. ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red""
   Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""wif"" must correspond to ""red"".

4. ""dax lug wif"" leads to ""green blue red""
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" once again corresponds to ""red"".

5. ""dax zup walm wif"" leads to ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
   ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""yellow yellow"" as seen before, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it appears that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" each time it is mentioned. There is a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the input ""zup"" and the output ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Meaning: The word ""zup"" means the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. This correlation is consistent across all given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns present in the input and output pairs. The colors seem to be associated with the words that precede them, and ""walm"" appears to influence the duplication of a color in the output.

Let's look more closely:

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

Here, ""zup"" is followed by yellow and ""dax"" is followed by green. ""Walm"" seems to make the green color that follows ""dax"" repeat.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

In this sequence, ""wif"" precedes red, ""zup"" precedes yellow. ""Walm"" again seems to be related to repeating the color that follows ""zup"" (yellow).

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here, ""dax"" is followed by green, with ""walm"" following. The color green is repeated three times.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

""Zup"" is followed by yellow, and ""wif"" is followed by red. ""Walm"" once again seems to influence the repetition, this time making the red repeat.

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

""Lug"" precedes blue, ""wif"" precedes red, ""dax"" precedes green, and ""zup"" precedes yellow. We notice that after ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated, corresponding to the color that follows ""zup.""

Based on the observed patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately succeeding ""walm"" to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the final word, it causes the color of the word preceding it to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the subsequent color to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the last word, it causes the color of the word before it to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: When the input is ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" When the input includes ""dax"" followed by another word such as ""zup,"" the output starts with ""green"" followed by another color corresponding to the second word. However, with the given data, the rule for the second word or additional words is not clearly defined. Only ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we can look at the provided examples and their outputs. Here's what we observe:

1. Input: wif -> Output: red
2. Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
3. Input: lug wif dax -> Output: blue red green
4. Input: wif lug wif -> Output: red blue red
5. Input: wif -> Output: red

From the first and the last examples, where ""wif"" is the only input, the output is ""red"" both times. This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" consistently.

In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and the output adds ""yellow"" before ""red."" In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""wif"" and ""dax"" follows it, with ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug"" and ""green"" to ""dax."" In the fourth example, ""wif"" surrounds ""lug"" and the outputs also surround ""blue"" with ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

So, the answer is:
wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: In each example where the word ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow"". There are no counter-examples provided that associate ""zup"" with any other color or rule. Therefore, it can be deduced that the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" is the color yellow.
bluf -> blue. Rule: The word bluf corresponds to the color blue in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the term ""walm,"" let's look at the examples provided and see how the output changes in the presence of ""walm.""

Looking at the outputs:

1. When ""wif walm dax"" is the input, the output is ""red red red green.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - There is an extra ""red"" in the output which is not accounted for by the other words.

2. For the input ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red green green green blue.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - There is an extra ""green"" not accounted for by the other words.

3. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - There are two extra ""blue""s.

4. ""dax wif walm"" brings about ""green red red red.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - There are two extra ""red""s.

5. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" gives ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - There are multiple ""yellow""s and an extra ""red"" not accounted for.

In all cases, the presence of ""walm"" results in a sequence of colors that matches the color associated with the previous word before ""walm."" This additional sequence holds true regardless of the word that comes before ""walm.""

Based on this pattern, we can induce that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the output corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> Causes the output color associated with the previous word to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will analyze the patterns in the colors associated with its use in each example:

1. dax bluf zup bluf dax  -> green green yellow yellow green
2. dax walm wif           -> green green green red
3. dax                     -> green
4. dax                     -> green
5. zup wif lug dax         -> yellow red blue green

Analyzing the given data:
- ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green every time it appears.
- The presence of ""dax"" does not seem to be context-dependent since it is translated the same way in varying contexts, whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input, or standing alone.
- The output color for ""dax"" does not seem to be influenced by the surrounding words like ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" which translate to different colors each.

The consistent pattern indicates that ""dax"" is equivalent to the color green, and there are no contextual rules that change this meaning based on the given examples.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"". In every instance where the word ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

- In the first example, ""wif"" is the first word, and the first color in the output is ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears first and third in the sequence, and ""red"" appears first and third in the output.
- In the third example, ""wif"" is the second word, and ""red"" is the second color in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is the first word, and ""red"" is the first color.
- The fifth example has only the word ""wif"", and the output is simply ""red"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"", regardless of the context or position of the word in the input sequence. Other words like ""wif"", ""walm"", ""dax"", and ""bluf"" correspond to different colors (red, yellow, green, and green respectively). Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

This means that whenever the word ""zup"" is present in an input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"". Let's examine the relation between each input and its corresponding output.

1. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

2. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green

3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

4. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

A consistent observation is that the appearance of the word ""bluf"" in the input always correlates with ""red red"" in the output. Despite the varying words before and after ""bluf"", the output ""red red"" remains constant when ""bluf"" is in the input. This suggests that ""bluf"" translates directly to ""red red"".

Therefore, the rule for the word ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> ""red red""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us observe the corresponding outputs for each example:

1. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
   - The sequence ""walm dax"" correlates to two ""yellow""s followed by a ""green""

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - The ""walm"" term therefore correlates to two additional ""yellow""

3. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - The sequence ""lug walm"" correlates to two additional ""blue""

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
   - The sequence ""lug walm"" again correlates to two additional ""blue""

5. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - The sequence ""lug walm"" correlates to two additional ""blue""; ""zup"" remains ""yellow""

From the above examples, we can infer that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it two times. Thus, when a word is followed by ""walm"", the color corresponding to the preceding word is outputted two additional times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" appears to translate to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the corresponding output contains the word ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided:

- When ""dax lug"" is the input, the output is ""green blue,"" suggesting that ""dax"" could mean ""green"" and ""lug"" could mean ""blue.""
- When ""lug dax"" is the input, the output is ""blue green,"" which confirms the meanings of ""lug"" and ""dax"" as above; the order matters.
- In the third input, ""dax"" appears after ""bluf"" and before ""wif,"" and the corresponding output is ""red green red,"" so ""dax"" is still ""green"" in the output.
- In the fourth and fifth input, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" in the output sequence.

Regardless of position, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

- In the first example, the output for ""dax wif"" is ""green red."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" must correspond to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup lug wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""wif"" must again correspond to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup"" gives ""red red red green yellow."" The first ""red"" corresponds to the first ""wif"" present, aligning with previous assumptions.
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and since ""wif walm"" yields ""red red,"" ""wif"" can be inferred as ""red"" once more, and ""walm"" as ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" translates to ""green green red yellow red."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" is likely ""green"" as well, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and with two occurrences of ""wif,"" both correspond to ""red,"" consistent with all prior examples.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"", let's analyze the input-output pairs:

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
Output: yellow green green yellow green

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red

Input: lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue yellow

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Now let's find the common pattern by looking at the position of ""bluf"" in the input and the corresponding colors in the output:

1. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> red red green green green
2. ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> yellow green green yellow green
3. ""zup lug bluf wif"" -> yellow blue blue red
4. ""lug bluf zup"" -> blue blue yellow
5. ""dax wif bluf"" -> green red red

Analyzing the patterns:

1. In the first example, bluf is preceded by wif (red) and followed by dax (green). Bluf corresponds to red, the same as its preceding word.
2. In the second example, bluf is preceded by dax (green) and followed by zup (yellow). Bluf corresponds to green, the same as its preceding word.
3. In the third example, bluf is preceded by lug (blue) and followed by wif (red). Bluf corresponds to blue, the same as its preceding word.
4. In the fourth example, bluf is preceded by lug (blue) and followed by zup (yellow). Bluf corresponds to blue, the same as its preceding word.
5. In the fifth example, bluf is preceded by wif (red) and followed by no other color. Bluf corresponds to red, the same as its preceding word.

From this analysis:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word that precedes it in the input sequence. If ""bluf"" is the first word, this rule cannot be applied directly based on the provided data.

Therefore, bluf -> meaning: Bluf takes on the color of the preceding word in the input.
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" acts to repeat the color associated with the preceding nonce word. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" when ""walm"" follows, it duplicates the color three times.

- In the second example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"" immediately following the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

- The third example also confirms that ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" leading to the output of ""blue blue blue"" again.

- In the last two examples, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" each time. This indicates that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" three times.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is that ""walm"" repeats the color of the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern for what ""lug"" might mean in this context. 

The occurrence of ""lug"":

1. dax walm lug -> green green green blue
2. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
3. dax lug -> green blue
4. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

Comparisons:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in every example it appears.
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""blue"" following the word ""lug.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" when not adjacent to ""lug.""
- ""lug"" precedes changes in the output pattern or introduces colors in the output that were not directly associated with the preceding words.

Based on these observations, it seems that when ""lug"" is followed by another word, it causes the following word to be translated three times instead of once. When ""lug"" is on its own, it can simply translate to ""blue.""

The consistent result following ""lug"" is ""blue,"" regardless of its position, whether at the beginning or in the middle of the sequence. However, when ""lug"" is at the beginning of the sequence, every word following it is repeated three times, ending with the color associated with the word ""lug"" (which is blue), except for the presence of ""bluf"" where it appears as ""red red"" at the end.

Hence, ""lug"" seems to have two effects:
1. It translates directly to ""blue.""
2. When placed before other words, it causes the next word to repeat three times in its associated color.

Rule: lug -> ""blue,"" and when before another word, causes that word's color to be repeated three times.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's examine the relationship between inputs and outputs.

1. Input: dax walm wif dax | Output: green green green red green
   
   Here, the occurrence of ""dax"" at the beginning and the end of the sequence results in ""green"" at the corresponding output positions, while ""wif"" in proximity to ""dax"" produces a ""red"" output. ""walm"" gives out a ""green.""

2. Input: dax zup lug | Output: green yellow blue

   The initial ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and then the following words ""zup"" and ""lug"" have outputs that are ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

3. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green

   With only ""dax"" and ""walm"" present, we see a sequence of ""green"" outputs, similar to the previous examples.

4. Input: dax | Output: green

   ""dax"" standing alone still results in a ""green"" output.

5. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif | Output: yellow blue red green green red

   In this sequence, ""dax"" yields ""green"" regardless of its position, while ""wif"" after ""dax"" again translates to ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" consistently translates to a ""green"" output regardless of placement within the sequence. Other words, such as ""wif"" when appearing after ""dax,"" may affect the output color associated with ""wif,"" but ""dax"" itself remains ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. In each example, the appearance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example: ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow red red green""; ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the second example: ""zup wif lug"" translates to ""yellow red blue""; ""zup"" is the first word and corresponds to ""yellow"", which is the first color in the output.
- In the third example: ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red""; ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" once again.
- In the fourth example: ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue""; ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the sequence.
- In the fifth example: ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow""; ""zup"" appears at the end and corresponds to ""yellow"", which is the last color in the output.

From these examples, it can be deduced that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze each example and the corresponding output:

- ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
- ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> ""blue yellow yellow green""
- ""lug bluf zup lug"" -> ""blue blue yellow blue""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

We can attempt to deduce a pattern by focusing on the positions where ""bluf"" appears and the color that corresponds to it:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
2. Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".
3. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
4. Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it takes the color of the word before it or, if there is no word before it, ""bluf"" has no direct output as seen in the last example.

So, according to this pattern, ""bluf"" seems to be a placeholder that takes the value or color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, perhaps it remains undefined or has no output, since we don't have an example of ""bluf"" appearing at the start of an input followed by another word.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the value or attribute of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, the meaning may be undefined or have no corresponding output.
An analysis of the provided examples suggests that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color of the word that precedes it three times. For example:

- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" results in ""red"" as well. ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug zup walm lug"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug dax walm"", after ""lug"" which is ""blue"" and ""dax"" which is ""green"", ""walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- In ""lug wif zup wif walm"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red red.""

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. 

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. Every time 'wif' appears in the input, 'red' appears in the same position in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is present in the corresponding output. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" as repeated twice, and ""zup"" is then followed by two instances of ""yellow,"" suggesting ""zup"" translates to a repetition of ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Zup"" is between them and represented by a single ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" on its own just results in ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" appears to mean ""blue,"" so when ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" we have ""yellow"" followed by ""blue.""
- In the last example again, ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" ""Zup"" occurs in between ""lug"" and ""wif"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow. It means that the word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""green."" However, in the four instances where ""bluf"" appears, it is followed by or preceeded by ""dax,"" which also translates to ""green."" There is no instance of ""bluf"" without ""dax"" being in the sequence. Therefore, the rule could suggest that ""bluf"" is directly related to the presence of ""dax.""

Rule: bluf -> green when in a sequence with dax.
walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word that represents a color, it indicates that the color associated with the preceding word should be output three times. For example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, so ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Similarly, ""dax"" is associated with green, ""lug"" with blue, and following these words with ""walm"" yields three repetitions of the respective color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Using the input-output pairs, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug."" Here's what we can infer from the examples:

1. ""lug wif dax"" corresponds to ""blue red green""
2. ""lug wif zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue red yellow red""
3. ""dax lug wif"" corresponds to ""green blue red""
4. ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue""
5. ""lug walm dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green""

From these examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" consistently in each output regardless of its position or the context it's used in.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the correlation between the input and the output in each given example.

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" correlates to the second ""blue""
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
   - ""zup"" and ""walm"" must correlate to ""yellow"" given that ""zup"" is followed by two ""yellow"" and ""walm"" follows ""dax"" in the first example and is also ""yellow""

3. Input: lug dax lug
   Output: blue green blue
   - Here, ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" is placed between two ""lug""s and correlates to ""green""

4. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" at both the beginning and the end
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" in the second position
   - ""bluf"" correlates to ""blue"" in the third position

5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green"", before two ""green"" which may suggest that ""walm"" correlates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"" based on earlier analysis

From these examples, we can infer that regardless of position or the words that come before or after, every time ""dax"" is mentioned, it correlates to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in each of the examples provided:

1. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue.""
   Here, ""lug"" might represent ""blue,"" and ""wif"" could represent ""red.""

2. ""wif"" alone translates to ""red.""
   This reinforces the idea that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green.""
   ""dax"" seems to alternate between ""green"" and another color not shown here. However, the third ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" and then becomes ""red,"" which aligns with the previous examples where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. ""wif"" alone again translates to ""red.""
   This continues to support that ""wif"" denotes ""red.""

5. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""
   When ""wif"" appears at the beginning of the sequence, it corresponds to ""red."" As the sequence continues, the following pattern emerges, ""walm"" and ""zup"" seem to be related to the color ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" still indicates ""blue.""

Given these observations, the rule seems consistent that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup."" Let's analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

2. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red

3. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green

4. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

5. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

It seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the words that surround it. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" correlates directly to a color output in the ""Output"" strings. Specifically, ""bluf"" seems to be associated with doubling the color that immediately precedes it in the ""Input"" string. Here is how ""bluf"" behaves in each example:

1. In ""lug bluf zup"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Since ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"" for the ""bluf"", followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup"".

2. In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". The ""bluf"" after ""zup"" doubles the ""yellow"", resulting in ""yellow yellow"". The ""wif"" then leads to ""red"", and ""walm"" seems to be an intensifier, tripling the ""red"" that it follows.

3. In ""zup bluf dax"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"". The ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and thus doubles the ""yellow"".

4. In ""zup bluf wif bluf"", we once again see that when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it doubles the ""yellow"". When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it doubles the ""red"".

5. In ""wif zup dax bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", and thus ""bluf"" doubles the ""green"".

From these observations, we can determine the rule for what ""bluf"" means:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> When ""bluf"" appears in the input, it results in the output repeating the color that immediately precedes it.
To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in each example:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

2. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

3. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

4. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

In every instance, the word ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of color names that match the color name of the word immediately preceding ""walm."" 

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates that the following sequence of words should be repetitions of the color indicated by the word just before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the color of the word preceding it to be repeated until a new color word is presented.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The term ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in an input sequence, it is translated to ""green"" in the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be as follows:

- When the word ""wif"" is presented alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears in a sequence with other words, the output for ""wif"" remains ""red,"" whereas the other words in the sequence correspond to their own individual colors.

Thus, from the examples given, we can deduce that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to two instances of the color ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Every occurrence of ""zup"" results in the output ""yellow.""
- Other words seem to correspond with different colors: ""wif"" produces ""red,"" ""dax"" produces ""green,"" and ""lug"" produces ""blue.""
- The number of times a word appears seems to correspond with the number of times its corresponding color appears in the output.

Therefore, we can derive the meaning of ""zup"" as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output, regardless of its position in the input string.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""bluf"" is presented in the input, it is translated to ""red"" in the output. Moreover, the output sequence shows a pattern where each word corresponds to a certain color, as can be deduced from the repeated alignments:

- ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" aligns with ""red""
- ""lug"" aligns with ""blue""
- ""walm"" aligns with ""yellow"" (since it only appears once and is aligned with yellow, we assume this to be the case)

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: bluf -> red
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs. By comparing instances where the word ""walm"" appears, we can look for consistent patterns or associations with specific colors in the output. 

Let's examine the data we have:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - Here ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""blue"" both times it is used.
   
2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and corresponds to the output ""red.""

3. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""zup,"" corresponding to the output ""blue.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to the output ""red.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and corresponds to the output ""blue.""

Based on examples 1, 3, and 5, we can see that when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue."" In examples 2 and 4, when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red."" 

From this, we can deduce the rule that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it. When it follows ""lug,"" it is ""blue,"" and when it follows ""wif,"" it is ""red."" In the absence of additional contrasting examples, this seems to be the most consistent rule.

Rule: walm -> the color of the preceding word (either blue when following ""lug"" or red when following ""wif"").

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax
    ",Output: red yellow green,red yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently correlates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green. Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Furthermore, ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" based on their consistent pairings in the examples. The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the fifth example and is followed by ""walm,"" which also produces ""yellow."" Without further examples it is hard to determine if ""walm"" is the same as ""zup"" or another instance of the color ""yellow.""

Rule:
dax -> green
Using the provided examples, I'll deduce the rule for the meaning of ""wif"":

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" is followed by a nonce word ""walm"" which results in ""red"" followed by ""red red"", meaning either ""wif"" could indicate the color ""red"", or there's another pattern linking ""wif"" and ""walm"" to produce multiple ""red"".

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" precedes nonce words ""dax zup walm"" and the output starts with ""red"" again. Following that, ""dax"" gives ""green,"" and ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow"". This suggests that ""walm"" is likely contributing to a pattern of repetition given that alone it produced ""red red"", and with ""zup"" it produced ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red
- ""lug"" followed by ""wif"" results in ""blue red"". ""wif"" once more produces ""red"", reinforcing that it likely stands for ""red"".

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
- We see ""walm"" before ""wif"" and ""lug"" after both. ""walm"" now results in ""blue"", ""wif"" is followed by ""red"", and the final ""lug"" returns to ""blue"", which is what ""lug"" produced in the previous example.

Input: wif
Output: red
- Standing alone, ""wif"" produces ""red"".

Based on the pattern ""wif"" directly correlates to ""red"" in all cases where it appears, regardless of its position relative to other nonce words.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" appears to correlate with the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is provided in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output at the corresponding position.

Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"", with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow"", where only the last word, ""zup"", aligns with the last color ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"", with ""zup"" appearing twice and each time corresponding to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf lug"" converts to ""yellow yellow blue"", with the first ""zup"" clearly reflecting the first ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug"" turns into ""yellow blue"", and again ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule that can be concluded is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup,"" and to ""blue"" when it is followed by ""lug."" It seems that ""bluf"" does not have a meaning independent of its context, but rather, its meaning changes depending on the words around it.

Here is the pattern identified:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""

Given these observations, the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent and aligns with the color associated with the preceding or following word in the sequence.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before or after it; ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
Analyzing the inputs and outputs given:

Input: dax walm zup lug -> Output: green green green yellow blue
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
Input: wif walm zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

From the provided data, we can deduce the rule of walm as follows. The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. This repetition continues until a new word other than ""walm"" appears. The new word then sets the next color to be repeated if ""walm"" follows it again.

Let's break it down:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which shows that ""walm"" repeats the color assigned to ""dax"" (which must be green) three times until a new word, ""zup,"" appears which changes the color to yellow.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" repeats that color three times until ""zup"" changes the color.
- ""zup walm"" similarly leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" being yellow and ""walm"" causing repetition.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" showing that ""wif"" is red and is repeated by ""walm.""
- The pattern holds in the example ""wif walm zup walm"" with ""wif"" leading to ""red"" and ""zup"" leading to ""yellow,"" both repeated by subsequent ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif dax
    ",Output: red green red green,red green red green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" The other words, such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm,"" each translate to different colors, and when placed before or after ""lug,"" they do not appear to change the output color that ""lug"" represents.

Here are the translations:

- ""wif"" appears to represent ""red,""
- ""zup"" appears to represent ""yellow,""
- ""bluf"" appears to represent ""blue"" just like ""lug,""
- ""lug"" consistently represents ""blue,""
- ""walm"" in the final example, when paired with ""lug,"" also results in ""blue blue blue.""

However, since ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue,"" it's possible that ""lug"" means something more specific than just ""blue,"" but with the examples given, one cannot differentiate between ""bluf"" and ""lug."" Given the data, the simplest direct rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

The consistent output associated with the word 'dax' in every example is ""green."" Regardless of the position of 'dax' in the input sequence or the other words present, the output for 'dax' remains ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the examples corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it is possible to deduce that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" each time it is used, irrespective of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is associated with the color that was previously mentioned. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (bluf corresponds to ""red,"" which was the color represented by ""wif"")
2. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> Output: red green red red yellow red (bluf corresponds to ""red,"" following the same color that ""wif"" represents which came before it)
3. Input: zup lug bluf -> Output: yellow blue blue (bluf corresponds to ""blue,"" the color that ""lug"" represents)
4. Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red (bluf corresponds to ""blue,"" following ""lug"" which represents ""blue"")
5. Input: dax lug bluf -> Output: green blue blue (bluf corresponds to ""blue,"" following ""lug"" which represents ""blue"")

So the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf represents the color word that immediately precedes it. If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which means ""red,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red."" If it follows ""lug,"" which means ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue,"" and so on.
Based on the examples provided, we can determine a pattern for what the nonce word ""walm"" means in terms of the output colors. It appears that ""walm"" generates a sequence of colors that corresponds to a repetition of the color before it. Let's go through the examples:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - After ""dax"" (green) is repeated, ""walm"" results in ""green green green"".
   - Output: green yellow green green green
   
2. Input: lug walm
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", which repeats the color of ""lug"".
   - Output: blue blue blue
   
3. Input: dax walm zup
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""walm"" results in ""green green green"", repeating the color of ""dax"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - Output: green green green yellow
   
4. Input: dax walm
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""walm"" results in ""green green green"", repeating the color of ""dax"".
   - Output: green green green

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" (red) repeats the color to give ""red red red"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""walm"" after ""zup"" (yellow) repeats the color to give ""yellow yellow yellow"".
   - Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

**Rule**: walm outputs a sequence of three colors that matches the color directly preceding it.

So, walm -> meaning: ""Translate the preceding color into a sequence of three of that same color.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the word lug appears in the input, it corresponds to the color blue in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's compare the examples and look for patterns.

From the provided examples, we can observe the following:

1. When 'dax' appears alone as the input, the output is 'green':
   Input: dax
   Output: green

   Thus, we can infer that:
   dax -> green

2. The appearance of 'dax' with other words still results in 'green' associated with 'dax':
   Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red 
   (The word 'dax' corresponds to the first 'green' in the output.)

   Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   (The word 'dax' corresponds to 'green' in the output.)

   Input: zup lug zup dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow green
   (The word 'dax' corresponds to 'green' in the output.)

   Input: zup wif zup dax
   Output: yellow red yellow green
   (The word 'dax' corresponds to 'green' in the output.)

From these observations, it is clear that the word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green' regardless of the context in which it appears. Other words can translate to different colors, but 'dax' is always associated with 'green'.

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Across all examples, whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. The position of ""wif"" in the input does not seem to affect this correspondence, and the occurrence of ""wif"" can result in multiple instances of ""red"" in the output if ""wif"" is repeated.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the input.
zup -> yellow

Rule: When the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to first establish the meaning of other words in the examples given their respective outputs. By analyzing the correlation, we can work out the underlying rule and deduce what ""bluf"" represents.

- When ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".
- When ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"".
- When ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"".

Now we need to determine what is consistent about ""bluf"" across all examples. In every instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. Importantly, the color ""yellow"" appears twice in a sequence, just like the word ""bluf"" appears twice in the input.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be that it translates to the word ""yellow"" twice in the output.

Rule: bluf -> yellow yellow
From the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to correspond with a repetition of the color that is associated with the word that precedes it. Here is how I came to that conclusion:

In the first example:
- The word ""dax"" yields the output ""green"" and when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" in ""dax walm"" the output is ""green green green"". This suggests that ""walm"" may mean to triple the preceding color ""green"".

In the second example:
- The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that when ""lug"" (which leads to ""blue"") is followed by ""walm"" the resulting color ""blue"" is also tripled.

In the third example:
- The presence of ""zup"" at the end, which corresponds to ""yellow"", does not alter the tripled color output from ""walm"" but adds ""yellow"" to the sequence, confirming that ""walm"" affects only the word directly before it.

In the fourth example:
- Multiple colors are involved, but the part of the sequence ""lug walm"" still results in ""blue blue blue"" and does not affect the colors associated with ""dax"" or ""wif"" before or after the sequence.

In the fifth example:
- Even though ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is still ""red red red,"" showing again that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be outputted three times.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Hence, we can deduce the following:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in a sequence or the words around it.
Observing the examples provided:

1. lug wif dax bluf wif lug = blue red green green red blue
2. wif = red
3. zup lug walm wif walm = yellow blue blue blue red red red
4. dax zup wif = green yellow red
5. dax walm wif walm zup = green green green red red red yellow

Based on the outputs, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Regardless of its position relative to other words in the sequence, the output for ""wif"" remains the same.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: wif means ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There is a one-to-one mapping between ""zup"" and ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how the rule applies to each given example:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" yields ""red red green green green"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The word ""bluf"" that directly follows ""wif"" also yields ""red"", and the ""bluf"" that follows ""dax"" is not present, but if it were, it would yield ""green"". The color ""green"" is repeated for each occurrence of the word ""walm"" (though it's not explicitly stated what ""walm"" yields, the pattern suggests ""green"").
  
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red"". Again, ""bluf"" takes the color ""red"" from the preceding word ""wif"".

- In the third example, ""dax bluf zup"" yields ""green green yellow"". This means that ""bluf"" is taking the color ""green"" from ""dax"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green"", showing ""bluf"" taking the color ""green"" from ""dax"" once again.

- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" yields ""green green yellow yellow green"". ""Bluf"" after ""dax"" yields ""green"", ""bluf"" after ""zup"" yields ""yellow"", taking on the color of the word that comes before it each time.

Hence, the rule appears to be: 

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color output corresponding to the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" is preceded by a word that yields ""red"", it also yields ""red""; if it's preceded by a word that yields ""green"", it yields ""green""; if it's preceded by a word that yields ""yellow"", it yields ""yellow"". There's no indication of what happens if ""bluf"" is the first word or if it follows a word with a different color output, as these cases are not provided in the examples.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" acts as a repetition operator for the color word that precedes it. The pattern exhibits ""walm"" repeating the color that comes just before it three times. Let's break down each input with this rule in mind:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""lug"" precedes the first ""walm"", ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"", thus ""blue"" is repeated three times.
   - ""wif"" precedes the second ""walm"", ""wif"" correlates to ""red"", thus ""red"" is repeated three times.

2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"", thus ""blue"" is repeated three times.

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", thus ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

4. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", thus ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

5. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"", thus ""blue"" is repeated three times.

With this consistent pattern in mind, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> a repetition operator that repeats the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug zup
    ",Output: green blue yellow,green blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. In each instance when ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" is present in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: In every example provided, whenever the word ""dax"" is present, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" by looking at the output associated with the input containing ""wif.""

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output sequence starts with ""red green.""
- When ""wif"" is surrounded by other nonce words, ""wif"" always correlates with ""red"" in the output.
- The output sequence seems to map one-to-one with the input sequence except for repeated words like ""walm"" where the first instance determines the color and the repetitions are colored the same.
- ""Wif"" doesn't seem to affect the output of the words around it other than producing its own output.

Based on this information, the rule for the word ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output sequence, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the provided examples and look for patterns:

1. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

2. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green

3. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

5. Input: lug zup dax lug dax
   Output: blue yellow green blue green

Observing the given examples, each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. No other input word consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output. This pattern suggests that ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color red. However, its occurrence also seems to trigger a repetition of the color immediately preceding it. Let's look at the patterns:

1. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   Here ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which is coded as red, and ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".

2. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   Here ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" which is coded as yellow, and ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"".

3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Here ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" which is coded as red, and ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Here ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" which is coded as yellow, and ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"".

5. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   Here ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" which is coded as yellow, and ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"".

From these observations, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it and repeats it. If the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, then ""bluf"" produces ""yellow."" If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, then ""bluf"" produces ""red red.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color word that precedes it three times in the output. Here are the examples broken down:

- ""zup walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""wif walm zup walm"": ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Each is followed by ""walm"", which causes their respective colors to be repeated thrice, giving us ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""dax lug walm"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". Since ""lug"" is directly before ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated three times, yielding ""green blue blue blue"".
- ""lug zup walm lug"": Here again, ""lug"" precedes ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" follows ""zup"" causing ""yellow"" to be repeated three times. The last ""lug"" is not followed by a ""walm"", so ""blue"" is mentioned only once at the end, giving us ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"".
- ""zup walm"": As in the first example, this results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" precedes ""walm"".

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

So:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow yellow yellow,green yellow yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

- When ""lug"" is present alone, the output is ""blue"".
- When ""lug"" follows another word, the color corresponding to ""lug"" is still ""blue"".
- ""lug"" does not appear to affect the color of the word that precedes it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". 

Thus: lug -> blue.
From the provided examples, we can observe the pattern in inputs and their corresponding outputs. The word ""dax"" appears in each input, and ""green"" appears in each output, corresponding to the presence of ""dax."" Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that ""dax"" correlates directly with the color ""green.""

Additionally, other words are associated with specific colors:

- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow""
- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue""

Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green

Each time ""dax"" is used in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Other words correlate with their respective colors as noted above.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word 'wif' corresponds to the word 'red'. There is no context given that changes the meaning based on position, surrounding words, or frequency of use. Every single time 'wif' is used, the output is 'red'. Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is used, the corresponding output includes ""yellow"". Additionally, the word ""zup"" doesn't seem to be impacted by its position in the input sequence; it always translates to the same color regardless of whether it is at the beginning or in the middle of the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can analyze the output colors corresponding to each input that contains the nonce word ""bluf"" and other words:

For ""zup bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".

For ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif walm"", with the entire output being ""yellow yellow red red red"". Since ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"", and the repetition of ""red red red"" suggests that each instance of ""wif"" and ""walm"" translates to ""red"", we can infer that ""bluf"" still means ""yellow"" here.

For ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"", the output is ""yellow blue red green green red"". Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"", while ""wif"" is ""red"". Since ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" resulting in ""green green red"", and since ""dax"" has already been shown to translate to ""green"", it is likely that ""bluf"" has translated to ""green"" in this instance.

For ""wif bluf dax walm"", the output is ""red red green green green"". From this, we can pair ""wif"" with ""red"", ""dax"" with ""green"", and since ""walm"" also resulted in ""green"", we can deduce that ""bluf"" has translated to ""red"" in this case.

For ""dax walm wif bluf"", with an output of ""green green green red red"", again we see ""dax"" and ""walm"" corresponding to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" following ""wif"" resulting in ""red"", which suggests that ""bluf"" is again ""red"".

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word immediately following it. If ""bluf"" is the last word and there is no word following it, it defaults to ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that follows (if present); otherwise, yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's look at the correlations between the inputs and the outputs:

In the first example:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" appears once followed by ""lug"" and ""wif,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow blue red""

In the second example:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""wif,"" resulting in ""green green green red""

In the third example:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is the last word before ""wif,"" resulting in ""green green""

In the fourth example:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and ""wif,"" resulting in ""yellow green red""

In the fifth example:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by ""zup,"" resulting in ""blue blue yellow""

Looking for a pattern with ""walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. This is evident in all examples, as the output repeats the color associated with the word right before ""walm,"" regardless of what the color is.

So, the rule for ""walm"" would be:
walm -> Repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all given examples.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'dax,' let's examine the correlation between the input and output pairs provided:

1. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. lug dax lug -> blue green blue
4. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
5. dax zup -> green yellow

Assuming that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output, 'dax' appears consistently with the color 'green.' We can confirm this by noting that every occurrence of 'dax' in the inputs coincides with 'green' in the outputs.

Moreover, since 'lug' appeared without 'dax' accompanying it in instances 3 and 4, we observe that 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' on its own. This helps to confirm that 'dax' is not influencing the color associated with 'lug.'

Therefore, the meaning of 'dax' is directly associated with the color 'green'.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. The word ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the preceding word. ""Bluf"" by itself does not have a fixed color association but it repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's examine the examples to illustrate this:

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

2. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

3. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green""
   In this sequence, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""dax"" (green) and repeats the color ""green.""

4. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
   ""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
   ""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" here, so it repeats ""yellow."" Later in the sequence, ""bluf"" is not present, but the pattern of repetition is consistent for the other words.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs under the assumption that each word in the input corresponds to a color (or pattern of colors) in the output.

Let's look at each instance of ""walm"" and the colors that directly follow it:

1. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
2. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
3. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
4. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
5. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we can establish the following:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" since it consistently leads to the output of blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" since it consistently leads to the output of green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" since it consistently leads to the output of yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" since it consistently leads to the output of red.

Now, let's look at ""walm."" In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which correlates to yellow. However, the output is ""yellow blue blue blue,"" and since ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" this suggests that ""walm"" includes the output of yellow followed by the color associated with the word following ""walm,"" which is in this case ""blue.""

In the second example, ""walm"" is again followed by ""zup,"" which correlates to yellow, and again the output includes yellow followed by blue, which is consistent with our observation.

In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which correlates to red, and the output includes blue followed by three reds, indicating that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to repeat three times.

In the fourth example, there is no color following ""walm,"" but the output is three reds, which corresponds to the word before ""walm,"" ""wif,"" which is red.

In the fifth example, ""walm"" is at the end, and the output is three yellow, which corresponds to the color before ""walm,"" ""zup,"" which is yellow.

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

walm -> Repeats the output color of the word immediately following it three times. If ""walm"" is the last word, it repeats the preceding color three times. 

Rule: If there is a word after ""walm,"" it causes the color corresponding to that word to appear three times in the output; if ""walm"" is the last word, it causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat three times instead.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern for the word ""dax"":

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the sequence, ""green"" appears in the corresponding output sequence.

This pattern holds true regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the length of the sequence. Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the input translates to ""red"" in the output, regardless of the presence of any other words. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule for the meaning of the word ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

Each instance of ""zup"" in the examples is correlated with the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to cause the output of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated. To confirm this rule, we should look at each example in detail:

- Input: dax bluf → Output: green green
    The word ""dax"" is outputted as ""green"" twice.

- Input: lug bluf → Output: blue blue
    The word ""lug"" is outputted as ""blue"" twice.

- Input: wif bluf lug zup → Output: red red blue yellow
    The word ""wif"" is outputted as ""red"" twice, though ""lug"" and ""zup"" are not repeated, possibly because ""bluf"" only affects the immediately preceding word.

- Input: lug wif bluf → Output: blue red red
    The word ""wif"" is outputted as ""red"" twice, which is consistent with the rule that ""bluf"" causes the word immediately before it to be repeated.

- Input: dax zup bluf → Output: green yellow yellow
    The word ""zup"" is outputted as ""yellow"" twice, following the recurring pattern that ""bluf"" repeats the output of the previous word.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is present in the input, it causes the output of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated.

Thus: bluf -> Causes the preceding word's output to be repeated.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the position of the word ""walm"" in each input and its corresponding output.

Here's the breakdown:

- Example 1: lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
  ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup"" in the first instance and follows ""lug"" in the second instance. Both cases are followed by three ""blue"" colors in the output, except for the ""yellow"" after the first ""zup.""

- Example 2: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
  ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug."" The output is ""blue"" after three ""yellow"" colors, matching the pattern of ""lug.""

- Example 3: dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
  ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif."" In the output, ""red"" follows three ""green"" colors, which suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

- Example 4: wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
  ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax."" The output has three ""red"" colors followed by ""green,"" similar to the pattern seen with ""dax"" in the previous example.

- Example 5: zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
  ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax."" The output is three ""yellow"" colors followed by ""green,"" as seen before with ""zup"" followed by ""dax.""

Based on these examples, ""walm"" appears to cause the output of three colors corresponding to the word before ""walm"" and one color corresponding to the word after ""walm."" For example, ""lug walm"" results in three ""blue"" outputs and ""zup walm"" results in three ""yellow"" outputs, and so forth.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> For the word that precedes ""walm,"" output its corresponding color three times, then output the color corresponding to the word that follows ""walm"" once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red yellow yellow,red yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can examine how it alters the output in each example given.

1. In the first example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" 
   - Here, we see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and it appears twice: once after ""wif"" and once at the end. The color associated with ""lug"" after ""wif"" is ""red"" while the one at the end, without ""wif"" preceding it, is ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is not affected by the presence of ""wif.""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it does not come after ""wif.""

2. In the second example, ""lug dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green green green red.""
   - Here, ""lug"" appears first and is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" is ""green."" At the end, ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""dax zup lug wif zup"" translates to ""green yellow blue red yellow."" 
   - ""dax"" is ""green,"" with no influence of ""wif.""
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow"" both times, despite ""wif.""

4. In the fourth example, ""dax lug bluf wif"" translates to ""green blue blue red.""
   - ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" must be ""blue."" 
   - The nonce word's presence at the end translates to ""red.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red.""
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" is typically ""green"" without the presence of ""wif,"" but when ""wif"" precedes it, it becomes ""red.""

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" changes the color associated with the following word to ""red"" when that word normally corresponds to a color. However, if ""wif"" occurs at the end of a sequence, it corresponds to ""red"" by itself.

Rule: When ""wif"" precedes a color-associated word, it changes the following color to ""red"". When ""wif"" stands alone, it represents the color ""red"". 

Thus the meaning is:
wif -> changes the following color to red / represents red when it is alone
Based on the given input-output examples, we can deduce the meaning of zup by looking for patterns and correlations. Here's an analysis of the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
   Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green
   - Adding ""zup"" to the beginning of the sequence adds ""yellow"" to the beginning of the color sequence.

2. Input: wif bluf wif -> Output: red red red
   Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: red red yellow yellow red
   - Inserting ""zup"" between ""bluf"" and ""bluf"" changes the color sequence to include two ""yellow"" before the final ""red"".

3. Input: bluf wif lug dax -> Output: red red blue green
   Input: zup bluf wif lug dax -> Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   - Putting ""zup"" at the beginning changes the first ""red"" to ""yellow"" and adds an additional ""yellow"" at the start.

4. Input: walm wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow
   Input: dax walm wif zup -> Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""Dax"" at the beginning adds ""green"" to the start of the sequence, and ""zup"" at the end adds ""yellow"" at the end of the sequence.

5. Input: dax -> Output: green
   Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
   - Following ""dax"", ""zup"" adds ""yellow"" to the sequence.

From these examples, we can conclude that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". It appears that each input word corresponds to a specific color, and regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence, the output is consistently ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we analyze the correspondence between the input and output in each example. Notice that the color after ""bluf"" in the output is always yellow, regardless of the word that precedes or follows ""bluf."" This consistent outcome suggests that ""bluf"" itself is related to the color yellow.

Here is the analysis line by line:

- Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
  Output: green green red yellow red
  ""bluf"" corresponds directly to ""yellow.""

- Input: dax zup bluf
  Output: green yellow yellow
  ""bluf"" again corresponds directly to ""yellow.""

- Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
  Output: red red yellow yellow red
  ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in both instances.

- Input: lug bluf zup lug
  Output: blue blue yellow blue
  ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

- Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
  Output: yellow yellow red green blue
  ""bluf"" once again corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> yellow. Bluf always corresponds to the color yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will examine the pattern of outputs corresponding to each input.

Looking at the inputs and outputs:

1. When the input is ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" appears once in the input, but ""blue"" appears three times in the output, which suggests that ""walm"" might contribute to the repeating of the color associated with ""lug.""

2. With the input ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" we see ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and then ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" comes after repetitions of ""dax,"" and the output sequence ""green green green red"" could imply that ""walm"" contributes to the repetition and then changes the repetition sequence by introducing a new color, in this case, ""red.""

3. When ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" is the input, the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" doesn't appear to have a corresponding color which suggests it might be ignored, and ""lug"" is associated with blue. The presence of ""walm"" after the repeated ""zups"" again corresponds to an additional ""yellow"" in the output, reinforcing the pattern where ""walm"" contributes to the repetition of the previous sequence or color representation before it in the output.

No matter the input, whenever ""walm"" appears, we can see an extended repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Based on this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> the function of ""walm"" is to continue the color sequence of the word before it, repeating the last mentioned color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm
    ",Output: red red red,red red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, each instance of ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding context. Therefore, the rule we can deduce for the meaning of ""lug"" in this specific problem is that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to look for a consistent pattern that is associated with ""dax"" in each example. 

In the first input, ""dax"" appears at the end of a sequence and is associated with the color green in the output. In the second example, ""dax"" is at the beginning and still corresponds to green. In the third, ""dax"" is alone and results in green. In the fourth, ""dax"" appears at the end, following a variety of other words, and results in green. In the fifth input, ""dax"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and ""walm,"" which are associated with yellow and green, respectively, but ""dax"" still outputs green.

From these examples, we can deduce a pattern:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output regardless of its position in the input.

Therefore, the rule we can derive is:

dax -> meaning: The word ""dax"" means green.

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is green.
From the provided examples, we can deduce the following color mappings for individual words:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue

Now, let's examine the word 'wif' in each example:

1. zup bluf wif bluf -> yellow yellow red red
   - Here 'wif' is followed by 'bluf' which maps to 'yellow'. Since the output is 'red', we can't finalize the rule here based on a single example.

2. wif zup dax -> red yellow green
   - 'wif' precedes 'zup' (yellow) and is followed by 'red' in the output. This still doesn't give us a conclusive rule.

3. wif walm -> red red red
   - 'wif' precedes 'walm' (which is also 'red'), suggesting that 'wif' might be adding 'red' to the sequence.

4. wif lug -> red blue
   - 'wif' precedes 'lug' (blue) and is followed by 'red' in the output.

5. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
   - This example is more enlightening. 'dax' and 'bluf' are consecutive, both mapped to colors ('green' and 'green', respectively). 'wif' is followed by 'zup' and the corresponding output is 'red', just like in the first example.

Based on the patterns, we can see that every time 'wif' is used, it is mapped to 'red' in the output, regardless of the words that follow it. From these examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red

This rule reflects the consistent mapping in all provided examples, where 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red' in the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow""
- ""wif zup wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow red green""
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
- ""dax zup lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue""
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red""

It appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is the same as the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" 

Rule:
- If the word ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- If the word ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue.""
- Each time ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""green.""

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to mean ""the same color as the color denoted by the word before it.""

In summary:

bluf -> meaning: The same color as the color denoted by the previous word.
Analyzing the examples provided, we look for patterns that correspond with the presence of the nonce word 'walm' and the associated color outputs. The rule must also account for sequences that occur without 'walm'.

1. Input: wif walm zup - Output: red red red yellow
   - 'wif' corresponds to the first 'red'.
   - 'walm' appears to correspond to a sequence of three identical colors which, in this case, is 'red red red'.
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.

2. Input: dax zup walm wif - Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.
   - 'walm' may transform the prior color ('yellow') into a series of three.
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

3. Input: lug zup walm lug - Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'.
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.
   - 'walm' seems to transform 'yellow' into a series of three again.
   - The final 'lug' still corresponds to 'blue'.

4. Input: dax walm wif - Output: green green green red
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.
   - 'walm' causes the 'green' to repeat three times.
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug - Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - Sequences before 'walm' include 'zup' (yellow), 'dax' (green), and 'lug' (blue).
   - 'walm' followed by 'zup' appears to repeat the color before it three times, which is 'blue blue blue'.
   - The sequence ends with 'lug' corresponding to 'blue'.

Rule:
From the examples, the word 'walm' appears to replicate the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word three times.

walm -> meaning: Repeats the color of the word before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"". Each time ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the color ""blue"" appears at the same position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" every time it appears. However, the output for ""lug"" changes from ""blue"" to ""green"" when followed by ""dax."" This pattern suggests that ""dax"" causes the word following it to be translated as ""green"" if there is one. The word preceding ""dax"" doesn't appear to affect its meaning, as ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> ""green"", and it also causes the subsequent word (if any) to be translated as ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each instance of a nonce word corresponds to a specific color. ""Wif,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""bluf"" consistently map to ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. The word ""zup"" correspondingly maps to ""yellow"" in each example it appears.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples provided and compare inputs with their respective outputs.

1. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
2. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax | Output: green blue yellow red red green
3. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
4. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
5. Input: zup lug bluf wif | Output: yellow blue blue red

From the first example, ""zup bluf"" directly translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which seems to indicate that ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" when it immediately follows ""zup.""

In the second example, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is ""red red green,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red."" In this context, ""bluf"" takes the color preceding it in the sequence, which is ""red.""

Looking at the third example, ""bluf"" once again follows ""wif"" and the output color for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which is the same color as ""wif.""

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is still preceded by ""wif,"" and so ""bluf"" is ""red"" again. In this instance and looking at the entire output, it appears that ""walm"" means ""green,"" but it is repeated for the number of words following ""bluf,"" including ""bluf"" itself.

In the last example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" which is the color mapped to ""lug.""

Looking at all the examples, a pattern emerges where ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word that immediately precedes it. From examples 2, 3, and 5, it seems clear that ""bluf"" takes the color output of the word before it. The only exception to this appears to be when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" as seen in example 1, where it outputs ""yellow,"" the same color as ""zup."" However, seeing as the other examples show ""bluf"" taking on the output color of the preceding word, it is possible that example 1 isn't an exception but follows the same rule.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color output of the word that immediately precedes it.
From the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"":

- In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" corresponds to ""green green green blue."" Since ""lug"" is the only unique element and corresponds to ""blue,"" we can infer that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green.""

- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""zup wif"" could give us ""yellow red"" based on previous outcomes, which leaves ""walm"" corresponding to ""red"" again, but since there is overlap in the output, we need more information to confirm.

- The third example, ""dax walm,"" gives us ""green green green,"" reinforcing that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" are ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup dax walm,"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green."" ""Zup"" is established as ""yellow"" and ""dax"" as ""green,"" which again leaves ""walm"" to be ""green.""

- The fifth example solidifies the relationship where ""walm"" is again resulting in ""green"" in the sequence.

Therefore, it seems that the rule we can deduce for the nonce word ""walm"" is straightforward:

Rule: walm -> green

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue"" across all given examples, irrespective of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green."" The outputs for other words (""zup"" resulting in ""yellow"" and ""wif"" resulting in ""red"") appear to be consistent as well. The repetition of a word seems to result in the same word being repeated in the output color sequence.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Each unique word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. The word ""dax"" is always associated with the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Through the examples, we can notice how the word 'wif' and other nonce words translate into color names. Each nonce word appears to correspond to a specific color. Additionally, repetition of a color seems to occur when a nonce word is followed by 'walm'. Let's analyze each example and create a corresponding rule.

1. Input: dax wif Output: green red 
   Rule: 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

2. Input: wif zup dax Output: red yellow green 
   Rule: Since we already deduced 'wif' as 'red' and 'dax' as 'green', 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm Output: red red green green green
   Rule: 'wif' is 'red', 'dax' is 'green' followed by 'walm' which seems to repeat the previous color twice more, suggesting 'bluf' also translates to 'red'.

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: 'dax' is 'green', 'wif' is 'red' followed by 'walm' which repeats 'red' twice, 'lug' translates to 'blue', 'zup' is 'yellow' with 'walm' following, repeating 'yellow' twice.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug Output: red yellow yellow blue
   Rule: 'wif' is 'red', 'zup' is 'yellow', 'bluf' duplicates the preceding color ('yellow'), and 'lug' is 'blue'.

From these examples, I can induce that:

- 'wif' -> translates to 'red'.
- Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color.
- The word 'walm' after any nonce word indicates that the prior color should be repeated twice more.

Rule: 'wif' -> 'red'.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" varies. Let's look at the pattern of where ""zup"" appears and what color is output:

1. zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
2. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
3. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. lug dax zup lug wif -> blue green yellow blue red

Observations:
- ""zup"" at the beginning of a sequence always results in ""yellow"" as the first output color.
- ""zup"" at the end of a sequence results in ""yellow"" as the last output color.
- When ""zup"" is surrounded by other words, the color before ""zup"" is the same as the color after ""zup"".

Hence, the rule is that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and affects the adjacent colors such that they match the color output of ""zup"" when it is immediately followed or preceded by it.

Rule: zup -> yellow, and it influences the adjacent colors to be the same as itself when it's not at the beginning or end of a sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced by comparing the inputs and corresponding outputs. Each example input ends with ""bluf"" and each output ends with ""red."" In all cases, no matter what words precede ""bluf"", the presence of ""bluf"" consistently results in the output including ""red"" at the end.

For instance:

- In the first and third examples, the input ""zup wif bluf"" consistently produces the output ""yellow red red."" The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the second instance of ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and the output sequence ends in ""green red."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" once again corresponds to ""red.""
- The fourth example is ""wif bluf"" and the output is simply ""red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" as well.
- In the fifth example, with an input of ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" the corresponding output ends in ""green red red."" Considering the previous rule identified for ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and keeping them constant, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""red"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> ""red""
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: When the word 'walm' follows a color-associated nonce word, it causes the output to be a repetition of the color associated with the nonce word that immediately precedes 'walm.' For instance, 'lug' is associated with blue, so 'lug walm' results in 'blue blue blue.' Similarly, 'dax' is associated with green, so 'dax walm wif' outputs 'green green green red' where 'wif' is associated with red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, we can observe that every time the word ""lug"" appears, the output is consistently ""blue"". Other words in the examples (""wif"", ""dax"", ""bluf"", ""walm"") correspond to different colors in the output and their placement doesn't seem to affect the output for ""lug"". Thus, we can induce the following rule:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in all given examples.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the examples given and the color sequences provided. It appears that ""wif"" serves as a modifier that follows a noun and changes the color associated with that noun. 

From the examples:

1. ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red""
2. ""dax wif"" results in ""green red""
3. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red green red red""
4. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red""
5. ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red""

From this, we observe that every instance of ""wif"" is followed by the word ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> ""red"" (wif is associated with the color red) 

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" occurs after a noun, the color ""red"" is added to the sequence in the output.
Based on the provided examples, zup consistently translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in a sequence or the other words present. Therefore, we can deduce that:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents the color yellow.
Observing the given examples, one can see that the word ""bluf"" consistently results in the same color that the previous word translated to. However, there are two examples where only the word ""zup bluf"" is given, and both times, the output is ""yellow yellow.""

Here are the observations elaborated:

1. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow green yellow green red red"" — ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and both translate to ""red.""

2. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" -> ""red red green green red red red blue red"" — ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and after ""dax,"" leading to both ""bluf"" instances being translated to ""red"" and ""green"" respectively, matching the colors of the words they follow.

3. ""zup bluf"" (given twice) -> ""yellow yellow"" — In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" leading to the same color ""yellow.""

4. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red"" — In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and both are translated as ""green.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the same color as the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf,"" output the color that the initial word translates to.
walm -> repetition of the color indicated by the word preceding it.

Rule: The word immediately before ""walm"" determines the color to be repeated. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of syllables in the word before ""walm"".

Examples:
- ""zup"" indicates yellow and has one syllable, so the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""lug"" indicates blue and has one syllable, so the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- ""wif"" indicates red and has one syllable, so the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- ""wif lug walm"" has the words ""wif"" and ""lug"" before ""walm"", ""wif"" indicates red and is one syllable, ""lug"" indicates blue and is one syllable, so the output is ""red"" followed by ""blue"" repeated three times.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" has ""wif"" (1 syllable, red), ""bluf"" (1 syllable, red), and ""dax"" (1 syllable, green); since ""dax"" is the last word before ""walm"", the output is ""green"" repeated three times for the single syllable in ""dax"".

The rule does not specify what happens when multiple words with multiple syllables precede ""walm"", but based on the given examples, it seems that only the word immediately before ""walm"" has its color repeated based on its syllables.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup walm dax lug
    ",Output: blue yellow yellow yellow green blue,blue yellow yellow yellow green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" 

Rule: Every instance of the word ""lug"" in the input is replaced with the word ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" has a consistent translation:

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: dax walm wif walm zup -> Output: green green green red red red yellow
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: wif lug zup -> Output: red blue yellow
Input: zup wif dax -> Output: yellow red green

In each case where ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red"". We can thus deduce a rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" irrespective of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern for the word 'zup':

- In every example where 'zup' is present, the corresponding output is 'yellow'.

Thus, the meaning of 'zup' in the context of these examples can be defined as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever 'zup' appears in the input, the word 'yellow' is outputted.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. So, ""bluf"" means the same color word that comes just before it in the sequence. Rule:

1. When ""dax"" (green) comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" means green.
2. When ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" means yellow.
3. When ""wif"" (red) comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" means red.
4. When ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" means blue.

Therefore, bluf mirrors the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to induce repetition of the color associated with the previous word when translated. Each given single word corresponds to a single color. When ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the associated color of that word to be repeated three times. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Let's apply this rule to see if it holds for all the given examples:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because the color associated with ""dax"" is green, repeated three times.

2. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because the color associated with ""zup"" is yellow, repeated three times.

3. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" causing three repeats of yellow, and the rest of the colors follow as per their associated words.

4. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" results in ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" causing three repeats of the color yellow.

5. ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow"". In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.

To summarize:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup wif dax
    ",Output: red yellow red green,red yellow red green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word within the inputs corresponds to a color in the outputs. Here's the apparent mapping:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" (noting repetition from ""wif"")
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Each input word is translated directly to its color output independent of position or surrounding words. Given that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in every instance it appears and is not influenced by adjacent words, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color “green.”

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can analyze the occurrences of ""wif"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"" in the output.

Now, let's check this simple rule against the examples given:

- In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"". ""Wif"" is at the end, and the word before it is ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" indicating that the presence of this preceding word does not change the output for ""wif"".
  
- In the second example, ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" translates to ""red green red red yellow red"". The instances of ""wif"" all correspond to ""red,"" regardless of the neighboring words.

- In the third example, ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red"".

- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"". The ""wif"" stands alone as ""red"" even though it is surrounded by different words.

- In the fifth example, ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue"". Again ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of the preceding or following words.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" seems to be consistent and independent of context:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or surrounding words in the input. Therefore, the rule for the word ""zup"" would be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the examples provided:

Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
Input: dax lug bluf -> Output: green blue blue
Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green

One can notice that the output pattern includes a color that is repeated twice at the end of each sequence. The color that is repeated corresponds to the color indicated by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". When ""bluf"" appears immediately after ""dax"", the color ""green"" is repeated twice. When other words precede ""bluf"", the color corresponding to the previous word is the one repeated. This suggests that ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the color mentioned just before it.

Therefore, the rule for bluf is:
bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color that precedes it to repeat twice in the output.
Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word(s) in the sequence the same number of times as there are letters in the word ""walm.""

Explanation:
1. ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and when ""walm"" follows, ""yellow"" is repeated three times (because ""walm"" has four letters).
2. ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows, ""green"" is repeated three times.
3. ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows both words, ""blue"" is repeated four times, taking the color from ""lug"" only.
4. ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times; then ""green"" follows after ""dax,"" and finally ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

So walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word the same number of times as there are letters in the word ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue blue blue blue,yellow yellow blue blue blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. Here's the pattern that seems to emerge from the given inputs and outputs:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red (assumed to be a repeat or typo because 'dax lug zup wif bluf dax' and 'lug wif dax' suggest that 'wif' and 'bluf' both output red)

So the rule in this case is: Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" specifically means ""green"". 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of the context it's used in. It consistently outputs ""red"" whether it's on its own or followed by other words. Therefore, the rule I can induce from these examples is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that **zup** consistently translates to the color **yellow** regardless of its position or the other words around it. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This can be deduced by observing that the output ""red"" appears each time the input ""bluf"" is present.

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe the patterns in the provided examples. Let's look at the occurrence of ""walm"" and the corresponding output in each example.

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Interpretation: The word ""walm"" appears twice and correlates with the sequence ""green green green"". ""Dax"" appears thrice and is always followed by ""green."" ""Wif"" and ""lug"" are followed by ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

2. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   Interpretation: ""Lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" ""Walm"" is associated with ""green"" as it follows ""dax.""

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Interpretation: ""Zup"" and ""bluf"" correlate with ""yellow"" and ""red,"" respectively. ""Wif"" is followed by ""red,"" and ""walm"" is followed by two additional ""red.""

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Interpretation: The presence of ""dax"" is followed by two ""green"" and ""walm"" follows with another ""green.""

5. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   Interpretation: ""Zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""walm"" extends the sequence of ""green.""

Through these observations, we can see that the word ""walm"" consistently correlates with an extension of the color emitted by the preceding word. In contexts where ""walm"" follows the word ""dax,"" which emits ""green,"" the pattern extends by emitting more ""green."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" functions as an amplifier or extender of the preceding color.

Rule: walm -> extends the sequence of the current color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

    ",Output: green yellow green blue green,green yellow green blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that each word corresponds to a specific color. To extract the rule for ""lug,"" we analyze the data to see what output is consistently associated with the input containing ""lug.""

- In the first input line, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup,"" and in the output line, ""blue"" is followed by ""yellow."" Later in the same line, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second input line, ""lug"" is the first word and corresponds to the first output color ""blue.""
- In the third input line, ""lug"" is the first word again and is followed by ""wif,"" with the output being ""blue"" followed by ""red.""
- In the fourth input line, ""lug"" is again the first word and corresponds with the first color in the output, ""blue.""
- Finally, in the fifth input line, ""lug"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output for ""lug"" in this position is ""blue.""

Across all examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Therefore, based on this data, we deduce:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. Here are the observed mappings:

zup -> yellow
wif -> red
dax -> green
walm -> green
lug -> blue

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" appears to be:

dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the provided examples and the outputs side by side:

- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
- Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> Output: red green yellow red green green
- Input: dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow
- Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red

From these examples, the direct occurrence of ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" in the output:

wif -> red

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule can be written as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Each instance of the word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"" whenever it directly follows a word that corresponds to the color ""green"" or precedes a word that corresponds to the color ""green"". When ""bluf"" does not directly precede or follow a word that corresponds to ""green"", it corresponds to the color ""yellow"". If ""bluf"" follows a word corresponding to ""blue"", it maintains the ""yellow"" color.

Here are the rules observed according to the provided examples:

1. ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"".
2. ""zup"" seems to change color between ""yellow"" and ""green"", which could mean that its color changes depending on its position relative to ""bluf"" or ""dax"".
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
5. ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"".

The observed pattern for ""bluf"" based on its position and context is:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green), it is ""green"" (Example 1).
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" (green), it is ""green"" (Example 2).
- When ""bluf"" does not directly precede or follow ""dax"" (green), but is in the proximity of ""zup"" (color changes), it is ""yellow"" (Example 3, Example 5).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue), it is observed as ""yellow"" (Example 3).

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" could be:

Rule: bluf -> ""green"" when immediately following or preceding ""green""; ""yellow"" otherwise, taking into account the proximity of changing colors such as ""zup"" or the presence of ""blue"" like ""lug"" before it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" takes on the color attribute of the word that immediately precedes it. To validate this claim, let's look at each example:

1. dax walm: Output is ""green green green"", which suggests that ""walm"" takes the color of ""dax"" (green).

2. wif walm: Output is ""red red red"", again showing that ""walm"" takes the color of ""wif"" (red).

3. lug walm wif zup wif: The output after ""lug walm"" is ""blue blue blue"", which implies ""walm"" takes the color from ""lug"" (blue), and then the sequence continues normally with the colors represented by ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow).

4. dax lug wif walm: Up to ""wif"" the output is ""green blue red"", and then ""walm"" repeats the color red which is the color of the word immediately before it, ""wif"".

5. lug walm wif lug: The output sequence ""blue blue blue red blue"" indicates that ""walm"" first takes the color from ""lug"" (blue), followed by the colors represented by ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" again (blue).

Given these observations, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it in a sequence. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" it outputs green, if preceded by ""wif"" it outputs red, if preceded by ""lug"" it outputs blue, and so on.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue."" Each instance where ""lug"" appears in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. This direct one-to-one relationship suggests that the meaning of ""lug"" is consistent regardless of context within these examples.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Examining the provided examples, it appears that each instance of ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" regardless of the other words around it or their respective outputs. Here is the pattern that 'dax' exhibits across the examples:

- Every time 'dax' appears, the output is 'green', no matter its position in the sequence.
- Other words correspond to different colors: 'bluf' corresponds to 'yellow', 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green. The rule is that the word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green'.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the word ""wif"":

Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the same position.

Here are the observations supporting this rule:

- Whenever ""wif"" is present alone or as the first word in the input, the output starts with ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears later in the sequence, ""red"" follows in the corresponding position in the output sequence.
- There are no instances where ""wif"" is in the input and ""red"" is not in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule:
wif -> ""red""
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be relatively straightforward:

- Whenever the input contains the word ""zup,"" the output always includes the word ""yellow.""

Therefore, our rule can be deduced as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When ""zup"" is present in the input, the output will always include the word ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the given examples and look for a pattern in colors associated with ""bluf"" and its position relative to the other words.

1. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
2. dax bluf wif -> green green red
3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
4. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
5. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Looking at the examples:

- In the first and third examples, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output color for ""bluf"" is red.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and the output color for ""bluf"" is green.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"" in the sequence, and the corresponding output colors are green and red.
- ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the output associated with the word immediately following it, if there is one.

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" appears to act as a kind of 'chameleon' word, taking on the color associated with the following word in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that immediately follows it. If there is no word after ""bluf,"" it takes the color associated with the word ""lug.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns related to the inputs and outputs provided:

1. When ""lug walm"" is the input, ""blue blue blue"" is the output. 
   - ""lug"" is followed by three ""blue.""

2. When ""zup wif dax walm lug"" is the input, ""yellow red green green green blue"" is the output.
   - ""zup wif dax"" gives ""yellow red green,"" then ""walm"" is followed by two ""green"" and ""lug"" gives another ""blue.""

3. When ""lug dax walm wif"" is the input, ""blue green green green red"" is the output.
   - ""lug dax"" starts with ""blue green,"" ""walm"" is followed by two ""green,"" and ""wif"" at the end is a ""red.""

4. When ""zup walm"" is the input, ""yellow yellow yellow"" is the output.
   - ""zup"" is followed by two ""yellow.""

5. When ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" is the input, ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"" is the output.
   - ""lug"" starts with ""blue,"" ""walm"" is followed by two ""blue,"" ""zup lug zup"" gives ""yellow blue yellow,"" and ""wif"" at the end is a ""red.""

Analyzing the above examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color word that precedes it in the pattern three times. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" three times; when ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color word before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Explanation: In each example, whenever the word ""lug"" is present, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. Regardless of the position or the number of occurrences of ""lug"" in the input, there is a consistent translation to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" changes its meaning depending on its position relative to other words. Let's analyze the patterns and occurrences of ""dax"":

1. When ""dax"" is at the beginning or end of a sequence, it translates to ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is in the middle of a sequence, it translates to ""red"" if it is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""bluf,"" but it translates to ""green"" in all other cases.
3. ""dax"" seems to not be directly influencing the translation of the other words around it, as their translations are consistent regardless of ""dax."" For example, ""lug"" always translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to ""blue.""

Given the examples above, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: When ""dax"" is at the beginning or end of a sequence, it translates to ""green."" When ""dax"" is in the middle of a sequence, it generally translates to ""green,"" except when it is specifically between ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" in which case it translates to ""red."" Other rules for word translation seem consistent regardless of the presence of ""dax.""

Therefore: dax -> ""green"" (at the beginning/end), ""green"" or ""red"" (in the middle, context-dependent)
Based on the examples provided, we can induce that ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is used, the output includes ""red.""

Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red."" Without ""wif,"" one might predict that ""zup"" alone would output ""yellow.""
- ""wif dax"" outputs ""red green."" Without ""wif,"" one might predict that ""dax"" alone would output ""green.""
- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red."" Without ""wif,"" one might predict that ""bluf"" alone would output ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is used on its own (Input: ""wif""), the output is simply ""red.""
- The input ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue,"" indicating that, like ""bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" while ""wif"" still adds ""red.""

Based on these observations, the induction is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is included in the output.
Based on the examples, we can deduce the following:

When 'zup' is by itself (example 1), the output is 'yellow'. When 'zup' is in a sequence with other nonce words such as 'lug', 'dax', 'wif', 'walm', and 'bluf,' the output for 'zup' is consistent – it is always 'yellow'. Other words like 'lug', 'dax', 'wif', and 'walm' have outputs that are not always the same ('lug' outputs 'blue' but also 'blue blue', and 'wif' outputs 'red' but also 'yellow yellow red'), indicating that their meaning might be position-dependent or influenced by the preceding or following words. 

However, 'zup' yields 'yellow' independent of its position in a sequence or the words around it (examples 2, 3, 4, and 5). This suggests that the meaning of 'zup' is not dependent on context and is consistently translated to 'yellow'.

Thus, the rule can be described as:

Rule: 'zup' translates directly to 'yellow', regardless of context or position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" 

- In every instance where the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- Other words in the input correspond to different colors in the output: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" also to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be consistent across all examples:

Rule: bluf -> blue
Rule: The word ""walm"" transforms the color associated with the word that immediately follows it into the same color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

Explanation:
1. In the first example, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green."" This means that ""walm"" makes the following color repeat the color of the preceding word so ""dax"" which is ""green"" is repeated due to the ""walm"".
   
2. In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" Following the rule, ""walm"" after ""dax"" generates more ""green,"" and then the ""walm"" after ""lug"" which is associated with ""blue"" generates more ""blue"".
   
3. In the third example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Here, ""walm"" makes the color after it (associated with ""lug"" which is ""blue"") take on the color before it (associated with ""zup"" which is ""yellow"").
   
4. In the fourth example, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" becomes ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" ""Walm"" changes the color that should come from ""wif"" into the color associated with ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

5. In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" The presence of ""walm"" makes ""zup,"" which should be yellow, take the color of ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and the second ""walm"" repeats the effect.

Therefore, the rule is that ""walm"" changes the color of the subsequent word to the color of the preceding word.

Walm -> changes the subsequent color to match the preceding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif lug walm zup
    ",Output: red green red blue blue blue yellow,red green red blue blue blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the given examples, whenever the input contains the word ""lug,"" the output consistently includes the color ""blue."" Therefore, it can be deduced that ""lug"" means ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""

1. In the first example, ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red,"" and the ""wif"" is directly paired with the first ""red.""
2. In the second example, ""zup lug zup lug wif"" outputs ""yellow blue yellow blue red,"" with ""wif"" again corresponding to the last ""red.""
3. In the third example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" linking ""wif"" to ""red.""
4. In the fourth example, the input ""wif"" on its own results in the output ""red,"" affirming its individual meaning.
5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup wif walm lug"" gives us ""yellow red red red blue,"" with ""wif"" once more associated with ""red.""

With all examples reviewed, there is a one-to-one correspondence between ""wif"" and the color ""red."" This allows us to conclude that:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, we can infer the following outputs for the given inputs:

- walm -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Each time 'zup' is the input or part of the input, the output always contains ""yellow"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence, its output is consistent. Therefore, it seems that the other words ('walm', 'wif', 'lug', etc.) translate to different colors and 'zup' specifically translates to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To discern the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to each instance of ""bluf"":

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

3. Input: dax bluf lug wif
   Output: green green blue red

4. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

5. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green

From the given examples, we can see that whenever the word ""bluf"" is used, the color that immediately follows ""bluf"" in the output is duplicated.

Considering the provided pairs:

1. ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue""
2. ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red""
3. ""dax bluf lug"" -> ""green green blue""
4. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
5. ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""

It is evident from these that the first color in the output sequence (that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"") is duplicated, followed by the color corresponding to the word immediately following ""bluf.""

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be duplication of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color corresponding to the previous word.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to invoke repeating the color of the previous word until a new color word appears. Here are the conclusions drawn from the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   The ""walm"" after ""lug"" keeps repeating ""blue"" until ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow"", then ""lug"" changes it back to ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" again.

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   After ""lug wif"", ""walm"" repeats ""red"" following ""wif"" until ""lug"" changes the color again to ""blue"".

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" repeats ""yellow"" following ""zup"".

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   ""Walm"" repeats ""red"" following ""wif"".

5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   ""Walm"" repeats ""green"" following ""dax"" until ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word until a new color word is mentioned.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup wif
    ",Output: blue green yellow red,blue green yellow red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, no matter its position in the input phrase or the other words surrounding it.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced by considering its consistent association with a specific output across different inputs. Here is the induction from the given examples:

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup lug bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow blue blue."" 
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow.""
- When ""dax"" stands alone, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup wif,"" the output is ""green yellow red.""
- When ""lug dax zup"" is the input, the output is ""blue green yellow.""

From the above examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to the output ""green,"" regardless of the context it is used in. 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, one can deduce that ""wif"" might correspond to the color ""red."" Let's test this hypothesis against each example:

1. ""dax wif"" becomes ""green red,"" which fits the rule if ""dax"" means ""green.""
2. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" This also fits the rule if ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""walm"" means ""blue.""
3. ""wif zup wif dax"" turns into ""red yellow red green,"" which is consistent if ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""
4. ""wif dax bluf"" yields ""red green green,"" which holds if ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""bluf"" is also ""green.""
5. ""lug wif lug wif lug"" becomes ""blue red blue red blue."" This example is consistent if ""lug"" means ""blue.""

In all cases, ""wif"" is associated with the output ""red,"" so the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" There is no context provided in which ""zup"" produces a different output, hence we can deduce that the word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
From the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color output in the ""Output"" sequences. Each instance of ""bluf"" appears to match the color preceding it.

Let's analyze each example:

1. In the first example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" the output colors are ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" Before ""bluf,"" the color is ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" the color is ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""zup wif bluf,"" the output colors are ""yellow red red."" Before ""bluf,"" the color is ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" the color is ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""zup bluf,"" the output colors are ""yellow yellow."" Before ""bluf,"" the color is ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" the color is ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" the output colors are ""blue green green red green."" Before ""bluf,"" the color is ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" the color is ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" the output colors are ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" Before ""bluf,"" the color is ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" the color is ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color that immediately precedes it.
By examining the input and output patterns, we can try to deduce the rule that governs the meaning of ""walm"". Let's look at each input and corresponding output:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Here ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow"", and then ""walm"" leads to two extra ""yellow"" outputs.

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   We know from the first input that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". ""wif"" in this case produces ""red,"" ""bluf"" produces ""blue,"" and ""lug"" produces ""blue"" again. After these, ""walm"" is followed by repetitions of ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" each repeated twice.

3. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   ""lug"" gives us ""blue,"" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""dax"" seems to give ""green,"" and ""zup"" gives ""yellow."" After these individual colors, ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated three times.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" twice (for ""walm""), then ""dax"" gives ""green,"" and ""zup"" gives ""yellow."" Here ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and before ""dax,"" and it gives us two extra ""red""s.

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" and given that this is the only color associated with ""wif,"" it seems that ""walm"" causes it to repeat twice more.

Based on the given examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color word of the immediately preceding term two extra times. So if the preceding color word is ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" results in two extra ""yellow"" words, and if the preceding color word is ""red,"" then ""walm"" results in two extra ""red"" words, and so on.

So the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word of the immediately preceding term two extra times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""lug"" seems to be consistently linked to the color ""blue."" In every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: In the given inputs, regardless of the other words present (""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup""), the output always includes ""green"" whenever the nonce word ""dax"" appears. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the appearance of ""dax"" in the input and ""green"" in the output. Thus, ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, here is the pattern that can be discerned:

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" translates to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

When ""wif"" is used in the examples, it appears to precede a repetition of the color that follows it, duplicating the number of times the color is expressed in the output. 

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Here, ""wif walm"" caused ""red"" to be repeated one more time than usual, resulting in three ""red"" instead of one.

2. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   Since there is no color after ""wif,"" it is assumed to output ""red.""

3. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   ""wif bluf"" resulted in ""red"" being repeated twice.

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Again, ""wif walm"" led to ""red"" being repeated three times total.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   ""wif bluf"" resulted in ""red"" being stated twice, and ""dax walm"" follows which seems to have no impact from ""wif,"" so ""green"" gets stated twice for ""dax"" and ""red"" stated once for ""walm.""

Given the above, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When the nonce word ""wif"" precedes another word, it causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated once more than it usually would.

However, there is an exception to this rule in example 2, where ""wif"" is not followed by another word but still results in ""red."" If we are to account for this anomaly, we could make an auxiliary rule that:

Auxiliary Rule: When ""wif"" is at the end of a sequence with no following word, it defaults to ""red.""

So, the meaning of ""wif"" in the given context is:
wif -> Repeat the color corresponding to the following word, or default to ""red"" if there is no subsequent word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" has a consistent translation to ""yellow"" each time it occurs in the input. There is no variation in the output for the word ""zup"" in any of the examples given. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is named directly before it. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""bluf"" translates to red in the output.
- In the second example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" becomes yellow in the output.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""zup bluf"" and ""wif bluf,"" it's clear that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it: ""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" is yellow; ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" is red.
- The fifth example, ""wif dax zup bluf,"" follows the same pattern, with ""zup"" before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" translates to yellow in the output.

Rule: bluf -> The color word preceding bluf is repeated as the meaning of bluf.
walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with that previous word three times.

Examples validated:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with green.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow.
- In the sequence ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Then following the sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" to red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""lug"" associates with the color ""blue."" Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" corresponds to it in the output. Therefore, the rule we can extract from the examples is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". Here is the reasoning for each example:

1. dax lug dax -> green blue green
2. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
3. wif dax lug dax -> red green blue green
4. wif zup wif dax -> red yellow red green
5. wif bluf dax -> red red green

No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence, the output is always ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of position or context. Thus, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently results in the output of the color ""yellow."" It doesn't matter what other words precede or follow it; the presence of ""zup"" guarantees that ""yellow"" will be part of the output sequence. The position of ""zup"" in the input affects its position in the output sequence.

Hence, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: When the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" will be output in the corresponding position to ""zup."" For example, if ""zup"" is the first word in the input, ""yellow"" will be the first word in the output.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the color that comes before ""bluf"" being repeated in the output. Here is the breakdown:

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"".)
2. ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red"" (The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"".)
3. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue"" (The word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"".)
4. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red"" (The word before ""bluf"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"".)
5. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"" (The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"".)

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"" in the input sequence.

Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's a breakdown of the observed pattern:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red."" ""Wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" ""Dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue.""

In all cases, the color that immediately precedes ""walm"" is repeated three times. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to function as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm wif
    ",Output: yellow green green green red,yellow green green green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output, consistently indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:
- ""dax zup lug wif zup"" translates to ""green yellow blue red yellow""
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red""
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red""
- ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue red blue blue yellow""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""

It can be observed that ""wif"" always translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning or rule for ""zup,"" let's consider it in the context of each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" but turns to ""red"" if repeated
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""green"" initially but changes to ""red""

2. Input: zup lug wif
   Output: yellow blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

3. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and considering all occurrences, it doesn't seem to correspond to any color directly but is always followed by ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue
   - Confirmation that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" seems not to change what follows but introduces a yellow.

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" ends up with ""red"" after ""bluf""
   - ""lug"" ends with ""blue""

Considering all these examples, ""zup"" appears to consistently output ""yellow,"" regardless of the context or its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be summarized as:

Rule: zup -> yellow (Each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position or surrounding words).
Based on the examples given, it appears that 'bluf' results in the output of the color word that precedes it in the sequence. Here are the observations supporting this:

1. In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", so 'bluf' follows the rule by duplicating the color 'blue'.
2. In the second example, ""zup wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow red red,"" where 'bluf' duplicates 'red', the color denoted by 'wif'.
3. The third example has ""zup bluf"", resulting in ""yellow yellow,"" with 'bluf' again duplicating the color 'yellow' as indicated by 'zup'.
4. In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" showing that 'bluf' duplicates the color 'red'.
5. Finally, the fifth example simplifies to ""zup bluf"" being ""yellow yellow,"" and consistent with previous instances, 'bluf' duplicates the color 'yellow'.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> the word immediately preceding 'bluf' is a color word, and 'bluf' is an instruction to duplicate that color word in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's analyze the pattern in each input and its corresponding output:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" seems to cause repetition of the last mentioned color, i.e., ""blue"".

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" again causes repetition of the last mentioned color, i.e., ""green"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" twice, and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" twice, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""walm"" repeats the ""blue"" twice, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" twice, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Based on the examples and the outputs provided, it can be concluded that ""walm"" is a rule that repeats the last mentioned color twice.

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color to be repeated twice. Rule: Repeat the last color twice when ""walm"" is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug walm dax walm
    ",Output: green blue blue blue green green green,green blue blue blue green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' corresponds to the color blue.
Looking at the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Regardless of the presence or absence of other words (""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug""), every instance of ""dax"" produces ""green"" in the output.

Thus, the rule we can deduce is:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word has a corresponding color. We can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" by examining the consistent output tied to its input across multiple examples.

Input: lug zup wif
Output: blue yellow red

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when translated, as we can see from the consistent output in all given examples.

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples suggest that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

- lug zup -> blue yellow
- zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
- wif zup -> red yellow
- wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

Based on these patterns, we can determine that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
From analyzing the examples provided, we identify the following patterns:

- ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently leads to the output ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently leads to the output ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" does not have a consistent output color.

So instead of having a direct corresponding color output, ""bluf"" seems to take the color output only from the word following it, except when it is the last word, in which case the output is ""red.""

Given the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green. 
   (The ""bluf"" here gives ""red"" which is the output for ""wif,"" and the following word ""dax"" yields ""green."")

2. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax -> Output: red yellow yellow red green. 
   (The ""bluf"" here gives ""yellow,"" which is the output for the following word ""wif."")
   
3. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red.
   (The ""bluf"" at the end gives ""red,"" same as the output for ""wif."")

4. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green.
   (The first ""bluf"" gives ""blue,"" which is the output for the following word ""zup,"" and the second ""bluf"" yields ""yellow,"" which is the output color for ""dax."")

5. Input: zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue.
   (The ""bluf"" gives ""yellow,"" which is the output for ""zup."")

From this pattern, we can induce the rule for ""bluf"":

bluf -> The output color of ""bluf"" is the same as the color output of the next word in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is at the end, the output color is ""red.""

Rule: If ""bluf"" is followed by another word, its output color is the color output of the following word; if ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, its output color is red.
Based on the given examples, the following patterns can be noticed:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is a repetition of ""red.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is a repetition of ""blue.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is a repetition of ""red.""

It seems that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the color that precedes it. The number of repetitions seems to correspond to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence; i.e., if ""walm"" is the fourth word, the color before it is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, a potential rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> It causes the word before it to be repeated in the output color sequence as many times as the position of ""walm"" minus one.

For example:
- In ""dax lug wif walm,"" ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" which is the fourth word, hence ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" is before ""walm,"" which is the second word, so ""blue"" is repeated once.
- In ""wif walm lug bluf,"" ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" which is the second word, so ""red"" is repeated once followed by the sequence for ""lug"" and ""bluf.""

This rule seems to account for the given examples, but because of the limited examples, it is not possible to determine if ""walm"" has a strict one-to-one correspondence with a specific color or purely depends on context.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs:

- wif zup lug wif -> red yellow blue red
- zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
- lug -> blue
- lug -> blue
- lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue

In all the examples, regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the rule induction analysis suggests that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Here's how the given input-output pairs led to this rule:

1. Input: ""dax"" Output: ""green""
2. Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue green blue""
3. Input: ""dax"" Output: ""green""
4. Input: ""dax walm"" Output: ""green green green""
5. Input: ""dax"" Output: ""green""

In every instance where the word ""dax"" appears, the output color associated with ""dax"" is ""green."" Furthermore, in the fourth input where ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times, suggesting that the word ""dax"" not only translates directly to the color ""green"" but also has an effect on the following words; in this case, causing ""walm"" to also produce the output ""green"" multiple times.

Given these observations, the underlying rule for the word ""dax"" seems to be consistent regardless of its position or the words surrounding it. As such, we can conclude the following:

dax -> meaning. Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that each word from the input corresponds to a certain color in the output. For instance, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" and likewise, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" In every given example, the appearance of the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, we can infer the following relationships:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"" (and also ""walm"" as it appears to be a repeated pattern of ""red"").

Given these relationships:

Rule: 
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif and walm -> red (with ""walm"" denoting a repetition of ""red"" as many times as ""walm"" occurs after ""wif"")
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it follows the words ""wif"" or ""dax"", and it corresponds to the color ""red"" when following the word ""lug"". When it follows ""zup,"" it corresponds to the color ""yellow."" However, when ""bluf"" follows itself or is in the beginning, it always corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Here are the rules as per the examples:

- wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
  The word ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and it translates to ""green.""
  
- dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
  The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and it translates to ""red."" However, this rule seems to conflict with the first example, which suggests that perhaps the meaning of ""bluf"" may not solely depend on the preceding word.

- dax bluf -> green green
  The word ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and it translates to ""green."" When ""bluf"" follows itself, it translates as ""green"" again, which correlates with the first example.

- lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
  The word ""bluf"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" When ""bluf"" follows itself, it translates to ""blue.""

- zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
  The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" translating to ""yellow"". When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it's ""blue,"" and when it follows itself, it's ""blue"".

Considering the inconsistencies and based on the majority of examples, the most consistent rule seems to be that ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" regardless of the previous word. The inconsistencies may arise from errors in the provided outputs or a misunderstanding of the rules based on the examples provided.

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Rule: walm means to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three additional times. For example, if ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, then ""wif walm"" would result in ""red red red red"".

Applying this rule to the examples:

1. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the color three more times.
2. ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color three more times.
3. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the color three more times.
4. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" results in ""green green green red blue green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""walm"" repeats it three more times, then ""dax"" again corresponds to green and ""walm"" repeats it again three more times.
5. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" repeats the color three more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The meaning of the word ""lug"" appears to be consistent across all examples. In each output where the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" is present in the output.

Rule: lug means blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the examples provided and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

Given this example, it is not immediately clear what ""wif"" signifies, as ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" but ""wif"" could mean ""red"" or it could be a separator of some kind.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

In this example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which leads to ""blue red."" Since ""walm"" and ""lug"" both translate as ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" it suggests that ""wif"" might indicate a color change or a repetition.

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Here, ""dax"" stands for ""green,"" and it is followed by ""wif"" which results in ""green red."" Later, we see ""bluf wif,"" which leads to ""yellow red red red."" It's possible that ""wif"" could be involved in producing the ""red"" color.

4. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red

Following the pattern of ""wif"" possibly adding a ""red,"" when it follows ""bluf,"" it again produces the same output as ""blue red.""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Observing that ""wif"" is before ""walm"" which translates to ""red,"" and again ""wif"" is modifying what comes after it or repeating the ""red.""

Considering all examples, one potential rule is that ""wif"" causes the color immediately preceding it to be followed by ""red."" If there is no preceding color, then ""wif"" just translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> ""wif"" repeats the color that comes immediately before it (if any) with the addition of ""red."" If there is no preceding color, then ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow', regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Observing the input and output patterns, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that came immediately before it in the input sequence. Let's verify this by examining each example:

1. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" 

4. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be consistent:

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that came immediately before it in the input sequence.
walm -> repeat the color of the previously mentioned color word

Using the examples given:

- ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue"". ""Walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""lug"" (meaning ""blue""), hence ""blue blue blue"".
- ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Walm"" repeats the color before it, which is ""zup"" (meaning ""yellow""), hence ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""wif walm"" is ""red red red"". ""Walm"" repeats the color before it, which is ""wif"" (meaning ""red""), hence ""red red red"".
- ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red"". ""Walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""wif"" (meaning ""red""), hence ""red red red"".
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red"". In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (meaning ""yellow""), hence the repetition ""yellow yellow yellow""; ""dax"" translates as ""green"" which is not followed by ""walm"", therefore there is no repetition, and then ""wif"" (meaning ""red"") followed by ""bluf"" (no meaning provided or necessary for the rule) ends the pattern.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, I will analyze each occurrence of the word ""lug"" and its resulting output color. The goal is to determine the rule or meaning based on the patterns observed in the outputs.

1. Example: ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
- ""lug"" first appears and is translated as ""blue.""
- ""walm"" seems to follow ""lug"" and is also ""blue.""
- ""zup"" interrupts the sequence and is ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" appears after ""zup"" and continues as ""blue.""

2. Example: ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> Output: ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""
- ""lug"" appears after ""zup"" and is translated as ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" before ""lug"" is ""yellow.""
- The second ""lug"" is still ""blue.""

3. Example: ""lug bluf"" -> Output: ""blue blue""
- ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" is also ""blue.""

4. Example: ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> Output: ""yellow green green green blue red""
- ""lug"" appears after ""walm"" and is ""blue.""
- ""wif"" after ""lug"" becomes ""red.""
- ""walm"" before ""lug"" is ""green.""

5. Example: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
- ""lug"" directly after ""zup"" is ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" at the end of the sequence after ""wif"" is ""red.""

Based on the examples, it seems that ""lug"" is consistently translated as ""blue"" regardless of its position or the words that come before or after it. There does not appear to be a change in the meaning of ""lug"" dependent on context; ""lug"" directly correlates to the color ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Considering the given examples and the respective outputs, we can derive a rule for what the nonce word ""dax"" represents in the context of color output.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Input: zup dax lug zup
Output: yellow green blue yellow

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

Based on the examples:
- The word ""zup"" is consistently followed by the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" is consistently followed by the color ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" is consistently followed by the color ""blue,"" except when it follows ""walm,"" then ""lug"" also produces ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" is consistently followed by the color ""red.""
- The word ""bluf"" is consistently followed by the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be independent of context, as it always translates to the color ""green"" regardless of the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" every time it appears in the input. The presence or absence of other words such as ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or ""bluf"" does not seem to alter the translation of ""wif"" itself.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the correlation between each input and the corresponding output, focusing on the positions where ""zup"" appears:

1. Input: lug zup wif -> Output: blue yellow red
In this example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: zup wif lug -> Output: yellow red blue
The order of the colors is reversed but still corresponds to the words, so ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green."" ""Wif"" appears twice, both times corresponding to ""red."" The first ""zup"" here corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax zup lug wif zup -> Output: green yellow blue red yellow
Again ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" appears twice, each time corresponding to ""yellow."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: zup walm lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
In this final example, we see ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" followed by a new word ""walm,"" which also corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Lug"" once more corresponds to ""blue.""

From these examples, we can deduce a rule: 

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's focus on the position of the word ""bluf"" and the color it corresponds to in the output across all examples.

1. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
2. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow
3. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
4. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

In examples 1 and 2, ""dax"" is before ""bluf"" and the output for both is ""green green"", suggesting that ""dax"" does not influence the color associated with ""bluf"". Examples 1 and 2 also show that ""zup"" and ""lug"" after ""bluf"" result in different colors (yellow and blue respectively) for the words following ""bluf"". Thus, ""bluf"" doesn't seem to determine the color that follows it.

However, looking at the third example where ""bluf"" is at the end, the corresponding output color is yellow. So, it might seem that ""bluf"" could represent the color yellow when it's the last word.

In the fourth example, we see that ""bluf"" is followed by different words but the output for ""bluf"" remains ""green"". This reinforces the notion that the position of ""bluf"" might not strongly determine its corresponding color.

Finally, the fifth example gives us ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"", which further suggests that ""bluf"" is associated with the color yellow, given that ""zup"" is also associated with yellow.

Based on these observations, it is logical to deduce that the word ""bluf"" represents the color ""yellow,"" though there might be additional contextual rules not immediately apparent from the examples given. However, in all cases ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the position of ""walm"" in every input and the corresponding output colors.

- Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
- Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif | Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
- Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
- Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
- Input: dax walm | Output: green green green

In all cases, the output immediately following the word ""walm"" consists of repeated colors. This repetition seems to reflect the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". To clarify:

- ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"", where ""wif"" is associated with red, and that color is repeated thrice after ""walm"".
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" results in ""blue blue blue green red blue red"". Here ""lug"" is associated with blue, and the color is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- In ""wif walm dax zup"" which results in ""red red red green yellow"", the word ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the color red is repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", as in ""dax lug walm"" and ""dax walm,"" the color green is repeated three times.

This consistent pattern implies the rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following:

1. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
2. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
3. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
4. lug zup -> blue yellow
5. dax lug wif -> green blue red

The word 'lug' appears in various positions in the sequences, and consistently, the word 'blue' is outputted in its place.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
Using the given examples, I will deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"".

In the first example, ""dax"" is used twice, once after ""wif"" and once after ""lug"". It corresponds to ""green"" both times. It appears that ""dax"" does not change meaning depending on its position after ""wif"" or ""lug"".

In the second example, ""dax"" appears after ""zup"" and it is still ""green"". Additionally, the word ""lug"" is used three times and corresponds to ""blue"" each time. This again supports the idea that ""dax"" maintains its meaning regardless of its position.

In the third example, ""dax"" appears both at the beginning and in the second position after ""bluf"" and still translates to ""green"".

Since the last two examples are just ""dax"" on their own and they translate to ""green"" both times, it solidifies the observation that ""dax"" stands for ""green"" consistently.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green,"" with two instances of ""wif"" both corresponding to ""red.""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red,"" hence ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm,"" which follows ""wif,"" repeats the ""red"" an additional two times.
- The single instances of ""wif"" also translate to ""red.""

It seems that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red,"" and when followed by another word that doesn't align with colors like ""lug"" or ""dax,"" it stands alone as a representation of the color ""red."" When followed by ""walm,"" it appears to result in repetition of the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or pattern associated with the nonce word ""zup."" We'll examine each example to determine what ""zup"" represents:

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
2. zup wif -> yellow red
3. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
4. dax zup lug wif zup -> green yellow blue red yellow
5. lug zup -> blue yellow

To find a pattern, let's focus on the output whenever ""zup"" appears:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" and the output always starts with ""yellow"" for ""zup"" followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""
- In example 3, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output adds two additional ""yellow"" after the initial ""yellow"" for ""zup."" Since ""walm"" without ""zup"" in other examples outputs only ""red red red,"" it suggests that ""zup"" modifies the following word by repeating its color.
- In example 4, ""zup"" appears twice: once after ""dax"" and once at the end. For the first ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" For the second ""zup,"" since it's at the end and followed by nothing, it is again ""yellow.""
- In example 5, ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue yellow"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"" in the output. Furthermore, when ""zup"" precedes another word, it does not appear to change the output of that word except when it is followed by ""walm,"" in which case it leads to repetition of ""red"" (the output for ""walm""). However, based on the data provided, we cannot infer a general rule for how ""zup"" modifies the following word besides ""walm,"" if it modifies at all.

Rule: zup -> yellow

In the case of ""zup wif walm,"" it seems there may be an additional rule or interaction between ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm,"" affecting the number of times ""red"" is repeated, but the provided examples are insufficient to deduce an exact rule for this interaction.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" acts as a mirror to the word that comes directly before it, by replicating its corresponding output color. If ""bluf"" appears following a word that translates to a color, it takes on the same color in the output. In other words, ""bluf"" effectively duplicates the color that precedes it. 

Let's see if this rule holds for the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Rule Check: ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" following it results in another ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   Rule Check: ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" following it results in another ""yellow."" Later, ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   Rule Check: ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" following it results in another ""green.""

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   Rule Check: ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" following it results in another ""green."" Then, ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   Rule Check: ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" following it results in another ""red."" ""Lug's"" color is irrelevant in this context because ""bluf"" only mirrors the preceding word.

Rule: bluf mirrors the output color of the word that directly precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of colors associated with nonce words in the examples provided.

In each example, the output colors are sequences, and it seems that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that came just before it. Let's examine each case:

1. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   
   Here, the color before ""walm"" is yellow, and after ""walm"" we see yellow repeated.

2. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   
   Here, the color before ""walm"" is green, and after ""walm"" we see green repeated.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   
   Again, the color before ""walm"" is green, and after ""walm"" we see green repeated.

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   
   The color before ""walm"" is blue, and after ""walm"" we see blue repeated.

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   The color before ""walm"" is yellow, and after ""walm"" we see yellow repeated.

Rule:
Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color immediately preceding it to repeat. Therefore:

walm -> meaning is that it repeats the color that comes before it in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is always ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, the word 'dax' seems to consistently correspond to the color 'green' in the outputs. In each example, regardless of the words around it, 'dax' always results in 'green' being part of the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" irrespective of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following pattern for the nonce word 'zup':

- Whenever 'zup' appears, the word 'yellow' is added to the output.
- The position of 'yellow' in the output correlates with where 'zup' appears in the input.
- 'zup' does not influence the translation of the other words.

Here's a breakdown according to each input and output, showing how 'zup' maps to 'yellow':

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   'zup' precedes 'lug' and 'walm', so 'yellow' appears first.

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   Each occurrence of 'zup' generates a 'yellow', one at the start and one at the end, framing the other colors.

3. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   'zup' appears after 'dax', mapping to the 'yellow' that follows 'green' in the output.

4. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
   'zup' is in the first position, adding 'yellow' at the start of the output.

5. Input: dax lug zup
   Output: green blue yellow
   'zup' appears at the end of the input, translating to 'yellow' at the end of the output.

Based on this analysis, the rule for 'zup' is:

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" (where 'yellow' is added to the output in the position corresponding to where 'zup' appears in the input).
From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the breakdown of the rule application in each example:

- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is also ""green.""
- In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""red,"" followed by ""dax"" which is ""green.""
- In ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" again, followed by ""wif"" associated with ""red"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""
- In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue"" again, followed by ""wif"" with ""red.""
- Finally, in ""dax bluf wif zup lug,"" ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" the output is ""green"" again, followed by ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""

Based on the above, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf means repeat the previous color.
Based on the given examples, walm appears to correspond to a rule where it repeats the color associated with the preceding word or words the same number of times as there are unique words before it, except for itself and any repetitions of the immediate word preceding it. Here's the interpretation for each example:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because 'dax' corresponds to green, and 'walm' means there would be three greens.
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"" because 'dax' is green, 'lug' is blue, and 'walm' repeats blue three times as there are two unique words preceding it ('dax' and 'lug').
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" because the unique words before 'walm' are 'lug', 'bluf', 'dax', and 'zup', corresponding to the colors blue, blue, green, and yellow respectively. 'Walm' repeats the color yellow three times as there are three unique words before it ('bluf', 'dax', 'zup'). The final 'lug' is not considered for 'walm' as it is not repeated immediately before 'walm'.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue"" since the unique words preceding 'walm' are 'zup' and 'wif', which correspond to yellow and red. 'Walm' repeats the color red three times, and the final 'lug' adds a blue at the end.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the unique word(s) immediately preceding 'walm' (excluding 'walm' itself and additional instances of the immediately preceding word), the number of times equivalent to the count of unique words present before 'walm'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" seems to act as a modifier or a duplicator for the following color term, effectively doubling the presence of the color term that comes immediately after ""lug."" For example, when ""lug bluf"" occurs, the output is ""blue blue,"" which is the color blue repeated twice, mirroring the duplication suggested by ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""lug"" -> duplication of the following color term in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each unique word seems to consistently translate to a specific color. The word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". The presence of ""zup"" introduces the color ""yellow"", suggesting ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
Taking into consideration the examples provided:

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Input: wif
Output: red

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, it's reasonable to deduce the following rule:

wif -> meaning. Meaning is the color red.

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the output is ""red"".
Based on the examples provided:

Input 1: ""lug zup bluf dax"" maps to ""blue yellow yellow green""
Input 2: ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
Input 3: ""dax walm zup"" maps to ""green green green yellow""
Input 4: ""zup wif bluf zup"" maps to ""yellow red red yellow""
Input 5: ""zup wif walm"" maps to ""yellow red red red""

From these examples, it is clear that ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided:

1. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf -> Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
2. Input: zup wif bluf zup -> Output: yellow red red yellow
3. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue
4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
5. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue

From the given examples, we can see that the word ""bluf"" appears once in each input, and the corresponding output always includes the color ""red."" However, it is not just ""red"" alone; it is always followed by another ""red."" Thus, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to two consecutive instances of the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> red red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of colors. Each instance of ""walm"" follows a word, and the output is a color repeated three times. Additionally, the color that is repeated is consistent with the word that appears before ""walm"":

- ""dax"" before ""walm"" corresponds with ""green green green""
- ""wif"" before ""walm"" corresponds with ""red red red""
- ""zup"" before ""walm"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow yellow""

In the fourth example, two different words (""wif"" and ""zup"") follow the word ""walm,"" each associated with their respective colors ""red"" and ""yellow."" The word ""lug"" does not have a prior association, but based on the context, it likely corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""

Thus, ""walm"" functions as an indicator to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Reviewing the given examples and correlating the inputs with their respective outputs, we can try to derive the meaning or rule for ""dax"":

- In the first example, ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow"". The unique word here is ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"".
- The second example, ""lug dax"", translates to ""blue green"". The position of ""dax"" has not changed its corresponding output, it is still ""green"".
- The third example, ""dax walm zup lug"", gives ""green green green yellow blue"". ""Dax"" still corresponds to ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif lug dax"", results in ""red blue green"". Again, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"".
- The fifth example is ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" with the output ""yellow yellow red green blue"". Here, ""dax"" maintains its green association.

Based on these patterns, it is consistent that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of the word's position in the input list or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples given, it's possible to deduce that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Looking at the constant occurrences, the word ""wif"" always appears in the input and ""red"" always appears first in the output, regardless of what other words are present. This suggests a strong correlation between the word ""wif"" and the color ""red.""

Here are the observed correlations:
- Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green.""

Since ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence, the rule is as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the output. Other words in the inputs such as ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax,"" correspond to the colors blue, red, and green, respectively.

Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is: the color word that follows 'bluf' should be replaced by the color that corresponds to 'bluf' itself, which is 'red'. When 'bluf' is followed by a word that represents a color it is repeated twice to represent the color that corresponds to 'bluf'.

Rule:
- If 'bluf' is followed by a word corresponding to a color, the output is 'red' repeated as many times as the color indicated by the following word (e.g., ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow"" because 'lug' represents 'blue' and should be replaced with 'red' twice).
- If 'bluf' is not followed by anything, it simply translates to 'red red'.
- If 'bluf' is followed by a non-color word, there's not enough information to define what the output should be (as indicated by the lack of examples for this scenario).
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word 'walm' is associated with repeating the color corresponding to the word that precedes 'walm' three times. Here's the apparent rule according to each example:

- In ""zup walm"", 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""zup walm wif"", 'wif' corresponds to 'red', so after three yellows, 'red' is added.
- In ""lug walm dax"", 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', so the output is ""blue blue blue"" followed by 'dax' which corresponds to 'green'.
- In ""dax lug walm"", 'lug' again corresponds to 'blue' even though it follows 'dax' as 'walm' repeats the color of the preceding word three times.
- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and it seems 'bluf' is another nonce word that I will assume corresponds to 'blue' due to the pattern of its usage.

Rule: walm repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word three times in the output sequence.

Therefore:

walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax zup wif walm
    ",Output: yellow green yellow red red red,yellow green yellow red red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given inputs and outputs, we can induce that ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green."" In the sequence of words, each output color corresponds to the position of the word in the input. Here are the observed mappings:

- ""dax"" always results in ""green.""
- ""lug"" seems to result in ""blue"" (as seen in example 2 and example 3).
- ""walm"" results in ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug"" (example 2) but ""green"" when following ""dax"" (example 4).
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" (as seen in example 3).
- ""wif"" and ""bluf"" result in ""red"" (as seen in example 5).

Since ""dax"" is the only word we wish to define, the rule inferred from the examples is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, it seems like the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each of the other words (""walm"", ""dax"", ""lug"", ""zup"", ""bluf"") maps to a unique color (""red"", ""green"", ""blue"", ""yellow"", ""yellow"", respectively).

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it in the output. For the first example, ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow,"" where the color blue immediately precedes the ""walm"" and is repeated three times. 

Let's break down each example:

1. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by the repetition of ""blue"" two more times due to the presence of ""walm,"" followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""blue"" two more times, then ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" leads to two more repetitions of ""blue.""

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" results in two more repetitions of ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" results in two more repetitions of ""blue.""

From these patterns, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> causes the color indicated by the previous word to be repeated two additional times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it repeats the preceding color in the output two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif dax lug bluf zup
    ",Output: yellow red green blue red yellow,yellow red green blue blue yellow,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs:

- Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. 

- The appearance of ""dax"" in the input does not depend on its position for ""green"" to occur in the output. 

- No other word in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs, suggesting that ""dax"" is uniquely mapped to ""green.""

Given the data, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green

Meaning: When ""dax"" is in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output corresponding to ""dax"".
To deduce the meaning of 'wif', we can analyze the patterns in the input alongside their respective outputs.

1. ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red""
2. ""zup lug wif"" -> ""yellow blue red""
3. ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue""
4. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""
5. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow green yellow green red red""

We notice that:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" We can confirm this because whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output, and similarly for ""dax"" and ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which can be seen as every instance of ""zup"" in the input leads to a ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""wif"" appears in various positions in the input and always results in ""red"" somewhere in the output, regardless of its position. Hence, it corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> ""red""
Based on the given examples, it appears that specific words are associated with specific colors. By analyzing the input and the corresponding output, we can establish the following associations:

- ""wif"" is consistently associated with ""red.""
- ""dax"" is consistently associated with ""green.""
- ""lug"" is consistently associated with ""blue.""
- Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.

There's direct one-to-one mapping between the occurrence of ""zup"" in the input string and ""yellow"" in the output string, regardless of the position or the surrounding words. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow. 

""Zup"" means ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning or the rule for ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns of input and their corresponding outputs:

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green
2. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
3. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
4. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
5. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red

From these patterns, we can make the following observations:

- ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red"" in every instance.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""wif"" (examples 1, 4, and 5).
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it precedes ""wif"" (example 4), but its output changes to ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" (example 2).
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it precedes ""wif"" (example 5), but its output changes to ""yellow"" when it follows ""wif"" (example 3).

The word ""bluf"" appears twice in every input it is part of, and the output colors for ""bluf"" match the colors that correspond to the words immediately preceding them. The logic seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color (output) of the word that directly precedes it. More specifically:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which leads to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also outputs ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs as ""red,"" hence, ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs as ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" continues this pattern, matching the output color of the word directly before it.

Thus, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: bluf -> the output color of ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes it.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" may correspond to a sequence of the same color as the immediately preceding word. Let's evaluate each example to verify this potential rule:

1. zup wif lug zup walm
   - zup -> yellow
   - wif -> red
   - lug -> blue
   - zup -> yellow
   - walm -> yellow yellow yellow (matching the color of the preceding word, ""zup"" -> yellow)

2. wif walm dax
   - wif -> red
   - walm -> red red red (matching the color of the preceding word, ""wif"" -> red)
   - dax -> green
   
3. dax lug walm
   - dax -> green
   - lug -> blue
   - walm -> blue blue blue (matching the color of the preceding word, ""lug"" -> blue)
   
4. dax walm wif walm
   - dax -> green
   - walm -> green green green (matching the color of the preceding word, ""dax"" -> green)
   - wif -> red
   - walm -> red red red (matching the color of the preceding word, ""wif"" -> red)
   
5. wif walm zup
   - wif -> red
   - walm -> red red red (matching the color of the preceding word, ""wif"" -> red)
   - zup -> yellow

In all cases, the sequence produced by ""walm"" contains three instances of the same color, matching the preceding word's associated color. Thus, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: walm -> produces a sequence of three of the same color as the color related to the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. The other words (e.g., ""wif"", ""dax"", ""bluf"", ""zup"", ""walm"") seem to correspond to their own colors, but ""lug"" consistently maps to the same color. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- Each time the word ""dax"" appears alone or as part of a sequence, the color ""green"" is included in the output.
- ""dax"" does not appear to change its output in relation to its position within the input sequence.
- ""dax"" does not appear to influence the output of the other words in the sequences, as the patterns for other words seem consistent regardless of the presence of ""dax"".

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> meaning: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" should be included in the output at the corresponding position.
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the term ""wif"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"". Each instance of ""wif"" adds a ""red"" to the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" has a dependent meaning based on the words that precede it. Here is the rule that I have determined:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" matches the color word that immediately precedes it. If no color word immediately precedes it, the color defaults to ""yellow.""

Thus:

- In ""lug bluf wif,"" since ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""bluf"" also means ""blue.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" since ""wif"" means ""red,"" ""bluf"" also means ""red.""
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" takes the color from ""wif"" because it is the immediately preceding color word, so ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" there is no other color word except ""lug,"" which means ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also means ""blue.""
- In ""dax zup lug zup bluf,"" the word ""zup"" immediately precedes ""bluf"" and denotes the color ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""

Using this rule, we can deduce that:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning depends on the preceding color word. If preceded by ""lug,"" it means ""blue."" If preceded by ""wif,"" it means ""red."" If preceded by ""zup,"" it means ""yellow."" If there is no preceding word, or it's not a color word, the default is ""yellow.""
By examining the different instances where the word ""walm"" appears, we can attempt to deduce its meaning based on the output provided:

1. When ""wif walm"" appears, the output is ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" on its own might correspond to a single ""red"" and ""walm"" adds two more ""red.""
2. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" which could mean that ""dax"" on its own might correspond to a single ""green"" and ""walm"" adds two more ""green.""
3. ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""zup lug"" without ""walm"" might be ""yellow blue,"" and ""walm"" adds two more ""blue.""
4. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" on its own might lead to a single ""blue"" and ""walm"" adds two more ""blue.""

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" adds two more of the color that precedes its mention. Thus, when it follows ""wif"" the color is ""red,"" when it follows ""dax"" the color is ""green,"" and so on. The number of times each color is mentioned can be indicative of the colors associated with the preceding words, and ""walm"" appears to consistently double the output of that color.

Rule: walm -> adds two more of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif dax walm
    ",Output: blue red green green green,blue red green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color blue. In each case where ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. Other words consistently map to other colors. For example, ""dax"" maps to green, and ""wif"" maps to red. 

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the information provided in the examples, each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. It seems that ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green,"" regardless of its position or the other words around it. Thus, we can deduce the meaning or rule as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify any patterns. Here's a breakdown of each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
2. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
3. Input: wif dax lug dax
   Output: red green blue green
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue
5. Input: zup wif lug wif
   Output: yellow red blue red

From the given examples, we see that every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Let's verify this:

- In example 1, ""wif"" is alone and the output is ""red.""
- In example 2, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""bluf"" — the output for ""wif"" is again ""red,"" aligning with its position between ""green"" (the output for ""dax"") and ""red"" (the output for ""bluf"").
- In example 3, 4, and 5, regardless of the other nonce words around ""wif,"" every time ""wif"" is present, the output ""red"" appears in the equivalent position.

Thus, the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: wif -> red. The meaning of ""wif"" is the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

- Each occurrence of ""zup"" translates into the word ""yellow"" in the output.
- The other parts of the input seem to translate consistently to the same colors: wif -> red, dax -> green, walm -> red, lug -> blue, bluf -> green.
- It does not appear that the position of ""zup"" within the string affects its translation, as it consistently results in ""yellow"" regardless of placement.

Given these observations, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the input-output pairs:

1. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
2. ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" -> ""green green red yellow blue""
3. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
4. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
5. ""wif zup dax bluf"" -> ""red yellow green green""

Looking at the input-output pairs, ""bluf"" always results in a color that was previously mentioned:

1. ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and outputs ""yellow"", which corresponds to ""zup"".
2. ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and outputs ""green"", which corresponds to ""dax"".
3. ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and outputs ""red"", which corresponds to ""wif"".
4. ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and outputs ""yellow"", which repeats the color for ""zup"".
5. ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and outputs ""green"", which is the color for ""dax"".

From these observations, we can conclude that ""bluf"" represents the action of repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine how it affects the output in each of the given examples.

Example 1:
Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Example 2:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Example 3:
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Example 4:
Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

Example 5:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

From the examples, we can notice that ""lug"" consistently leads to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" consistently leads to ""yellow,"" except when it immediately follows ""walm."" When ""wif"" appears by itself, it leads to ""red,"" but when it follows ""walm"" it does not output ""red.""

By looking at example 1 and 4, we can see that in the presence of ""walm,"" whatever color word (""zup"" or ""lug"") precedes ""walm"" repeats its color output three times, and ""wif"" generates an extra ""red"" at the end. ""Walm"" doesn't seem to create an output by itself, but modifies the output of the preceding word and the following ""wif.""

Given this, we can propose the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be outputted three times, and if ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" then an additional ""red"" is outputted after the three repeated colors.

Hence: walm -> causes the preceding word's color to be repeated three times, and ""wif"" to output an additional red if it comes after ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue."" In every instance where ""lug"" is mentioned, the output corresponds with the word ""blue."" There does not appear to be any variation contingent upon the context or position of ""lug"" in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" is consistent and unchanging throughout the examples.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to analyze the patterns of the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: dax
Output: green

Here we see that ""dax"" by itself results in the output ""green."" This singular occurrence does not provide enough context to establish a robust rule, but it suggests that ""dax"" might correspond to ""green.""

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

In this instance, the presence of ""wif"" after ""dax"" results in ""green red."" This could suggest that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Similarly to the previous input-output pair, ""lug"" following after ""dax"" yields ""green blue."" This implies that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

With ""walm"" after ""dax,"" we get ""green green green."" The triplicate nature of the output suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the preceding color or specifically indicates ""green"" repeated three times.

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

This pattern is particularly informative because it's the first time we see ""dax"" not at the beginning. ""wif"" results in ""red,"" which is consistent with our earlier assumption from the ""dax wif"" input. ""bluf"" after ""dax"" leads to an additional ""green,"" suggesting ""bluf"" either triggers a repetition of ""green"" or is ignored. We don't have enough examples to determine the exact role of ""bluf"" here.

From these examples, we can induce that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" The presence of ""dax"" seems to guarantee a ""green"" at the beginning of the output color sequence, while the words that follow contribute other colors or effects to the sequence based on their respective meanings.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". The presence of the word ""wif"" in an input string results in the word ""red"" being part of the output string at the corresponding position of ""wif"" in the input.

Here is how the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"" in each example:

Input: ""wif zup"" -> Output: ""red yellow""
""Wif"" appears first, and ""red"" is the first word in the output.

Input: ""wif"" -> Output: ""red""
""Wif"" is the only word in the input, and ""red"" is the only word in the output.

Input: ""zup lug zup lug wif"" -> Output: ""yellow blue yellow blue red""
""Wif"" appears last, after ""zup lug zup lug,"" and ""red"" is the last word in the output.

Input: ""lug wif lug"" -> Output: ""blue red blue""
""Wif"" is sandwiched between two ""lug"" words, just as ""red"" is sandwiched between two ""blue"" words in the output.

Input: ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
""Wif"" appears twice, and ""red"" also appears twice in the corresponding positions in the output.

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the presented data, one can induce the following:

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red

Here, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'bluf' seems to correspond to 'red'.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

In this case, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and 'bluf' to 'yellow' again.

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red

Here 'dax' once again corresponds to 'green', 'bluf' to 'green' as it follows 'dax', 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red'.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Here, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'bluf' comes after 'wif' and also corresponds to 'red'.

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'walm' has no prior correspondence but results in 'blue', 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'bluf' comes after 'wif' and also maps to 'red'.

Rule:

From the examples, it seems that 'bluf' takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color of the immediate preceding word.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to influence the output by repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. Here's how the rule applies to each provided example:

1. ""dax walm zup walm"":
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) three times
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

2. ""lug walm"":
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue) three times
   Output: blue blue blue

3. ""wif dax zup walm"":
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

4. ""zup wif walm"":
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red) three times
   Output: yellow red red red

5. ""wif walm lug bluf"":
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red) three times
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" does not have any associated color provided
   Output: red red red blue blue (the ""blue blue"" after ""bluf"" cannot be explained by the currently detected pattern)

Based on the above analysis, the rule for ""walm"" can be summarized as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" when used after another word, causes the output to be the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times.

So:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color linked to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When the word ""lug"" is used in the examples, it corresponds to the color blue.
To determine the rule or meaning associated with the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the provided examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green

2. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red

4. Input: dax
   Output: green

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- Every instance of ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- The words that follow ""dax"" correspond to different colors.
- Each word following ""dax"" seems to consistently map to a specific color.
- The words ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup"" have been used in different combinations and consistently map to the colors green, blue, red, green, and yellow, respectively.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rules:

- ""dax"" maps to the color green.
- Other words that follow ""dax"" represent different colors as follows:
  - walm -> green
  - lug -> blue
  - wif -> red
  - bluf -> green
  - zup -> yellow

Given the consistent mapping in all examples, we can define ""dax"" as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color green, and subsequent words represent different colors mapped in a consistent way when following ""dax.""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's first analyze the pattern of input colors and output colors where ""wif"" is used:

1. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
2. ""zup lug wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow blue red green blue""
3. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
4. ""zup wif bluf zup"" -> ""yellow red red yellow""
5. ""dax wif zup dax"" -> ""green red yellow green""

From the examples, it appears that the output color associated with ""wif"" is always ""red,"" regardless of the surrounding words. It follows the previous colors without altering the sequence. Here are the sequences with ""wif"" isolated:

- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (same as example 3)
- ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""

As the color ""red"" consistently appears after ""wif"" and does not depend on its context, it seems that ""wif"" is translated directly to ""red"" in this set of examples.

Rule: wif -> red
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to look at the outputs where ""zup"" is mentioned and find the consistent pattern.

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: zup wif dax
Output: yellow red green

In all the output examples where ""zup"" is included, ""yellow"" is consistently produced in the output. No matter the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the presence of other words, the output for ""zup"" remains constant.

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is translated into the color that precedes it. Here's the breakdown of the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug dax bluf"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green"". Since ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which is green, the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"".
- In the second example ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""walm"" also translates to ""green"". Noting that ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- The third example ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" also shows that ""bluf"" takes the color ""red"" from the preceding ""wif"".
- The fourth example ""wif bluf"" has no other colors besides ""red"" for ""wif"", hence ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf zup"", ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""bluf"" follows it, resulting in ""bluf"" translating to ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> the color of the previous word. If ""bluf"" is the second word, it takes the color of the first word. If ""bluf"" is the first word, no pattern can be established based on the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - ""walm"" here results in two additional ""green"" before the pattern changes.

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""walm"" results in ""red blue"" following the ""red red"" pattern before it.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" here results in continuation of ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""walm"" causes continuation of ""red"" before a pattern change due to ""dax.""

5. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   - ""walm"" causes continuation of ""blue"" before a pattern change due to ""wif.""

Based on these observations of how ""walm"" affects the sequence of colors, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color indicated by the word that precedes it in the sequence. Moreover, it repeats the preceding color as many times as the number of letters in ""walm"" (which is 4 times) before any change in the pattern occurs due to subsequent words.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the preceding color four times before any subsequent pattern change.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each of the provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following mappings between words and colors:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> green (this can be inferred since ""walm"" at the end of the last example results in an additional green)

Each example has a direct correlation between the input words and the output colors. ""Dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Here is the evidence for this conclusion:

- In every instance where the word ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- The word ""wif"" does not translate to multiple different colors; it is always associated with ""red.""
- The position of ""wif"" in the input does not change its associated color in the output; regardless of its positioning, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Given this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be consistent across all instances. In each example, when the word ""zup"" is used, the output is ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""yellow."" This can be inferred from the consistent replacement of the word ""bluf"" with the word ""yellow"" in the output. Additionally, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the given examples:

1. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
2. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. wif walm -> red red red
5. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Several patterns can be noted:

- When ""walm"" is present in the sequence, the output word before it is repeated once if it's the first occurrence of ""walm"" (e.g., ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"").
- For subsequent occurrences of ""walm,"" the output word before it is repeated for the number of times ""walm"" has appeared so far (e.g., ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" after the last ""zup"" because it's the first ""walm"" and should thus be repeated once).
- The color before ""walm"" does not change even if ""walm"" appears after a different input word (e.g., ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue"" and ""wif walm"" -> ""red red"", the repeated color matches the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"").

The rule appears to be:
Rule: When “walm” appears, it causes the preceding color in the output to be repeated based on the number of times ""walm"" has appeared in the sequence so far, counting the current instance.

Using this rule, we can determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" as follows: 

walm -> repeat the previous color output the number of times ""walm"" has occurred in the sequence counting the current instance.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm lug
    ",Output: red red red blue,red red red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided input and output pairs, we can deduce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"":

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the words around it, the output always includes ""green"" at the corresponding position. Thus, the meaning of ""dax"" in these examples is the color green. 

This is supported by the following correspondences:

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue yellow red red green  
Input: dax wif zup dax -> Output: green red yellow green  
Input: dax -> Output: green  
Input: dax bluf lug wif -> Output: green green blue red  
Input: zup dax walm lug wif -> Output: yellow green green green blue red  

In each case, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it, whenever ""wif"" is given as input, the output consistently includes the word ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" will be included in the output at the corresponding position.
By observing the patterns between the inputs and the outputs, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup."" Let's go through the examples:

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
The word ""zup"" triggers the change from ""green"" to ""yellow,"" and it is followed by repeat occurrences of the prior word (""walm""), which maintains the ""yellow"" color.

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
The word ""zup"" follows ""dax"" and precedes another ""dax,"" leading to ""yellow"" between two ""green"" outputs. So ""zup"" causes a change in the color pattern but does not necessarily result in repeat occurrences of ""green.""

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
In this sequence, ""zup"" is at the end and follows a repeat of ""walm."" It transitions the output from ""red"" to ""yellow,"" similar to the transition seen in the first example.

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue
Here, ""zup"" is in the beginning and the output is ""yellow."" It is followed by different words (""dax"" and ""lug""), each corresponding to different colors (""green"" and ""blue"").

Input: zup
Output: yellow
""Zup"" on its own results in ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be quite simple: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" It does not seem to affect the color associated with words that come after it, so it acts independently of context.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the Input and Output in each example.

From the first example:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

The output seems to correspond to the input with ""zup"" producing ""yellow yellow,"" ""bluf"" producing ""red red,"" and ""wif"" also producing ""red."" However, the word ""walm"" does not have a direct representation in the output, which might suggest its representation is redundant due to previous word(s) or that it doesn't change the output.

From the second and third examples:
- ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red""
- ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow""

Here, ""bluf"" results in a repeated color adjective of the color preceding it. ""wif"" gives ""red"" and ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" and following each with ""bluf"" results in a doubling of the respective color adjective.

From the fourth example:
- ""lug bluf"" yields ""blue blue""

This reinforces that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of a color that precedes it. ""lug"" introduces ""blue"" and ""bluf"" generates ""blue blue.""

From the fifth example:
- ""wif bluf dax"" yields ""red red green""

Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" which gives ""green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" doesn't have an effect on what follows it, but rather on what precedes it.

Putting this all together, ""bluf"" appears to cause the repetition of the color adjective corresponding to the word that precedes it. The color does not seem to be inherently linked to ""bluf"" but rather to the context provided by the previous word. 

Rule: bluf -> Causes the repetition of the color word that precedes it.
Observing the provided examples:

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

We can see that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" in the input correlates with a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it in the output. 

Specifically:

- When preceded by ""lug,"" ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""blue.""
- When preceded by ""dax,"" ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""green.""

It also seems that the repetition count is consistent; ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color word exactly three times.

Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Analyzing the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" and its pattern of use:

Example 1:
Input: dax
Output: green

Example 2:
Input: dax lug wif lug
Output: green blue red blue
In this example, ""lug"" appears twice and is translated to ""blue"" both times. ""Wif"" translates to ""red."" Since ""dax"" is first and isolated, it still translates to ""green.""

Example 3:
Input: dax
Output: green
Again ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green,"" which is consistent with previous examples.

Example 4:
Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green
""lug"" at the beginning translates to ""blue,"" as in Example 2. ""Wif"" again translates to ""red"". ""Bluf"" translates to ""green,"" but it is followed by ""wif,"" which affects the previous word, ""bluf,"" but ""dax"" still translates to ""green"" both times, whether before or after ""bluf.""

Example 5:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
In this example, ""walm"" looks like a nonce word, and it translates to ""green."" Since ""dax"" preceded ""walm"" and the output is green for both words, there is an indication that ""dax"" possibly maintains its meaning regardless of the following word.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""dax"":

Rule:
dax -> green

""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or surrounding words.
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" Each example shows a consistent pattern where ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Here are the given examples to support this rule induction:

1. ""zup wif lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red blue.""
2. ""lug dax zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""blue green yellow green red.""
3. ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red.""
4. ""zup dax lug zup"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue yellow.""
5. ""wif zup dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow green.""

We can see that regardless of its position in the input, ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
bluf -> meaning. Meaning: to repeat the color that precedes the word ""bluf"".

Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by a color word, the output is that color word repeated. If ""bluf"" is the first word, the preceding color is imagined based on the subsequent examples.

- In ""lug bluf dax lug"" -> ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" requires ""blue"" to be repeated.
- In ""zup bluf"" -> ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" requires ""yellow"" to be repeated.
- In ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""bluf"" requires ""red"" to be repeated.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Repeated:
   Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

From the examples, we notice that:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the color that it outputs seems to repeat multiple times. For instance:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green,"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times; this pattern is confirmed by the repeated example.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and the output after ""blue"" shows ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In example 4, ""walm"" again follows ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and the output after ""green blue"" is ""blue"" repeated three times.

It appears that ""walm"" causes the color that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output. Now let's state the rule looking at the specific position where ""walm"" appears:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it translates into the color associated with the word immediately preceding it being repeated three times in the output. 

So, given this pattern, the meaning of ""walm"" can be stated as:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
By comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""lug.""

In the first example, ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green."" In the third example, which is identical to the first, the output is also ""blue green,"" thus consistently associating ""lug dax"" with ""blue green.""

However, the second example ""zup lug wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue red green blue,"" where ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" since it appears twice and is followed by ""blue"" both times in the output. The word ""dax"" is also consistent, appearing after ""lug"" and corresponding to ""green.""

In the fourth example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue.""

In the fifth example, ""zup wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red blue green,"" where again ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" and ""dax"" by ""green.""

Based on the provided examples, we can extract the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue

Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we need to examine its placement and the corresponding output colors in each given example. The examples provided show the inputs and their corresponding outputs which are colors.

From the examples provided:

1. Whenever ""zup"" is encountered, the output is ""yellow.""
2. Whenever ""lug"" is encountered, the output is ""blue.""
3. Whenever ""walm"" is encountered, the output is always ""blue.""
4. Whenever ""wif"" is encountered, the output is ""red.""
5. ""bluf"" seems to consistently map to ""yellow.""

Looking at the use of ""dax,"" it appears before different words in the examples: 
- In example 1, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""green.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"" again, and the output is again ""green.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" this time, with the output still ""green.""
- In example 4, ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" and the output is ""green"" while ""bluf"" itself is followed by a ""yellow.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" precedes and is followed by ""lug,"" with both instances of ""dax"" giving ""green.""

From examining the positions where ""dax"" appears and the corresponding outputs, we can induce that ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green,"" regardless of what comes before or after it in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no example that contradicts this relationship. Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. There are no exceptions to this in the provided examples, and the relationship appears to be direct and consistent, regardless of the position of the word ""zup"" within the input string.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". To confirm this, we can look at each example:

- ""wif dax zup bluf"" output is ""red green yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""yellow.""
- ""zup bluf dax"" output is ""yellow yellow green."" The positions of ""zup"" and ""bluf"" have been switched with ""dax,"" yet ""zup"" and ""bluf"" still map to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to green.
- ""zup bluf wif"" output is ""yellow yellow red."" Again, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" also leads to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- ""dax zup bluf"" output is ""green yellow yellow."" Once more, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow.""
- ""dax zup lug bluf"" output is ""green yellow blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and finally, ""bluf"" is ""blue."" However, this example diverges from the previous rule, but considering that ""bluf"" has consistently been associated with ""yellow"" in all prior examples, we can deduce that the repeated ""blue"" in the output is likely an error or a special condition not yet explained. Without additional context or examples, we will assume ""bluf"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""

Based on the consistent mapping in the examples (except for the potential anomaly in the last example), we can deduce the rule:

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in the output being a repetition of the last color word's corresponding color. To illustrate:

- ""zup dax walm"" -> ""yellow green green green"": The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"": Here, ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
- ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red"": Here, ""walm"" repeats the color ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
- ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red"": Again, ""walm"" repeats the color ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": In this case, ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the corresponding color of the last mentioned color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" can be translated to ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words, ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern for the position of the word ""zup"" and its corresponding output in terms of colors. Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

1. **Input**: zup wif
   **Output**: yellow red
   - ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"". The output directly after ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

2. **Input**: zup lug walm wif dax
   **Output**: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"", ""walm"", and ""wif"" which corresponds to the colors ""blue blue blue"" before the already known ""red"" for ""wif"". The output for ""dax"" is ""green"". The output directly after ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

3. **Input**: dax bluf wif zup wif
   **Output**: green green red yellow red
   - ""zup"" occurs after ""wif"" and the subsequent output is ""yellow"" before another ""red"" for ""wif"".

4. **Input**: lug zup dax lug
   **Output**: blue yellow green blue
   - Here, ""zup"" is sandwiched between ""lug"" and ""dax"". The output directly after ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

5. **Input**: dax walm zup walm
   **Output**: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" comes after ""walm"" and before another ""walm"". The output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

From the above examples, we can deduce that the occurrence of ""zup"" consistently results in the color ""yellow"" as the immediate next output in the sequence, regardless of which words it comes before or after. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Considering the given examples and corresponding outputs:

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Rule:

There seems to be a pattern where the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it in the input, or repeats the color associated with that word in the output.

- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow, therefore the output for ""bluf"" is yellow.
- In the second and fourth inputs, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to red, hence ""bluf"" outputs red.
- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, leading ""bluf"" to output green.
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" giving a yellow output, and the pattern is consistent when later ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is red as expected from the association of ""wif"" with red.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> meaning: The color output for ""bluf"" is the same as the color output for the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to take on the color value of the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence. This can be confirmed by evaluating each instance where ""walm"" appears:

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" which is translated to ""blue."" Hence, ""walm"" also translates to ""blue.""

- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" translating to ""yellow,"" which means ""walm"" also means ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" making ""walm"" also ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" again means ""yellow.""

- In the last example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue,"" which implies ""walm"" has taken on the color value of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

Based on the rule induction from these examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is that it represents the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: walm -> The color of the word immediately before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug walm zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue blue yellow blue,yellow blue blue blue yellow blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

- Whenever the word ""lug"" appears alone or in combination with other words, the output is always ""blue"".
- The word ""lug"" does not depend on the position in the sequence to give the output ""blue"", as it outputs ""blue"" whether it appears at the start, in the middle, or at the end of a sequence.
- The output does not change with the recurrence of the word ""lug""; it consistently corresponds to ""blue"".

Combining these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the presence of other words in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, when ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the words that surround it, ""green"" consistently shows up in the output sequence.

Therefore, the rule induced from the examples is:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position of ""dax"" in the input.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at each example to see where ""wif"" appears and what word follows it in the output:

1. Whenever ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red.""
   - wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
   - Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. When ""wif"" is the last word in the sequence, the output is still ""red.""
   - lug walm wif -> blue blue red
   - Despite ""wif"" being at the end, the color that follows is ""red.""

3. ""Wif"" being surrounded by different words doesn't change the association.
   - dax zup wif zup -> green yellow red yellow
   - ""Wif"" is preceded by different colors, yet the output following ""wif"" is always ""red.""

4. Even when ""wif"" comes after a word repeated earlier, the associated color remains consistent.
   - lug wif -> blue red
   - ""Wif"" follows ""lug,"" and the output color is still ""red.""

5. The position of ""wif"" in the sequence affects neither its associated color nor the surrounding colors.
   - dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
   - Regardless of its position, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.

Based on these examples, ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red."" Each instance of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds with ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is: bluf -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. Each instance of ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color generated by the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Below is a breakdown of the pattern:

- Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"", Output: ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"".
  ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"". The first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats the color ""red"" two more times. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and then ""zup"" before the next ""walm"" is ""yellow"". The next ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two times.

- Input: ""lug walm"", Output: ""blue blue blue"".
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats this color twice.

- Input: ""lug wif walm"", Output: ""blue red red red"".
  ""lug"" gives ""blue"", ""wif"" gives ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.

- Input: ""zup dax walm"", Output: ""yellow green green green"".
  ""zup"" gives ""yellow"", ""dax"" gives ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

- Input: ""wif walm dax"", Output: ""red red red green"".
  ""wif"" gives ""red"" and the ""walm"" that follows repeats ""red"" two times. ""dax"" gives ""green"".

So, the rule seems to be:
walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word representing a color, the output will be the color corresponding to the preceding word repeated three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax wif
    ",Output: green yellow green red,green yellow green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The meaning of ""lug"" is the color ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the Output. Here is the mapping of the inputs to the output colors:

1. ""zup wif zup dax"" -> ""yellow red yellow green""
2. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
3. ""dax wif zup"" -> ""green red yellow""
4. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
5. ""dax"" -> ""green""

From these examples, each instance of the word ""dax"" maps to the word ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. No other context seems to affect this mapping.

Hence, the rule is:
dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. In each provided example, regardless of the other words present, ""wif"" always results in the output ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following:

- When ""zup"" occurs alone, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is combined with other words, each word has a consistent corresponding color output. ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

Given these observations, we can induce that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"". 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the same color as the word immediately preceding it. Here are the deductions from the examples given:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it, which is ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" reinforcing the pattern that ""bluf"" assumes the color of the preceding word, which in this case is ""blue.""
- The third example is a repetition of the first, providing further confirmation.
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red,"" where ""bluf"" again mirrors the color of the word before it, ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- The fifth example, ""zup wif bluf,"" translates to ""yellow red red,"" where yet again ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it, in this instance ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-coded word, the output is the color associated with that word repeated three times. 

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", so when ""walm"" follows ""lug"" it causes the color blue to be outputted three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", so when ""walm"" follows ""zup"" it causes the color yellow to be outputted three times.
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"", which includes the repetition of yellow after ""zup"" and blue after ""lug"" when followed by ""walm"", consistent with the rule.
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", so when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" it causes the color green to be outputted three times. 

Thus, ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word right before it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax walm lug
    ",Output: blue green green green blue,blue green green green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" I'll correlate the input where ""dax"" appears with the respective output. I notice that each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue  
Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green  
Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow  
Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow  
Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green

In each of the outputs, there is a ""green"" for every ""dax"" in the input. This indicates that ""dax"" is directly related to the color ""green,"" regardless of other words present.

Thus, the rule can be stated as: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow. Every time 'zup' appears in the input, the word 'yellow' appears in the output.
Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" appears to translate to the color ""green."" However, when ""bluf"" is preceded by the word that is associated with ""blue"" (lug) or ""yellow"" (zup), the output color for ""bluf"" changes to match the preceding color word. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow"" (here, 'zup' is followed by 'bluf' and the output is ""yellow"" for both 'zup' and 'bluf').
2. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" (here, 'lug' is followed by 'bluf' and the output is ""blue"" for both 'lug' and 'bluf').
3. ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow"" (again, 'zup' precedes 'bluf' and both are ""yellow""; then 'bluf' is followed by 'lug', but no color change for 'bluf' is seen here, possibly due to 'bluf' being a fixed color when not directly preceded by another color word).
4. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" (consistent with above, 'bluf' takes the color ""yellow"" after 'zup').
5. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green green yellow blue red"" (here 'dax' directly precedes 'bluf', and 'dax' translates to ""green"", followed by 'zup' which is ""yellow"" and 'lug' which is ""blue"", confirming that 'bluf' turns into ""green"" when followed by 'dax').

From the information available, it seems that the word ""bluf"" may default to ""green"" but takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it if that word is a color term like ""lug"" or ""zup"". However, if 'bluf' is followed by a color word, it does not change.

So, the rule could be stated as:

Rule: ""bluf"" defaults to ""green"" unless directly preceded by another designated color word, in which case ""bluf"" takes on that color. If ""bluf"" is not directly preceded by a color word, it retains its default color regardless of what follows. 

bluf -> ""green"" (default), or the color of the directly preceding color word
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" causes the output of the color that precedes it to be repeated three times. Let's validate this with the examples:

- Input: wif lug walm
  Output: red blue blue blue
  Rule Validation: ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", and after ""walm"" we get ""blue blue blue"".
  
- Input: zup dax walm
  Output: yellow green green green
  Rule Validation: ""dax"" leads to ""green"", and after ""walm"" we get ""green green green"".
  
- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  Rule Validation: ""dax"" leads to ""green"", and ""walm"" again causes this to be repeated three times. 

- Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
  Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
  Rule Validation: The first ""walm"" repeats ""red"" thrice, and the second ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" thrice which was output by ""zup"".

- Input: dax lug walm
  Output: green blue blue blue
  Rule Validation: ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and leads to ""blue"", followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""blue"" three times.

With this consistent pattern across the examples, we can conclude the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. This is clear since every instance of ""lug"" in the input leads to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, we can write the rule as:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" appears to consistently translate to the color ""green"":

Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green
Input: lug dax walm wif -> Output: blue green green green red
Input: zup dax zup -> Output: yellow green yellow
Input: dax -> Output: green

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
From the examples provided, we can observe the following:

- In the first input, ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue."" ""Dax"" precedes ""zup"" and is represented by ""green"" preceding ""yellow."" ""Zup"" seems to fall between ""green"" and ""blue,"" which is represented by ""lug."" 
- In the second input, ""zup dax wif zup"" becomes ""yellow green red yellow,"" again showing ""zup"" leading to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".
- In the third input, ""lug zup"" is outputted as ""blue yellow."" ""Lug"" is consistent with ""blue"" across examples, and ""zup"" again results in ""yellow.""
- In the fourth input, ""dax walm zup lug"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue."" Here, both ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green,"" and once again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- In the fifth input, ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow."" This is the first time we see ""bluf,"" but ""zup"" maintaining the translation to ""yellow"" seems consistent.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input string or the context of surrounding words. Therefore, we have the following rule:

zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the translation of ""bluf"" seems to be dependent on the context of the words around it. Let's analyze the examples provided:

1. In the first example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. The word ""bluf"" appears between ""wif"" and ""zup"" and translates to red. 

2. In the second example, ""lug zup bluf dax"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green. ""Bluf"" appears between ""zup"" and ""dax"" and translates to yellow.

3. The third example, ""wif bluf lug zup"", has ""wif"" as red, ""lug"" as blue, and ""zup"" as yellow. Here, ""bluf"" appears between ""wif"" and ""lug"" and translates to red.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" appears right after ""zup"" without another term following it, translating to yellow again.

5. The fifth example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"", shows a pattern where ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""zup"" is yellow. ""Bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and it translates to green.

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that appears immediately before it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it assumes the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> The color of the word before bluf.
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"", with the number of repetitions being equal to the number of unique words encountered before ""walm"", starting from the beginning of the input.

Explanation:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and since ""lug"" is the only word before ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated once.

2. In the second example, ""lug wif walm"", both ""lug"" and ""wif"" appear before ""walm"", making a total of two unique words. The word preceding ""walm"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", so ""red"" is repeated twice.

3. In the third example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"", the unique words before ""walm"" are ""wif"", ""zup"", ""lug"", and ""dax"". The word ""zup"" appears twice, but only counts as one unique word. The word preceding ""walm"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"". Since there are four unique words, ""yellow"" is repeated four times.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", the unique words before ""walm"" are ""zup"" and ""lug"". The word ""zup"" appears twice, but as before, we only count unique instances. ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""yellow"" is repeated two times.

5. In the fifth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", the unique words before ""walm"" are ""wif"", ""zup"", ""bluf"", and ""lug"". ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue"". There are four unique words, so ""blue"" is repeated four times. 

So, ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with the previous word based on the count of unique words in the sequence before ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"", with the number of repetitions being equal to the number of unique words encountered before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif zup
    ",Output: yellow red yellow,yellow red yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each unique word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output. By examining the instances where ""dax"" appears and comparing the outputs, you can deduce what ""dax"" means in terms of color.

Let's look at each example:

1. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue green blue""
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" as seen by the repetition of ""lug"" at the end and ""blue"" at the end of the output. The only instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the only instance of ""green"".

2. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
   Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" and ""wif"" follows ""red"".

3. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
   Here, the position of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

4. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
   Once more, ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" and ""lug"" follows ""blue"".

5. ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
   Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" and ""dax"" follows ""green.""

Through these examples, it's clear that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples given:

- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red""
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red""
- ""wif dax zup wif"" translates to ""red green yellow red""
- ""wif zup dax"" translates to ""red yellow green""
- ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red""

From the above examples, it's clear that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is included in the corresponding output.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in a sequence of words, it consistently translates to ""yellow."" Other words in the sequence translate to different colors, such as ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The presence of ""zup"" in any position yields the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence.
From the provided examples, we can see that each word corresponds to a specific color or combination of colors. To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll examine each example where it is used and identify the color or colors it is associated with:

Input 1: zup walm lug wif **bluf**
Output 1: yellow yellow yellow blue **red red**

Input 2: dax **bluf** wif zup lug
Output 2: green **green red** yellow blue

Input 3: dax lug walm dax wif **bluf** dax
Output 3: green blue blue blue green **red red** green

Input 4: zup wif **bluf** zup lug
Output 4: yellow red **red red** yellow blue

Input 5: lug **bluf**
Output 5: blue **blue**

When we compare each instance of ""bluf"" with the associated colors in the output, we notice that ""bluf"" is always associated with ""red red"" in all instances but one. In the exceptional case (Input and Output 5), ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is the same color associated with ""lug.""

Given this exception, in the context of the other words in the sequence, it is not accurate to define ""bluf"" solely as ""red red."" Based on the data, we can speculate that ""bluf"" might take on the color of the word immediately preceding it when there is no preceding word, the default color for ""bluf"" might be ""red red.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> When preceded by another color word, ""bluf"" duplicates that color. When not following any other word, it defaults to ""red red.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" from the examples given, we need to look at the patterns in input and output:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

In all the provided examples, the appearance of ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated color except for the last color following ""walm"". Also, the color corresponds to the first word before ""walm"":

1. ""wif"" corresponds to red, and before ""dax"", there are three reds.
2. ""wif"" corresponds to red, and before ""lug"", there are two reds followed by a different color, blue.
3. ""dax"" corresponds to green, and before ""wif"", there are three greens.
4. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and there's nothing after ""walm"", so there are three yellows.
5. ""wif"" corresponds to red and there's nothing after ""walm"", so there are three reds.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the next word's color to be repeated three times if ""walm"" is in-between two other words. When there is no word after ""walm”, the color of the word before ""walm"" is merely repeated three times.

With this in mind, we can formulate the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times in the output sequence if there is a word after ""walm""; if ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, the color associated with the word before ""walm"" is outputted three times.

Walm -> Triplicates the color associated with the previous word, unless ""walm"" is the last word, in which case that color is merely repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in every example.
Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" appears to translate to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" by looking at how it translates into an output color across each example.

From the first example:
Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Here, both instances of ""zup"" correspond to the color yellow.

From the second example:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

In this case, ""zup"" is at the end and corresponds to yellow.

From the third example, which is an extension of the second example:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

The word ""zup"" still corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" which follows ""zup"" adds additional yellows.

From the fourth example:
Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue

Here, ""zup"" again translates to yellow.

From the fifth example:
Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue

Once more, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.

By examining these examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be deduced as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, but its specific color output is determined by the word that immediately precedes it. The color output is one color ""down the spectrum"" from the color corresponding to that word. Here's the apparent mapping:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color is red (presumably because ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""bluf"" then means green, which follows red in the examples given: Input 1, Input 4, and Input 5).

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is green (since ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""bluf"" then corresponds to the next color, which is yellow, but since ""dax"" is green again, ""bluf"" turns green following it: Input 2).

- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color is blue (presumably because ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""bluf"" follows as green, but there's a repetition in colors, as seen in Input 3 and Input 4, where ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the color green appears more than once in sequence).

Given this pattern, here's the induction rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" means green, but when preceded by another color word, ""bluf"" assumes the color immediately following that of the preceding word on a simplified spectrum loop. The simplified color loop based on the examples is presumed to proceed in the order of red, yellow, green, blue, possibly looping back around after blue.

Thus, the mapping for ""bluf"" could be as follows:

- ""wif bluf"": red green
- ""dax bluf"": green green
- ""lug bluf"": blue green

However, there is a limitation to this rule induction since the outputs for the inputs ""dax zup bluf"" and ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" suggest an anomaly where the output for ""bluf"" appears to directly copy the output associated with the word immediately preceding it, rather than following a strict spectral loop. Without further examples or clarification, this will remain an area of uncertainty in the induced rule.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repeated output of the color immediately preceding ""walm"". Here is the breakdown of the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'walm' is repeated three times as 'blue'.

2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'walm' is repeated three times as 'green'.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Again, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'walm' repeats 'green' three times.

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and 'walm' repeats 'yellow' three times.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'walm' repeats 'red' three times.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> the meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the word immediately before it three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup bluf
    ",Output: green yellow green,green yellow yellow,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following correspondences:

- ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green""
- ""lug"" on its own translates to ""blue""
- In the sequence ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" the word ""bluf"" at the end is then translated to ""yellow"" again, suggesting that it might be equivalent to or a variation of ""zup.""
- ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" indicating that ""lug"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively.
- In the sequence ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax,"" the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since we have already associated ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" the pattern remains consistent.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:
Rule: lug -> blue
In each example, the output is a sequence of color words, and the input is a sequence of non-color words that include the nonce word ""dax."" By comparing the inputs and outputs, you can observe that each non-color word in the input corresponds to a color word in the output. The specific ordering and correlations are as follows:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be a consistent mapping from the nonce word to the color word ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This is evidenced by examples where ""wif"" is a standalone input and the output is ""red,"" and when ""wif"" is included with other nonce words, the instance of ""wif"" always translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. This can be deduced as follows:

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears once and is followed by the word ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" appears twice, and both instances correspond to ""yellow"" in the output.
- The third example shows ""zup"" once and it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- The fourth example contains ""zup"" once at the beginning and the output starts with ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" again matches with ""yellow"" in the output.

This consistent mapping of ""zup"" to ""yellow"" across all examples allows us to conclude that the rule is that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color that is named before the word ""bluf"". Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the color that precedes it is repeated in the output. Looking at the examples:

- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output is ""yellow yellow"". 
- In ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"", ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""green"", hence the output ""green green"" right after ""dax bluf"".
- In ""wif bluf dax walm"", the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", so the output is ""red red"".
- In ""dax bluf wif zup dax"", ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"", which is ""green"", resulting in ""green green"".
- In ""wif zup bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which means ""yellow"", hence ""yellow yellow"" as the output.

Based on this pattern, ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color mentioned right before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"".
Given the sequence of inputs and outputs, it appears that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the prior word. To validate this, let’s examine the examples:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   
   ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""lug"":
   - After ""wif"", ""red"" is repeated two more times.
   - After ""lug"", ""blue"" is repeated two more times.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""walm"" follows ""zup"": ""yellow"" is repeated two more times.
   
3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   
   ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup"":
   - After ""lug"", ""blue"" is repeated two more times.
   - After ""zup"", ""yellow"" is repeated two more times.
   
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
   ""walm"" follows ""lug"": ""blue"" is repeated two more times.
   
5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
   ""walm"" follows ""dax"": ""green"" is repeated two more times.

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated two additional times.

Thus:
walm -> results in the repetition of the previous color word in the sequence two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif
    ",Output: red green red,red green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it's possible to deduce that each nonce word (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""dax"") corresponds to a color word in the output.

Here's the mapping based on the given inputs and outputs:

- zup corresponds to yellow
- wif corresponds to red
- dax corresponds to green
- lug corresponds to blue

Thus, when we see the word ""lug,"" it is translated to the color blue in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it is not possible to deduce an inherent meaning to the nonce word ""dax"" with high certainty, as the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of the context within the input sequence. However, ""dax"" could potentially indicate the color green in these examples. Observing the other words and their outputs might help deduce their meanings, which could potentially impact the meaning of ""dax.""

From the second example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" We can assume that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow."" From the fourth example, ""dax walm zup,"" we see ""green green green yellow."" If ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" is not consistently ""yellow,"" suggesting that the meaning of ""walm"" can change based on its position in the sequence or some other rule not yet determined.

The third example, ""dax lug dax,"" results in ""green blue green."" Here, ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue,"" as ""dax"" is consistently ""green.""

The rules seem to be inconsistent for words other than ""dax."" However, for ""dax"" itself, there is a consistent rule throughout the examples:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the second color that is mentioned before it. For instance, in the first example ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and hence ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red."" Here's the breakdown according to the examples:

Input: wif bluf  
Output: red red  
Explanation: wif corresponds to red, and then bluf matches the previous color mentioned, which is red.

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug  
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue  
Explanation: zup corresponds to yellow, dax to green, and bluf to the color mentioned right before it, which was green; wif is red, and then the second instance of bluf matches the color mentioned before it, which is yellow; lug is blue.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm  
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow  
Explanation: zup corresponds to yellow, bluf to the color right before it, which is yellow; lug is blue, then the next two colors are both yellow.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif  
Output: green green red yellow red  
Explanation: dax corresponds to green, bluf to the color before it, which is green; wif is red, zup is yellow, and the wif that follows is red again.

Input: lug bluf dax bluf  
Output: blue blue green green  
Explanation: lug corresponds to blue, and bluf turns to the color mentioned just before it, which is blue; dax corresponds to green and then bluf becomes the color that precedes it, which in this case is green.

Rule: bluf -> the color word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" changes the color sequence into a repeated color sequence. The color that repeats seems to be the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"". Here's the breakdown according to each input/output pair:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Rule observed: ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with blue, thus the sequence becomes ""blue blue blue"".

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule observed: ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with green, thus the sequence becomes ""green green green"".

3. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   Rule observed: Again, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" resulting in ""green green green"", after which the sequence continues normally with ""zup"" which is yellow.

4. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   Rule observed: ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"", after which the sequence continues normally with ""lug"" which is blue and ""wif"" which is red.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule observed: ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with red, thus the sequence becomes ""red red red"".

Based on the foregoing analysis:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word directly before ""walm"" for the next term(s) until a new word provides a different color.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated for the length that ""walm"" would influence, usually until a different colored word is stated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently correlates with a particular color output. Here is the breakdown of each example:

- Input: lug -> Output: blue
- Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
- Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue
- Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green
- Input: zup lug walm wif dax -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

In each instance where the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. There are no examples of ""lug"" leading to any output other than ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. We can test the consistency of this rule by examining each example:

1. dax lug bluf -> dax translates to ""green,"" lug to ""blue,"" and bluf to ""blue.""
2. wif bluf lug zup -> wif translates to ""red,"" bluf to ""red,"" lug to ""blue,"" and zup to ""yellow."" Notice that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" only because it appears after ""wif,"" which itself translates to ""red.""
3. wif bluf -> wif translates to ""red,"" and bluf, which follows wif, repeats the color ""red"" rather than translating to a new color.
4. lug walm wif lug bluf -> lug translates to ""blue,"" walm does not affect the color before or after, wif translates to ""red,"" the next lug again to ""blue,"" and bluf repeats the color of the previous word 'lug,' hence it's ""blue.""
5. zup lug zup bluf lug -> zup translates to ""yellow,"" lug translates to ""blue,"" and the next zup repeats ""yellow."" Bluf follows another zup and thus repeats ""yellow"" (suggesting bluf could echo the previous color), but when followed by lug, it is ""blue.""

From these observations, we can conclude that the nonce word ""bluf"" adopts the color of the word that precedes it, with the exception of when it follows ""wif,"" in which case it turns ""red."" However, since not all possible scenarios (such as ""bluf"" following ""dax"" or ""walm"") are shown, we cannot conclude with certainty that ""bluf"" only adopts the previous color or turns ""red"" after ""wif"" under every circumstance. Still, based on the given examples, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color of the preceding word unless it follows ""wif,"" in which case it translates to ""red.""
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word

Explanation: In every instance where ""walm"" is used, the output color is a repeat of the color assigned to the previous word. For example:

- ""dax walm zup"" leads to ""green green green,"" where ""walm"" takes the color green from ""dax.""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" yields ""red red green green green,"" where ""walm"" repeats green from ""dax.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" where ""walm"" again repeats the green from ""dax.""
- ""wif walm dax"" gives ""red red red green,"" with ""walm"" taking the red from ""wif.""
- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red,"" where ""walm"" takes on the red from ""wif.""

Thus, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green green,green red yellow green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the input corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
From the provided examples, we can induce a pattern where each word maps to a specific color. The mappings that can be readily inferred from unique words to colors are as follows:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> yellow (inferring this because ""bluf"" yields the same color as ""zup""—yellow—and they are not followed by any other words that would change their output color)

Now, we can analyze the examples containing the nonce word ""dax"" to understand what color it corresponds to.

1. Example: ""dax zup walm wif walm""
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   
   In this string, ""zup"" is clearly yellow, ""wif"" is red, and it seems that ""walm"" is preceded by a yellow, then it turns to yellow; if preceded by a red, it remains red. The word ""dax"" is followed by a green.
   
2. Example: ""zup dax zup""
   Output: yellow green yellow
   
   Here, ""zup"" is still yellow, and ""dax"" is followed by a green.
   
3. Example: ""dax zup bluf""
   Output: green yellow yellow
   
   This echoes the previous examples: ""zup"" and ""bluf"" are yellow, ""dax"" is followed by a green.

4. Example: ""dax lug""
   Output: green blue
   
   ""Lug"" is said to be blue, therefore ""dax"" is followed by green.

5. Example: ""wif zup wif dax""
   Output: red yellow red green
   
   In this sequence, ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is followed by green once again.

Based on these observations, we can determine that the word ""dax"" corresponds to green when it appears in these sequences. It's notable that each occurrence of ""dax"" is directly followed by a green in the output. Since all the other color mappings are consistent with each other, it's reasonable to conclude that ""dax"" maps directly to green, and doesn't depend on the context it's found in.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" It does not seem to depend on its position in the sequence, the words that come before it, or the words that come after it. It is translated to ""red"" each time it appears.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow."" Here are the rules indicating how ""zup"" translates within each given example:

1. ""lug zup wif lug"" translates to ""blue yellow red blue""
2. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red""
3. ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow""
4. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup wif zup"" translates to ""yellow red yellow""

In all cases, irrespective of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words, the word ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned twice in the output. When ""bluf"" is used with another word, the output is the color corresponding to that word repeated twice. Here's the breakdown:

- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green red,"" so ""bluf"" takes the color red from ""lug.""
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" matches the color of ""wif.""
- ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red,"" so ""bluf"" matches the color of ""wif.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red,"" so ""bluf"" matches the color of ""wif.""
- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" matches the color of ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: When followed by ""bluf,"" the output color is the same as the color of the word that precedes ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> The color of the word that comes before ""bluf.""
From the examples given, we can induce the following rule:

- The output consists of a color repeated a number of times that seems to correlate with the position of ""walm"" in the input sentence. Specifically, it appears that ""walm"" results in a color being repeated three times if ""walm"" is the last word, and it gets repeated six times if another instance of ""walm"" follows. We see that ""walm"" is associated with a particular color when it immediately follows another word.

Here are the breakdowns to establish rules:

- Example 1 (""dax walm zup walm"") yields ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"". ""Dax"" correlates to ""green"", and ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"". When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color green is repeated three times, and when ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the color yellow is repeated three times.

- Example 2 (""dax walm"") yields ""green green green"". Again ""dax"" correlates with the color green which is repeated three times because ""walm"" follows it, and there is no subsequent ""walm"".

- Example 3 (""lug wif walm"") yields ""blue red red red"". ""Lug"" correlates to ""blue"" once, and ""wif"" correlates to ""red"", followed by ""walm"" which repeats the color red three times.

- Example 4 (""zup lug walm wif walm"") yields ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"". ""Zup"" gives ""yellow"" once, and ""lug"" gives ""blue"", followed by ""walm"" which repeats the color blue three times. Then ""wif"" gives ""red"", followed by ""walm"" which again repeats the red color three times.

- Example 5 (""dax walm"") is the same as Example 2 and yields ""green green green"".

The rule can be summarized as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times if ""walm"" is at the end or followed by another word. If there is another instance of ""walm"" following the first one, the cycle repeats with the next association.

Therefore:

walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug dax wif walm
    ",Output: red blue green red red red,red blue green red red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the appearance of ""lug"" consistently results in the output of ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" aligns with ""blue"" in the output, independent of the placement of ""lug"" in the input sentence. No other word in the examples provided corresponds to ""blue"" in such a consistent manner. Therefore, we can deduce that:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

1. When ""dax"" is used alone, the output is ""green"".
2. When used in combination with other words, it seems that each distinct word corresponds to a specific color output:
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Therefore, regardless of position or combination with other words, ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green"". 

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently generates the output ""red"" regardless of what other words precede or follow it. Because ""wif"" always results in ""red,"" irrespective of context, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" seems to be as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the color ""red"" is included in the output.
From the provided examples, we can infer a pattern by observing the position of ""zup"" and the color in the output that corresponds to it. Let's break down each example:

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""zup"" occurs first in the sequence and corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""zup"" occurs last in the sequence and corresponds to ""yellow"" again.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- ""zup"" occurs last in the sequence and corresponds to ""yellow"" once more.

Input: dax zup dax zup
Output: green yellow green yellow
- ""zup"" occurs second and fourth in the sequence, and both times it corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: lug dax zup wif
Output: blue green yellow red
- ""zup"" occurs third in the sequence and corresponds to ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, the rule is quite straightforward; regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the position of the word and the corresponding color outputs:

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
3. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
4. wif bluf dax -> red red green
5. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow

By examining the outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" correlates with a color that is dependent on the word that comes just before it:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" (Example 1), ""bluf"" results in green.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" (Example 2 and 3), ""bluf"" results in yellow.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" (Example 4), ""bluf"" results in red.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" (Example 5), ""bluf"" results in yellow as well, but this does not provide enough information to determine if ""lug"" always correlates with yellow or if this is a coincidence due to the presence of ""zup"" afterward. 

Since ""bluf"" does not have a fixed output color but changes depending on the word in front of it, we can infer that ""bluf"" means to take on the color value associated with the preceding word according to some mapping rule.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color associated with the immediately preceding word as follows:
- If preceded by ""dax,"" then bluf means green.
- If preceded by ""zup,"" then bluf means yellow.
- If preceded by ""wif,"" then bluf means red.
- The color associated with ""lug"" is not clearly defined from these examples alone, as there is only one instance and it could be influenced by ""zup"" which always correlates with yellow when followed by ""bluf.""
Rule: walm -> the color that has been repeated just before walm appears.

Explanation:

1. In ""wif lug dax walm"", ""dax"" is said just before ""walm"" and it corresponds to ""green"". Since green is repeated three times after ""walm"", walm means ""green"" in this context.

2. In ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"", ""lug"" is said just before ""walm"" and it corresponds to ""blue"". Since ""blue"" is repeated twice after ""walm"", walm means ""blue"" in this context.

3. In ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" is said just before ""walm"" and it corresponds to ""yellow"". Since ""yellow"" is repeated twice after ""walm"", walm means ""yellow"" in this context.

4. In ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"", ""zup"" is said just before ""walm"" and it corresponds to ""yellow"". Since ""yellow"" is repeated twice after ""walm"", walm means ""yellow"" in this context.

5. In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", ""zup"" is said just before ""walm"" and it corresponds to ""yellow"". Since ""yellow"" is repeated twice after ""walm"", walm means ""yellow"" in this context.

Hence, the usage of the word ""walm"" in each sentence causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word said just before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue yellow blue blue blue,yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given:

- In the first example, 'lug' appears twice and in both instances it corresponds to 'blue' in the output.
- In the second example, 'lug' still corresponds to 'blue' and it follows the pattern established in the first example.
- The third example contains only 'lug' and the output is solely 'blue', reinforcing that 'lug' equates to 'blue'.
- The fourth example has 'lug' sandwiched between 'dax' and 'wif', which respectively output 'green' and 'red', with 'lug' once again corresponding to 'blue'.
- In the fifth example, 'lug' precedes 'walm' and the output for both is 'blue'. It is important to note that 'lug' is not changing its corresponding color based on position or surrounding words. Additionally, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.

Rule: lug -> blue. The word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color 'blue' in the output, regardless of its position or surrounding words.
Given the examples provided:

1. Each occurrence of ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
2. ""lug"" when it appears, consistently maps to ""blue.""
3. ""wif"" when it appears, consistently maps to ""red.""

From the given data, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

Meaning dax corresponds to the color green. Each example reinforces this rule as ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input string.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. In every instance, the word ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red"" in the output.

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" whenever it is used. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
The given examples suggest that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's verify this with each line:

1. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: red red yellow yellow red
   ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"". Both instances of ""bluf"" repeat the color of the preceding word.

2. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", and ""bluf"" repeats the color ""blue"" that ""lug"" represents.
   
3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   Here, the first two words ""zup"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively. The last word is ""bluf"", and the word before it is ""wif"", which correlates with ""red""; thus, ""bluf"" results in the repetition of ""red"".

4. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", followed by ""bluf"", which repeats the color ""blue"". Another ""zup"" gives ""yellow"", followed by ""bluf"", which repeats ""yellow"".

5. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   Again, ""wif"" represents ""red"", followed by ""bluf"", which repeats ""red"". 

To sum up, the rule is that ""bluf"" repeats the color code of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should analyze the given input-output pairs to identify patterns:

1. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
2. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
3. ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
4. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
5. ""dax walm lug"" -> ""green green green blue""

- The word ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently results in the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently results in the color ""blue.""
- The word ""bluf"" is only used once, resulting in the color ""yellow.""

We can observe that whenever ""walm"" is used, it seems to repeat the color of the word that comes just before it. For example, in the first sentence, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the subsequent colors after ""walm"" are ""red red red."" Similarly, in the second sentence, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" corresponding to ""green,"" and the colors after ""walm"" are ""green green."" In the third sentence, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" and then after ""zup,"" both times following the rule of repeating the previous color multiple times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word multiple times. The exact number of repetitions can vary depending on context or other underlying rules not immediately deducible from the provided examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif bluf lug walm dax lug dax
    ",Output: red red blue blue blue blue green blue green,red red blue blue blue green blue green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word 'lug' correlates with the color 'blue'.

- In the first example, ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green,"" with 'dax' likely meaning 'green'.
- In the second example, ""lug wif dax"" corresponds to ""blue red green,"" with 'wif' likely meaning 'red'.
- In the third example, ""lug wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue blue,"" with 'bluf' likely meaning 'blue'.
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue,"" further supporting that 'dax' means 'green' and 'lug' means 'blue'.
- In the fifth example, ""dax lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green blue blue red,"" which again aligns with the meanings deduced above.

Rule:
lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the way it corresponds to the output in each example.

Input: lug walm dax   
Output: blue blue blue green

Input: dax walm   
Output: green green green

Input: zup walm dax lug   
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Input: dax lug wif lug   
Output: green blue red blue

Input: zup lug dax   
Output: yellow blue green

Observations:
1. When ""dax"" follows ""lug walm,"" the corresponding output color is green, while the other colors are blue.
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" all the output colors are green.
3. When ""dax"" follows ""zup walm,"" the output for ""dax"" is still green.
4. When ""dax"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif lug,"" the output for ""dax"" is green.
5. When ""dax"" follows ""zup lug,"" the output for ""dax"" is green.

From these examples, we can see that regardless of what precedes or follows ""dax,"" the output color associated with ""dax"" is consistently green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Let's evaluate each input and its corresponding output to determine the rule.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""wif"" stands for ""red,"" ""bluf"" for another ""red,"" and ""dax"" for ""green.""

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif
Output: red
- ""wif"" on its own still yields ""red.""

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf,"" as seen in the second input, also corresponds to ""red.""

With the above observations, the rule appears to be consistent:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's compare each input with its corresponding output.

Input: wif dax zup dax
Output: red green yellow green

In this sequence, ""zup"" corresponds directly to ""yellow,"" as all other words have a consistent color associated with them.

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Again, ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" coming after ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue

""Zup"" follows ""wif"" (which translates to ""red"") and precedes ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Input: wif zup wif dax
Output: red yellow red green

Here, ""zup"" is between two instances of ""wif"" that translate to ""red"" and itself translates to ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green yellow red

In this example, ""zup"" appears first and corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it also appears between ""walm"" (which translates to ""green"") and ""wif"" (which translates to ""red""), resulting once again in ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" is a rule that repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" the same number of times as there are total unique words before ""bluf."" Therefore, ""bluf"" incites duplication of the color of the word before it, with the quantity of repetitions dependent on the count of unique words before ""bluf.""

For instance:
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and since there is only one unique word (""zup"") before ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated once, resulting in ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and as ""dax"" is the only word before ""bluf,"" ""green"" is repeated once, resulting in ""green green.""
- In ""dax lug bluf,"" there are two unique words before ""bluf"" (""dax"" and ""lug""), so the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) is repeated twice, resulting in ""blue blue.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and as it is the only word before ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated once, resulting in ""red red.""
- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" there are three unique words before ""bluf"" (""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif""), so ""lug"" (blue) is repeated three times, taking into account only the unique words for the count, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf"" as many times as there are unique words before ""bluf.""
From the examples provided, the output pattern indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and subsequent colors seem to depend on the previous word-color pair. The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" there's an extra ""blue"" in the output. Also, when ""walm"" is present without ""lug,"" it results in repetitions of ""green.""

Now let's examine each instance:

1. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" From this, we can deduce that ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in repeating the color ""blue"" that ""lug"" represents.

2. ""dax walm zup lug"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue."" Here, ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in two additional ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in two additional ""green.""

4. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green."" Here again, ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in two additional ""green.""

5. ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" following ""lug"" results in repeating the color ""blue"" two additional times.

From these examples, we can generalize that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it. 
If ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" results in two additional ""green.""
If ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" results in two additional ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the word before it twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

1. Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".
2. ""lug"" appears alone and also in combination with other words.
3. Regardless of its position within a sequence of words or the presence of other words, the output for ""lug"" remains consistent.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the given examples, we can observe that the output colors are related to the input words. Specifically, it seems that each occurrence of the word ""dax"" results in two occurrences of the word ""green"" in the output. Let's look at the patterns to confirm:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". It could mean that ""dax"" translates to ""green green"" and ""walm"" translates to ""green"".
- In the second example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue green blue blue blue"". If we maintain that ""dax"" means ""green green"", then ""lug"" should be ""blue"" and ""walm"" as before translates to ""green"". This fits our initial assumption since ""dax lug"" gives ""green green blue"" and repeating that pattern gives the output correctly.
- The third example, ""dax walm zup lug"", results in ""green green green yellow blue"". Using our previous deductions, ""dax"" gives ""green green"", ""walm"" gives ""green"", and ""lug"" gives ""blue"". Thus, ""zup"" must mean ""yellow"".
- The fourth example, ""lug zup dax lug"", results in ""blue yellow green blue"". This supports the idea that ""dax"" is ""green green"" (only one ""green"" shows up because ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"", which gives ""blue"", cutting off the second ""green"").
- The last example, ""wif dax bluf"" results in ""red green green"", suggests that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" maintains its meaning as ""green green"" since ""bluf"" does not contribute to the output.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: dax -> green green

This means that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to two occurrences of the word ""green"" in the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red"" in the outputs. At every instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" is present at the same position in the output. The other words in the inputs correspond to different colors consistently: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" However, the word ""bluf"" appears only once and also corresponds to ""yellow,"" suggesting that the specific rule for ""bluf"" cannot be conclusively defined with the examples given.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can observe how the word ""bluf"" translates into color in the output in each given context:

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""bluf"" occurs between ""wif"" and ""dax"" and translates to ""red""

Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue
- ""lug"" is introduced and translates to ""blue""
- The position and translation of ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""bluf"" remain consistent with the first example.

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" still translates to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" occurs between ""zup"" and ""lug"" and translates to ""yellow""

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red
- The color translations for ""dax"", ""lug"", ""wif"" remain unchanged
- ""bluf"" occurs after ""wif"" and translates to ""red""

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow
- The positions of ""wif"", ""lug"", and ""zup"" have changed, but their color translations remain consistent
- ""bluf"" occurs after ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow""

By analyzing the color outputs corresponding to ""bluf"" in each example, it's deducible that ""bluf"" does not translate to a fixed color but rather to the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let us analyze the input-output pairs to find the recurring patterns:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
3. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
5. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, it seems that every word has a color associated with it:
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" but is preceded by ""walm"" in each occurrence.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and it appears only once.

In examples (2) and (3), ""walm"" precedes the word ""dax,"" and we have ""red red red green"" in the output, which suggests ""walm"" likely translates to ""red"" because the word after ""walm"" (which is ""dax"") always has the color green after it. This is supported by example (1), where ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" and is followed by ""red.""

However, example (5) presents a challenge since ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which should mean ""walm"" is ""yellow."" But since every other instance of ""walm"" is associated with the color red that precedes a green color, this indicates that ""walm"" doesn't have its own color in the strictest sense but seems to suggest that it adopts the color of the word it precedes, which is ""yellow"" in this case. This is further reinforced by example (4), where ""walm"" is repeated after ""wif"" and before ""zup,"" and each instance of ""walm"" in this sequence is followed by ""red.""

Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the color of the word it immediately follows.

However, since there are not enough examples to cover all possible scenarios (like ""walm"" appearing after different words or at the beginning or end of the sequence), the rule could be incomplete or context-dependent. But with the existing data, the rule seems consistent. Thus:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" takes on the color attributed to the word that comes before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green green red,green red,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" might change its meaning depending on its position or the context in which it is used.

Let's analyze the patterns where ""lug"" appears to understand the rule:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   Observation: ""lug"" appears after ""zup"" and the output is yellow followed by blue. In the second part of the input, without the ""lug"", the ""zup"" corresponds to the yellow output only.

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Observation: ""lug"" at the beginning corresponds to blue, just like ""bluf,"" suggesting it could mean ""blue"" in this context. However, the last ""lug"" also corresponds to blue, which might suggest that when ""lug"" appears at the end, it also means blue.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   Observation: Here ""lug"" appears at the end and corresponds to blue, which aligns with the second observation.

4. Input: lug dax lug
   Output: blue green blue
   Observation: ""lug"" at the beginning and end of the sequence corresponds to blue, further solidifying that at the beginning and end, ""lug"" could mean blue.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Observation: ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" results in blue outputs only.

Based on these observations, it is difficult to establish a single steadfast rule for the meaning of ""lug."" However, one can conclude that ""lug"" will output blue when it is at the beginning or the end of a sequence. When ""lug"" is in the middle, as shown in the first example, it seems to correspond to blue only when it directly follows certain words, possibly ""zup"" in this case, but there's not enough data to form a solid rule for its middle-of-sequence meaning.

Rule: When ""lug"" is at the beginning or end of a sequence, it corresponds to the color blue. When ""lug"" is in the middle of a sequence, its meaning might depend on its preceding word, but we may need more examples to determine the exact rule. For now, it can be observed that it may correspond to blue when placed after ""zup.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems to be consistently associated with the output ""green."" Notwithstanding the positions of ""dax"" in various context or its combination with other words, the output for ""dax"" remains ""green."" 

Therefore, we can deduce:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the word ""red."" Here's a breakdown supporting this conclusion:

1. In example 1, ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""red yellow.""

2. In example 2, the single input ""wif"" results in the single output ""red.""

3. In ""lug wif walm"" (example 3) and ""lug wif dax"" (example 4), ""wif"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue red,"" suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" again to ""red.""

4. For the last example, ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" the only new word is ""wif"" and two new ""red"" colors follow it, reaffirming that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From these examples, it appears that ""wif"" adds ""red"" to the sequence, regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red.
From the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is in the corresponding position in the output. Regardless of what other words are present or their order, ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow."" This suggests that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Based on the presented examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned before ""bluf."" When ""bluf"" appears, we replace it with the color of the word right before it. If it's the first word in the sequence, it defaults to green.

Here's the breakdown:

1. In the sequence ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" so it outputs yellow (the color associated with ""zup"").
2. In the sequence ""dax bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" hence it outputs green (the color associated with ""dax"").
3. In the sequence ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" so it outputs yellow.
4. In the sequence ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" first follows ""lug,"" which outputs blue, and the second ""bluf"" follows the previous ""zup,"" so it outputs yellow.
5. In the sequence ""zup bluf wif lug dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" so it outputs yellow.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, default to green.

Rule: bluf -> color of preceding word (default to green if none).
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to cause repetition of the last color mentioned. Here is the analysis:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated twice more.

2. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - After the first ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated once more.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - After ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated twice more.

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - After ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated twice more.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated twice more.

Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the last mentioned color twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow green yellow yellow yellow,green yellow green yellow yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, lug consistently corresponds to the color blue. Each occurrence of lug in the input results in the word blue in the output, irrespective of its position or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Given the examples provided, it is possible to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""zup lug wif lug"". Notably, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green"", here when it follows ""bluf"", which translates to ""green"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""zup lug zup wif"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is again ""green"" and it follows ""wif"", which translates to ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" again translates to ""green"" when it is followed by ""lug bluf"" (blue blue).

Observing the pattern, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. There are no instances where ""wif"" leads to any other word or color in the output, so we can deduce that the meaning of ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems clear that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In every instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. There are no examples given that suggest any context dependency for the meaning of ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color assigned to the word that precedes it. Let's examine the evidence from the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" outputs another ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is not shown with a direct association but looking at the pattern, ""lug"" could be ""blue."" Following that, ""bluf"" outputs another ""blue.""

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" and ""bluf"" outputs another ""red.""

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" resulting in another ""red"" output.

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" associated with ""yellow,"" producing another yellow output.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning is to duplicate the color of the word that appears just before it.

Therefore: bluf -> Duplicate the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is the rule observed:

- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" with ""dax"" associated with green and then repeated twice more for ""walm.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" is associated with blue and then repeated twice more for ""walm.""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow,"" with ""wif"" associated with red and then repeated twice more for ""walm"" before the sequence continues.
- ""dax walm lug"" outputs ""green green green blue,"" again with ""dax"" associated with green, repeated twice more for ""walm,"" and then following with ""lug,"" which is associated with blue.
- ""zup walm lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" is associated with yellow, repeated twice more for ""walm,"" and then blue for ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax bluf wif lug
    ",Output: blue green green red blue,blue green green red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
From the given examples, it can be inferred that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. 

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" should be included in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence. Other words following ""wif"" denote additional colors unrelated to the meaning of ""wif"" itself. For example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""dax"" when placed between two instances of ""wif"" translates to ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of the word ""zup"" produces the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the other words present. The word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color ""yellow,"" and the word ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

So the rule seems to be: 
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the color of the preceding word. Here is how the rule seems to apply:

- ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- ""lug bluf zup"" results in ""blue blue yellow."" In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""lug,"" which is blue.
- ""zup bluf dax"" results in ""yellow yellow green."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow."" Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Notice that the color corresponding to ""bluf"" is always the same as the color of the word immediately before it. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, walm appears to result in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

- In the first example, 'zup dax lug walm zup', 'walm' follows the word 'lug', which corresponds to the color blue. After 'walm', the color blue is repeated twice.
- In the second example, 'dax walm', 'walm' follows 'dax', which corresponds to green. The output is three instances of the color green, indicating that the color associated with 'dax' is repeated due to 'walm'.
- In the third example, 'dax walm zup lug dax', 'walm' follows 'dax' again, and the output is three instances of the color green.
- The fourth example, 'zup walm', has 'walm' following 'zup', which corresponds to yellow, and the output is three instances of the color yellow.
- Finally, in 'zup bluf wif walm', 'walm' follows 'wif', which has the associated color of red, and the output shows red being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. 'Walm' means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be consistent. In each case, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output. Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output. Here are the breakdowns:

- In ""lug dax,"" ""dax"" results in ""green"" while ""lug"" is likely resulting in ""blue.""
- In ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" ""dax"" yields ""green,"" ""walm"" also yields ""green,"" ""wif"" yields ""red,"" and ""zup"" yields ""yellow.""
- In ""wif zup dax,"" each of the words corresponds to ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green"" respectively.
- In ""dax walm,"" both ""dax"" and ""walm"" yield ""green.""
- In ""dax zup,"" ""dax"" gives ""green"" and ""zup"" gives ""yellow.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" in the output:

- In the first example, every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" follows in the output.
- In the second example, the lone ""wif"" at the beginning leads to a ""red"" at the beginning of the output.
- In the third example, the single occurence of ""wif"" produces a single ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" again is followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red red red"" in the output, which may indicate that the word following ""wif"" also influences the number of ""red""s in the output. However, since ""wif"" in every occurrence leads to at least one ""red"" in the output, it is safe to deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
From the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern for each word:

- Each occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- Each occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- Each occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to a double ""red"" output.

Now, let's focus on the occurrences of ""zup."" We can notice that every time ""zup"" appears, the color outputted is the same as the color assigned to the word that directly follows it. Here are the observations:

1. After ""zup lug"", the output is ""yellow blue"", and ""lug"" aligns with ""blue.""
2. After ""zup walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow,"" and ""walm"" aligns with ""yellow.""
3. After ""zup wif"", the output is ""yellow red,"" and ""wif"" aligns with ""red.""

Therefore, ""zup"" seems to function as a duplicator or repeater for the color assigned to the word that immediately follows it. For instance, if ""zup"" is followed by a word that corresponds to ""red,"" the output will have ""yellow"" preceding that ""red.""

Rule: zup -> Repeat the color associated with the following word, starting with ""yellow.""
Based on the examples given:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green"".
- ""bluf"" alone after ""wif"" also outputs ""red red"".

It appears that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it. Hence, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the color is red (since ""wif"" corresponds to red), and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the color is green (since ""dax"" corresponds to green).

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""wif"", ""bluf"" means red. If the preceding word is ""dax"", ""bluf"" means green.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be related to the color associated with the word that precedes it. The color repeats a number of times equal to the number of letters in the word before ""walm."" 

Examples to deduce the rule:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". The word before walm is ""wif,"" which has three letters, so ""walm"" is ""red"" repeated three times.
   
2. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". The word before walm is ""dax,"" which has three letters, so ""walm"" is ""green"" repeated three times.
   
3. ""lug walm"" (repeated example) translates to ""blue blue blue"". The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which has three letters, so ""walm"" is ""blue"" repeated three times. Since this example is given twice with the same output, it confirms the pattern.
   
4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". The word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which has three letters, so ""walm"" is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

From the examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents a color repetition based on the preceding word. The specific color is determined by the word itself, and the repetition is based on the number of letters in that word.

Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color associated with the preceding word, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of letters in that word.""

For example, if ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""red,"" ""bluf walm"" would mean ""red red red red,"" since ""bluf"" has four letters.

Note that this rule induction is made with the assumption that the nonce word ""walm"" operates consistently across these examples and that each word (e.g., ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug"") has a fixed color associated with it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif dax
    ",Output: yellow red green,yellow red green,True
