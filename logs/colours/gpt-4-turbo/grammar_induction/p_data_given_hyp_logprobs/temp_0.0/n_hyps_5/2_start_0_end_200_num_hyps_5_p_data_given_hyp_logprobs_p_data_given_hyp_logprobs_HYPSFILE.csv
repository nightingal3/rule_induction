"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at the inputs and the corresponding outputs closely.

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

In the first input, we see that the word ""dax"" is directly followed by the word ""wif"" and the output shows ""green"" followed by ""red."" This could imply that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" but we need more examples to confirm.

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow

When ""dax"" appears after ""wif,"" the output for ""dax"" is still ""green."" This reinforces the initial hypothesis that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red

Here, ""dax"" appears near the end, and its output is still ""green,"" further supporting the hypothesis.

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red

Once again, ""dax"" is first in the sequence and the corresponding output is ""green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Finally, ""dax"" appears with ""walm,"" and the entire output string is green, which suggests that ""walm"" also translates to ""green,"" but we consistently see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the correspondence between the input and output in each example.

- In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red."" ""Wif"" maps to ""red"" consistently in other examples and ""bluf"" also maps to ""red"" consistently, suggesting that ""dax"" maps to ""green.""

- In the second example, ""wif dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red green yellow yellow."" We already know ""wif"" and ""bluf"" map to ""red,"" so ""dax"" mapping to ""green"" fits, while ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" corresponds to ""red red blue green red."" Consistently ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" is ""red,"" and in this case, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" leaving ""dax"" to be ""green"" again.

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green blue red red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" and ""bluf"" to ""red,"" reinforcing that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

- In the final example, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green."" We haven't seen ""walm"" in any prior examples, but since ""dax"" consistently correlates with ""green,"" and the output contains all ""green,"" it could be deduced that ""walm"" also correlates with ""green.""

Based on all the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green.",-0.09446129514980486,0,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze each example and look for a pattern.

1. dax wif bluf -> green red red
2. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
3. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
4. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
5. dax walm -> green green green

From the examples:

- Every time ""dax"" appears, the output color is ""green.""
- ""wif"" always produces the output color ""red.""
- ""bluf"" also consistently results in the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" produces the output ""green"" the same as ""dax.""

We can observe that ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green"" in varying contexts, regardless of its position in the input. When ""dax"" appears, no matter what other words are present or their order, the output contains ""green"" at the position matching ""dax."" Furthermore, when ""walm"" appears without ""dax,"" it also results in ""green.""

Using this information, we can induce the rule:

- The position of ""zup"" in the input doesn't change its corresponding output color.

Here are the observed correlations:

- ""lug"" corresponds to blue since every instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red since every instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, but the specific color it corresponds to is influenced by the word that comes before it. Analyzing each sentence and corresponding output:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" output is ""green green yellow,"" here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and outputs ""green.""
2. ""zup bluf"" output is ""yellow yellow,"" here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and also outputs ""yellow.""

5. ""dax lug bluf"" output is ""green blue blue,"" here ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue.""

The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, with the following associations observed:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color is ""blue.""

There is no direct evidence from the examples of what ""bluf"" means when following ""wif"" or ""walm,"" as ""bluf"" does not directly follow these words in any of the examples.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",-0.08247936295209876,0,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" However, in some cases, the output color does not exactly match ""blue,"" but rather seems to be influenced by the preceding word. The color output immediately following ""bluf"" seems to be a color that is a mix or a transition between ""blue"" and the color corresponding to the word right before ""bluf.""

Here are the observed patterns:

1. ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,""
2. ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,""
3. ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,""
4. ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red.""

Now, applying this to the word ""bluf"":

- In ""dax bluf zup,"" the output is ""green green yellow."" Here ""bluf"" appears to be influenced by ""dax"" (which corresponds to green), hence the output is ""green.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" Here ""bluf"" is influenced by ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow), so the output is ""yellow.""
- In ""lug bluf zup lug,"" the output is ""blue blue yellow blue."" Interestingly, here ""bluf"" takes on the color ""blue"" without influence from ""lug.""
- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" the output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" suggesting again that ""bluf"" corresponds to blue, but this sequence does introduce a new word, ""walm,"" with an output of ""red,"" consistent with the red output for ""wif.""
- In ""dax lug bluf,"" the output is ""green blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and takes on the blue color without being influenced.

Considering the consistency of the output colors associated with ""bluf,"" the simplest explanation—the one requiring the least speculation—is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue, and the examples where ""bluf"" seems to take on a different color might be due to an inconsistency or some additional context-dependent rule not obvious from the examples provided.

Rule: bluf -> blue",-0.08771210082445681,0,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to a color which is determined by the word that comes immediately after ""bluf"". Here's how we can determine the rule by looking at each input and its respective output:

1. dax **bluf** zup → green green **yellow**
   - The word after ""bluf"" is ""zup"", and the output is ""yellow"".

2. zup **bluf** → yellow yellow
   - There is no word after ""bluf"", and the output is ""yellow"". This suggests that when ""bluf"" is the last word, the default color is ""yellow"".

3. lug **bluf** zup lug → blue blue **yellow** blue
   - The word after ""bluf"" is ""zup"", and the output is ""yellow"".

4. lug **bluf** wif lug wif walm lug → blue blue **red** blue red red red blue
   - The word after ""bluf"" is ""wif"", and the output is ""red"".

5. dax lug **bluf** → green blue **blue**
   - ""bluf"" is the last word, and since we previously determined that the default color is ""yellow"" when ""bluf"" is the last word, it seems there is an inconsistency here. Unless the presence of ""lug"" before ""bluf"" influences the output, this example does not fit the previously deduced rule.

In order to resolve the inconsistency with the fifth example, let's consider the possibility that the color corresponding to ""bluf"" may be affected by the word that comes before it, as well as the word that comes after it. However, the fifth example does not provide a word after ""bluf"", and we have no other example that shows a word after ""bluf"" when followed by ""lug"". Without more examples, resolving this discrepancy is challenging.

So, with the information we have, the deduced rule will exclude the fifth example:

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately after it if there is one; otherwise, it defaults to ""yellow"". 

There's an inconsistency with example 5 that we cannot resolve with the given information.

bluf -> meaning: The color corresponding to the word after ""bluf"" or the color ""yellow"" if ""bluf"" is the last word (with the exception noted in the fifth example).",-0.17812851087548148,0,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the given examples and analyze the patterns that emerge.

We can see that:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is green.
2. Whenever ""bluf"" is used, the color that follows ""bluf"" is the same as the color of the word that precedes it.
3. The color yellow appears after ""bluf"" when ""zup"" follows ""bluf.""
4. The color blue appears after ""bluf"" when ""lug"" follows ""bluf.""

A plausible rule based on the given information might be that ""bluf"" causes the next word to mimic the color of the word that precedes ""bluf."" However, the first example seems to be an exception since ""zup"" did not mimic ""bluf"" but had its own color, yellow.

To account for all examples consistently, we can consider the following rule:

bluf -> meaning. Rule:
- When ""bluf"" is followed by a new word, ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf.""
- If the word after ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" the output is always yellow, which indicates that ""zup"" might have its own fixed color output (yellow) instead of mimicking the preceding color.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be related to repeating the color of the preceding word with an exception for the word ""zup.""

In summary:
bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf,"" except when followed by ""zup,"" which results in yellow.",-1.1808964115493832,0,bluf

- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" gives ""green green green red blue green green green"", where ""dax"" precedes the first ""walm"" and thus ""green"" is repeated three times, followed by the color for ""wif"", which is red, and the color for ""lug"", which is blue, and then ""green"" is repeated three more times because ""dax"" precedes the second ""walm"".
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", with ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" and thus ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm wif lug"" turns into ""blue blue blue red blue"", with ""lug"" preceding the first ""walm"" resulting in three ""blues"", followed by the color for ""wif"", which is red, and then the color for ""lug"" again, which is blue.
- ""wif walm dax"" translates into ""red red red green"", where ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" so ""red"" is repeated three times, followed by the color for ""dax"", which is green.

- ""zup lug walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue. ""Walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

- In the third example, ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue"", which again presumes ""wif"" is ""red"" because other words keep their color associations from other instances.

2. The color output for ""bluf"" is the second color in the pair generated by the word preceding it.

Let's analyze each example:

- ""lug bluf wif"" outputs ""blue blue red"", so ""bluf"" takes on the color ""blue,"" because ""lug"" generates the pair ""blue blue""

- ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow"", so ""bluf"" takes on the color ""yellow,"" because ""zup"" generates the pair ""yellow yellow""

- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" again, consistent with the pattern

- ""zup dax bluf"" outputs ""yellow green green"", so ""bluf"" is ""green,"" because ""dax"" generates the pair ""green green""

- ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" outputs ""yellow green green yellow green"", so ""bluf"" is ""green"" in this context because it follows ""dax,"" which generates the pair ""green green""

Putting all this together, the rule for what ""bluf"" means is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the second color output from the word immediately before it. If the word before ""bluf"" outputs a pair of the same colors, then ""bluf"" represents that color.

1. Input: wif walm

2. Input: zup wif walm lug

   ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" again (which now outputs ""red"") and results in ""red red red."" In this case, the word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" The presence of ""walm"" here again seems to create a repetition of the color before it.

3. Input: lug dax walm

   ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" (translated to ""yellow"") resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" once more supporting the repetition rule.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax

A noticeable pattern is that the word directly in front of ""walm"" has its color repeated three times in the output.

Example 5: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" gives ""green green green yellow blue green,"" displaying the same pattern of tripling the preceding color, with the rest of the words following their color sequence.

- Input: lug dax walm | Output: blue green green green
- Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Input: dax walm zup lug dax | Output: green green green yellow blue green

Observations:

1. When ""walm"" immediately follows ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax,"" the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to that word (red for ""wif,"" yellow for ""zup,"" green for ""dax"").
2. The number of repetitions of the color seems to be exactly three, irrespective of what follows the ""walm.""
3. The word ""walm"" itself does not correspond to a specific color—it only affects the preceding word.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Meaning: When the input contains the word ""dax,"" the corresponding output is the color ""green.""",-1.894596275365823,4,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we will examine the relationship between the input phrases and the color patterns of the output. Let's break down each example:

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red 
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color associated with the previous word (""green"" in this case)
   - ""wif"" could be a separator or modifier that changes the pattern
   - ""bluf"" might correspond to ""red,"" but given it produces two reds, it may be influenced by ""wif""

2. dax lug wif lug -> green blue red blue 
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" and the color associated with ""lug"" is repeated (""blue"")
   - ""wif"" again seems to introduce a change in the pattern

3. zup wif -> yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

4. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word (yellow)
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

5. wif dax wif -> red green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" introduces ""red"" both times it appears

From these observations, it appears that ""wif"" precedes a change to ""red."" Additionally, ""wif"" may also work similarly to a function that outputs ""red"" regardless of the preceding word, and it could potentially reset the pattern or introduce another instance of ""red"" after the color corresponding to the subsequent word.

Rule: When ""wif"" is present in the input, it modifies the output to include ""red"" immediately after. If ""wif"" appears at the beginning or middle of the phrase, it causes ""red"" to appear before and after the color associated with the subsequent word. If ""wif"" appears at the end of the phrase, it just adds ""red"" to the end of the color pattern. Additionally, ""wif"" seems to reset any repetition pattern established by words like ""walm.""

Therefore:

wif -> meaning: Wif marks the insertion of ""red"" into the output sequence and can also indicate a pattern reset or repeat depending on its position.",-0.11986154781012989,4,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can analyze the patterns in the given inputs and outputs.

Let's first look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
2. dax lug wif lug -> green blue red blue
3. zup wif -> yellow red
4. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
5. wif dax wif -> red green red

From these examples, we can observe that ""wif"" does not correspond to a consistent color output across different instances. ""wif"" seems to interact with the words around it, indicating that its meaning may be context-dependent. Looking closer, we notice the output color that follows ""wif"" is always red. This pattern holds true even when ""wif"" is at the beginning or end of the input string. Hence, we can infer that ""wif"" might act as a marker that indicates the next word (or even itself if it appears consecutively) should be translated as red.

Let's write down the rule based on this observation:

Rule: The word following ""wif"" is always translated as red. If ""wif"" is followed by another ""wif,"" it is also red. 

Thus:

wif -> A context-dependent marker indicating the next word (or itself if no word follows) should be output as ""red"".",-0.1637307853977403,4,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's examine the patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. In all instances where ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output contains at least one red. This suggests a red is directly associated with the presence of ""wif.""

2. When ""wif"" follows or precedes other words, the colors that correspond to those words appear in the pattern before a red occurs. For example:
   - In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" the output is ""green green green red red,"" with ""dax"" and ""walm"" both seemingly corresponding to green before ""wif"" which corresponds to red.
   - In ""dax lug wif lug,"" the output is ""green blue red blue"", with ""dax"" and ""lug"" corresponding to their respective colors before ""wif"" introduces a change with red.
   - ""wif"" alone followed by another word, ""wif dax,"" leads to ""red green,"" where ""dax"" follows the red indicative of ""wif.""

3. ""wif"" seems to interrupt the color sequence with red, no matter the pattern before it. For example, in ""zup walm wif,"" the pattern was ""yellow yellow"" before ""wif,"" and then it turned into ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" signals the end of the repetition and starts a new sequence led by red.

Based on these observations, we can suggest a rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif introduces a sequence break in the pattern and corresponds to the color red. It signifies the end of an ongoing color sequence and transition to a red output.",-0.5725776132102598,4,wif
"Based on the provided examples, wif seems to correlate with the color red in the output. It appears consistently that whenever 'wif' is present in the input, 'red' is present in the corresponding position of the output. 

Below is the reasoning leading to this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds directly to ""red,"" while ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears twice and corresponds to ""red"" each time it appears. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" except in the position following ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""wif"" follows, it corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow,"" and when ""wif"" follows, it corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in both instances it appears, flanking ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
wif -> red",-0.9516340862584419,4,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to observe patterns to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif.""

Here are the observations:

1. Every time ""wif"" appears, the output immediately following it is ""red.""
2. ""wif"" doesn't seem to depend on the word that comes before it, as it is preceded by different words across the examples (""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and can start a sequence as well).
3. The words that appear before ""wif"" do not have a consistent color associated with them and don't affect the color after ""wif.""

So, the examples suggest that ""wif"" signals the color ""red"" in the output regardless of the context it appears in. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Clarification of rule: The word that comes before bluf has a color associated with it (e.g., ""dax"" is associated with green, ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""zup"" is associated with yellow), and the word ""bluf"" indicates that this color should be repeated.

Examples based on the rule:
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""bluf"" means repeat the color.
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""bluf"" means repeat the color.
- ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"" because ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""wif"" has no preceding color association in this context so we assume it's red, and ""bluf"" means repeat the color.
- ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""wif"" assumes the same rule as above, and ""bluf"" means repeat the color.
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""bluf"" means repeat the color.",-0.13974103821761907,4,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the pattern appears to be that the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word. Here are the observed patterns:

- `dax` corresponds to `green`, and when followed by `bluf`, the output is `green green`.
- `lug` corresponds to `blue`, and when followed by `bluf`, the output is `blue blue`.
- When `lug` is followed by `wif` and then `bluf`, `wif` corresponds to `red`, and `bluf` duplicates `red` to result in `blue red red`.
- Similarly, `zup` corresponds to `yellow`, and `wif` corresponds to `red`. When `zup wif` is followed by `bluf`, `bluf` duplicates the `red` color to result in `yellow red red`.

So, the rule that can be deduced is that `bluf` duplicates the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color corresponding to the previous word.",-0.25347036429253966,4,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the preceding word's color to be repeated. In each example, the color associated with the first word is duplicated after ""bluf"" is introduced. For instance:

- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of ""green.""
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of ""blue.""

When ""bluf"" is used after ""wif,"" the color that corresponds to ""wif"" is red, and it is repeated twice according to the output.

It can be concluded from the examples that when ""bluf"" is used after a single word that corresponds to a color, it repeats that color. When used after two words, where ""wif"" is known to correspond to the color red, it causes the color red to be repeated twice.

Therefore, the rule is: ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word or words.

"By examining the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern that indicates the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's analyze each example:

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- Here, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correlate with ""red,"" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""walm"" correlates with additional ""green.""

Input: lug walm

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color output associated with the preceding word.",-0.11031367342175677,4,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to map to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. In the outputs, the color associated with the preceding word repeats three times instead of once. Here is the analysis:

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" maps to ""red red green green green."" Since ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" ""bluf"" is associated with ""red"" again, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and then we have three more ""green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" takes the previous color (""green"" from ""dax"") and repeats it.

- ""lug walm"" maps to ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and then we see three repetitions of ""blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" caused the repetition.

- The repeated example of ""lug walm"" confirms this rule because it again translates to ""blue blue blue.""

- ""wif walm"" maps to ""red red red."" Following the same pattern, since ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" ""walm"" then repeats this color three times.

- ""lug walm zup walm"" maps to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" which is repeated by ""walm,"" while ""zup"" is a new word associated with ""yellow,"" which is also repeated three times by ""walm.""

3. When preceded by ""zup,"" the output is not explicitly given, but based on the pattern of doubled colors, one could infer that ""walm"" might result in ""yellow yellow"" following ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule appears to involve repeating the color associated with the previous word twice when ""walm"" follows it.

In all instances, ""wif"" precedes the word that corresponds to the color red except in the last example where ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to green.

- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" always represents a color switch to ""green"" or from ""green.""
- ""wif"" has a pattern of often switching the color to ""red.""

To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we notice the following pattern associated with ""bluf"":

- In example 4, ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" following ""wif.""
- Example 5 again shows ""bluf"" outputting ""red"" following ""wif.""

If there's no preceder that dictates a color (like ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" or ""dax""), it seems to revert to a default color which cannot be determined from these examples.

- In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue green red red green""; here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

- From example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and the output repeats ""blue"" three times.
- From example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red"" three times.

When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" seems to be repeating the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it (in this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"").

In all of the examples, the word that comes before ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output, and the color that ""bluf"" corresponds to is repeated after it.

Let's test this with the other examples:

- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds with ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated twice (""red red"").
- In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds with ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated twice (""yellow yellow"").
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" as well, and similarly, ""yellow"" is repeated twice.

- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and just like in the first example, the presence of ""walm"" seems to lead to a repetition of ""blue"" three times, followed by ""wif"" and ""bluf"" which give ""red red.""

Input: zup wif dax walm lug | Output: yellow red green green green blue
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Dax"" corresponds to green, and just like in previous examples, the presence of ""walm"" repeats the color of the word prior to it three times. Following this pattern, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- Consistent with previous examples, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

- Starting with ""lug walm,"" we see the repetition of ""blue"" three times. Then we have ""zup"" resulting in ""yellow,"" ""lug"" resulting in ""blue,"" another ""zup"" for ""yellow,"" and finally ""wif"" for ""red.""

"Based on the examples given, we can observe the following:

1. The word ""walm"" appears to translate to multiple instances of a color word.
2. The number of times the color word is repeated corresponds to the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm"".
3. The color that ""walm"" translates to seems to depend on the word that comes before it.

Here's the breakdown:

- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green""; ""dax"" is a three-letter word and the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red""; similarly, ""lug"" is a three-letter word and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"" includes ""dax walm"" which gives us ""green green green"" just like the first input.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""; consistent with the earlier output for ""lug"".
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" shows that the repetition effect applies across different words preceding ""walm"".

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, regardless of its position (""lug"", ""dax lug"", ""lug walm"", ""dax lug walm"", ""dax lug zup""), the output always contains ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" when it precedes ""lug"" leads to ""green"" appearing before ""blue"" (e.g., ""dax lug"" becomes ""green blue"").
- The word ""walm"" after ""lug"" adds extra instances of ""blue"" to the output, proportional to how many times ""walm"" is stated. For example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" and ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue.""
- The word ""zup"" when it follows ""lug"" adds the color ""yellow"" at the end (e.g.,""dax lug zup"" results in ""green blue yellow"").

2. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue : ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" leading to ""red"", followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""red"" and then ""blue"".

Now, we'll apply this rule to each of the examples to check for consistency:

Input: wif zup bluf lug
- Output: red yellow yellow blue (Consistent with wif -> red, zup -> yellow, bluf -> red, and lug -> blue)

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red.",-0.1159973711872368,8,wif
"The input-output pairs suggest that wif is not a static word but rather depends on its position and the context within the sequence. Let's analyze the inputs and their respective outputs to deduce the meaning or rule behind wif:

1. Input: wif lug → Output: red blue
2. Input: wif bluf lug → Output: red red blue
3. Input: dax wif → Output: green red
4. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif → Output: yellow blue red green green red
5. Input: wif zup bluf lug → Output: red yellow yellow blue

From the examples given, we can observe the following patterns:

- When wif is followed by lug, the output always ends in blue.
- When wif is followed by bluf, the output appears to always include red prior to other output elements associated with the following words.
- When wif is preceded by zup, the output shows yellow before the output for wif.
- When wif stands alone after another word (e.g., dax), the output still includes red associated with wif.

Given these observations, the outputs tied to wif are red followed by the output color associated with the word after wif, if there is one. In the case of the word lug being present, blue is consistently the color paired with lug, and following the red presumably associated with wif, it seems that wif is a modifier that adds red.

Therefore, the rule for wif can be deduced as follows:
- When wif is present before another word, it seems to modify the output by adding red in front of the output color associated with the word that follows wif.

Putting this into the specified format:

Rule: wif -> Adds ""red"" to the output, and when followed by another word, it also includes the corresponding output color for that word. If it precedes a word, the output for that word follows the output for wif.",-0.13599836607077628,8,wif

2. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
   Here, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" (""red"") and again is followed by ""lug"" (""blue""). The presence of ""wif"" seems to cause ""bluf"" to change to ""red.""

4. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red
   ""wif"" appears twice. After ""lug"" (""blue""), it outputs ""red,"" and it follows ""bluf"" (""green"") and precedes another ""wif"", also resulting in ""red."" Before ""dax"" (""green""), it translates to ""red"" again.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue
   ""wif"" precedes ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" resulting in ""red yellow"" respectively. ""Bluf"" doesn't turn into ""red"" here, which might imply that ""wif"" only affects the word immediately after it, not subsequent words, unless it follows ""bluf"", in which case ""bluf"" turns into another instance of ""wif"".

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rules:

- When ""wif"" precedes any color word, it translates to ""red.""
- When ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" changes to ""red.""

The examples show that ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" However, the influence on the word ""bluf"" indicates that ""wif"" not only has a standalone meaning but also an interaction effect on the word immediately following it, which might be limited to the word ""bluf"" (as it becomes ""red"" following ""wif"").

With the given data, the most consistent rule we can derive is:

- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

From the analysis of these examples, we can deduce that whenever we see the word ""bluf,"" the color that follows immediately after ""bluf"" in the input matches the color that is placed in the same position as ""bluf"" in the output. For example, in the first input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and in the output, the position corresponding to ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which is the same color ""dax"" corresponds to.

However, when ""bluf"" is at the end of the input sequence, the color that corresponds to ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""bluf"". For example, in the fourth input (""zup bluf""), ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word that immediately follows ""bluf"" in the input.

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" is used, it appears to also correspond to the color of the word that immediately follows it.

From this, we can induce that ""bluf"" is a special word that copies or takes the color value of the next word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the following word. If there is no following word, there is no output for bluf.",-0.9213901071012344,8,bluf
"Based on the provided input-output examples, we can attempt to deduce the rules governing the term ""bluf"" by comparing the context in which it appears and the corresponding output colors.

Here is the analysis:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" This holds true in the first, fourth, and last examples.
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" as seen in the third example.
3. If ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output color is ""blue,"" as in the second and last examples.
4. In isolation, ""bluf"" does not appear by itself without context; hence, we cannot directly infer its color without considering surrounding words.

Considering this, we might deduce that ""bluf"" does not have an inherent color output; rather, it serves as a kind of ""mirror"" or duplicator for the color of the word preceding it. Here's the rule induction based on the observations:

Input: wif walm dax

Comparing the inputs with the outputs, we notice that the word that appears after ""walm"" is always translated to the same color as ""walm."" We can hypothesize that ""walm"" indicates that the following word should be treated as the same as the word before ""walm,"" in terms of the color code.

To formalize:

walm -> the following word should be assigned the same color as the prior word (repeating the color associated with the word just before ""walm"").

Rule: If a word appears after ""walm,"" it is translated to the same color as the word immediately before ""walm.""",-0.07879675765005953,8,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and see how they correlate with the outputs.

First, we focus on sentences with only the word ""walm"" and another word:

- ""wif walm dax"" -> red red green
- ""lug walm dax"" -> blue blue green

In these examples, the word ""walm"" has the same color as the word that appears just before it and differs from the word that comes just after it. This suggests that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color of the previous word, breaking the sequence when a new word with a different associated color is introduced. 

To further confirm:

- ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> green red red red blue yellow
- ""zup walm lug wif"" -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
- ""zup walm lug"" -> yellow yellow yellow blue

In every case, the word ""walm"" caused the color of the word that immediately preceded it to repeat, breaking the sequence when a new word with a different color is encountered.

Now let's define the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to repeat itself until another word with a different color appears. 

Thus, 
walm -> causes the repetition of the color of the previous word until a new color is introduced.",-0.3177240165517857,8,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns that are consistent across all examples.

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Each input corresponds to a unique color in the output, except for ""walm,"" which always has the color of the following word in its output sequence. In every instance, the color associated with ""walm"" is the same as the color of the word that immediately follows it:

- In ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output for both is ""red red.""
- In ""zup walm lug wif,"" ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" and the output for both is ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""wif walm dax,"" ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" and the output for both is ""red red.""

If ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" respectively, and the output for ""walm"" always matches the color of the word that follows it, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color of the following word in the sequence.",-0.6101219954985715,8,walm
"Rule: walm means ""repeat the color of the previous word"". 

In every example, the color that follows ""walm"" is the same as the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- In the first example, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" which is red, so ""walm"" leads to red.
- In the second example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" which is yellow, so ""walm"" leads to yellow.
- In the third example, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" which is red, so ""walm"" leads to red.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" which is yellow, so ""walm"" leads to yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" which is blue, so ""walm"" leads to blue.

- When following ""dax,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to green.
- When following ""wif,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to red.
- When immediately following ""lug,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to blue.

- In the first input, ""bluf"" is the second word, and the second color in the output is ""green.""
- In the second input, ""bluf"" is the last word, and the last color in the output is ""green.""
- In the third input, ""bluf"" is the second word, and the only two colors in the output are ""blue,"" followed by ""blue,"" which is itself inconclusive, as this could also be due to ""lug.""
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" is the fourth word, and the fourth color in the output is ""yellow."" However, this seems to be an error since it would contradict the previous findings—we may assume ""yellow"" is not the intended correlation for ""bluf."" There may be a mistake in this input/output pair. 
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" is the second word, and the second color in the output is ""red,"" which also contradicts the other examples unless additional context is taken into account.

When we filter out the contradictory instances, the strongest consistent link for ""bluf"" is the color ""green."" It is important to note that the fourth example may have an error since ""bluf"" is linked to ""yellow"" instead of ""green"" in the output, and the fifth example connects ""bluf"" to ""red"" in the output.

1. When 'walm' is present in the input, the corresponding output contains a repetition of the color that is associated with the word directly preceding 'walm'.

2. The color repeats as many times as there are characters in the word that immediately precedes 'walm'.

To illustrate this:

- In the first example, ""dax wif walm,"" 'wif' is the word before 'walm' which corresponds to the color 'red'. There are three letters in 'wif', so 'red' is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm,"" 'lug' is the word before 'walm' which corresponds to the color 'blue'. There are three letters in 'lug', so 'blue' is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" we can see that 'walm' follows 'wif', and there are three 'reds' in a row again.

Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red red."" This suggests that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""walm"" also means ""blue,"" and ""wif"" means ""blue,"" while ""bluf"" likely means ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" leads to ""blue red green green green yellow.""

- The fifth example has ""dax"" twice, separated by ""bluf,"" and ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" despite the surrounding words.

1. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   
2. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   
3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

Looking at the examples:

- Every time ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- Every time ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
- ""Bluf"" at the end of the sequence always results in ""yellow,"" regardless of the word that precedes it.

From these observations, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" However, there seems to be some dependency on the word that precedes it:

- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it maintains the color of the preceding word, which is ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it still translates to ""yellow,"" but we also get the color associated with ""dax"" which is ""green.""

The context does not provide enough information to understand what happens when ""bluf"" is preceded by other words such as ""walm"" or ""wif"" since it results in ""red red,"" which deviates from previously identified patterns.

Based on this limited data, the rule might be stated as follows:

Rule: ""Bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or is the last word in the sequence, and maintains the preceding color when placed directly after ""zup."" When following ""dax,"" it also translates to ""yellow"" but retains the color linked to ""dax"" (""green"") before it.

So, bluf -> yellow (with contextual variations as stated in the rule).",-0.09045449289259995,11,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided, I will attempt to deduce the rule or meaning behind the word ""bluf.""

1. In the first example, the sequence ""zup dax bluf"" leads to the output ""yellow green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might represent the color ""green.""

2. In the second example, the sequence ""zup bluf lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and results in ""yellow,"" which is different from the first example. It suggests ""bluf"" might not directly represent the color ""green"" in all cases.

3. The third example, ""zup bluf,"" simplifies to just ""yellow yellow."" This further supports the idea that ""bluf"" might not consistently represent a single color but might somehow be dependent on the word that comes before it.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" again results in ""yellow"" even though it follows different words (""zup"" and ""dax"").

5. The fifth example, ""dax walm wif bluf,"" becomes ""green green green red red."" This is the first time we see the color ""red,"" which follows a sequence including ""bluf,"" indicating that ""bluf"" might relate to the color ""red"" now.

Based on the above analysis, we can infer the following rule:

- ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), it results in ""yellow."" When it follows ""dax"" (green), it results in ""green."" The last example is an exception with two colors being output, green and red, which throws a bit of uncertainty into the inferred rule.

However, considering the exceptions and inconsistencies, especially with the fifth example, there could be additional contextual rules that are not immediately apparent. The rule might be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word, but in case of a new word appearing right before it, like ""wif"" which we don't have a color association for, it defaults to ""red"" as an unspecified case. This possibility needs further examples to validate.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the immediately preceding word or represents the color ""red"" when following an unspecified word.",-0.47496034320117647,11,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word 'bluf' consistently results in the output 'yellow' regardless of its position in the sequence. Each of the other words (zup, dax, lug, walm, wif) is associated with a different color output (yellow, green, blue, green, green) when they precede 'bluf', but 'bluf' itself always translates to 'yellow'. Hence, we derive the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> yellow.",-1.0882981672424707,11,bluf
"Rule: The word bluf seems to be associated with the color yellow. However, the relation is not one-to-one, as other words also map onto yellow, such as ""zup,"" and bluf doesn't exclusively map onto yellow, as seen in the ""dax walm wif bluf"" example where it contributes to two red outputs. It suggests that bluf represents the word yellow in every case except when immediately preceded by a specific sequence of colors (in this case, three greens, as in ""dax walm wif bluf""), which changes its meaning to red.

Bluf -> In general, it means yellow but can change meaning depending on the preceding context words and their corresponding colors.",-1.1463378497011767,11,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the meaning of the word ""bluf"" seems to depend on the preceding word(s). Each example pairs certain words with a specific color: ""zup"" with yellow, ""dax"" with green, and ""lug"" with blue. The word ""bluf"" seems to result in an output where the color of the word preceding ""bluf"" is repeated. The word ""wif"" is paired with red, but appears only once in conjunction with ""bluf,"" and in that instance, ""bluf"" is also followed by red, consistent with the observed rule.

Rule: bluf seems to replicate the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

Thus, if a word x corresponds to a color y, ""x bluf"" would correspond to the sequence ""y y"".

So, bluf -> meaning is that bluf causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word.",-1.2016398639764703,11,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" transforms each preceding word into a series of color words, where each color word is repeated a number of times based on a rule. The color itself is determined by the individual word being transformed:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Further, the repetition of the color word depends on the sequence or order of words. Each instance of the new color word appears to correspond to the position of the original word before ""walm"" in the sequence:

- The first word is transformed into one instance of the corresponding color word.
- The second word is transformed into two instances of the corresponding color word.
- The third word is transformed into three instances of the corresponding color word, and so on.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

When ""walm"" follows any of these words, it repeats that word's associated color three times. With this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

- ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with the color green and has one syllable.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue and has one syllable.
- When there is a sequence of words before ""walm,"" each word's color is repeated according to the syllables in that word.

- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so the output is ""green green green.""

2. Input: wif bluf

   Output: red red green

4. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Looking at the examples, one can notice that every word in the input is mapped to a color in the output. The repeated presence of the word ""bluf"" in each input and the consistency of one color following ""bluf"" in the output suggests that ""bluf"" is directly linked to this color.

From example 1:
- ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup,"" with the output being green for ""dax,"" green for ""bluf,"" and yellow for ""zup."" There is no immediate pattern here as ""bluf"" is between two other colors.

From example 2:
- ""bluf"" stands alone with ""wif"" and both input words translate to red. This could mean ""bluf"" equals red or that it takes the color of the preceding word.

From example 3:
- ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" again, and both are red. It is followed by ""dax,"" which is green.

From example 4:
- ""bluf"" is preceeded by ""lug"" and followed by ""wif,"" with the output being blue for ""lug,"" blue for ""bluf,"" and red for ""wif.""

From example 5:
- In this sequence, ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""bluf"" (blue), then ""wif"" (red), and ""lug"" (blue) again. However, ""walm"" does not appear in any other sequence to deduce its color from the previous examples.

From the available deciphering, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- In examples 2 and 3, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and both are red.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and both are blue.
- Example 1 is the exception where ""bluf"" follows a green ""dax"" but without another example to confirm if ""dax"" should be green or another context rule, we can't conclude a rule for this instance.

Given this pattern, here is the rule:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately before it. If ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which is green), it becomes green. If it follows ""wif"" (which is red) or ""lug"" (which is blue), it takes on red or blue respectively.",-0.08313546265501123,12,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is assigned to the word that immediately precedes it.

Examples to support this rule:

- In ""dax lug bluf wif,"" since ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue (Output: green blue blue red).
- If ""bluf"" is the second word in sequence and the first word is different each time, then ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the first word. This is shown where ""bluf"" yields different colors when following different words.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to represent a color that should be repeated for as many times as the word preceding ""walm"" is replicated in the output. To clarify:

1. In the first example, ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" the word ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and “wif” corresponds to red in the output. ""Walm"" is followed by ""red red red,"" indicating a repetition of three reds.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm,"" the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and “lug” corresponds to blue in the output. ""Walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue"" indicating a repetition of three blues.

3. In the third example, ""dax walm wif walm,"" the word ""dax"" precedes the first ""walm,"" and “dax” corresponds to green in the output. ""Walm"" is followed by ""green green green."" Then, ""wif"" precedes the second ""walm,"" and “wif” corresponds to red. The second ""walm"" is followed by ""red red red,"" indicating a repetition of three reds.

4. In the fourth and fifth examples, we see similar patterns of repetition corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" can be understood as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.",-0.7256749472550548,12,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" has the following meaning:

When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with that preceding word is repeated for ""walm"". For instance, when ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", which outputs ""green"", the output for ""walm"" is also ""green"". Similarly, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and when ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue"" for both ""lug"" and ""walm"".

Let's summarize the observed pattern:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""
- ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that it directly follows

Therefore, the rule is:

"Analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce the following rules based on the input and output pairs:

1. Given that whenever the input contains the word ""dax"" the corresponding output includes ""green"", we can infer that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the output.

2. The word ""dax"" seems to retain its meaning irrespective of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words, suggesting that its translation is context-independent within the provided examples.

Now, let's verify this rule against all examples:

- Example 1: ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> ""yellow green green yellow green"" shows that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" consistently.
- Example 2: ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue"" again ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- Example 3: ""dax"" -> ""green"" further confirms that ""dax"" alone also translates to ""green"".
- Example 4: ""zup dax zup wif"" -> ""yellow green yellow red"" shows that ""dax"" is interpreted as ""green"" between yellow and red, which corresponds to ""zup"" and ""wif"", respectively.
- Example 5: ""lug zup dax lug"" -> ""blue yellow green blue"" again confirms that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" no matter if it's preceded by ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""zup"" or followed by ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug"".

Here's the pattern:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the examples provided and the corresponding outputs.

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup dax walm"" -> ""yellow green green green""
2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
3. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
4. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> ""green green green yellow blue green""

Noticing the pattern, we can see that ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes directly before it:

- In example 1, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" results in green being repeated three times.
- In example 2, ""dax"" is again associated with green, and ""walm"" results in green repeated three times.
- In example 3, ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" results in red being repeated one additional time before ""dax"" switches it to green.
- In example 4, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""walm"" results in yellow being repeated three times.
- In example 5, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" results in green being repeated two additional times before ""zup"" changes the color to yellow.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the preceding color in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated consecutively.",-0.09347536069293333,13,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to infer the meaning of ""walm"" by analyzing the patterns of input and comparing them to the output.

In each case, ""walm"" seems to correspond to multiple outputs of the color green.

Let's examine each case:

1. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - Zup corresponds to yellow, dax to green, and walm seems to add two extra greens.
   
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - Wif corresponds to red, bluf to another red, dax to one green, and again walm seems to add two extra greens.
   
3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - Wif still corresponds to red, dax to green, and walm now corresponds to two reds instead of greens.
   
4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - Wif corresponds to red, dax to green, zup to yellow, and walm seems to add two extra yellows this time instead of greens.
   
5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - Dax corresponds to green, zup to yellow, lug to blue, and walm adds an extra green (but not two as in the first two examples).

When we look at these patterns, it becomes evident that ""walm"" doesn't have a consistent direct translation to a color, but its presence in the sequence appears to add repetitions of colors, although not consistently the same number or color.

The rule is not entirely clear, but we can speculate:

Rule: ""walm"" likely indicates repetition, but the number and color of repetitions are not consistent across these examples. It could depend on the position of ""walm"" in the sequence or the colors that precede it. Given the inconsistency shown in the number of repetitions, a definitive rule cannot be established from these examples alone.

Therefore:

walm -> Rule: Walm appears to cause some level of repetition of a color in the sequence, but the pattern of repetition is inconsistent, suggesting it may be context-dependent.",-0.10505378132182225,13,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the common patterns across the provided examples.

1. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

Looking at the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- The word ""walm"" appears in all inputs.
- The word that immediately precedes ""walm"" (if any) is always transformed to a sequence of the same color in the output.
- The length of that color sequence in the output is one more than the number of times the word preceding ""walm"" occurs in the input prior to ""walm.""

For example:

- In example 1, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and there are three ""green"" outputs following it.
- In example 5, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" again, and since ""dax"" appears twice before ""walm,"" there are three greens after ""dax.""

Using this pattern, we can now deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after another word, it seems to indicate that the color corresponding to the preceding word should be repeated one additional time beyond the occurrences of that word before the ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be described as:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word one extra time.",-0.11818615717466664,13,walm
"Let's analyze the relationship between the input and the output by looking for patterns:

Input: zup dax walm

- The word 'zup' translates to 'yellow'.
- The word 'dax' translates to 'green'.
- Following 'walm', there are three 'green'.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- The word 'wif' translates to 'red'.
- The word 'bluf' has no direct translation however it is between two 'reds' in the output.
- 'dax' translates to 'green'.
- Following 'walm', there are three 'green'.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- 'wif' translates to 'red'.
- Following 'walm', there are two 'red'.
- 'dax' translates to 'green'.

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- 'wif' translates to 'red'.
- 'dax' translates to 'green'.
- 'zup' translates to 'yellow'.
- Following 'walm', there are three 'yellow'.

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
- 'dax' translates to 'green'.
- Following 'walm', there are two 'green'.
- 'zup' translates to 'yellow'.
- 'lug' translates to 'blue'.
- Another 'dax' translates again to 'green'.

From these observations, the rule for 'walm' can be deduced. It appears that 'walm' causes the color word that follows it to repeat three times in the output. When 'walm' is followed by a color word, that color is produced three times in the output. When 'walm' is the last word, as seen in the first two inputs, 'green' is repeated, which is the color associated with 'dax', the color word before 'walm'.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs provided. Here is what we can notice:

1. When ""walm"" follows the word ""dax,"" the output associated with ""walm"" is always ""green.""
2. When ""walm"" comes immediately after ""wif,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""red.""
3. The presence of other words like ""zup,"" ""lug,"" or ""bluf"" before ""walm"" doesn't change the output color for ""walm"" directly, but the colors associated with these words appear to be consistent in their own right: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""bluf"" -> red.

From these observations, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" as a nonce word translates to an output color that depends on the word preceding it. Specifically, the rules seem to be:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green.""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red."" 
- When ""walm"" appears without either of those specific pairs, the word itself outputs one ""green.""

"Observing the given input-output pairs, let's try to understand the pattern associated with the word 'walm' and other words.

1. When we see 'wif walm dax zup', the output is 'red red red green yellow.' In this case, 'walm' is preceded by 'wif' and followed by 'dax'. Both 'wif' and 'dax' color outputs are consistently 'red' and 'green' respectively (as shown in other examples), while 'zup' always results in 'yellow'. The word 'walm' here results in 'red'.

2. The second example, 'dax wif walm lug zup,' results in 'green red red red blue yellow', respectively. Again, 'dax' leads to 'green', 'wif' to 'red', and 'lug' to 'blue', 'zup' to 'yellow'. The 'walm' in this case corresponds to 'red' again.

3. In 'lug walm zup', we get 'blue blue blue yellow'. Here 'lug' and 'zup' again resulting in 'blue' and 'yellow' respectively. 'walm' corresponds to 'blue' this time.

4. 'lug walm' produces 'blue blue blue'. Since every instance starts with 'lug' and is consistently 'blue', 'walm' in this context also results in 'blue'.

5. Finally, 'lug dax walm wif' corresponds to 'blue green green green red', where we know 'lug' is 'blue', 'dax' is 'green', and 'wif' is 'red'. 'walm' results in 'green'.

By examining the pattern, it seems that 'walm' takes on the color of the word that is immediately preceding it. 

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word. If there is no word before 'walm', 'walm' does not have a corresponding color.",-0.09159564670880953,14,walm
"To determine the rule for the nonce word walm, we must compare the input examples and their corresponding outputs. We should look for a pattern that the presence of 'walm' always corresponds to:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

Based on these examples, the rules for the colors seem to be as follows (excluding the rule for 'walm' for now):

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow (always at the end of the output sequence and only occurs when 'zup' is at the end of the input sequence)

Now, let's focus on the word 'walm':

1. When walm is preceded by wif or dax, the word immediately after 'walm' is the same color as the preceding words: wif walm (red red), dax walm (green green).
2. When walm is preceded by lug, all words including and after 'walm' are blue (up until 'zup'): lug walm (blue blue), lug walm zup (blue blue blue yellow).
3. When walm is the final word and is preceded by lug, all words including 'walm' are blue: lug walm (blue blue).
4. When walm follows lug and dax, and is preceded by wif, all words are green except wif, which is red: lug dax walm wif (blue green green green red).

The consistent rule for 'walm' appears to be:

- When 'walm' follows 'lug', whatever the color of 'lug' applies to 'walm' and continues onward until 'zup'.
- When 'walm' follows another color and is not immediately preceded by 'lug', the color of the word immediately before 'walm' applies once more to the word just after 'walm'.
- When 'walm' is preceded by 'lug' and followed by 'wif', 'walm' takes the color of 'lug', but 'wif' reverses back to its default color.

The rule that can be derived could be:

Rule: 'walm' repeats the color of the preceding word unless the preceding word is 'lug', in which case 'walm' continues the color blue for all following words until 'zup' appears or the sequence ends. If 'wif' follows 'lug dax walm', it takes its original color, which is red. 

Therefore, the meaning of 'walm' could be interpreted as:

walm -> meaning: 'walm' propagates the color of the preceding word, or continues the color blue if the preceding word is 'lug', affecting all subsequent words excluding 'zup' and 'wif'.",-0.09813975827435716,14,walm
"Given the examples, we can start deducing a rule for the meaning of ""walm"" by comparing the inputs and their associated outputs.

In every output, we observe that the color blue is associated with the word ""lug,"" while the color green is associated with ""dax,"" and red is associated with ""wif."" The presence of ""zup"" leads to the color yellow at the end of the output sequence, but when ""zup"" is not included, the yellow is also absent. Crucially, we need to determine what impact ""walm"" has on the output.

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
3. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
5. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red

From example 1, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""dax,"" and the output sequence associated with these three words is ""red red red green."" Since ""wif"" correlates with red and ""dax"" correlates with green, we can determine that the presence of ""walm"" here leads to another red.

Example 2 again includes ""walm,"" this time after ""wif"" but before ""lug,"" and the output is ""red red red red."" This suggests that ""walm"" also causes ""lug"" to be associated with red instead of its usual color, blue.

Looking at examples 3 and 4, where ""walm"" follows directly after ""lug,"" the output for ""lug"" is consistently blue, and additional blues follow, one for each occurrence of ""walm."" In these instances, ""walm"" does not seem to change the color associated with ""lug,"" but adds more instances of blue corresponding to its own presence.

Finally, in example 5, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""wif,"" and we observe that ""dax"" and ""walm"" lead to a repeated color, green. But when ""walm"" appears before ""wif,"" ""wif"" is also associated with the same color as ""dax"" and ""walm,"" which is green instead of its usual red.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the word immediately following it to take on the color attribute output of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word following ""walm,"" as in example 4, it simply repeats the color attribute of the preceding word. If this is applied to all of the examples, it accurately accounts for the output sequences provided.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Causes the following word to take on the color attribute of the preceding word, or repeats the attribute of the preceding word if there is no following word.",-0.12798375310649998,14,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to discern the rule that the word ""walm"" is associated with generating the color ""blue"". We can see that every time ""walm"" appears in an input, ""blue"" appears in the output the same number of times. Furthermore, the presence of ""walm"" seems to cause all outputs to be ""blue"" ignoring any other words, as evidenced by the Output for ""lug dax walm wif"" being ""blue"" for each word despite ""lug"", ""dax"", and ""wif"" producing different colors when not in the company of ""walm"".

Here is the observed pattern:

- When ""walm"" is present, all other words in the sequence generate the output ""blue"".
- Without ""walm"", each word seems to have its own associated color (e.g., ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"").

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
walm -> causes all words in the sequence to output the color blue, regardless of their individual associated colors.",-0.9924263684748806,14,walm
"`Walm` seems to induce the rule that repeats the color associated with the previous word.

Similarly, in the second example, `lug` is `red` and `walm` that follows is also `red`. In the third example, `lug` is `blue` and so is `walm`.

2. Input: zup bluf

1. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green

2. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow

5. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax | Output: blue green green red green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

From these examples, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" the output is ""red."" When it follows ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow."" Following this rule, the output color is repeated immediately after ""bluf"", mirroring the color of the word that comes before it.

3. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
4. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
5. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green

Looking at the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can try to find a pattern for ""bluf"" by focusing on the words that come directly after ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red green,"" which is consistent with the first example.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green red,"" which is consistent with the third example.

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that follows it. Thus, the color output for the word immediately after ""bluf"" is always repeated.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

- The third example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" turns into ""green green red yellow red,"" which again is in line with the associations for ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" from previous examples.
- The fourth example includes a new word ""walm,"" giving the output ""green green"" for ""dax"" and ""walm,"" with ""wif"" as ""red."" Since both ""dax"" and ""walm"" result in green, it could mean ""walm"" also represents green or some other rule is at play.

"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns in the input and their corresponding output.

1. In the first example, both instances of ""wif"" yield ""red,"" and ""dax"" after ""bluf"" yields ""green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might cause the word that follows it to result in ""red"" turning into ""green.""

2. The second example only has ""zup bluf"" with an output of ""yellow yellow,"" but it doesn't help much because ""bluf"" doesn't have a word after it in this instance. It's important to note that ""zup"" yields ""yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""dax"" yields ""green"" when it appears after ""bluf,"" ""wif"" before and after ""zup"" gives ""red,"" and ""zup"" gives ""yellow."" This supports the initial observation from example 1 where ""bluf"" affects the word that follows.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" yields ""red,"" and when ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" it yields ""green,"" and ""walm"" yields ""green green."" This suggests that particular words have set colors, and that ""bluf"" may only be affecting the word immediately following it.

5. The fifth example confirms this pattern. ""lug"" yields ""blue,"" ""dax"" yields ""green,"" and when ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" it yields ""green,"" and ""wif"" after ""bluf"" yields ""red.""

From these patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the word that immediately follows it to take on a color different from its usual association. Specifically, ""wif"" turns from ""red"" to ""green"" when it follows ""bluf,"" ""dax"" remains ""green,"" but it's not clear what ""bluf"" would do with ""zup"" or ""lug,"" as they have not been shown to follow ""bluf.""

"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs. We will look for patterns that relate the position or context of ""dax"" with the colors in the output.

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
3. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
4. zup lug zup wif dax -> yellow blue yellow red green
5. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red

Here is what we note from the examples:

- Every time ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""green.""
- ""Dax"" seems to operate independently of its position in the sequence as it always translates to the same output regardless of where it appears or what other words are around it.

None of the other words consistently correspond to ""green"" in the output across the examples, meaning ""dax"" correlates uniquely to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its placement in the input sequence.",-0.10068779899353844,16,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the patterns between the inputs and outputs provided in the examples. Let's review the given data:

1. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
From this example, it appears that ""wif"" relates to ""red"" and ""dax"" relates to ""green.""

2. Input: zup dax walm zup wif | Output: yellow green green green yellow red
""dax"" again corresponds to ""green,"" and the positions of ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm | Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""

4. Input: zup lug zup wif dax | Output: yellow blue yellow red green
""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

5. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif | Output: red red blue green red
""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""lug"" is ""blue"" as in the previous example.

Based on these observations, each input word is assigned a specific color in the output. While other input words relate to specific colors directly (e.g., ""wif"" to ""red""), we see that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in each example, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Using this pattern, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"":

dax -> meaning. Meaning: green. Rule: Regardless of position or surrounding words, ""dax"" always translates to the color ""green.""",-0.10979046722350963,16,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the input-output pairs and see if we can identify any patterns.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Input: zup lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow blue yellow red green

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red

Looking at the outputs, it's clear that each word has a corresponding color. For example, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow."" The outputs immediately following ""dax"" are different colors, and ""dax"" itself seems to cause a shift in the color pattern. However, the color following ""dax"" is not always the same, so the meaning of ""dax"" might depend on the context, or it might signify a change or transition in the pattern. Let's look for a pattern by considering the word that comes right before ""dax"":

1. The word preceding ""dax"" does not determine the color following ""dax,"" as ""bluf"" precedes ""green"" and ""lug"" precedes ""green,"" but ""bluf"" and ""lug"" correspond to different colors.
2. ""Dax"" is never at the beginning or the end of the sequence.
3. ""Dax"" seems to be associated with a transition since the color before and the color after ""dax"" are not the same.
4. There's no clear one-to-one correspondence in terms of ""dax"" and the following color.

A potential rule could be: ""dax"" signifies a change in the color pattern, but without the information for how each non-""dax"" word translates to color (aside from the consistent mappings like ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow""), we cannot determine the exact meaning of ""dax."" However, given that a new sequence often starts after ""dax,"" it may indicate that ""dax"" itself is a pattern reset signal where the sequence of colors begins anew post-""dax.""

Rule: dax -> signifies a pattern reset or transition point within a sequence, influencing the color that follows. The exact color change is not determinable without understanding the rules for the other words in the sequence.",-0.12258841452770189,16,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we'll examine the color patterns in relation to the presence of ""dax"" in the input strings. ""Dax"" is followed by a specific color output in each of these examples, so let's look at the color that follows ""dax"" in each output.

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is also followed by ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" is again followed by ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is once more followed by ""green.""

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" is always followed by the color ""green"" in the output. It appears that the rule is that the word ""dax"" itself corresponds directly to the color ""green.""

"Rule:
Observing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it appears that each instance of ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" translates to a specific color every time it appears. In each instance, regardless of the context or surrounding words, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule regarding the meaning of ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-1.5156151665477116,16,zup

2. Input: ""wif zup bluf"" -> Output: ""red yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates the color before it, which is ""yellow.""

5. Input: ""wif bluf zup"" -> Output: ""red red yellow""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> duplicate the previous color word mentioned in the input.",-0.10069094554460524,16,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it's possible to deduce that the word ""bluf"" generates an output that is a repeated color word of the previous color word in the sequence. Although there isn't an example solely with ""bluf"" to understand its base color, the repetitive nature in the output suggests this behavior. 

For example:
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".
- ""wif zup bluf"" translates to ""red yellow yellow"", where ""bluf"" repeats the color output of ""zup"".
- ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow"", where ""bluf"" repeats the color output of ""wif"".

Therefore the rule seems to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color word of the previous non-""bluf"" word in the sequence.",-0.5918516782772367,16,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" is producing ""yellow"" as its output consistently, regardless of its position within the input. Therefore, the simplest explanation is that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color yellow.

However, there is a pattern where the word preceding ""bluf"" seems to be repeated in the output when ""bluf"" is present. For instance, ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red yellow"" - which suggests that ""bluf"" might cause the color corresponding to the word right before it to repeat in the output.

To detail the rule as requested:

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look closely at the outputs following the appearance of the word ""walm"" in each input. By comparing the inputs with their respective outputs, we can attempt to induce the rule governing the term ""walm.""

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

Here, after ""dax walm,"" we have three greens. After ""wif lug dax walm,"" we find that the pattern restarts with green. 

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

After ""zup walm,"" the output is three yellows.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

After ""wif walm,"" the output is three reds followed by a green.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

After ""dax walm,"" the output is three greens.

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

After ""lug walm,"" the output is three blues followed by a red and then a blue.

In each instance, ""walm"" causes the next three colors to repeat the color associated with the word just before ""walm"". So far, we can observe the pattern that ""walm"" has a repeating effect on the preceding color. The instances preceding ""walm"" with ""dax"" lead to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Notably, there are always three repeated colors following ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the next three outputs to be the same color as the word immediately preceding ""walm.""",-0.08381292606494503,16,walm
"To deduce the meaning or the rule for ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to each input, focusing on when the word ""walm"" is used:

1. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
- ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in ""green green green""
- ""dax"" after ""walm"" results in ""green green green""
- ""walm"" does not seem to be influenced by ""dax""

2. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- There's no instance of ""walm"" proceeding a word. However, ""walm"" following ""zup"" yields three ""yellow""s.

3. wif walm dax -> red red red green
- ""walm"" following ""wif"" yields three ""red""s.

4. dax walm -> green green green
- Again, ""dax"" before ""walm"" leads to ""green green green""

5. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
- ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

When ""walm"" follows a word, repeat the color corresponding to that word three times. The color corresponds to the word that appears immediately before ""walm."" 

- ""dax"" is associated with ""green""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red""

Since there is no direct example of ""walm"" followed by ""zup,"" we cannot conclusively determine the rule in this case, but we can see that the resulting color was ""yellow,"" although it is not repeated three times as with other words before ""walm.""

The one discrepancy is the sequence ""dax zup walm,"" which breaks the apparent rule by having an extra ""yellow"" after ""zup."" This could indicate that ""zup"" has a different effect or there is an additional rule when ""zup"" is involved.

However, with the given information and focusing on ""walm,"" we have the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-0.12392505200973623,16,walm
"To determine the rule for what ""walm"" means, let's examine the colors output in each example with respect to the presence of ""walm"":

1. When ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" is input, the output is ""green green green red blue green green green"". We notice that each time ""dax walm"" appears, it is followed by ""green green green"".

2. For the input ""lug wif dax zup walm"", the sequence ends with ""yellow yellow yellow"". Thus, ""walm"" by itself after ""zup"" results in three yellow outputs.

3. With the input ""wif walm dax"", we have the output ""red red red green"". Once again, the appearance of ""walm"" is followed by a series of three colors identical to the color that precedes ""walm"".

4. Input ""dax walm"" gives an output ""green green green"", which is consistent with the already observed pattern of ""walm"" following ""dax"".

5. For the input ""lug walm wif lug"", the output is ""blue blue blue red blue"". The presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" produces ""blue blue blue"". 

Based on these observations, we see that ""walm"" results in repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. Here is what we can deduce for each nonce word:

- ""dax"" likely corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" likely corresponds to ""red""

Therefore, the rule is:

For instance, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green, is replicated multiple times (three times, to be precise). Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), it results in three instances of blue. The replication count for ""walm"" remains consistent at three times the preceding color.

- ""Dax"" at the beginning of the sequence also translates to ""green.""
- Regardless of ""dax"" position relative to other words, its presence always results in ""green"" in the corresponding output.

2. ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" is directly followed by ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is doubled due to ""bluf,"" giving us ""yellow yellow.""

3. ""zup dax bluf"" results in ""yellow green green."" In this example, ""dax"" must mean ""green,"" and ""bluf"" doubles it to ""green green.""

4. ""lug dax bluf"" results in ""blue green green."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which we have established means ""green."" Therefore, ""bluf"" causes the ""green"" to double.

5. ""dax bluf zup"" results in ""green green yellow."" This supports the rule, even with the position of ""bluf"" after ""dax,"" showing that the doubling effect occurs regardless of its position after ""dax.""

So the rule is:

bluf -> Doubles the color associated with the word that precedes it.",-0.13064269611605717,17,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned immediately before it. If there is no color word before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" defaults to the color yellow. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"" (wif represents red, hence bluf is red)
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (no color before bluf, hence bluf is yellow)
- ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green"" (dax represents green, hence bluf is green)
- ""lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue green green"" (dax represents green, hence bluf is green)
- ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow"" (dax represents green before bluf, hence bluf is green)

So, the rule for ""bluf"": bluf -> the color word preceding it, or yellow by default if no color word precedes it.",-0.17037921507534293,17,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the pattern that emerges from the pairing of the inputs and the outputs:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" is the only word following ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug dax,"" the output is still ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" but is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""green green yellow.""

Considering these examples, the rule seems to be that the meaning of ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word that comes immediately before it, resulting in that color being repeated twice in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding ""bluf"" twice in the output.

"bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

For example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated, resulting in ""yellow yellow."" Similarly, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green."" If ""bluf"" follows another instance of ""bluf,"" which follows a color word, it repeats the same color again, as seen in ""zup wif bluf,"" where ""wif"" must correspond to ""red,"" and thus the sequence outputs ""yellow red red.""",-0.6580206340371427,17,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the consistency of the outputs when the term appears.

1. ""dax walm wif bluf"" generates the output ""green green green red red""
2. ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue""
4. ""zup walm"" again leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""dax walm"" corresponds with ""green green green""

In each of these examples, the word ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color word that precedes it (or the color that corresponds to the word preceding it). For instance, in the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"", implying that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The triple repetition suggests that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the preceding color thrice.

Observing this pattern consistently through all the inputs and outputs provided makes it plausible to deduce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.09713164626625,17,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the output color is determined by the word that precedes 'walm.' Each word that comes before 'walm' corresponds to a specific color, and the number of times that color is repeated in the output matches the number of letters in the word preceding 'walm.' Here is the apparent rule for each example:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and since 'dax' has three letters, the output is 'green' repeated three times.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and 'zup' has three letters, so the output is 'yellow' repeated three times.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and 'lug' has three letters, so the output is 'blue' repeated three times.
- The phrase ""dax walm wif"" includes an additional word 'wif' after 'walm.' Whereas 'dax' and 'walm' together produce three greens, adding 'wif' with three letters causes the output to include two additional reds.

Thus, the rule for 'walm' seems to be that it serves as a placeholder for a color change signal, where the specific color is determined by the preceding word, and the number of repetitions of that color in the output is based on the number of letters in the preceding word. If there is a word following 'walm,' it directly affects the output by adding a color (red in the examples) in the quantity of the number of letters in that following word.

Rule: walm -> 'walm' signals the conversion of the preceding word into a specific color based on a predetermined correspondence, repeating as many times as there are letters in that word.

4. The word ""walm"" by itself does not give an output example, so we cannot determine its meaning in isolation.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word preceding it three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns seen in the provided examples. Each word seems to correspond to a color. By aligning the input and the output, we can try to identify which word corresponds to which color.

Looking at the patterns, ""zup"" occurs in different positions and is paired with different colors. By comparing the inputs with their outputs, we can infer the following:
- In each instance where ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is also in the output.

From the given examples, we can tentatively conclude the following mapping:
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow

Now let's verify this with the examples:

**Example 1:**
Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow
Here, ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" when it appears at the beginning and the end.

**Example 2:**
Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red
Here again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

**Example 3:**
Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
The pattern holds once more, with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow.""

**Example 4:**
Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
In this case, even though ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" we can deduce that since ""dax"" also corresponds to green, ""walm"" most likely intensifies the color mentioned before it rather than having a color of its own. Hence, ""zup"" still means ""yellow.""

**Example 5:**
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Here, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again serves as an intensifier to the colors coming before it rather than signifying its own color.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.057246053086195896,18,zup
"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to be changing based on its position in the sequence or based on the colors represented by the words before and after it. Let's examine the instances of ""zup"" and the corresponding outputs to deduce the rule:

Analyzing the first example, ""zup wif bluf zup"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow,"" where both instances of ""zup"" translate to ""yellow."" In all the other examples, the word ""zup"" is only present once and also translates to ""yellow.""

Therefore, I deduce that ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or surrounding context within these examples.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" influences the color output following a set of rules. It is necessary to analyze the examples to determine the meaning or the rule behind ""zup.""

From the examples provided:

1. zup wif bluf zup => yellow red red yellow
2. lug dax bluf zup lug wif => blue green green yellow blue red
3. lug wif dax zup walm => blue red green yellow yellow yellow
4. lug zup dax walm => blue yellow green green green
5. zup bluf wif walm => yellow yellow red red red

Analyzing the color outputs following the introduction of ""zup"" in the inputs:

- ""zup"" at the beginning and end of the first input result in ""yellow"" at the beginning and end of the output.
- ""zup"" in the middle of the second input results in a ""yellow"" following previous colors (blue green green).
- In the third input, ""zup"" results in the first ""yellow"" and subsequent words result in repeated colors (yellow yellow).
- The fourth input has ""zup"" second, resulting in yellow and causing the next word to produce a color which then repeats (green green green).
- The fifth input has ""zup"" at the beginning, resulting in ""yellow"" and causing ""bluf"" and ""wif"" to output their respective colors twice.

The rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" itself translates to ""yellow,"" and additionally, it causes the next color word to be repeated in the output the number of times equal to the position of ""zup"" in the input.

Therefore, the rule of ""zup"" can be defined as:

Rule: When ""zup"" appears, it outputs ""yellow"" and causes the subsequent color word (not ""zup"") to be repeated based on the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence.

zup -> ""yellow"" and repeat the next color word based on zup's position in the input sequence.",-0.08766393526251548,18,zup
"Observing the patterns in the given examples and how the word ""zup"" influences the output, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"". However, this is not just a straightforward translation, as the word that follows ""zup"" seems to be repeated three times, unless the word is ""zup"" itself, in which case the pattern is yellow red red yellow as seen in the first input.

Here are the rules that can be established based on the examples:

- When ""zup"" is followed by a different word, the color corresponding to that word repeats three times in the output (e.g., ""zup lug"" becomes ""yellow blue blue blue"" as seen in the second input).
- When ""zup"" is followed by itself, it creates the pattern ""yellow red red yellow"" (e.g., ""zup wif bluf zup"" becomes ""yellow red red yellow"" as seen in the first input).
- The word immediately following ""zup"" dictates the color to be repeated, regardless of what the color for ""zup"" is.
- The repetition of the color after ""zup"" only occurs if there is a following word that is not ""zup"". If ""zup"" is the last word or is followed by another ""zup"", this repetition rule does not apply as seen in the first and last input where no word follows the last ""zup"".

Putting this together:

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

The meaning of ""zup"" takes the color yellow, but due to additional context rules, it causes the following word's associated color to repeat three times or adheres to the specific pattern when followed by ""zup"".",-1.3325528436546392,18,zup

Input: dax bluf

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow

Analyzing the occurrences of ""bluf"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. When ""dax"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" influences the first ""green"" in the output and ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""

2. When ""zup"" is before ""bluf,"" the output is two identical colors. ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and since the output mirrors the color both times (yellow yellow), it might indicate that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word directly preceding it.

3. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" it results in an output that includes red, but the next color depends on the following word. In ""wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green green,"" which aligns with our earlier findings that ""dax"" is ""green"" and as stated in point 1, ""bluf"" would then take the color preceding it. Similar reasoning can be applied in the last example.

Given these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color value corresponding to the word directly preceding it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the second word, then it repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color value of the preceding word.",-0.09191634480022857,18,bluf

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow

By comparing these examples, we can try to figure out the rule behind the word ""bluf.""

From 1 and 3, where the word ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green"" regardless of whether another word comes before ""dax."" This suggests that ""dax bluf"" consistently translates to ""green green.""

From 4, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" here might take on the meaning of the previous word, ""zup.""

From 2, even though ""wif"" precedes ""dax bluf,"" the output is not ""red red"" but ""red green green."" This demonstrates that ""wif"" does not influence ""bluf"" the same way that ""zup"" does.

Finally, from 5, we see that ""zup"" is the last word before ""bluf,"" and ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" even when there are other words in front of it, like ""wif lug.""

From these observations, we can generalize that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it. If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green"" because ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and if it follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""

2. wif dax bluf -> red green green
3. dax bluf -> green green
4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
5. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow

Looking at the output colors, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color attributed to the word immediately before it, except when ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", leading to the output ""green"" twice regardless of the word before ""dax"".

- In the first and second examples, ""dax"" is before ""bluf"", and the output is ""green green"".
- In the third example, it is just ""dax bluf,"" and the output follows the same pattern: ""green green"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" directly, and the output is ""yellow yellow"". Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", it would seem ""bluf"" takes on this color.
- Finally, in the fifth example, while ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it's worth noting that ""zup"" is not directly before ""bluf"", yet the output for ""bluf"" is still ""yellow"", matching ""zup"".

Taking this pattern into account:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it unless that word is ""dax"", in which case the output is always ""green"" (duplicated for some reason). If ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" with some other words in between, it still takes on the color ""yellow"" associated with ""zup"". This means there might be a special rule that always associates ""zup"" with ""yellow"" for ""bluf"", even when they are not adjacent.

bluf -> meaning:

When preceded directly by ""dax"": green
When preceded directly by any other word: takes on the color of that word
When ""zup"" appears anywhere before ""bluf"": yellow",-0.10956231189414282,18,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" I will analyze the correlation between the input and output in the provided examples. Here are the observations:

1. In the first and second examples, ""dax bluf"" produces ""green green,"" regardless of whether ""zup"" or ""wif"" precedes it. This suggests that ""dax"" itself triggers the first ""green,"" and ""bluf"" might be responsible for the second ""green.""

2. The third example, which is just ""dax bluf,"" again outputs ""green green,"" reinforcing that ""dax"" is paired with the first ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is responsible for the second ""green.""

3. The fourth example, ""zup bluf,"" outputs ""yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" appears to be paired with ""yellow,"" similarly to how ""dax"" is paired with ""green."" This also strongly suggests that ""bluf"" adapts to the color of the preceding word, in this case, turning ""yellow"" as well.

4. In the last example, ""wif lug zup bluf"" outputs ""red blue yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" again with ""yellow."" The final ""yellow"" seems to match the color of the word right before ""bluf"" again, which is ""zup.""

Based on these observations, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" outputs a color that matches the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

Applying this rule, we get:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is that it outputs the color associated with the preceding word. If there is no word before it (which is not exemplified), there's not enough information to define what it would output by itself.",-0.31490827774371427,18,bluf
"Observing the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" represents a color that can change based upon the word that comes immediately before it. The color output changes with different preceding words (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or the absence thereof). For example, when ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color is ""yellow""; when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red,"" and so on.

However, when no word precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" on its own defaults to ""green.""

Here's the rule I deduced from the example:

- ""dax bluf"" emits ""green green,"" indicating ""dax"" could result in ""green"" and ""bluf"" on its own also results in ""green.""
- ""zup bluf"" emits ""yellow yellow,"" indicating ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it if it's ""zup.""
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" emits ""red blue yellow yellow,"" here ""bluf"" again takes on the color of the word preceding it, ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
  
Therefore, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it (if there is one). If ""bluf"" is not preceded by another word, then it defaults to ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word before it; default is green if no word precedes it.",-0.38950595171214303,18,bluf
"walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" when following another word dictates that the output should repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. Examining the specific instances:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" is related to yellow.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which would suggest that ""wif"" is associated with red.
- ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green,"" showing that ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug wif"" leads to ""blue red,"" where ""lug"" is a new word and could be associated with blue, but there is no repetition, which indicates that the repetition of color is specifically linked to the use of ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the word right before it to be repeated three times in the output. 

Rule: walm -> Causes the color related to the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-0.5829708182906976,18,walm

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word walm generates a sequence of color outputs that matches the color output of the word immediately preceding it. Here’s the breakdown of the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Since ""zup"" alone was not previously given, we cannot confirm its output color but we can infer that ""walm"" repeats whatever color ""zup"" represents multiple times, which in this case is presumed to be yellow.
  
- In the second example, ""dax wif walm"" correlates to ""green red red red"". Here we see that ""dax"" is green and ""wif"" is red, followed by ""walm"" which results in the repetition of ""wif""'s color output three times, indicating ""walm"" is repeating the red output.
  
- The third example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" This provides more insight as ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to blue being repeated two more times, then ""zup"" is seen followed by ""lug"" as yellow and blue respectively, with ""wif"" as red. It confirms ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

- The fourth example is ""zup lug walm wif dax"" resulting in ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" Again, we see that after ""lug,"" which is blue, comes ""walm,"" which results in a repetition of blue two more times, confirming the rule of repetition.

- The fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" gives us ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" is green, followed by ""walm"" which repeats the green output twice. Then ""zup"" presumed yellow, ""lug"" blue, followed by ""walm"" which repeats the blue output twice.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color output of the preceding word multiple times.",-0.08367602908863832,19,walm
"Observing the examples, we can establish a rule where the word ""walm"" coincides with a repeated color in the output. Specifically, the color seems to repeat the same number of times as the placement of ""walm"" in the input sequence. Here's the pattern:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": Here, ""walm"" comes second after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

2. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red"": Here, ""walm"" is the third word, and ""red"" is repeated three times in the output.

3. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"": In this example, ""walm"" is the second word and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red green"": ""walm"" is the third word, so ""blue"" is repeated three times.

5. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"": Here, ""walm"" appears both as the second and the last (fifth) word. The second placement results in ""green"" three times, while for the fifth placement, it's not apparent since the sequence ends.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that the color word preceding it is repeated a number of times that is one more than the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. However, we must acknowledge that this pattern may be influenced by the possible rules governing other nonce words in the examples, yet with the given examples, this is the observable rule for ""walm"".

2. Input: ""dax wif walm""

We can make the following observations regarding the use of ""walm"":

- Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output presents a repeated color that corresponds to the color of the word preceding ""walm."" 
- The number of repetitions matches the number of letters in the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated as many times as there are letters in that preceding word.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word for as many letters as are in that word.",-0.09647395317914893,19,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will look at the correlation between the locations of ""walm"" in the input and the repeated color words in the output.

- In the first input, ""walm"" corresponds to three occurrences of ""yellow"" in the output.

- In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is associated with four occurrences of ""red"" in the output.

- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes a pattern of ""zup lug,"" which in the output corresponds to ""blue blue blue."" 

- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""wif dax,"" which in the output corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""

- In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes a pattern including ""zup lug walm,"" which in the output corresponds to ""green green green"" and then ""blue blue blue.""

Taking into account the position and what words ""walm"" follows, it seems ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" The repeated color is output three times if ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" four times if it follows ""wif,"" and if it follows ""lug"" or ""dax"", it is three times as well.

Here's the rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word a set number of times. The number of repetitions and the specific color depend on the word that comes directly before ""walm.""

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
Analysis: ""bluf"" corresponds to a green, which is the same as the color associated with the word right before it, ""dax"".

From these examples, a possible rule could be that ""bluf"" represents the same color as the word immediately preceding it.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the input and corresponding output sequences.

From the first example:
- Input: zup wif walm
- Output: yellow red red red

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""Walm"" is followed by two additional reds.

From the second example:
- Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

We can pinpoint other words' meanings by their repetition. ""Zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" In this sequence, after ""walm,"" there are two more yellows before the pattern diverges with ""dax.""

From the third example:
- Input: zup dax walm lug wif
- Output: yellow green green green blue red

Again, we can identify ""zup"" as yellow, ""dax"" as green, ""lug"" as blue, and ""wif"" as red. After ""walm,"" we notice three greens in the output, which is a repetition of the color that precedes ""walm.""

From the fourth example:
- Input: wif lug dax walm
- Output: red blue green green green

Here, green repeats three times after ""walm,"" which aligns with ""dax"" being green. 

From the fifth example:
- Input: lug zup walm lug
- Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

In this instance, it's the same case: ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that precedes it, i.e., yellow.

Combining the observations from all examples, ""walm"" appears to cause the next color word (or the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence) to repeat three additional times.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color to repeat three times.",-0.0718443904235417,20,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color green to be repeated in the output for as long as ""walm"" occurs in the input sequence.

Breaking down the first example:

- Input: ""zup wif walm""
- Output: ""yellow red red red""

Here, ""walm"" is followed by three reds, but there's no instance to understand the repetition rule.

Looking at subsequent examples:

- Input: ""zup walm dax zup dax wif""
- Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""

Here, ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" and the output is ""yellow green"". Since ""zup"" is yellow and ""dax"" follows ""walm"" with a green output, it suggests that ""walm"" causes the next color to repeat.

- Input: ""zup dax walm lug wif""
- Output: ""yellow green green green blue red""

In this case, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""lug"", and the green repeats three times before ""lug"" turns to blue. This indicates that ""walm"" affects the preceding color.

- Input: ""wif lug dax walm""
- Output: ""red blue green green green""

Similarly, ""walm"" causes green to repeat three times, affecting the preceding color (""dax"" leads to a green output).

- Input: ""lug zup walm lug""
- Output: ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""

In the final example, ""walm"" again causes the preceding color to repeat—yellow in this instance.

Walm -> meaning. Rule: When ""walm"" appears, it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated in sequence until a new word appears.",-0.07985982597468748,20,walm
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the provided examples very closely:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
2. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
3. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow green green green blue red""
4. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green""
5. ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""

We know the following:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Now looking at the instances where ""walm"" appears in each sequence:

1. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and three ""red"" repeat.
2. ""walm"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and ""dax,"" yielding two instances of ""yellow"" before it and ""green"" after it.
3. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.
4. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" again and ""green"" is repeated three times.
5. ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and following it we have two instances of ""yellow.""

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions is either three or, in the second example, follows the pattern of the colors around it (repeating the color preceding ""walm"" and then continuing the sequence).

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color of the previous word, and the specific output may depend on the contextual sequence of words/colors around ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions or specific output pattern depends on the sequence of words/colors around ""walm.""",-0.08954570053354166,20,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's analyze the output after each instance of ""walm"":

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red 
   (Here, ""walm"" is followed by three reds.)
2. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red 
   (Here, ""walm"" is followed by three yellows and one green.)
3. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red 
   (Here, ""walm"" is followed by three greens and one blue.)
4. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green 
   (Here, ""walm"" is followed by three greens.)
5. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue 
   (Here, ""walm"" is followed by three yellows.)

The pattern we can discern is that ""walm"" causes the next word to be repeated three times in the output, with the color that corresponds to the input word. For example, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is three greens, because ""dax"" corresponds to green. Another thing to notice is that after the three repeated colors, there is a color corresponding to the subsequent word.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next word's corresponding color to be repeated three times, followed by the color corresponding to the word that comes after the three repetitions.

Now to consolidate this information into a rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The color that directly succeeds ""bluf"" in the output sequence is repeated as many times as the number of syllables present in the word(s) that directly follow ""bluf"" in the input sequence.

Applying this rule:

- ""dax bluf zup"" results in green green yellow because ""zup"" immediately follows ""bluf"" and has one syllable, so ""green"" is repeated once before moving to ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup.""
- ""wif bluf lug"" results in red red blue because ""lug"" immediately follows ""bluf"" with one syllable, implying a single repetition of ""red"" before ""blue.""
- ""zup bluf"" results in yellow yellow because there is no word after ""bluf,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated once by default.
- ""wif bluf"" also yields red red by the same logic as in the ""zup bluf"" case.
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" produces red yellow yellow blue blue blue because ""lug walm"" immediately follows ""bluf,"" with ""lug"" having one syllable and ""walm"" having one syllable, so ""blue"" is repeated twice, one for each successive word.

2. ""wif bluf lug"" produces ""red red blue"", and ""wif bluf"" produces ""red red"".
3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" produces ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"".

It looks like the ""bluf"" is used to duplicate the color associated with the preceding word, without creating a new color of its own. 

For instance, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green""), the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green"". Similarly, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red""), the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red"".

- When ""dax"" precedes bluf, the output color is ""green"".
- When ""wif"" precedes bluf, the output color is ""red"".
- When ""zup"" precedes bluf, the output color is ""yellow"".
- There is no instance of ""lug"" preceding bluf, but when following bluf it corresponds to ""blue"" (though this might just be a coincidence based on ""lug"" itself rather than its position relative to ""bluf"").

Additional information not given in the examples but induced by the pattern:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word. If the previous word's color is green, yellow, or red, repeat that color for ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is the last word, simply repeat the previous color once more.

Note: The word ""walm"" doesn't have a clear corresponding color. However, there appears to be a rule that words that are not specifically associated with a color have their last letter dropped and then the color output is repeated based on the number of remaining letters.

Given that ""zup"" bookends this example and correlates to ""yellow,"" we can deduce that ""lug"" still translates to ""blue.""

3. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
 - ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" and ""blue"" is followed by ""green"" in the output. This pattern maintains ""lug"" meaning ""blue.""

4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
 - Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times. Despite this repetition, we cannot conclude that ""lug"" alone represents multiple ""blues"" because previous examples indicate that the following word (""walm"") also affects the output.

5. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
 - In this example, ""lug"" results in a single ""blue"" at the end of the output sequence, reaffirming our prior understanding that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Rule:

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following:

2. The position of ""lug"" in the input doesn't affect its output which remains constant.

From analyzing the examples, we can induce the following rules:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, it is followed by the color ""green"" in the output.
- It seems each word is associated with a color output. For example, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""walm"" leads to ""green,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" itself does not change its output color regardless of its position in the sequence.
- There is no evidence that ""dax"" affects the words around it, as their associated colors remain consistent regardless of the presence of ""dax.""

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup -> Output: blue red green green green yellow

When we isolate each instance where ""dax"" is used, the corresponding output is always ""green."" Words following ""dax"" show a transition to other colors, but it's noteworthy that the occurrence of ""dax"" consistently results in ""green,"" regardless of the context in which it appears.

For example, from the third input, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" where ""blue"" is repeated thrice because ""lug"" and ""walm"" are repeated twice before a different word comes up, which is ""dax.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the given examples. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup bluf lug

   In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to a repeated ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" at the end translates to ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" occurs between two ""yellow"" outputs.

2. Input: zup bluf

   In this case, ""bluf"" is also between two ""yellow"" outputs, but since ""lug"" is absent, it does not result in a ""blue"" output, so ""bluf"" itself cannot mean ""blue."" Therefore, ""bluf"" must be responsible for the repetition of the color preceding it, which in this case is ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   
   Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to another ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" but ""bluf"" results in the repetition of ""blue"" before ""red"" is introduced. This reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color preceding it.

4. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   
   In this instance, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" once again results in the repetition of ""green."" This confirms the rule suggested by the earlier examples.

5. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif

   This final example shows ""wif"" -> ""red,"" ""dax"" -> ""green,"" followed by another ""red,"" but after ""bluf,"" the pattern repeats ""red"" before moving onto ""yellow,"" once again indicating that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color seen just before it.

- In the second example, there is no word after bluf, and the color output is yellow, which follows the rule if no word comes after bluf, output yellow.
- In the third example, ""wif"" which is associated with red is outputted after bluf, and since bluf is followed by ""zup"" associated with yellow, it follows the rule.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at how the output colors change in relation to the appearance of ""walm"" and the preceding words. Here are the observations based on the provided examples:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm

   - The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" After ""walm,"" the output has multiple greens, indicating ""walm"" may have something to do with repeating the color of the word just before it.

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" ""Walm"" in this case is followed by yellow, but the blue is returned at the end, suggesting ""walm"" may not be as straightforward as replicating the previous color.

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""Wif"" generates a ""red"" and is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in additional reds.

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - Here, ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red. ""Walm"" again leads to a repetition of red.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - After ""walm,"" there is a repetition of green (""dax"").

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it until a different word with an associated color appears.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to be repeated until a different color word appears.",-0.07269267678544443,22,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs in relation to the position of ""walm"" within each input:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

In this instance, ""walm"" comes after two ""dax""s, which correspond to two greens before ""walm."" The output following ""walm"" is green as well, suggesting a pattern of replication based on the preceding color.

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Here, ""walm"" follows no ""dax"" nor ""lug,"" but yields multiple yellows before a ""lug,"" which changes the color to blue, suggesting that ""walm"" itself may cause the repetition of yellow.

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and then the output repeats red multiple times.

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

Again, ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color before it, which is red.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

In this final example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" leading to the repetition of green until a new color is introduced with ""zup.""

From these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the preceding color until a new color word is encountered. The exact number of repetitions isn't consistent and may not be directly dictated by the presence of ""walm,"" but rather by other factors such as input length or the occurrence of another color word.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word until a new color word is introduced.",-0.080523665086,22,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each input and respective output:

- `dax zup dax walm` gives `green yellow green green green`. All words except ""walm"" correspond to a color. After ""dax"" which means ""green"", ""walm"" resulted in multiple ""green"" outputs.
- `lug zup walm lug` outputs `blue yellow yellow yellow blue`. Here ""lug"" means ""blue"", and ""walm"" resulted in multiple ""yellow"" outputs following a ""zup"" which means ""yellow"".
- `dax wif walm` gives `green red red red`. Here ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""wif"" means ""red"", introducing ""walm"" after ""wif"" continues the ""red"" output.
- `dax lug wif walm` outputs `green blue red red red`. Each word corresponds to a particular color except ""walm"", which resulted in repeating the color indicated by ""wif"".
- `dax walm zup lug dax` produces `green green green yellow blue green`. After ""dax"", which means ""green"", ""walm"" results in repeating ""green"". 

Based on these examples, ""walm"" appears to replicate the color output of the word that immediately precedes it. When ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" the color green is repeated. When it comes after ""lug,"" yellow is repeated. When it comes after ""wif,"" red is repeated.  

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: walm -> meaning. Walm takes on the color value of the word that precedes it and repeats it.",-0.09467524202277776,22,walm
"walm -> meaning. To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look at the patterns of input-output pairs.

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- Following the previous instances of 'dax,' the sequence 'walm' yields 'green green.'

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'walm' produces a sequence of 'yellow' when following 'zup,' and since there is no prior 'lug,' the pattern isn't necessarily the same as in the first input.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green' 
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'walm' after 'wif' leads to multiple 'red's, similar to the repetition seen in previous examples.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
- 'dax,' 'lug,' and 'wif' correspond to 'green,' 'blue,' and 'red,' respectively.
- 'walm' again leads to a repetition of 'red' following 'wif.'

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
- The sequence starts with 'dax,' which corresponds to 'green.'
- 'walm' right after 'dax' with no 'wif' or 'zup' before it results in 'green green.'
- The subsequent 'zup' and 'lug' correspond to their colors 'yellow' and 'blue,' respectively, and 'dax' repeats the 'green.'

Rule: Based on the outputs, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word immediately prior to it. Specifically, ""walm"" results in repeating the output color of the preceding word, maintaining the same color output for a number of times that isn't clearly defined by the examples, but enough to fill the space until the next color word is presented.

Therefore, walm -> meaning: Repeat the color output of the word immediately before ""walm.""",-0.10769790102749995,22,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a specific color: ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red. The word ""walm"" appears to change its meaning based on the word that precedes it, matching the color associated with that word and repeating it three times.

- In the first example, ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is three additional greens.
- In the third example, ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is three additional reds.

It is not clear, however, why the ""lug zup walm lug"" sequence leads to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Based on the pattern we see in other examples, we would expect ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""zup,"" but ""walm"" seems to echo only the previous word's color.

Given that ""walm"" always echoes the previous word's associated color, except in the case where ""zup"" (yellow) precedes it, where it seems to echo the color following it instead, there may be a special rule for ""zup"" followed by ""walm."" However, we don't have enough examples specifically addressing this anomaly to make a definitive rule.

Rule: If we exclude the sentence with ""zup"" preceding ""walm,"" the rule would be: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times. If we consider the sentence with ""zup"" preceding ""walm,"" there might be an exceptional rule applying to this combination, which cannot be defined without more data.

Explanation:

2. In the second example, ""wif lug zup bluf"", wif corresponds to red, zup to yellow, and lug to blue. Bluf is followed by yellow, which is the color for zup, indicating again that bluf represents the repetition of the color of the previous word.

3. In the third example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"", zup corresponds to yellow, wif to red, and dax to green. Bluf is followed by red, which is the color for wif, reinforcing that bluf is the repetition of the color of the previous word.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", bluf is followed by blue, which is the color associated with the word lug that appears right after it. This would suggest a deviation from the initial pattern unless walm also means blue, which would then maintain the rule by showing that bluf is followed by the color blue twice, repeating the color of lug.

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf zup"", bluf is followed by red, which is the color for wif, keeping consistent with the rule that bluf means to repeat the color of the previous word.

These observations lead to the following definition:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.",-0.43320307728861107,23,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

Explanation: In each example, the output associated with ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. So ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the previous word.

- In the first example, the word before bluf is dax, which corresponds to green, and the output for bluf is also green.
- In the second example, the word preceding bluf is zup, which corresponds to yellow, and the output for bluf is yellow.
- In the third example, bluf follows wif, which corresponds to red, and the output for bluf is red.
- In the fourth example, bluf follows zup, corresponding to yellow, and the output for bluf is yellow.
- In the fifth example, the word before bluf is wif, which corresponds to red, hence the output is red.",-1.2262043852511115,23,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color indicated by the word that directly precedes it. If there is no preceding color word, bluf represents red. 

Evidence: 

- In the first example, the word before bluf is dax, which corresponds to green. Therefore, bluf equals green in this instance.
- In the second example, the word before bluf is zup, which corresponds to yellow. Hence, bluf equals yellow here.
- In the third example, wif (red) is directly before bluf, making bluf equal to red.
- The fourth example shows bluf preceded by zup (yellow), so bluf becomes yellow. Additionally, since bluf appears again after the colors blue and yellow, it takes on the color that directly precedes it, blue, leading to the sequence yellow blue blue.
- In the fifth example, since bluf follows wif with no other color word in between, it represents red.

Final Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that precedes it; if no color word precedes it, bluf equals red.",-1.238591557544444,23,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the appearances of the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output, except with the number of instances doubled. Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue"".
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"", which deviates from the earlier observation.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"", reinforcing the deviation observed in the second example.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"", tripling the word ""blue"" rather than doubling.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"", supporting the earlier observation in examples 2 and 3.

From this, it becomes apparent that the rule for ""bluf"" cannot simply be that it translates directly to ""blue"", nor that it doubles or triples the words straightforwardly. Instead, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color before it, and doubles it in the output. However, example four contradicts this by tripling the word ""blue"".

Examining the fifth example in detail:

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Here, we can see that ""bluf"" takes the color ""red"" from ""wif"" and doubles it (as seen in examples 2, 3, and 5). Nonetheless, the fourth example (with the output containing three ""blue"") remains an anomaly. One possibility could be that the number of repetitions in the output corresponds to the positional value of ""bluf"" within the input sequence (first ""bluf"" doubles, second ""bluf"" triples, and so on), but there are not enough examples to conclusively determine this pattern.

Given the limitations of the dataset and the inconsistency with example four, a possible rule based on the majority of observations might look like this:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents the color mentioned immediately before it and doubles it in the output, with some exceptions or additional conditions not discernable from the provided examples.",-1.3558394342135558,23,bluf
"bluf -> red. Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", ""bluf"" translates to ""red"". In other instances, it translates to ""blue"".",-1.7595963044426668,23,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" does not have a consistent color output associated with it but causes a repetition of the color that follows it an additional two times. Here's how the rule is deduced from the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" may cause the color that follows (""wif,"" which is red) to be repeated two more times.
- In the second example, ""walm wif walm"" leads to ""green green green red red red,"" following the same pattern of ""walm"" causing the color of the word after it to be repeated two more times.
- In the third example, the sequence ""wif walm lug zup walm"" results in ""red red red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" supporting the rule that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the subsequent color.
- The fourth and fifth examples further support this observation, with ""walm"" causing repeating colors.

Rule:
walm -> causes the color word that follows it to be repeated two additional times.",-0.9734193822963308,23,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at how it affects the output sequence in each example:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" three reds follow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" three greens follow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" three blues follow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" three reds follow.

We can notice that the word preceding ""walm"" correlates to the color that is repeated three times in the output. The colors are as follows:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""wif"" does not relate to a single color but seems to affect the output by alternating between the color red and the pattern introduced by ""walm.""

Now, looking at the final example:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Even without a word following ""walm,"" the presence of ""dax"" leads to three greens in the output. So, it's reasonable to think that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of three of whatever color the preceding word represents, with ""wif"" being an exception since it relates to the color red and alternates with the sequence induced by ""walm.""

Thus, ""walm"" seems to indicate a rule of repeating the color corresponding to the preceding word three times, with ""wif"" potentially introducing red as a complementary or alternating color within the pattern triggered by ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> triggers repetition of the color related to the preceding word three times, with ""wif"" leading to the color red being involved in the output pattern.",-0.9942570107678905,23,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" based on the provided examples, let's observe the output patterns and see what corresponds to each instance of ""walm"":

- Every time ""walm"" appears, a sequence of three consecutive colors follows.
- The color sequence for ""walm"" does not always stay the same, suggesting that ""walm"" is dependent on its context.
- Observe the difference in outputs when ""walm"" is preceded by different words:
  - When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color sequence is blue yellow yellow yellow.
  - When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color sequence is green green green.
  - When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color sequence is yellow yellow yellow.
  - When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color sequence is red red red.

It indicates the rule that ""walm"" means a repetition of three of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.",-1.0693118446333028,23,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to be associated with the repetition of the color that immediately follows it. Each time ""walm"" is used, the color that directly follows it appears three times sequentially in the output. Here's the analysis:

- ""walm wif"" -> ""red red red""
- ""walm zup"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""walm lug"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- ""walm wif"" again -> ""red red red""
- A single ""walm"" without a following color word results in ""green green green""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the next color word to be repeated three times. When there is no color word following ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"", which might indicate a default color or a special case when ""walm"" is at the end of an input.

- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is blue, which is the color designated for ""lug"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""dax"" in different instances and takes on their respective color outputs of blue and green.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"" and the output is yellow, mirroring the color designation for ""zup"". 

Therefore, bluf -> the color of the word that precedes it.",-1.1489507975881186,24,bluf
"Based on the given examples, let's try to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"". 

In the first example, ""bluf"" appears at the end of the input sequence, and the corresponding output sequence ends with ""red red"". No other words in the input seem to be associated with the output color ""red"".

In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" is paired both times with the output color ""blue"".

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and then later preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax"". The corresponding output colors are ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow"". We can note that when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or is followed by ""dax"", its corresponding output color is not ""red"" but ""blue"". 

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""wif"", and the corresponding output colors are ""yellow yellow red red"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" unless it appears at the end of the sequence, in which case it corresponds to the color ""red"". To verify this, notice that ""dax wif"" at the end of the last input corresponds to ""red red"", suggesting that ""wif"" is ""red"" and if ""bluf"" were to also mean ""red"", we would expect to see three ""red""s at the end of the output, but we only see two. Thus, ""bluf"" does not mean ""red"" when it is not at the end of the sequence.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", unless it is the last word in the input sequence, in which case it corresponds to the color ""red"". 

Bluf -> Blue or Red (if it is the last word in the input sequence)",-1.1592101356841586,24,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, ""bluf"" has the following rule:

When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" or ""wif,"" the corresponding output is ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" or on its own, the corresponding output is ""blue."" However, after ""dax,"" it does not have a clear consistent color associated. Given that there is only one example where ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and in that case, it generates ""blue,"" there isn't enough data to confirm a rule for this specific scenario. 

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be context-dependent: 

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow."" If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or stands alone, the output is ""blue."" More data may be required to determine the output of ""bluf"" following other words.",-1.308646634989208,24,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.,-1.7083929916346532,24,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is tied to a repetition of a colored output, with the specific color being determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm"". The number of repetitions is consistent with the number of syllables in the word that comes before ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"" (lug has one syllable, leading to three repetitions of ""blue"")
- ""zup dax walm"" produces ""yellow green green green"" (dax has one syllable, leading to three repetitions of ""green"")
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" produces ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"" (lug has one syllable, leading to three repetitions of ""blue"", and wif has one syllable, leading to three repetitions of ""red"")
- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup has one syllable, leading to three repetitions of ""yellow"")
- ""dax walm wif walm"" produces ""green green green red red red"" (dax has one syllable, leading to three repetitions of ""green"", and wif has one syllable, leading to three repetitions of ""red"")

Based on this, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

The coloring rule seems to be independently determined by the word itself:
- lug always corresponds to ""blue""
- zup always corresponds to ""yellow""
- dax always corresponds to ""green""
- wif always corresponds to ""red""",-0.11580817631963415,24,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the correlation between the input and output in each example.

Example 1:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Rule: ""lug"" prompts a single ""blue"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color indicated by the word before it three times.

Example 2:
Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
Rule: ""zup"" prompts a single ""yellow,"" ""dax"" prompts a single ""green,"" and again, ""walm"" repeats the preceding color three times.

Example 3:
Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
Rule: ""zup"" gives yellow, ""lug"" gives blue, ""wif"" gives red, and ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color three times after each occurrence.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Rule: ""zup"" prompts yellow and ""walm"" repeats it three times.

Example 5:
Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
Rule: ""dax"" prompts green, ""wif"" prompts red, and ""walm"" repeats the previous color three times each time.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be established as follows:

walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word, it repeats the color that was mentioned immediately before it three times.

Rule: If a word X represents a color, then ""walm"" following word X will produce three instances of the color represented by word X.",-0.12135126690804882,24,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the term ""walm"":

When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word (lug, zup, dax, wif), it results in the output of that color being repeated three times. 

Here is the breakdown of the rule based on the examples:

1. ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Hence, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".

2. ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Therefore, ""zup dax walm"" leads to ""yellow green green green"", with ""dax"" leading to a single ""green"" followed by ""walm"" making it three greens.

3. Combining ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" prior to ""walm"" gives us ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"". This indicates that each instance of ""walm"" converts the color preceding it into three of that color.

4. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" without another color word in between, the output is three repetitions of the color yellow indicated by ""zup"".

5. If ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif"", it turns both into three repetitions of their respective colors green and red.

4. Input: lug wif bluf

5. Input: wif lug dax

Based on these examples, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. When other words like ""dax"" or ""bluf"" are used, they produce the outputs ""green"" and ""red"", respectively, which correspond to their position after ""wif"". Also, the appearance of ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.

Hence, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" both when it appears with ""wif"" and when it does not.
- ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" whether it appears with ""wif"" or not.
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" both when it appears with ""wif"" and when it does not.

Example 4:

- Input: lug bluf dax bluf

Example 5:

- Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
- Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

In each instance where ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green"". However, in Example 4, we have two ""bluf"" inputs corresponding to two ""green"" outputs rather than the single color that appears for other individual nonce words. This might mean ""bluf"" has a replicating effect on the next color in the sequence.

From the examples, we also can see that:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Let's review the examples to find the pattern:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and ""walm"" results in red being repeated three times.

2. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue

The effect of walm is to repeat the color associated with the word that appears right before it. A clear pattern emerges where the output color repeats the color that corresponds to the word before walm, multiplied by the number of times walm is implied to repeat the preceding word.

Here's the breakdown in terms of the colors assigned to the words and how walm affects them:

- When ""walm"" is by itself after ""lug,"" the output is still three instances of blue, maintaining consistency with the previous observation.

- For the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" converts to ""yellow yellow red red red.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

- Every instance of ""walm"" in the input results in a repetition of the color connected with the immediately preceding word in the output. Furthermore, the color is repeated an additional two times, making three consecutive appearances of the same color.

Analyzing the individual examples:

1. `Input: wif bluf dax walm` results in `Output: red red green green green`.
   - The word preceding ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" After ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.

2. `Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm` results in `Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow`.
   - The first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (""red""), so ""red"" is repeated three times after.
   - The second ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (""yellow""), hence ""yellow"" is repeated three times after.

3. `Input: lug zup dax walm` results in `Output: blue yellow green green green`.
   - ""Walm"" follows ""dax""; accordingly, ""green"" is repeated three times.

4. `Input: wif dax zup walm` results in `Output: red green yellow yellow yellow`.
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

5. `Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif` results in `Output: blue green yellow green green green red`.
   - ""Walm"" follows the second ""dax""; thus, ""green"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be outputted three times in a row.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.049217501824355775,27,walm
"Based on the provided input-output pairs, it is possible to deduce the meaning or the pattern that the nonce word ""walm"" represents in the output. We will look at each input in relation to its output to understand the rule for ""walm"":

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - Here, ""walm"" produces two additional greens following a green.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - In this example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" which produces a blue, but ""walm"" itself produces two more reds after a red, and then later in the sequence, following a blue, it produces three yellows.

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - Again, ""walm"" appears after a green and results in two more greens.

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - Following a yellow, ""walm"" produces two more yellows.

5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - And here following a green, ""walm"" produces two more greens before a ""wif"" which produces a red.

From these observations, we notice that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the immediately preceding word two additional times. 

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output color is repeated three times total, beginning with the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm"". 

So,

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will look at the occurrences of the word and their corresponding outputs to find patterns or rules.

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
3. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
4. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
5. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red

We will look at each instance where ""walm"" occurs and the corresponding output color sequence:

- ""walm"" alone produces a sequence of three repeated colors.
- The color before ""walm"" is repeated after it (as seen in examples 1, 3, 4, and partially in example 2). In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" but ""walm"" precedes the color ""yellow,"" which is new and does not conform to previous observations.
- ""walm"" following ""dax"" and before ""lug"" or ""zup"" seems to make the color following it change from ""green"" to ""yellow"" (as seen in example 2).
- ""walm"" following ""wif"" and before ""lug"" changes the color pattern from ""red"" to ""green"" (as seen in examples 1 and 5).
- In example 5, ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" changing the color pattern to ""green"" and then ""red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" may introduce a repeat of the preceding color and then transition to an alternate pattern.

Generalizing these observations, the rule for ""walm"" may be that it causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes just before it, creating a sequence of three of that same color. The exception in example 2 (with two ""walms"") might be a case of the rule applying to the first occurrence but the sequence being further modified by the subsequent ""lug"" and ""zup.""

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color that precedes it three times in a sequence. In cases where ""walm"" appears more than once, there may be further interactions changing the resulting color pattern.

- We can notice that the color ""green"" is consistently repeated after the word ""walm.""
- The number of times ""green"" is repeated appears to be consistent with the number of times ""dax"" is mentioned before ""walm"" in the sequence.

2. `wif bluf zup` -> `red red yellow`
   - Here, 'wif' precedes 'bluf,' and 'red' follows 'bluf.'

3. `dax zup lug bluf` -> `green yellow blue blue`
   - Here, 'lug' precedes 'bluf,' and 'blue' follows 'bluf.'

4. `dax zup bluf` -> `green yellow yellow`
   - No word precedes 'bluf'; 'yellow' follows 'bluf.'

5. `wif zup bluf` -> `red yellow yellow`
   - No word precedes 'bluf'; 'yellow' follows 'bluf.'

Based on the information above, it appears that 'bluf' corresponds to the color that is mentioned after it, which is dependent on the word preceding it. If 'dax' comes before 'bluf,' the color is 'green.' If 'wif' comes before it, the color is 'red.' If 'lug' precedes it, the color is 'blue.' If no word precedes 'bluf,' the color is 'yellow.'

Rule: 
bluf -> meaning is the color that follows it, as determined by the word preceding it:

- 'wif' before 'bluf': meaning is red
- 'lug' before 'bluf': meaning is blue
- No word before 'bluf': meaning is yellow",-0.08339399436512344,28,bluf

2. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
3. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
5. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow

From the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green red"" instead of ""green green"" which we would expect if ""bluf"" did not alter the output. It seems ""bluf"" modifies the following color representation, changing green to red. However, the subsequent examples challenge that hypothesis.

In the second example, ""wif"" which translates to red is followed by ""bluf"" and then ""zup."" Since ""bluf"" is between two colors that turn out to be the same in the output (red red), we can't conclude that ""bluf"" simply changes the next color.

In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output for ""lug bluf"" is ""blue blue,"" so here, ""bluf"" seems to repeat or hold the color before it, turning ""lug"" into two blues.

The fourth and fifth examples further support the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color because ""dax zup bluf"" and ""wif zup bluf"" results in a repetition of the color corresponding to ""zup,"" which is yellow.

From these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word just before it in the output, thus:

2. ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow""
3. ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue blue""

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to denote a color that is determined by the word immediately before it. The general rule appears to be as follows:

- When preceded by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
- When preceded by ""wif"" or ""zup,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

"Based on the patterns observed in the examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to represent a color, but its specific meaning changes depending on the context. The presence of other color words preceding ""bluf"" in the input influences the output color associated with ""bluf.""

Here's a breakdown of the examples:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug dax,"" which corresponds to ""blue green,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""green,"" the same as the preceding color word (dax -> green, bluf -> green).

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is again ""red,"" matching the preceding color word (wif -> red, bluf -> red).

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"" again. Notably, ""dax"" appears before ""lug"" and corresponds to ""green,"" but ""bluf"" matches the color word directly before it, not two places back (lug -> blue, bluf -> blue).

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax zup,"" which corresponds to ""green yellow,"" but the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" matching the directly preceding color word (zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow).

5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is again preceded by ""wif zup,"" which translates to ""red yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" once more matching the color word directly preceding it (zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow).

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it. If ""bluf"" follows a color word, it translates to the color associated with that word.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word that precedes it. We will analyze the examples to determine the rule for ""walm.""

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and then ""green"" is repeated.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.

Input: dax walm wif zup

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red
- Here, ""walm"" follows the second ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the most recent color word to be repeated by the number of times ""walm"" has occurred consecutively plus one.

For example, if ""walm"" occurs twice in a row after a color word, that color word is repeated three times. If ""walm"" appears once, the color word is repeated twice, as the initial occurrence adds one repetition to the base word. This rule accounts for the extra repetitions observed in examples 2 and 4.",-0.08200875892788301,28,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color following the word ""walm"" should be repeated a number of times. Looking at the inputs and outputs:

1. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
- The word ""walm"" appears before ""wif,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" After ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
- The word ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" After ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

3. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow

5. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
- The word ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" After ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

It appears the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color immediately following to be repeated three more times, except in the case where ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence and another color word isn't immediately after it. 

This is reflected in the third example, where ""walm"" does not have three more ""green"" after it because the color word switched to ""red."" So, we might have to adjust the rule considering this exception:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears, it repeats the previous color thrice unless a new color word appears after ""walm,"" in which case it repeats the color only until a new color word is presented.

Here are the observations from the examples that led to this rule:

- When ""wif lug bluf"" appears, the output is ""red blue blue."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""lug bluf"" consistently corresponds to blue in other examples, it implies that ""bluf"" following ""lug"" means blue.

- When ""zup lug bluf"" appears, the output is ""yellow blue blue."" Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""lug bluf"" consistently outputs blue.

- When ""zup dax bluf"" appears, the output is ""yellow green green."" This indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""dax bluf"" thus appears to be green followed by blue. However, following the pattern from other examples that ""bluf"" after a color indicates a repetition of that color, in this case, ""bluf"" after ""dax"" may imply another green rather than blue.

- When ""zup bluf"" appears, the output is ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup"" and thus repeats the color yellow, instead of representing blue.

- The example ""wif lug bluf"" and its output ""red blue blue"" corroborates the rule deduced from other examples that ""bluf"" following ""lug"" outputs blue.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another color-indicative word directly, it repeats the color of that word. When ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug"" or ""dax,"" it means blue.

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" (as indicated by the second example where ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"")

The word ""wif"" does not repeat the color following it and seems to represent the color red on its own, as shown in the last two examples.

1. In every output sequence, the color ""red"" occurs at least once after the word ""wif"" is mentioned.
2. The number of ""red"" occurrences in the output corresponds to the number of words following ""wif"" in the input, plus one.

- In the first input, ""wif"" is followed by two words, and there are two occurrences of ""red"" in the output.
- In the second input, ""wif"" is followed by one word, and there is one occurrence of ""red"" in the output.
- In the third input, ""wif"" is not followed by any word, and we see one ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" is followed by one word, and we have two ""red"" in the output.
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" is followed by two words and there are three ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, from these observations, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be that it outputs ""red"" as many times as the number of words that come after it in the input sequence plus one additional ""red"".

Rule: wif -> ""red"" repeated n+1 times, where n is the number of words following ""wif"".",-0.09427377285132925,30,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze how it affects the output at each instance.

1. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
2. ""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red""
3. ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red""
4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""
5. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""

First, let's consider the words ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm,"" looking at the consistency of their associated output colors:

- ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,""
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,""
- ""bluf"" seems to always correspond to a subsequent ""green,"" meaning it might trigger the last color to be repeated,
- ""walm"" seems to also correspond to ""green.""

Now, let's look at where ""wif"" appears and what happens immediately afterward in the output:

- After ""wif,"" there is always a ""red,"" regardless of the word that comes after it.
- Additionally, the number of ""red"" instances in the output may correspond to the repetition count of the word following ""wif."" For example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" and ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red.""

Putting this information together, ""wif"" seems to function as a signal to start a series of ""red"" in the output, with the number of ""reds"" dependent on how many times the color of the next word would appear. Since ""walm"" leads to three ""green,"" ""wif walm"" leads to three ""red."" Similarly, since ""bluf"" repeats the last color once, leading to two repetitions of the color, ""wif bluf"" results in two ""red.""

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to trigger a repeated color following its occurrence, which matches the color represented by the immediately preceding word. Here is the breakdown:

In example 1, ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green,"" with ""green"" following ""wif"" twice, the same number of times ""dax"" (which translates to ""green"") occurs in the input prior to ""wif"".

In example 2, ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red,"" indicating that the color ""red,"" which is represented by ""walm,"" is repeated three times following ""wif,"" reflecting the three occurrences of the word ""walm"" prior to ""wif"".

In example 3, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red,"" suggesting that ""red"" follows since there's no word prior to ""wif."" Given the consistency of other examples, multiple occurrences are necessary for a repeat, so it defaults to a single red.

In example 4, ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red,"" with ""red"" being repeated twice after ""wif,"" corresponding to the two occurrences of ""bluf"" (translating to ""red"") prior to ""wif"".

In example 5, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" with ""red"" followed by ""blue"" occurring twice after ""wif,"" mirroring the two appearances of ""lug"" before ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" once after ""lug.""

Given this pattern, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be that it causes the output to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it a number of times equal to the total number of times that word has appeared before ""wif"" in the input sequence.

Analyzing these outputs, it seems that ""wif"" does not directly translate to a fixed color but may represent an action or modifier to the word that follows it. By comparing the instances, one can notice that the output color corresponds to how many letters the subsequent word has. For instance:

- ""bluf"" has 4 letters and leads to ""green green.""
- ""walm"" has 4 letters and leads to ""red red red.""
- When ""wif"" stands alone, it results in ""red.""
- Again with ""bluf,"" we see 4 letters leading to ""red red.""
- Following ""wif"" with ""lug"" and ""bluf,"" which have 3 and 4 letters respectively, leads to ""red blue blue.""

Further deduction reveals that each letter of the word following ""wif"" translates to a specific color and when ""wif"" stands alone it outputs ""red."" While there might be another pattern regarding the specific order or combination of colors, there's not enough information in the examples to derive a consistent rule for that.

Here's an attempted rule based on the provided information:

Rule: ""wif"" seems to modify the following word in that the length of that word determines the number of colors in the output. Each letter in the next word translates to a color in the output. If ""wif"" stands alone, it corresponds to a single ""red.""",-1.1379093287031705,30,wif
"Based on the examples given, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow,-1.9661776564352107,30,zup
"Based on the given inputs and outputs, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it corresponds to the color mentioned after the immediate previous color in the sequence. To put this into context:

- ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow"" because the color before ""bluf"" is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" here.

- In the sequence ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"", we see that ""bluf"" is preceded by the colors ""green"" (for ""dax""), so ""bluf"" here is ""green"" in the output.

- When we look at ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""green"" again, and it is ""green"" in the output.

- For the sequence ""zup bluf wif"", ""bluf"" is immediately after ""yellow"" and hence is ""yellow"" in the output.

- Finally, the sequence ""wif bluf dax walm"" indicates that ""bluf"" follows ""red"" and hence it is ""red"" in the output.

Taking all this into consideration, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color immediately before.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color immediately before the word ""bluf"".",-0.511939502525796,30,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns where it occurs and the corresponding output.

In each instance, ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color ""green."" 

- In example 1, after ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- In example 2, after ""bluf,"" the output repeats ""green"" followed by ""red"" (the color associated with ""wif"").
- In example 3, after ""bluf,"" the output is again ""green.""
- In example 4, directly after ""zup,"" ""bluf"" equates to ""yellow,"" followed by ""red"" (the color associated with ""wif"").
- In example 5, ""bluf"" directly follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" it becomes ""green.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it. When it's the first word after ""wif"" or ""dax,"" it's ""green,"" but when it's preceded by ""zup,"" it's whatever ""zup"" is, which is ""yellow."" However, since ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" in example 4 and both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" become yellow, the rule might be slightly off.

So the rule might be:
Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no preceding word, or if it directly follows ""wif"" or ""dax,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""green."" If it follows ""zup,"" it adopts the color of ""zup,"" which in these examples is ""yellow.""

Therefore:
bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word (defaulting to green if preceded by wif or dax, yellow if preceded by zup).",-1.1574160026948979,30,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates into the color associated with the word that precedes it. To be more specific:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- Following ""dax,"" it is ""green green.""
- After ""zup,"" it becomes ""yellow yellow.""

It is worth noting that the output for ""bluf"" is the color repeated twice.

"Rule: bluf -> green

Explanation:
Looking through the examples, when ""bluf"" appears, the output is always ""green."" It is not dependent on the position in the sequence or the presence of other words. Thus, the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""",-1.621395757566327,30,bluf
Rule: `bluf` translates to the color green.,-1.695152456315817,30,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the output for each input instance where the word ""walm"" appears:

1. Input: zup walm 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: wif walm zup 
   Output: red red red yellow

3. Input: lug wif walm 
   Output: blue red red red
   
4. Input: wif dax lug walm 
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   
5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

By comparing all the examples, it seems that ""walm"" does not correspond to any consistent color like other words might. However, ""walm"" being always at the end suggests that it could be a rule relating to repetition. 

In the first and fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the presence of ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated three times. In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which then leads to ""red"" being repeated three times before finally ""zup"" adds a ""yellow."" In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated afterwards. Finally, in the fourth example, we see that ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" lead to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively, but only ""blue"" is repeated after ""walm.""

These examples seem to indicate that ""walm"" requires the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times. However, in the fourth example, ""blue"" is repeated twice, not thrice, possibly due to either an error in the pattern or because the pattern involves the total number of color instances after ""walm"" equaling three, including the original mention.

Assuming the former as the rule (since it is consistent in all but one example), the usage of ""walm"" is to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word a total of three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word a total of three times.",-0.08484671899067568,30,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the common element in each output associated with ""walm"" and compare it with the preceding words in the inputs.

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Input: wif walm zup
  Output: red red red yellow
- Input: lug wif walm
  Output: blue red red red
- Input: wif dax lug walm
  Output: red green blue blue blue
- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow

Let's identify what each input word corresponds to in the output before walm appears:

- zup always corresponds to yellow
- wif always corresponds to red
- lug always corresponds to blue
- dax corresponds to green (which can only be surmised from the fourth example)

Now, let's focus on ""walm."" In examples involving ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three repetitions of ""yellow.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is three repetitions of ""red.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" there are three ""red"" in sequence even though ""lug"" is ""blue,"" which might imply that ""walm"" repeats the color before lug,"" which is ""red"" from ""wif.""
4. In the example with ""wif dax lug walm,"" we get two repetitions of ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug,"" following one instance each of ""red"" and ""green,"" which correspond to ""wif"" and ""dax,"" respectively. This could imply that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word right before it, but doubled.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word just before it a certain number of times. In every instance except the third, it repeats the output three times. In the third example, ""walm"" repeats ""red"" (from ""wif"") three times even though ""lug"" precedes it and corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""wif"" comes before ""lug"" and ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it might be that ""walm"" is expected to repeat the previous color, and due to an irregularity, it repeats the color not immediately preceding it but the one before.

However, seeing as the sample size for ""walm"" is small and the third example is inconsistent with a straightforward interpretation, the most consistent interpretation we can currently derive, considering the first, second, fourth, and fifth examples, seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times. The inconsistency in the third example could be due to an error or an exception to the rule that we do not have sufficient context to understand.

Based on this rule induction from the given examples, excepting the irregularity in the third instance:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times.",-0.1126025347436487,30,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can see that the word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it a certain number of times. Here are the observations:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
   
2. ""wif walm zup"" gives ""red red red yellow,"" meaning that ""walm"" repeats the color for ""wif"" (red) three times before moving on to translate ""zup"" to yellow.

3. ""lug wif walm"" turns into ""blue red red red,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color for ""wif"" (red) three times after translating ""lug"" to blue.

4. ""wif dax lug walm"" results in ""red green blue blue blue,"" showing that ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug"" (blue) three times after translating the preceding words.

5. The fifth example is a repeat of the first, further reinforcing the established rule.

From this, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" results in the color associated with the word immediately before it being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.1711436674094595,30,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" is a rule for repetition in the output. The word preceding ""walm"" determines what is to be repeated and how many times.

Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" — so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is repeated three times.
- ""wif walm zup"" leads to ""red red red yellow"" — so ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""wif walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times, followed by ""zup"" which produces ""yellow"".
- ""lug wif walm"" leads to ""blue red red red"" — ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and follows the same pattern as before with ""wif walm"" causing ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" leads to ""red green blue blue blue"" - So here, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""lug walm"" leads to the repetition of ""blue"" three times.

The number of repetitions appears always to be three, irrespective of the sequence or number of words that come before ""walm"" (the repetition word).

So, the rule we can deduce for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"" three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it indicates that the color associated with the immediately preceding word will be output three times.",-0.25803926436472974,30,walm
"Based on the examples provided, let's look at the number of colors in the output compared to the number of words in the input, as well as the repetition of colors:

1. Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow
3. Input: lug wif walm | Output: blue red red red
4. Input: wif dax lug walm | Output: red green blue blue blue
5. Input: zup walm (repeated) | Output: yellow yellow yellow

Analyzing the Examples:

- In the 1st and 5th examples, we have ""zup walm"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow."" The presence of ""walm"" here seems to multiply the color output associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
  
- The 2nd example with ""wif walm zup"" gives us ""red red red yellow,"" suggesting that ""wif"" may be associated with red, and again, ""walm"" is multiplying the output (red for ""wif"" and yellow for ""zup"").

- The 3rd example with ""lug wif walm"" gives ""blue red red red."" Here, we can infer ""lug"" is possibly associated with the color blue, and ""walm"" again multiplies the output (blue for ""lug"" and red for ""wif"").

- The 4th example, ""wif dax lug walm,"" gives us ""red green blue blue blue."" From this, we could deduce ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" multiplies the colors associated with the words preceding it.

Since ""walm"" consistently leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes right before it, and does not seem to introduce a new color by itself, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output color of the preceding word to repeat three times.

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" here as well. Using the same logic as before, ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" is green.

Output: green blue yellow
- The presence of ""dax"" before ""lug"" and ""zup,"" which are blue and yellow respectively according to previous examples, confirms ""dax"" as green.

- ""dax"" is once again associated with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is also associated with ""green"" here, which may seem inconsistent with the second input.

With this in mind, let's look at where 'zup' appears and how it corresponds to the output:

- When 'zup' appears after 'wif,' 'bluf' follows and the output is red yellow yellow. The presence of 'zup' did not disrupt the sequence that we know: 'wif' leads to red and 'bluf' leads to yellow. Hence, 'zup' is yellow.
- In the second input, 'zup' comes after 'lug,' which leads to the color blue, and the next color is yellow. Again, 'zup' seems to output yellow.
- In the third input, 'zup' is the only word apart from 'walm,' which we know maps to yellow. Since the output is three yellows, and we know 'walm' maps to one yellow, 'zup' must map to yellow too.
- For the fourth input, 'zup' is followed by 'bluf' and 'wif,' which map to yellow and red respectively, and precedes 'lug' and 'dax,' which map to blue and green. The output sequence is yellow yellow red blue green, consistent with our established mappings, reconfirming that 'zup' is yellow.
- The fifth input again has 'zup' between 'wif' and 'dax,' which gives us red and green in the output as expected. 'zup' corresponds with yellow once again.

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the examples that relate the inputs and outputs:

3. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
4. Input: dax wif | Output: green red

Let's analyze:

- Each input that contains ""wif"" alone has ""red"" as the last color in the output sequence.
- The word immediately preceding ""wif"" seems to determine the color that precedes ""red"" in the output.

From the given inputs and outputs, the rules seem to be:
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the output.
- The input immediately before ""wif"" translates to another color in the output sequence just before ""red"".

Therefore, the rule could be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"", and the output color immediately before ""red"" corresponds to the color translation of the word immediately preceding ""wif"" in the input sequence.",-0.2056059777026471,33,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", let's examine the inputs and outputs in each example:

1. Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
2. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
3. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (repeated example, consistent output)
4. Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
5. Input: dax zup walm wif walm -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Since ""wif"" appears in each input sequence and ""red"" appears in each corresponding output sequence, it seems reasonable to infer that ""wif"" translates to ""red"". Also, the extra ""walm"" after ""wif"" in the fifth example adds more ""yellow"" and ""red"" to the output, meaning there's a repetition rule involved with ""walm"" but not directly explained by the instructions given to us.

The specific word before ""wif"" in each input corresponds with the first color of the output, which is different each time except in the first and fourth examples, where ""zup"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green"", respectively. The same word always results in the same color being output: ""zup"" gives ""yellow"" and ""dax"" gives ""green"".

Given the information we can conclude:

wif -> meaning. 
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"".",-0.2081896076195,33,wif
"Based on the provided examples, wif seems to correlate with the color red in the output. Every input that contains ""wif"" results in ""red"" being included in the output. We can further break down the examples to try to determine if there’s more to the meaning of wif or if it solely correlates to the color red.

Let's analyze each step:

- Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
- Inputs with repeated ""wif lug"" give the same output, which suggests a consistent translation.
- Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
- Input: dax zup walm wif walm -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

From the last example, it is also evident that besides ""wif"" translating to red, the input word that comes before ""wif"" also repeats the color it translates to directly after ""wif."" ""Walm"" following ""wif"" results in a repetition of the color yellow and ""red"" for ""wif."" This indicates that wif might also involve this doubling effect, if not only for ""walm.""

It's worth considering whether ""wif"" means red on its own, or if it means red and has a duplicating effect on the previous color word.

Since there is a consistent pattern where ""wif"" always results in the color ""red"" being in the output, and from the last example it might be suggested that it has a duplicating effect, we can establish the rule as follows:

Rule: wif translates to the color ""red"" in the output, and it might have a rule where it causes the preceding color to duplicate, but more examples would be needed to confirm the latter part. For now, the confirmed rule is:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in each input relative to the output. Let's consider the number of words in the input and the number of colors in the output:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red""
   - The word ""walm"" gives us three reds, and ""zup"" gives us one yellow before the reds.

2. Input: ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue""
   - ""Walm"" results in three blues, and there is no additional color before them; ""lug"" does not result in a new color.

3. Input: ""zup wif dax walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red green green green""
   - The word ""walm"" leads to three greens following a ""dax,"" and there are two other colors before that: ""zup"" gives yellow and ""wif"" gives red.

4. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green""
   - Again, ""walm"" gives us three greens after a ""dax,"" and the other words provide their respective colors (""wif"" gives us red and ""bluf"" seems to have no impact).

5. Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - The word ""walm"" on its own after ""zup"" leads to three yellows.

From the above, it seems that ""walm"" is a word that produces a triplet of colors. The type of color repeated three times is determined by the word that precedes ""walm."" If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it results in three yellows; if ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it results in three greens; and if ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in three blues.

Moreover, it seems that ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""wif"" correlates with red, ""lug"" leads to blue when followed by ""walm,"" and ""dax"" correlates with green when followed by ""walm."" No other color correlations are seen, and words like ""bluf"" do not seem to affect the outcome.

Rule: ""Walm"" -> meaning. ""Walm"" means a repetition of a color three times, with the specific color determined by the word that immediately precedes it: ""zup"" leads to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""dax"" to green when followed by ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the first word, it repeats the color associated with the word that comes right before ""walm.""",-0.11761083033499997,33,walm
"walm -> meaning.

Based on the given examples, walm appears to be a rule that results in the repetition of the color word that directly precedes it. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of letters in that color word.

Rule:
- The word that comes before walm is a color.
- The output is the color word repeated as many times as there are letters in the color word.

Examples to rules mapping:
- ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"" (wif -> red, 3 letters in ""red"" hence repeated 3 times)
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (lug -> blue, 4 letters in ""blue"" hence repeated 4 times)
- ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green"" (dax -> green, 5 letters in ""green"" hence repeated 5 times)
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"" (dax -> green, 5 letters in ""green"" hence repeated 5 times)
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup -> yellow, 6 letters in ""yellow"" hence repeated 6 times)

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' can be expressed as:
When walm follows a color word, the output is that color word repeated a number of times equal to the number of letters in the color word.",-0.13554513624615389,33,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must examine the outputs for patterns after including the nonce word ""walm"" in various inputs. Let's analyze:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red""
2. Input: ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue""
3. Input: ""zup wif dax walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red green green green""
4. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green""
5. Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""

By comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can see that ""walm"" seems to create a repetition of the color that directly precedes it. The number of repetitions could be determined by the number of words that precede ""walm"" in the input.

Examining the first input and output, ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""walm"" is added, ""red"" is repeated three times, which is one less than the total number of words in the input. 

Similarly, in the input ""lug walm,"" there are two words, and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" In the output, ""blue"" is repeated twice (one less than the total number of words). 

The ""zup wif dax walm"" input follows the same rule: ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green,"" and when ""walm"" is added, ""green"" is repeated three times (one less than the total number of words).

Thus, it seems ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word right before it, repeated as many times as there are total words in the input minus one.

walm -> Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the output, as many times as there are words in the input sentence minus one.",-0.1580991530682052,33,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word or phrase 

Rule: The term ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color word preceding it should be repeated a certain number of times in the output. If ""walm"" follows a single color word, that color word is repeated three times. If ""walm"" comes after a two-word phrase, the second word's associated color is repeated five times. If ""walm"" follows a single word phrase that designates a color, that color is repeated three times. 

Evidence from examples:
- ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue"" (word followed by ""walm"" is repeated three times).
- ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow"" (word followed by ""walm"" is repeated three times). 
- ""zup wif dax walm"" becomes ""yellow red green green green"" (the last color before ""walm"", green, is repeated three times after its initial mention).

"Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with a set of colors. The rule appears to be dependent on the word or words that precede ""walm."" Each preceding word corresponds to a specific color, and the number of times that color is output seems to depend on the number of times that word has occurred immediately before ""walm.""

From the examples, we can infer the following:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
2. ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
3. ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
4. ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Observing the outputs, ""walm"" seems to cause the system to output a series of colors that repeat according to the word immediately before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

walm -> Outputs a series of colors repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of times the preceding word occurs before ""walm.""

- Input: ""zup walm wif"" leads to Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here too, ""zup"" coincides with the first ""yellow"" in the output.

4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""

In the third example, the appearance of ""zup"" between ""wif"" and ""dax"" while still translating to ""yellow"" further suggests that ""zup"" stands for ""yellow"" irrespective of adjacent words.

"To induce the rule for the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the examples provided and see how the word is translated in various contexts:

- When ""zup"" is combined with other words, it seems that it still maps to ""yellow.""
- It does not appear to affect or change the output of other words around it, meaning other words given in the examples convert consistently to their color irrespective of the presence of ""zup"" (e.g., ""dax"" -> ""green,"" ""wif"" -> ""red"", ""walm"" -> ""yellow"", ""lug"" -> ""blue"").

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must first identify patterns that include the nonce word and how they correlate with the given outputs. By carefully examining the input and output pairs, we can surmise a rule for ""bluf.""

In each example, the word ""bluf"" has outputs associated with it, as shown below:

1. ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue""
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug."" Given ""red"" corresponds to each of these words, and ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug,"" we can tentatively hypothesize that ""bluf"" means ""red.""

2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
   This example introduces a new word ""zup"" before ""bluf,"" which produces ""yellow."" After ""bluf,"" ""lug"" appears, which is ""blue."" ""walm,"" a new term, also corresponds to ""blue."" This input is not immediately helpful for deducing ""bluf"" alone as it is between two ""yellow"" instances, so we need to look at more examples.

3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
   ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which produces ""yellow."" In this instance, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow,"" which conflicts with our initial hypothesis from the first example.

4. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""green."" This again conflicts with our prior deductions.

5. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""
   In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif."" It continues to correspond with the output for ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

From the examples provided, it seems ""bluf"" does not consistently correspond to a specific color; instead, it mirrors the color of the word that precedes it:

- In examples 1 and 2, it seems to be ""red"" as it follows ""wif"" (""red"").
- In example 3, it follows ""zup"" and takes the color ""yellow.""
- In examples 4 and 5, it follows ""dax"" and takes the color ""green.""

The rule that can be derived from the examples is:

bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word (or takes on the output associated with the word that directly precedes it)

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is contextual; it replicates the output color associated with the word immediately before it.",-0.13173195835877108,34,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> The color represented by the word preceding bluf, repeated as many times as there are letters in the word preceding it.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" entails duplicating the color of the word before it (wif -> red) twice because ""wif"" has three letters.
- The second example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" converts to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" follows it, resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated twice (as ""zup"" is three letters long).
- For ""zup bluf,"" we simply get ""yellow yellow,"" which fits the same pattern.
- ""zup dax bluf"" gives us ""yellow green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" causes the color of ""dax"" (green) to be duplicated since ""dax"" has four letters.
- Lastly, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" outputs ""blue red green green red blue."" In this string, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and thus ""green"" is duplicated.

Based on these findings, we derive that ""bluf"" instructs us to take the color associated with the word immediately before it and repeat it as many times as there are letters in that word.

Therefore, the rule is as follows: bluf -> The color of the preceding word, repeated the number of times equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.",-0.14906606908156622,34,bluf
"bluf -> repeated color of the previous word. Rule:

Looking at the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to cause the next color to repeat the color that was output before ""bluf"" was mentioned. Analyzing each input and output pair:

- ""wif bluf lug"" becomes ""red red blue"" - ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to repeat.
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" becomes ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"" - ""bluf"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat twice because it's mentioned twice after ""zup"".
- ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"" - ""bluf"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat once.
- ""zup dax bluf"" becomes ""yellow green green"" - ""bluf"" causes ""green"" to repeat.
- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" becomes ""blue red green green red blue"" - ""bluf"" causes ""green"" to repeat.

"Rule: bluf -> doubles the color of the previous word.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red blue,"" which means ""bluf"" doubles the red before adding blue.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow."" The rest continues the pattern of doubling the previous color before concluding with blue (since ""lug"" corresponds to blue, it's ""blue blue blue"" in the end).
- In the third example, since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" again confirming the rule.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the result is ""green green,"" doubling the green.
- In the last example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" thus ""bluf"" results in ""green green"" before concluding with blue, and the pattern holds for the entire input-output sequence.

So, bluf -> doubles the color of the previous word before adding blue.",-0.9593120691100004,34,bluf

Rule: ""bluf"" directly translates to the color blue.",-1.8417800044578319,34,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the correlation between the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input and the color repeated in the output. We can ignore the other words for now which seem to translate consistently into specific colors (e.g., ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red).

Let's analyze the examples line by line:

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output after ""zup"" is repeated ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output after ""dax"" is repeated ""green.""

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output after ""wif"" is repeated ""red.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output after ""zup"" is repeated ""yellow.""

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- Analysis of this instance is a bit more complicated. ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and after the first ""walm"", the output is repeated ""red."" Later, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and the output after ""lug"" is repeated ""blue.""

From the above patterns, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it causes the color corresponding to the word just before it to be repeated in the output.

Thus, the meaning can be written as:

walm -> causes the color represented by the previous word to be repeated",-0.08079403180433961,34,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each sentence and its corresponding output.

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Looking at the pattern of outputs whenever ""walm"" appears, it's clear that ""walm"" doesn't correspond to a consistent output color like the other words do. Instead, when ""walm"" appears, the color that follows it is dependent on some context provided by previous words. From the first and fourth examples, it seems that ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color that directly follows the word ""zup."" However, the fifth example shows a different pattern, where after ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

Let's consider the second and third examples:
- ""dax walm wif dax"" leads to ""green green green red green."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""green"" which is the same as the color represented by ""dax"" before it.
- ""dax lug wif walm"" results in ""green blue red red red."" In this case, the color red repeats, which is also the color corresponding to ""wif,"" the word preceding ""walm.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" takes the color of the word immediately before it and repeats it. In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" turns into ""red red,"" and ""lug walm"" turns into ""blue blue,"" reinforcing this rule.

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",-0.08319583570922641,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's look for patterns in how it's used in the input and how it relates to the output. We'll go through each example and see what we can find.

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
- Here, ""walm"" seems to result in a sequence of three ""yellow"" outputs.

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- ""walm"" is followed by two greens, but this does not align with our first observation as we don't see three ""yellow"" outputs here.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
- Again, ""walm"" results in repeated colors, this time three ""red.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- In this example, ""walm"" once again leads to three occurrences of ""yellow,"" matching our first observation.

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- In the first occurrence, ""walm"" results in three ""red,"" and in the second occurrence, it results in three ""blue.""

From all these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" seems to cause the next color word to be repeated three times. In the inputs, ""walm"" is followed by another color word or is at the end, suggesting that it influences the next color word. However, in one example (""dax walm wif dax""), the expected repetition does not completely follow this pattern, indicating that there may be an exception or additional rule when ""wif"" comes after ""walm.""

To consolidate the findings, the initial interpretation could be expressed in the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the next color word to be outputted three times.

However, due to the inconsistent example, we should refine the rule to account for the influence of the word that comes after ""walm"":

Rule refinement: When ""walm"" is followed by a color word, that color is repeated three times. If ""walm"" is directly followed by ""wif,"" there seems to be an alteration in this pattern, where the repetition of the color word is interrupted by the word ""red."" If ""walm"" is at the end, it defaults to repeating ""yellow"" three times, perhaps indicating that the default or unspecified color in this system is ""yellow.""",-0.0864990457674717,34,walm
"By analyzing the given examples, I will try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" as well as the rules for the other words if necessary.

1. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - The word ""zup"" appears twice and leads to ""yellow"" both times.
   - The word ""wif"" leads to ""red"".
   - The word ""lug"" leads to ""blue"".

2. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
   - The word ""dax"" seems to lead to ""green"".
   - The word ""wif"" still leads to ""red"".

3. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
   - ""dax"" still leads to ""green"".
   - ""lug"" still leads to ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" still leads to ""red"".

4. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" still leads to ""blue"".
   - ""wif"" still leads to ""red"".
   - ""dax"" still leads to ""green"".
   - ""zup"" still leads to ""yellow"".

5. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" still leads to ""red"".
   - ""dax"" still leads to ""green"".
   - ""zup"" still leads to ""yellow"".
   - ""lug"" still leads to ""blue"".

What we can observe is that the color output for ""walm"" seems to vary. 

Let's deduce the rule for ""walm"":
- In example 1, the word following ""walm"" is missing and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". 
- In example 2, the word following ""walm"" is ""wif"" and the color is ""red"", but the output is ""green green green"".
- In example 3, the word following ""walm"" is missing and the output is ""red red red"".
- In example 4, the word following ""walm"" is missing and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In example 5, the word following ""walm"" is ""dax"" and the color is ""green"", but the output is ""blue blue blue"".

It appears that ""walm"" may cause a repetition of the next color three times. However, in examples where there is no word after ""walm"", the repetition is of the last color mentioned three times:

- In example 1, the last color before ""walm"" is blue, so after ""walm"" it's yellow, which is blue's complementary color repeated three times.
- In example 3, the last color before ""walm"" is red, which is repeated three times after ""walm"" itself.
- In example 4, the last color before ""walm"" is yellow, so after ""walm"" it's yellow, repeated three times.

However, this rule doesn't hold for example 5. It's clear that there's a word following ""walm"" (""dax"") in this example, which suggests ""walm"" then involves a transformation of the color associated with the word following it, repeated three times. 

Thus, it seems ""walm"" might invert the color that would normally follow based on the pattern observed (red -> green, green -> blue). However, without a clearer pattern of the transformation or additional examples to solidify this assumption, it is difficult to define a definite rule for ""walm"".

Given this uncertainty and the complexity of the patterns, the best tentative rule I can suggest is:
 
Rule: When ""walm"" is present, it causes a repetition of a color or a transformation of a color to be repeated three times. The specific repeated color may depend on the word that follows ""walm"" or may be the inverse or complement of the color associated with the preceding word in cases where there is no following word.

However, without further information or examples, it's challenging to define a precise rule for ""walm"". It would be helpful to have additional examples to test the inverse or complementary color hypothesis further.",-0.13909740241,34,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at what is common in each of the outputs whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, while also considering the surrounding words.

From the first input-output pair, we can't determine much alone since ""walm"" occurs once, but the sequence is ""zup walm"" and the color output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

In the second pair, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green red green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" could be related to the color green in some way, but also considering the red in between, which could indicate a change due to ""wif.""

In the third sequence, ""walm"" occurs at the end again and is preceded by ""wif,"" which leads to the output ""red red red.""

In the fourth sequence, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the colors are ""yellow yellow yellow,"" as in the first example.

In the fifth sequence, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and ""wif,"" resulting in the output ""blue blue blue.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it unless ""wif"" is directly preceding it, in which case it changes to red. Let's construct the rule based on this:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the previous word. If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" then the color is red. 

Now, applying this rule:

1. In the first input-output pair: ""zup wif lug zup walm"", ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so it repeats ""yellow"" three times, as it confirms with the output ""yellow yellow yellow.""

2. In the second input-output pair: ""dax walm wif dax,"" ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" resulting in ""green green,"" but the presence of ""wif"" before ""dax"" changes the color to red, resulting in the output ""green green red green.""

3. In the third input-output pair: ""dax lug wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" so the color is red and it is repeated, matching the output ""red red red.""

4. In the fourth input-output pair: ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" follows it directly without ""wif"" in between, therefore repeating yellow, resulting in the output ""yellow yellow yellow.""

5. In the fifth input-output pair: ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" the sequence starts with ""wif walm,"" meaning ""walm"" is red and repeated because of the preceding ""wif,"" then follows the colors for ""dax"" and ""zup,"" and finally ""wif lug walm."" Since ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue.""

- When the input includes ""wif,"" the output includes ""red.""
- When the input includes ""zup,"" the output includes ""yellow.""
- When the input includes ""dax,"" the output includes ""green.""
- When the input includes ""lug,"" the output includes ""blue.""
- When the input includes ""walm,"" the output includes ""yellow,"" but this is deduced from a single instance.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each instance of walm and its surrounding context to find patterns.

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red 
   
2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   
3. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   
4. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   
5. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

From these examples, we can see that every time ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" repeated as many times as there are letters in the word ""walm."" Since ""walm"" has four letters, the color is repeated four times. 

Let's validate this by looking at each example:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we have ""red"" repeated three times.

2. ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, ""yellow"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

3. ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which has already been established to correspond to ""red,"" so ""red"" is repeated three times.

4. Here, ""walm"" occurs twice, first after ""dax,"" corresponding to ""green,"" and then after ""wif,"" corresponding to ""red."" Both times, the respective colors are repeated three times.

5. ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

Considering this pattern, we can define the word ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> This nonce word indicates to repeat the color output associated with the preceding word three times. Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times.",-0.08345739278724139,35,walm
"The examples provided suggest that ""walm"" is a word that outputs a series of ""red."" To determine the specific rule, it's important to look at the number and pattern of reds following ""walm"" in each example against the context of the other words.

Let's review the examples with this in mind:

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
Here, ""walm"" is preceded by one instance of the word ""wif"" and followed by three instances of ""red.""

2. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red""
In this example, ""walm"" follows two other words (""dax"" and ""zup"") and is followed by one ""red"" and then another ""wif."" 

3. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red""
Here, ""walm"" follows the sequence ""lug wif zup wif"" and is followed by three ""red.""

4. ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green red red red""
In this example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by three ""red,"" then it appears again after a ""wif"" followed by another three ""red.""

5. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
In this example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by three ""red,"" but the pattern is not directly present due to the word ""lug"" influencing the output.

By examining all the examples and specifically focusing on the pattern following ""walm"", we can induce that ""walm"" corresponds to a triplet of ""red"":

Rule: ""walm"" translates to ""red red red"", irrespective of the preceding words.

Thus, the rule is:

walm -> red red red",-0.08929697151080465,35,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" has the following behavior:

- The output generated by ""walm"" is a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.
- The repetition quantity is equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.

For instance:
- In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" has three letters, and the output is ""red red red"" (3 times ""red"").
- In ""dax zup walm wif"", ""wif"" follows ""walm"", and we have ""yellow yellow yellow red"" because ""zup"" (which precedes ""walm"") has three letters.
- In ""lug wif zup wif walm"", ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"", generating ""red red red"" since ""wif"" has three letters.
- In ""dax walm wif walm"", ""walm"" is first preceded by ""dax"" which has three letters resulting in ""green green green"", and then ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" which also has three letters, so the pattern repeats with ""red red red"".
- In ""zup walm lug"", ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and has three letters, resulting in ""blue blue blue"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word associated with the immediately preceding word as many times as there are letters in that word.",-0.6153379104094254,35,walm
"Rule: walm -> red repeated by the number of preceding words.

Explanation:
In each example, the output for ""walm"" is a sequence of ""red""s. The number of ""red""s corresponds to the number of words before ""walm"" in the input.

- Input: ""wif walm"" has 1 word before ""walm,"" so the output is 1 ""red.""
- Input: ""dax zup walm wif"" has 2 words before ""walm,"" and hence ""walm"" translates to 2 ""red""s.
- Input: ""lug wif zup wif walm"" has 4 words before ""walm,"" so ""walm"" outputs 4 ""red""s.
- Input: ""dax walm wif walm"" is a special case where ""walm"" appears twice. The first ""walm"" follows 1 word, and the second ""walm"" follows 3 words (including the first ""walm""), resulting in a total of 1 + 3 = 4 ""red""s for the second ""walm.""
- Input: ""zup walm lug"" has 1 word before ""walm,"" resulting in 1 ""red.""


Based on this, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it outputs ""red"" a number of times equal to the number of words that precede it in the input string.",-0.742260148834138,35,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the output patterns in response to the given inputs. Notice how the output changes when ""walm"" is present versus other words.

- Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, a sequence of ""red red red"" follows it in the output.
- The output sequence ""red red red"" is exclusive to the presence of ""walm"" in the input. No other input word generates this sequence.
- The word ""walm"" does not seem to affect the colors that precede its sequence ""red red red"" in the output, indicating that its meaning might be an independent quantity.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" corresponds to the output sequence ""red red red"". Therefore, we can express the rule for ""walm"" as the following:

Rule: Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, it is represented by the output sequence ""red red red.""

Based on example 3, ""bluf"" occurs between two colors (""yellow"" and ""blue"") that do not follow the red-blue pattern. However, the ""bluf"" here corresponds to an additional ""yellow"" in the output, suggesting that the appearance of ""zup"" before ""bluf"" alters the usual output pattern.

Looking for a consistency in context where ""bluf"" doesn't depend on adjacent words (e.g., ""wif"") and the output color is consistent, we can review example 4, where ""bluf"" appears with ""wif"" and it results in doubling the ""red"" output.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In this sequence, we can confirm that ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The word ""wif"" appears again followed by ""bluf,"" which leads to the output ""red red."" We can presume that ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" likely corresponds to ""red"" as well.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both lead to ""red.""

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which leads to ""red red red."" 

Considering that ""wif"" comes before double instances of ""red"" when following other words but corresponds to a single ""red"" when following ""zup,"" one might initially think that ""wif"" could mean ""double red"" or ""repeat the color,"" but the input where ""walam"" follows ""wif"" leads to three ""red"" outputs, not two. This could indicate that ""walm"" affects the rule of ""wif.""

However, ""wif"" consistently results in at least one ""red"" in the output, so our most straightforward conclusion would be that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in all instances. The additional ""red(s)"" in the output when ""wif"" is followed by another word seem to be dictated by that following word, not by ""wif"" itself.

Therefore, based on the information provided:

"Rule: walm -> repeat the last color spoken as many times as there were unique words since the last occurrence of the word ""walm"" (or from the start if ""walm"" has not appeared before). 

Here's the explanation for each input/output:

- Input: dax walm 
  Output: green green green
  (There is one unique word before walm, ""dax"" which is green, so repeat green three times because ""green"" is the last color and there were three words including the word walm itself.)
  
- Input: zup lug walm 
  Output: yellow blue blue blue
  (Two unique words before walm, ""zup"" which is yellow and ""lug"" which is blue, so repeat the last color mentioned, blue, four times including the word walm.)

- Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug

  (There are three unique words before walm, ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" (red), and ""wif"" (does not have a color but is considered for the count of unique words). The last color mentioned before ""walm"" is red, so it is repeated seven times including the word walm itself.)

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Input: dax walm

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

By analyzing the examples, we can notice that whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the last color word mentioned before ""walm"", with the number of repetitions equalling the number of words between ""walm"" and the preceding color word. Let's examine each example:

- When we have ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- With ""zup lug walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated four times.
- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" the last color word before ""walm"" is ""red"" (which corresponds to ""wif""), and the output is ""red"" repeated three times before the final ""blue"" for the ""lug"" after ""walm.""
- ""Dax walm"" once again results in ""green"" repeated three times.
- Lastly, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" gives us ""yellow"" repeated six times, as ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and there are five words between the last ""zup"" and ""walm.""

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color word preceding ""walm"" as many times as there are words between it and ""walm.""",-0.10459013978124418,37,walm
"Observing the provided examples, we can try to identify a pattern between the input and output to deduce the meaning of ""walm"".

First, we find the ""walm"" outputs only have one color repeated multiple times. Thus, ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of one color.

To identify which color is chosen for the repetition, we can notice:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", implying that ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in the color green being repeated three times.
- ""zup lug walm"" generates ""yellow blue blue blue"", which suggests that the color immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated for the rest of the output.
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"", indicating that ""walm"" causes the pattern to repeat ""red"", the color corresponding to ""wif"", the word before ""walm"".
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"", which further supports the idea that the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" is repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, for a count equal to the total number of words in the input after excluding ""walm"".

- In the first example, ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" 'Dax' has three letters, and 'green' is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""lug"" correlates to ""blue."" There are three letters in ""lug,"" so the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""

"Through examining each example, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" by correlating it with the respective outputs.

Here's a breakdown of the inputs and outputs where ""bluf"" is mentioned:

1. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf | Output: red green yellow red green green
   - ""bluf"" aligns with the color ""green"".

2. Input: wif bluf dax lug | Output: red red green blue
   - ""bluf"" aligns with the color ""red"".

3. Input: dax lug bluf wif | Output: green blue blue red
   - ""bluf"" aligns with the color ""blue"".

4. Input: lug wif lug bluf | Output: blue red blue blue
   - ""bluf"" aligns with the color ""blue"".

5. Input: dax lug bluf | Output: green blue blue
   - ""bluf"" aligns with the color ""blue"".

We can observe that ""bluf"" aligns with different colors in different contexts:

In the first occurrence, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" but in the second example, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"". However, in the third, fourth, and fifth occurrences, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".

It seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that precedes it when it is used in a sequence:

- In example 1, ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") comes before ""bluf"", hence ""bluf"" results in ""green"".
- In example 2, ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") comes before ""bluf"", hence ""bluf"" results in ""red"".
- In examples 3, 4, and 5, ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") comes before ""bluf"", hence ""bluf"" results in ""blue"".

Given this pattern, we can infer a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.",-0.09304303174242529,38,bluf
"Examining the input and output pairs, the following associations can be identified:

- ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red""
- ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green""
- ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Now let's look only at the positions where ""bluf"" appears and its corresponding outputs:

1. Input: ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> Output: ""red green yellow red green green""  
   ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and translates to ""green"".

2. Input: ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> Output: ""red red green blue""  
   ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and translates to ""red"".

3. Input: ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> Output: ""green blue blue red""  
   ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"".

4. Input: ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> Output: ""blue red blue blue""  
   ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" and again translates to ""blue"".

5. Input: ""dax lug bluf"" -> Output: ""green blue blue""  
   ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"" again.

The pattern indicates that ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word before it.",-0.09486854347072408,38,bluf
"Based on the examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" can be deduced by looking at the output that corresponds to the input where ""bluf"" appears. Comparing the inputs and outputs:

1. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
2. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
3. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
4. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
5. dax lug bluf -> green blue blue

From the outputs, we notice that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in outputs (4) and (5), but it corresponds to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" in output (1), and ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"" in outputs (2) and (3). This suggests that ""bluf"" indicates repeating the color that corresponds to the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence.",-0.11578373747749425,38,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it looks like ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue. In each instance where ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue."" 

However, considering that in the second example ""lug"" also corresponds to blue, there might be a contextual rule. Looking at all the given examples carefully:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is blue.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is red.
- The output for ""lug"" changes from blue to red when directly following ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" becomes the same color as the preceding word unless it is ""wif,"" after which ""bluf"" translates to red.

Rule: bluf -> follows the color of the word before it but is red if the preceding word is ""wif.""",-1.1405336073773562,38,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> blue

The relationship between the input nonce words and the colored outputs suggests that each nonce word corresponds to a color. By examining the outputs where ""bluf"" appears and comparing them to the inputs, we see that whenever ""bluf"" is used, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Thus, ""bluf"" equates to the color blue.",-1.5325004007994256,38,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to determine the color that precedes it. The pattern seems to indicate that ""walm"" causes the word before it to be repeated in its corresponding color in the output. Here is how the rule applies to each input and its output:

In the first example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"":
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- The presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green"" before yellow, which represents ""zup"". It doubles the green color which is coming from ""dax"".

In the second example, ""lug walm dax"":
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- The presence of ""walm"" immediately after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue"", followed by green for ""dax"".

In the third and fourth examples, ""dax walm"":
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- The presence of ""walm"" immediately after ""dax"" results in ""green green green"".

In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif"":
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- The presence of ""walm"" immediately after ""dax"" results in ""green green green"", followed by red for ""wif"".

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",-0.29965823728805197,38,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the subsequent words (if any) to repeat the color associated with ""dax"" up until a new word is introduced. In the given examples, ""dax"" corresponds with the color green. Therefore, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" any repeated use of ""dax"" or continuation with ""walm"" results in the color green being repeated.

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and before the introduction of a new word ""zup,"" green is repeated.
2. ""lug walm dax"" - ""walm"" directly follows ""lug,"" thus resulting in the repetition of ""lug's"" color, blue.
3. ""dax walm"" - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" thus the color green is repeated.
4. ""dax walm"" - This is similar to the third example.
5. ""dax walm wif"" - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and before a new word ""wif,"" the color green is repeated.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it repeats the color of the preceding word until another non-""walm"" word is mentioned. If ""walm"" is the first word or preceded by a different word, it takes on the color of the word it follows. If it is preceded by ""dax,"" which is green, ""walm"" will result in repeating the color green.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates into a sequence of colors. The rule for what ""bluf"" means seems to be dependent on the words that precede it. Let us consider the patterns:

1. When the word ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
2. When the word ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" whether directly (""lug dax bluf"") or with ""wif"" and ""walm"" in between (""wif walm lug bluf""), the output includes ""blue."" Notably, ""lug dax bluf"" results in a repetition of ""green"" after ""blue,"" suggesting that ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
3. When the word ""zup"" is present (""zup wif bluf"" and ""zup walm lug wif bluf""), ""yellow"" appears in the output.

From these observations, we might infer the following relationships:
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and has a potential influence on the color sequences that follow.
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" seems to act as a signal to repeat the output colors of the words that come before it in the sequence.

Considering these patterns, here is the rule induction for ""bluf"":

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the repeated output of the color that is mentioned just before it. Here's the reasoning:

- In the first two examples, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red"". Thus, ""wif"" might mean ""red"", and ""bluf"" causes the preceding color to be repeated.

- In the third example, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" amidst other colors, and the output sequence ends with ""red red"", which again suggests ""bluf"" repeats the color red which is associated with ""wif"".

- In the fourth example, ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"", and the output sequence is ""blue green green"", suggesting that the presence of ""bluf"" causes the color green associated with ""dax"" to be repeated.

- In the fifth example, ""lug"" and ""walm"" come before ""bluf"", and the output is ""red red red blue blue"", which again shows the colors blue and red being repeated as associated with ""lug"" and ""walm"", respectively.

"To discern the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" examine the commonalities in each input-output pair where ""bluf"" appears:

- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue yellow yellow""
- ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""green green red blue""

From the examples, we can observe that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color it corresponds to in the output is the same as the color for the word immediately preceding it:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and both correspond to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" takes on the meaning (color) of the word that directly precedes it. Thus, we can write the rule as:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning - Bluf corresponds to the color of the word that directly precedes it in the input sequence.",-0.10071850167861902,41,bluf
"From the examples provided, you can deduce the rule based on the correlation between the input and the output.

In the given examples, every time the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is outputted. When ""zup"" is mentioned, ""yellow"" follows. For ""wif"", it's ""red"", and ""lug"" is consistently associated with ""blue"".

Now, let's look closely at ""bluf"". In every instance where ""bluf"" is present, it is followed by a ""yellow"" in the output.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows two occurrences of ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow yellow"". This implies that ""bluf"" seems to be translated as ""yellow"" in this context.
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"", supporting the notion that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".
- In the third example, we see ""lug zup bluf"", which corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow""; again, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"".
- The fourth example ""zup wif bluf"" gives us ""yellow red red"". It's critical to observe here that ""bluf"" cannot be ""red"" because ""wif"" is already consistently mapped to ""red"". This implies ""bluf"" is resulting in the second ""red"" due to a rule specific to this context, likely a repetition of the color before it – in this case, ""red"". However, considering the other inputs, one could find this incongruent with the regular pattern observed.
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf wif lug"", the output is ""green green red blue"". This suggests that ""bluf"" translated to ""green"" following ""dax"".

Given the somewhat inconsistent translation in the fourth example but consistent ""yellow"" in the other contexts, we might propose that the default rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the color that comes before it, and in cases where ""bluf"" is the first word or follows a word that doesn't have a color mapping, it defaults to ""yellow"".

Here's the proposed rule:

Bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows a color-associated word, it repeats the color of the word before it. If ""bluf"" is the first word or follows a word without a color association, it defaults to yellow.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat previous color; if initial or no previous color, then ""yellow"". 

This rule is consistent with examples 1, 2, 3, and 5. However, example 4 seems to offer a conflicting case that does not fit the proposed rule exactly due to the ""red red"" output, unless ""bluf"" specifically can also translate to the color ""red"" after ""wif"", which is against the consistency observed. Since examples are generally more reliable than exceptions, unless more data is given that consistently shows ""bluf"" translating to a color other than the previous color or yellow, the proposed rule stands as the most logical deduction based on the current examples.",-0.5850052669100715,41,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with the word that precedes it. If we analyze each case:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which again corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"".
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"".

From the data, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence. Therefore,

- In ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax,"" 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue.'
- In ""dax zup lug bluf,"" 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue.'

From this analysis, it appears there is an inconsistency in the observations for the word 'bluf'. In most cases (examples 3-5), 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue.' However, in the first two examples, 'bluf' does not translate to 'blue,' which creates a contradiction.

Given this contradiction, there might be a context-dependent rule for 'bluf' that isn't immediately apparent, or there could be errors in the dataset or an insufficient number of examples to deduce an accurate rule.

Observations:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", which suggests that ""walm"" could mean ""yellow"" in this context since ""zup"" also outputs ""yellow"".
2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is always ""red red red"", implying ""walm"" could also mean ""red"" following ""wif"".
3. The outputs consistent of three colors in sequence, which suggests ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of a color three times.
4. ""walm"" can change its meaning based on the preceding word.

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" is a modifier that repeats the color word preceding it three times. Therefore:

""walm"" when following ""zup"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
""walm"" when following ""wif"" repeats ""red"" three times.

- ""dax zup walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"".

The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color indicated by the word preceding it, except when the preceding word is ""dax,"" in which case ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""

Let's analyze the given examples to determine the rule:

- In ""lug dax bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is the same color as ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

- In ""zup bluf,"" the ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and it takes on the same color as ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

From this analysis, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: bluf -> meaning.
- If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- If the preceding word is any other word that translates to a color, then ""bluf"" means the same color as the preceding word.

This rule appears consistent with the examples given.",-0.5412106764780227,43,bluf
"According to the examples provided, the word bluf seems to correspond to repeating the color associated with the word preceding it. In the instances where bluf appears directly after another nonce word, the color output is doubled for the color associated with that nonce word. Here's how it appears to work, based on the input/output pairs:

1. When bluf follows the nonce word 'lug' (lug bluf), the output is 'blue green green'. 'Lug' must mean 'blue', thus 'bluf' in this context means 'green', repeating the color that 'dax' stands for since 'dax' directly precedes 'bluf'.

2. When 'bluf' follows 'wif' (wif bluf), the output is 'red red'. Here, 'wif' is associated with the color 'red', and 'bluf' repeats that color, yielding 'red' again.

3. When 'bluf' follows 'dax' multiple times (wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif), the output seems to maintain this pattern. 'Dax' corresponds to 'green,' and thus after 'dax,' 'bluf' produces 'green' again.

4. Similarly, with 'zup' leading to the output 'yellow,' when 'bluf' follows 'zup' (zup bluf), the output is 'yellow yellow'. The same pattern of 'bluf' repeating the color of the word that precedes it continues.

Therefore the rule for 'bluf' is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding nonce word. If 'bluf' is preceded by a nonce word that translates to a color, the output for 'bluf' will be that color again.",-0.6673776044737499,43,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" mirrors the color stated by the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, ""bluf"" defaults to red.

- In ""wif bluf,"" where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output for ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" also becomes red.

4. Input: lug walm dax

5. Input: lug walm zup

We notice that every time the word ""walm"" appears, the color of the output that corresponds to it is directly repeated from the color before it. For example, in the first input, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and the first appearance of ""walm"" thereafter gives ""blue"" as well.

   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

4. ""lug walm dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

5. ""lug walm zup"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Looking at these patterns, ""walm"" appears multiple times in each sequence and the outputs suggest a repeated color corresponding to the color of the previous word.

For instance, in example 1, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" then ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""blue blue."" In example 4, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output of ""walm"" is ""blue blue"" again.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it doubles the color of the word right before it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word twice.",-0.07854488771043962,43,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to discern a pattern for the word ""walm"" that correlates with the output. Here are the observations:

1. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   - After the word ""lug,"" which translates to blue, we see additional ""blue"" for each occurrence of ""walm""; ""wif"" translates to red and also repeats for the second ""walm.""

2. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""
   - The word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is red, and thus ""red"" is repeated; ""dax"" translates to green afterward.

3. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""
   - Post ""wif,"" which is red, ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""red;"" then ""lug"" and ""zup"" appear as blue and yellow without repetition.

4. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
   - The word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), resulting in the repetition of ""blue;"" ""dax"" follows and is green.

5. ""lug walm zup"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow""
   - Similar to the previous, ""walm"" repeats the color from ""lug"" (blue).

From the examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat. If a different word follows, ""walm"" does not repeat the color of the new word. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the immediately preceding word to be repeated in the output for each occurrence of ""walm."" If a new word without a ""walm"" follows, the pattern is interrupted and the corresponding color of the new word is introduced without repetition.

Walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence.",-0.08738617016595601,43,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns surrounding its usage and the corresponding outputs in the examples provided. Analyzing each instance where 'walm' appears:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif walm"" and the output sequence is ""blue blue red red red"". Since ""wif"" is consistently associated with ""red"" in all other examples, it appears that ""walm"" is associated with ""blue"" here.
  
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""red red red green"". Again, ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green"", so ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red"" here.
  
- In the third example, ""wif walm lug"" together yield ""red red red blue"". With ""wif"" being ""red"" and ""lug"" being ""blue"", ""walm"" seems to produce ""red"" again.

- In the fourth example, ""walm dax"" give us ""blue blue green"". With ""dax"" as ""green,"" the ""walm"" before it suggests a ""blue"" output.

- In the fifth example, ""walm zup"" results in ""blue blue yellow"". We know ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" must correspond to ""blue"" in this context.

Through these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the color associated with the immediately following word within the output sequence, except when it follows ""wif,"" in which case it produces ""red"".

Thus, when ""walm"" precedes ""lug"" or ""zup,"" it generates ""blue blue,"" and when it is followed by ""dax,"" it gives us ""blue green."" When it comes after ""wif,"" such as in ""wif walm,"" it results in ""red red."" This implies a rule where ""walm"" may alter its meaning depending on its position relative to ""wif"" or the type of word that follows it.

Using the above-indicated rule, walm can be defined as the following:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" duplicates the color associated with the next word, unless it directly follows ""wif,” in which case the meaning is ""red"".",-0.8056383422301101,43,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the output of three consecutive colors that correspond to the preceding word. It also introduces a shift in the color sequence. Here's how ""walm"" is working in the given context:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", and ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"". ""Walm"" is used after ""lug"" and ""wif"", repeating their respective colors thrice.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"", again repeating the color corresponding to ""wif"" three times.
- A similar pattern follows in the remaining examples.

Hence, the rule could be stated as:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" if it's preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red,"" if by ""dax,"" then ""green green green,"" and so forth.

So the definition:

walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.9515817122278026,43,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can try to find a consistent meaning or rule for the word ""lug."" 

- In the first example, ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue."" Since ""wif"" appears in other examples corresponding to ""red,"" we might tentatively assign ""lug"" the meaning ""blue.""
- In the second example, we have the same input and output as in the first, reinforcing our initial tentative assignment.
- The third example, ""lug bluf zup,"" corresponds to ""blue blue yellow."" We know ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and if ""lug"" indeed means ""blue,"" then it would follow that ""bluf"" could mean ""blue"" as well, but we might suspect there's an error or special rule, as ""bluf"" is close to but not the same as ""lug.""
- The fourth example, ""wif dax wif lug wif,"" translates to ""red green red blue red."" Here, ""dax"" seems to consistently mean ""green,"" ""wif"" is still ""red,"" and our tentative meaning for ""lug"" remains ""blue,"" fitting into the pattern.
- The fifth example, ""zup dax lug,"" gives ""yellow green blue."" Again, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" appears to consistently correspond to ""blue.""

"Based on the provided examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf."" To do this, we will examine the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding output colors.

In the first example:

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" is also green, and ""zup"" is yellow.

In the second example:
Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is red, and ""dax"" is green.

In the third example:
Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green

""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and ""dax"" is green.

In the fourth example:
Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red

""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is yellow when preceded by ""zup"", and ""zup"" is yellow.

In the fifth example:
Input: zup bluf lug zup
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow

""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" is yellow after ""zup"", ""lug"" is blue.

When analyzing the examples, two consistent patterns emerge:

1. The color of ""bluf"" seems to match the color of the word immediately preceding it unless it is the first word, in which case it's green.

2. The colors for other words seem consistent: ""dax"" is always green, ""wif"" always red, ""zup"" always yellow, and ""lug"" always blue.

Given these observations, we can deduce a possible meaning for ""bluf"":

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it; if ""bluf"" is the first word, it is green.

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by another word, it has the same color as that word; if it is the first word in the sequence, its color is green.",-0.08879300140653332,44,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will analyze the output color associated with it in each example relative to its position and surrounding words.

Here's what we know from the provided examples:
1. In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" corresponds with ""green.""
2. In ""wif bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red.""
3. In ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax,"" ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red.""
4. In ""wif bluf zup bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow.""
5. In ""zup bluf lug zup,"" ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow.""

Analysis:
- In examples 1 and 2, the color that corresponds with ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that precedes it: ""dax"" or ""wif.""
- In example 3, the pattern is consistent with example 2, where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""
- Examples 4 and 5 show that when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""yellow."" Also, in example 4, when repeated after ""zup,"" its color remains ""yellow,"" indicating that the color may not change with repetition.
- A ""bluf"" is not directly associated with a single consistent color; instead, its output color depends on the context—in this case, the word that comes before it.

Considering these points, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on the word immediately preceding it. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it is ""green."" When it follows ""wif,"" it is ""red,"" and when it follows ""zup,"" it is ""yellow."" Thus, the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be a rule for a color change based on the preceding word's association.

bluf -> This word changes the associated color based on the preceding word: following ""dax"" it is ""green,"" following ""wif"" it is ""red,"" and following ""zup"" it is ""yellow.""
",-0.4002373733898889,44,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" or ""wif,"" the output is green for ""dax"" and red for ""wif,"" regardless of the sequence (e.g., green follows ""dax"" and red follows ""wif"").
2. When ""zup"" is used, it correlates with a yellow output in all instances.
3. ""Lug"" correlates with a blue output wherever it appears.

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" doesn't directly affect the color outcome but rather allows for the word directly following it to influence the output according to its own rule. In other words, ""bluf"" does not have a consistent output that accompanies it; instead, it serves as a placeholder that permits the following word to determine the color.

To confirm this observation, we can see that whenever a color word comes after ""bluf,"" that color is represented in the output:

- ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and the resulting color is green.
- ""zup"" follows ""bluf"" and the resulting color is yellow.

Looking at the third example, ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and results in red, ""lug"" follows ""wif"" and yields blue, and ""dax"" follows ""lug"" and yields green.

The fourth example also confirms this rule since ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" which yields yellow, and again by ""bluf,"" then followed by ""wif,"" which gives red.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" allows the word following it to output its associated color.

Rule: bluf -> allows the following word to determine the output color, serving as a placeholder without a color association of its own.",-0.7256974629869556,44,bluf
"Rule: Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" and it translates to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or ""dax"". There are no instances where ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", so we cannot determine what it would mean in that context. Additionally, ""bluf"" does not precede any of the words, so we don't know what it means in that position either. 

Therefore, a tentative rule for ""bluf"" could be that its meaning is dependent on the word it follows, with the current examples giving us:

- wif bluf -> red 
- zup bluf -> yellow 
- dax bluf -> yellow

Note: This conclusion is based on the limited examples provided, and additional examples could potentially alter the rule.",-0.9255380938089998,44,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""red"" in the second example but with ""yellow"" in the first, third, fourth, and fifth examples. To discern a pattern, we need to look at the words that accompany ""bluf.""

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is yellow.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output color is red.
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is yellow.
4. When ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" the output color is yellow.

A noticeable pattern is that the color associated with ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that precedes it:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color is red.
- Otherwise, the color is yellow, no matter if ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""zup,"" or precedes ""wif.""

In this first example, the word bluf corresponds to the second yellow in the output. Since yellow is already associated with zup, this suggests that bluf maps to the same color as a word that is directly preceding it.

Let's test this with the other examples:

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Here, bluf maps to red, which is the same color as the word right before it (wif).

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

In this example, bluf maps to green, which is the same as the word before it (dax).

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

Again, bluf maps to red, which is the same as the word before it (wif).

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

Here, bluf maps to yellow, which is the same as the word before it (zup).

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" maps to the same color as the word that directly precedes it in the input sequence.

Therefore, bluf -> meaning. Meaning: bluf represents the color of the word that precedes it.",-0.09350793675184613,45,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's match each ""bluf"" occurrence in the inputs to its corresponding word in the outputs:

1. Input: wif dax zup bluf -> Output: red green yellow yellow
2. Input: wif bluf zup -> Output: red red yellow
3. Input: dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow
4. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue
5. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf -> Output: green red green yellow yellow

Looking at the patterns, we can deduce:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

To find the rule for ""bluf,"" we notice that:
- In all cases, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is identical to the color that appears right before it. For instance:
  - In input 1 and input 5, the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""
  - In input 3, the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green.""
  - In input 2, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
  - In input 4, the output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" matching the preceding ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""bluf"" is that it takes the same color as the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> The same color as the previous word.",-0.09364237650529665,45,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can infer the meaning of ""bluf"" based on its pairing with other nonce words and the corresponding output colors:

1. In the first example, ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow."" We observe that ""wif"" means ""red,"" ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" is the only word left and the corresponding output color is the second ""yellow,"" it likely means ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow."" We already identified ""wif"" as ""red"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red,"" this reinforces our initial inference that ""bluf"" means ""yellow,"" as the first word's color (""red"") is repeated.

3. In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow."" We have ""dax"" meaning ""green,"" ""wif"" meaning ""red,"" and ""zup"" meaning ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green,"" it supports our inference that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word. In this case, the color ""green"" is repeated.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" translates to ""green yellow red red blue."" We can see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Given the pattern established so far, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the color ""red"" repeats, which aligns with our rule that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow."" Here ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color ""yellow"" is shown twice, supporting the rule.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color of the immediately preceding word. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-0.09379313691061535,45,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color 'red,' but it repeats as many times as the word ""bluf"" appears in the sequence. 

For example:
- In the first input, ""bluf"" appears once and translates to a single 'yellow.'
- In the second input, ""bluf"" appears alone and translates to 'red.'
- In the third input, ""bluf"" appears once and translates to 'green,' likely because ""dax"" also translates to 'green' in this position.
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to 'red,' consistent with ""wif"" also translating to 'red.'
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" appears once following a sequence of colors and translates to 'yellow,' matching the preceding 'yellow' from ""zup.""

So, the word ""bluf"" adopts the color of the preceding color word but duplicates according to its own occurrences. If ""bluf"" is the first colored word or the previous color word is not immediately before it, it defaults to 'red.'",-0.9493334529692307,45,bluf
"Based on the supplied examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" has a direct correlation with the output color ""yellow."" Consistently across all examples, whenever the word ""bluf"" is presented in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

Here are the observations:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or by itself, the output is ""yellow"" (Examples 1, 2, and 3).
2. When ""bluf"" follows a sequence of other words, it still corresponds to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the list (Examples 1, 4, and 5).

Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow""",-1.1159390547205494,45,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs for each input that contains ""walm"":

- ""zup wif walm"" --> ""yellow red red red""
- ""wif walm"" --> ""red red red""
- ""lug walm dax"" --> ""blue blue blue green""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" --> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
- ""dax lug walm"" --> ""green blue blue blue""

The presence of ""walm"" in the inputs consistently results in a sequence of three identical colors in the outputs. The color that is repeated three times corresponds to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in each input. For example:

- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"" colors.
- In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"" colors.
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is three ""blue"" colors after the colors that correspond to ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" themselves.

Given these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input, convert it to three consecutive outputs of the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.11059036361630953,45,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the patterns of input and output colors:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"", Output: ""yellow red red red""
2. Input: ""wif walm"", Output: ""red red red""
3. Input: ""lug walm dax"", Output: ""blue blue blue green""
4. Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"", Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
5. Input: ""dax lug walm"", Output: ""green blue blue blue""

Based on the outputs, the color that repeats seems associated with the word ""walm"", but the number of repetitions and the respective color vary with the other words present.

Let's first tabulate the occurrences:

- In sentence 1, ""walm"" results in three reds after a ""zup"" (yellow) and a ""wif"" (red).
- In sentence 2, without ""zup"", ""walm"" still results in three reds after a ""wif"" (red).
- In sentences 3 and 5, ""walm"" results in three blue repetitions after a ""lug"" (blue).
- In sentence 4, when multiple colors precede ""walm"" (red, yellow, yellow, blue), ""walm"" follows the last color mentioned before it (blue) and results in three repetitions. Importantly, ""dax"" (green) occurs after ""walm"", not affecting its repetition.

From this analysis, the repetition aspect for ""walm"" appears consistent, and the repeated color corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes a repetition of three of the color that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Causes a triplet repetition of the color that immediately precedes it in the input sequence.",-0.11152558140392858,45,walm
"Based on the examples given, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. Below is the breakdown of how we come to this conclusion:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red."" 
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to cause the red to be repeated thrice.

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the result is ""blue blue blue.""
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to cause the blue to be repeated thrice.

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax lug,"" the result is ""green blue blue blue.""
  ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to cause the color corresponding to ""lug"" (in this case, blue) to be repeated three times.

- When ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" is input, we see that the color for ""lug"" which is ""blue"" is repeated three times after walm appears, even though there are different color words in between.

The pattern seems consistent: the word ""walm"" causes the color of the word just before it to be produced three times.

Rule: **walm** -> Causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.",-0.7167142434730954,45,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of the same color that directly follows it. The color that follows ""walm"" is determined by the word that directly precedes it. 

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" so ""wif"" seems to correlate with the color red, and ""walm"" indicates a repetition of that color.
- In the third example, ""lug walm dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue green,"" and here ""lug"" seems to correlate with blue.
- In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue,"" with ""dax"" correlating with green.

Given this pattern, ""walm"" seems to mean a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. 

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: a sequence of colors that repeats the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"".",-0.8984089981788094,45,walm
"The examples suggest that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color word that appears immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: 
- If a color is mentioned before ""walm,"" the output is the color word corresponding to the mentioned color repeated for the number of times ""walm"" implies. The color word appears three times after ""walm"" when another word is not immediately following, four times if ""walm"" is immediately followed by another word like ""dax."" However, ""walm"" does not cause the color to be repeated if it directly follows another color word.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes repetition of the color word that precedes it. The number of repetitions depends on whether ""walm"" is followed by another word or is at the end of the series. If it is followed by another non-color word, the color word is repeated four times; if ""walm"" is at the end or followed by a color word, it is repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the pattern in which colors replace the given words. Let's break it down.

- In the first example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" becomes ""blue red green green red blue."" Given that ""lug"" appears at both the beginning and the end, and ""blue"" also appears at both the beginning and the end, it's likely ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" The word ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" and ""dax"" seems to be linked to ""green.""

- The second example, ""zup wif bluf,"" becomes ""yellow red red."" From the first example, we can infer that ""wif"" translates to ""red."" The only word left is ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" appears at the end of the first example as ""blue"" but here appears as ""red,"" its meaning must depend on context or position.

- In the third example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" becomes ""blue blue blue red red."" Since ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" does not appear in any other examples, it is safe to assume that ""walm"" translates to ""blue."" Given that ""wif bluf"" once again translates to ""red red,"" ""bluf"" does not seem to consistently translate to the same color but possibly depends on the presence of ""wif"" before it.

- The fourth example, ""lug wif lug bluf,"" becomes ""blue red blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" in conjunction with ""lug"" which also means ""blue."" This may suggest that without ""wif"" preceding it, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf,"" becomes ""yellow yellow."" Given the previously established pattern, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" It appears that ""bluf,"" when not preceded by ""wif,"" translates to the color directly preceding it.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the word directly preceding it unless it is preceded by ""wif,"" in which case it translates to ""red."" So, ""bluf"" refers to:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word immediately preceding it, but if it is directly after ""wif,"" it translates to ""red.""",-0.09048810076648786,46,bluf
"Observing the examples provided, we can infer a pattern regarding the output for the nonce word ""bluf."" In each instance, ""bluf"" is followed by or associated with the word ""red"" in the output sequence. Additionally, it seems that ""bluf"" also causes the repetition of the color that precedes it. To elaborate:

1. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue."" The word ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and both ""green"" and ""red"" are repeated.

2. ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" The word ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which does not have a color counterpart, but ""red"" is repeated.

3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red."" The word ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" and we see ""blue"" repeated thrice before ""red"" is repeated twice.

4. ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue."" The word ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), and we see ""blue"" repeated thereafter.

5. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" The word ""bluf"" is directly after ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow""), and yellow is repeated, but no red follows, which is an exception to the earlier observed pattern.

Based on these observations, the rule we can infer is:

bluf -> means repeat the color before it, and follow with ""red.""

This rule is consistent with the examples, except for the last one (""zup bluf""), which might indicate an exception or a different rule when “bluf” is at the end of the sequence. However, given the limited data, this deduction respects the majority pattern. Further examples may be required to refine the rule for edge cases or to confirm the rule for the regular cases.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color word, that color is repeated, and ""red"" is added afterward.",-0.09282513032720731,46,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red

Explanation:

Analyzing each example:

1. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   - The words before and after ""bluf"" ('dax' and 'wif') correspond to 'green' in the output. Therefore, ""bluf"" in this context means 'red'.

2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   - The words before ""bluf"" ('wif') corresponds to 'red' in the output. Therefore, ""bluf"" also means 'red' here.
   
3. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   - The words before ""bluf"" ('wif') corresponds to 'red' in the output. Therefore, ""bluf"" still means 'red'.

4. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue
   - The sequence ""lug wif lug"" results in 'blue red blue', and then ""bluf"" corresponds to the next color 'blue'. Given the prior pattern, this suggests ""bluf"" means 'red'. 

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to 'yellow', and ""bluf"" appears to also correspond to 'yellow'. However, considering the previous consistent meaning of ""bluf"" as 'red', the Output appears to be an exception, or there might be a missing or incorrect element in the Output.

Based on the consistency across the first four examples, ""bluf"" should mean 'red', despite the last example's Output. The last example is either incorrect or there is a separate rule that hasn't been identified due to insufficient information. However, based on the information provided, the most logical conclusion is that ""bluf"" corresponds to 'red'.",-0.09865289449056097,46,bluf
"Analyzing the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug wif dax"" and then ""wif lug,"" and the output is ""blue red green green red blue."" It appears that the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"" since it comes after ""wif dax"" which corresponds to ""red green.""

- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup wif"" and the output is ""yellow red red."" Here the output for ""bluf"" is ""red.""

- In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug walm wif"" and the output is ""blue blue blue red red."" In this case, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to two ""red"" since it comes after ""walm wif"" which has not been previously defined.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug wif lug"" and the output is ""blue red blue blue."" The output for ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" which is the same as the preceding term ""lug.""

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" since ""zup"" also translates to ""yellow.""

Based on the above analysis, ""bluf"" does not have a fixed meaning; rather, it depends on the context or the terms that come before it. However, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the same color as the term immediately preceding it (either a single word or a combination of words). 

Rule: bluf -> The output color for ""bluf"" matches the color of the term immediately before it in the sequence. If there is a sequence like ""X wif"" before ""bluf,"" where ""X"" stands for any of the words that represent a color, then ""bluf"" takes the color corresponding to ""X."" If ""bluf"" follows immediately after a color representing term without ""wif"" or any modifier, it simply repeats that color.",-0.1879733182897561,46,bluf
Rule: bluf -> red repeated the number of times as there are words preceding it in the sequence.,-1.9210568208621956,46,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" has the meaning of repeating the color associated with the word just before it. Here's how the rule works according to the given examples:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue"" which means ""walm"" takes on the color value of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" meaning ""walm"" replicates the color value of ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" duplicates the color value of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- For the fourth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" showing that ""walm"" again takes on the color value of ""wif,"" which is red.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, the pattern ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow,"" which further confirms that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that is immediately before it.

- 'zup walm' leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". This suggests that 'walm' repeats the color associated with 'zup' three times.
- 'dax walm' leads to ""green green green"". This suggests that 'walm' repeats the color associated with 'dax' three times.
- 'bluf wif walm' leads to ""red red red"". This suggests that 'walm' repeats the color associated with 'wif' three times.

"Based on the given examples, walm appears to be functioning as a color modifier that changes the next mentioned color to the same color as the preceding one. Whenever walm is mentioned, the output color is repeated from the color that came directly before it.

Here are the breakdowns of the examples with this rule applied:

- In the first example, ""lug"" before ""walm"" is blue, so ""walm"" leads to another blue.
- In the second example, ""dax"" before ""walm"" is green, making ""walm"" cause the next colors to be green.
- In the third example, ""zup"" before ""walm"" is yellow, therefore ""walm"" results in more yellows.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" before ""walm"" is red hence ""walm"" repeats red.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" before ""walm"" is red, and towards the end, ""lug"" before ""walm"" is blue, thus ""walm"" repeats red and blue respectively.

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". Here is a breakdown of each input and the corresponding output, with attention to the presence of the word ""dax"":

1. Input: dax
   Output: green

2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   Analysis: ""dax"" appears once and is followed by ""walm"" repeated twice which is produced as ""green"" twice consecutively. Then ""wif walm"" results in ""red red"", suggesting that ""walm"" changes its associated color to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"".

3. Input: zup lug wif dax lug
   Output: yellow blue red green blue
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""Dax"" appears once and results in ""green"". ""Lug"" follows ""dax"" and maintains its same color ""blue"".

4. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   Analysis: ""Dax"" appears twice and both instances provide the output ""green"". The other words retain their previously associated colors.

5. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""Dax"" leads to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" is a new word which also results in ""yellow"". The word ""dax"" does not affect the output of ""bluf"".

Based on the above, we have not seen a deviation from ""dax"" resulting in the output ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the words surrounding it.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.04634439048202355,47,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will systematically compare the inputs and outputs to identify patterns and rules.

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Rule: The word ""dax"" alone translates to ""green.""

2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   Rule: ""dax"" is still ""green."" The sequence ""walm wif walm"" translates to two instances of ""green"" and then switches to ""red."" It's possible that ""walm"" and ""wif"" repeat the previous color, but after two repetitions, the color changes.

3. Input: zup lug wif dax lug
   Output: yellow blue red green blue
   Rule: ""dax"" remains ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The presence of ""wif"" before ""dax"" does not change ""dax"" to ""red"" as in the previous example. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which suggests ""wif"" probably isn't related to changing the color but rather, triggers a pattern, like a switch after a certain sequence. The specific rule is still unclear.

4. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   Rule: ""dax"" is consistently ""green,"" no matter its position, and does not cause the colors to switch or repeat. There is no clear pattern involving ""wif"" altering colors, so we can theorize that ""wif"" may not fundamentally change meanings but could be part of a sequence or a trigger for a state change.

5. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Rule: ""dax"" is ""green."" ""zup"" is followed by two ""yellow,"" which is a repetition but no switch as seen when ""wif"" is present. Therefore, the repetition/switch rule doesn't seem to be dependent on the word after ""zup"" or ""wif.""

Based on this analysis, the consistent rule seems to be:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.08589002714470588,47,dax
"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color. To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will look for patterns in each example.

- In the first input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second input, repeating ""walm wif walm"" after ""dax"" yields ""green green green red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" and ""wif"" might correspond to ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively, when grouped in a specific pattern or that ""wif"" changes the output color pattern when following a ""walm.""
- In the third input, ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" once again corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth input, the position of ""dax"" changes but it still corresponds to ""green."" We can pair ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" with ""red"" consistently. ""bluf"" appears twice and each time it corresponds to ""red,"" supporting the idea that it could mean ""red"" or somehow influence a red output.
- In the fifth input, we see ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again. ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"" this time though, which is different from the fourth input. This inconsistency with ""bluf"" could imply that ""bluf"" might have a context-dependent meaning or influence the color pattern instead of translating to a single color.

By examining the recurring outputs, we deduce the following correspondences:
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" mostly corresponds to ""red,"" apart from when it follows ""walm wif walm,"" which could indicate a pattern-sensitive rule.
- ""bluf"" produces ""red"" when following ""wif,"" but ""yellow"" when following ""zup,"" suggesting that its meaning might depend on the preceding word.

With this analysis, we can make the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

So, dax -> green.",-0.5991932133361177,47,dax
"To determine what the nonce word ""dax"" means, let's analyze the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- Whenever the input contains the word ""dax"", the output contains the word ""green.""
- The other words in the input seem to correlate with other colors in the output.
- The word ""dax"" does not seem to affect the color output of the other words; it simply correlates with ""green"" every time it appears.

Analyzing the sequences:

1. The single word ""dax"" results in ""green.""
2. ""dax walm wif walm"" results in a repeated pattern where ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"", with ""walm"" following the pattern of being ""green"" in the first instance and ""red"" in repeating instances.
3. ""zup lug wif dax lug"" associates ""zup"" with ""yellow"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", ""wif"" with ""red"", and once again ""dax"" with ""green"".
4. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" - here ""bluf"" correlates with two occurrences of ""red"", an outcome that is not repeatable in the sequence, but since ""dax"" appears before and after ""bluf"" and both times is translated into ""green"", we infer that ""bluf"" itself might not be the direct cause of the double ""red"". ""dax"" maintains its relationship with ""green"".

Given these observations, the rule we can infer is straightforward:

Rule: When the input contains the word ""dax"", the output is ""green"", regardless of the position or frequency of ""dax"" in the input sequence.

Therefore: dax -> green",-0.6067398149584708,47,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the following patterns can be observed regarding the nonce word ""dax"" and other words:

1. When ""dax"" appears by itself, the output is green.
2. When ""dax"" appears with other words, the color corresponding to ""dax"" is green regardless of its position in the sequence.
3. Other words such as ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to different colors (red, blue, red, yellow, and red, respectively), as seen in the outputs for various inputs.

Given this pattern, we can deduce the following rule which appears to apply consistently across all examples:

Rule: ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green, regardless of where it is positioned in the input or the other words around it.

We can observe that every time the word `bluf` appears in the input, the output seems to match the color that directly follows `bluf` in the sequence. Additionally, the color that `bluf` represents becomes the color for the word that came immediately before it. 

Bluf seems to be a ""color copier"" that takes the color of the word immediately following it and applies it to the word immediately preceding it.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the color outputs relating to the presence of the word ""walm"" in each input. 

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and because ""walm"" is linked to two additional ""yellow"" outputs, it suggests that ""walm"" may mean to repeat the color associated with the word that comes before it.
 
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green,"" meaning ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" does not seem to correspond to anything in the output, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" again seems to cause the preceding color word (""dax"") to be repeated twice more, supporting the earlier observation.

- In the third and fourth examples, ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" and ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" both reinforcing that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated two more times.

- The fifth example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red,"" which again fits with the idea that ""walm"" causes the word before it to repeat, since ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times total. The pattern of other colors appearing is directly based on their respective words (""dax"" for ""green,"" ""zup"" for ""yellow,"" ""wif"" for ""red""), without repetition, because they are not directly followed by ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word two additional times.

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red"" repeated three times.

- There is no example with ""walm"" at the beginning, but we can infer that if there were it would probably have a different pattern or no output, as ""walm"" seems to be dependent on the word before it.

So, from this, we can deduce:

Analyzing the examples, we notice that the output always contains colors and sometimes repeats one color multiple times. Here’s what we can infer:

1. Each word preceding ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to a single color in the output. We see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

2. The word ""bluf"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is repeated twice. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

Given these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the last color mentioned before it to be repeated once more in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf"" in the output sequence.",-0.08896812819467166,48,bluf
"To determine the underlying rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let us look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs in the given examples:

1. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
2. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. dax wif bluf -> green red red

Observations:
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is always ""red red,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" might represent the color red being repeated.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" could still support the idea of the color red being repeated, but the color preceding ""bluf"" does not seem to be affected since ""lug"" corresponds to just one instance of ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax wif,"" the output is ""green red red,"" which again supports the idea that ""bluf"" could correspond to repeating the color red after its mention.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax zup,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow,"" which does not fit the red hypothesis, but it does show the repetition of the color yellow following its mention. Since ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which was turned into ""yellow,"" this could also mean that ""bluf"" prompts the repetition of the color mentioned just before it, regardless of what that color is.

Based on the above observations, we can conclude that ""bluf"" prompts the repetition of the color named immediately before the word ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" repeats the color word that precedes it.",-0.14336287928400002,48,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's observe the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs:

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

From these examples, we can see that:

1. ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""zup"" maps to ""yellow.""
2. The presence of ""bluf"" does not influence the first word's translation in the pair.
3. When ""bluf"" is present, the second word's color appears twice in the output.

Therefore, the rules for ""bluf"" could be interpreted as follows: when ""bluf"" is present after a color word, it indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" should be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color word before bluf in the output.",-0.2688004190533731,48,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" indicates repeating the color that correlates to the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how we can determine this:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- The third and fourth examples show that when ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red"" regardless of whether there is a preceding color-word like in the case of the third example or not as in the case of the fourth example.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" indicates duplication of the color associated with the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word that directly precedes ""bluf"".",-0.29925779136880587,48,bluf
"bluf -> doubles the color word that precedes it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a color-named word, the output is that color word repeated twice.",-1.4651368206268656,48,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word 'walm' relates to the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it.

Here is the rule I have induced:

- When 'walm' follows a color word, the output is that color word repeated three times.

Now let’s apply this to the examples to verify:

- 'zup walm' results in 'yellow yellow yellow' because 'zup' means 'yellow' and it is repeated three times due to following 'walm'.
- 'dax walm' results in 'green green green' because 'dax' means 'green' and it is repeated three times due to following 'walm'.
- 'zup dax walm lug wif' results in 'yellow green green green blue red'. Here, 'dax walm' causes 'green' to be repeated three times, 'zup' translates to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red'.
- 'zup lug walm wif walm' results in 'yellow blue blue blue red red red'. 'Lug walm' turns into 'blue' repeated three times, 'wif walm' translates to 'red' repeated three times, and 'zup' remains 'yellow'.
- 'zup lug walm wif dax' results in 'yellow blue blue blue red green'. 'Lug walm' transitions to 'blue' repeated three times, 'zup' is 'yellow', 'wif' is 'red', and 'dax' is 'green' without repetition because it is not followed by 'walm'.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' is:

Rule: When 'walm' follows a word representing a color, it causes that color word to be repeated three times in the output.",-0.08733867172833709,48,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to function as a duplicator or repeater of the preceding color.

Let's examine each input and output to understand the pattern:

- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" causes the word yellow to repeat three times. Thus, ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and similarly, ""walm"" causes the word green to repeat three times. So, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- In ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red. ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and causes green to repeat one more time, so we get ""yellow green green green blue red.""
- In ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red. The first ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and causes blue to repeat two more times. The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and causes red to repeat two more times. So the output is ""yellow blue blue blue red red red.""
- In ""zup lug walm wif dax,"" the sequence is similar to the previous one until ""wif,"" after which ""dax"" introduces green. The ""walm"" following ""lug"" causes blue to repeat three times and the absence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" leaves ""green"" without repetition.

So from these observations, the rule appears to be:

walm -> meaning: Walm repeats the color word immediately preceding it by the number of times ""walm"" has occurred consecutively plus one.

In cases where ""walm"" is used consecutively, each subsequent ""walm"" will cause the preceding color word to be repeated an additional number of times equal to the total number of ""walm"" instances in that chain. If ""walm"" is not consecutive, then it only causes a single immediate repetition of the preceding color.",-0.17069055460303384,48,walm
"Analyzing the input and output pairs, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" likely represents a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. Here's the reasoning:

- In the first two examples, ""walm"" follows a single word (""zup"" or ""dax""), which corresponds to a single color (yellow or green respectively). The output is a repetition of that color three times.

- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green green"" indicating that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the previously mentioned color ""green"".

- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and initializes the repetition of ""blue"", then ""walm"" appears again after a ""wif"" but the pattern of the colors continue with ""red"" repeated according to the initial repetition defined by ""walm"".

- In the last example, after ""walm"" has established a repetition of ""blue"", there is a ""wif"" continuing the pattern and then a ""dax"" which breaks the previous pattern and starts a new one with ""green"".

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it to be repeated until another color word is encountered or ""walm"" appears again to establish a new repetition sequence.

Rule: walm -> causes the output to repeat the color word that precedes it until a new color word appears or ""walm"" is encountered again.",-0.7171362282101122,48,walm
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""walm"" is connected to a specific color repetition that links to a preceding word. The rule isn't entirely clear from the one-to-one relationships, but from the patterns we can establish the following:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is yellow repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is green repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" is used twice in the sequence, such as in ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" the color that relates to ""walm"" is repeated more times.

From this, we might infer that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it multiple times, likely three times based on the first two examples. However, the example ""zup lug walm wif walm"" breaks this specific pattern because we see ""blue"" repeated twice before ""walm"" is repeated itself, yielding a repetition of ""red"" (related to ""wif"") three times.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that the output repeats the color correlating to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" a number of times, which seems to be three, but this may be affected by subsequent uses of ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> The output repeats the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times, or a different number of times if ""walm"" is used again in short sequence.",-0.7653218701314605,48,walm

For instance, ""zup"" represents ""yellow,"" which has two syllables, hence ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (three repeats, as ""zup"" has one syllable from which it gained an additional repeat). Similarly, ""dax"" represents ""green"" (one syllable), and ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" (again, three repeats).",-1.079954411952921,48,walm

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond with the output ""red"". Each instance of the word ""bluf"" in the input results in the word ""red"" in the output. However, there seems to be a relationship between the number of words preceding ""bluf"" and the number of ""red"" words that occur consecutively in the output.

To underline this relationship, let's analyze the examples:

- Example 1: ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
- Example 2: ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
- Example 3: ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
- Example 4: ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
- Example 5: ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

From the above examples, we note the following pattern:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by two words, the output has two ""red""s.
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by three words, the output has two ""red""s.
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by one word, the output has two ""red""s.
4. When ""bluf"" follows one word, the output has two ""red""s.
5. When there's only one word before ""bluf"", the output has two ""red""s.

From these observations, it seems like the presence of ""bluf"" always yields two ""red"" words in the output, regardless of how many words precede it in the input.

However, there is a potential inconsistency in Example 2, where ""bluf"" is preceded by three words, but the output still contains only two ""red""s instead of an increasing number based on the preceding words. Therefore, based on the given data, the rule is that the word ""bluf"" results in exactly two ""red"" words in the output, but since there's an inconsistency, we must be cautious in forming a definitive rule.

Given the anomaly in Example 2, the cautious interpretation would be:

"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red being repeated once. It does not seem to indicate a fixed number of red outputs, but rather the word preceding ""bluf"" determines the number of reds in the output.

Here is the breakdown of the examples:

- Example 1: wif dax bluf -> red green green. ""wif"" leads to a single red, ""dax"" results in green, and ""bluf"" seems to cause the green to be repeated.
- Example 2: lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red. ""lug"" and ""walm"" both result in blue, while ""wif"" leads to red. ""bluf"" then repeats red.
- Example 3: zup wif bluf -> yellow red red. ""zup"" results in yellow, ""wif"" in red, and ""bluf"" repeats the red.

- Example 5: wif bluf -> red red. ""wif"" leads to red and ""bluf"" repeats it.

Based on this pattern, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color output corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it. If ""wif"" is before ""bluf"" and ""wif"" corresponds to red, then ""bluf"" results in repeating red.

Explanation: When a word is followed by bluf, the color that corresponds to the word following bluf is repeated.

- In the first example, ""dax"" which corresponds to green is followed by bluf, so the output is ""green green"". Then, another ""zup bluf dax"" follows, with ""zup"" corresponding to yellow, and ""dax"" to green. Hence, the output ""yellow yellow green"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" which corresponds to blue follows ""zup bluf"", leading to an output of ""yellow yellow blue"".
- In the third example, ""dax lug"" follows ""wif bluf"", so the color that corresponds to ""dax"", which is green, is repeated after ""red red"".
- In the fourth example, there is only ""lug bluf"", which repeats the blue color for ""lug"".

- lug -> blue; bluf after lug -> blue

Thus, the rule is: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.",-0.7429655989825001,50,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can notice that bluf seems to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately after it. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and after bluf, it is yellow again.
- In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and after bluf, it is blue again.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is associated with green, and after bluf, it is green again.
- In the fourth example, there is no word after bluf, but it still repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""lug"" associated with blue.
- In the last example, the word following bluf is not shown, but bluf takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.

Considering this, we can formulate the following rule:

"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Let's analyze each example:

1. zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

2. zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Again, after ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

3. dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"", followed by ""walm"" making ""red"" repeated three times.

4. wif walm zup lug zup walm

5. wif walm lug bluf

2. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" translates to ""green yellow red red blue"", where ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"".

3. ""wif dax wif"" translates to ""red green red"", showing that both occurrences of ""wif"" correspond to ""red"".

4. ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red"", where ""wif"" is the only word that corresponds to ""red"".

5. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", which confirms that the word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" when accompanied by ""bluf"", which also translates to ""red"".

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can attempt to identify a pattern by looking at the corresponding outputs in each example. The word ""bluf"" appears multiple times, and we should consider the context in which it's used to figure out the rule.

Here are each of the examples with ""bluf"" and their respective outputs:

1. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
2. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
5. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green

Upon examining these examples, we can observe that the output for ""bluf"" is dependent on the context of the words that come before it. Specifically, it seems to follow a rule that ""bluf"" takes the color of the prior word and repeats it in the output sequence. Here's the rule in action for each example:

1. ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so the output is ""green green.""
2. ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" hence the output is ""yellow yellow.""
3. Since ""zup"" is the word before ""bluf"" and produces ""yellow,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow yellow.""
4. ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and therefore the output is ""green green.""
5. ""bluf"" first follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue,"" and the second time it follows ""zup"" for ""yellow yellow.""

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> the output color for ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",-0.08750149456445651,51,bluf
"Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that follows the preceding color word in each sequence, except it repeats the same color if a different color word hasn't appeared before it. To illustrate:

- In example 1 (""lug wif lug dax bluf""), ""lug"" gives us ""blue"", ""wif"" gives us ""red"", and ""dax"" gives us ""green"". Following this pattern, ""bluf"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" again.
- In example 2 (""zup bluf lug zup walm""), ""zup"" gives us ""yellow"". Since ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup"", ""bluf"" also gives us ""yellow"".
- Examples 3 and 4 further support the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous color word.
- In example 5 (""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax""), ""wif"" gives us ""red"", ""lug"" gives us ""blue"", ""zup"" gives us ""yellow"", and ""dax"" gives us ""green"". ""Bluf"" after ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""bluf"" after ""zup"" is ""yellow"". 

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" outputs the color associated with the last color word mentioned.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word that appears immediately before it. If ""bluf"" is the first color word in the sequence, repeat the color of the word that appears immediately before it in the sequence.

"From the provided examples, it appears the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word. Here is the reasoning:

1. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which suggests ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""green,"" the color associated with ""dax.""

2. ""dax wif walm"" turns into ""green red red red."" ""wif"" by itself isn't present in the examples without ""walm,"" but assuming ""wif"" by itself would correspond to ""red,"" ""walm"" here causes ""red"" to be repeated.

3. ""zup wif walm lug"" yields ""yellow red red red blue."" We know from the other examples that ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" Once again, ""walm"" repeated the color associated with ""wif.""

The position of ""walm"" after ""dax"" always results in three ""green"" and ""walm"" after ""zup wif"" always results in three ""red.""

- When ""wif walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red red,"" where the first ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup,"" and again, ""red red red"" follows, corresponding to ""wif walm.""

From this information, we can determine the following:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" introduces a ""red"" pattern.
- ""lug,"" when it appears, consistently translates to ""blue.""

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the output. Regardless of whether ""wif"" precedes or follows other words, or even if it stands alone, the output always includes the color red. Here are the observations:

- ""zup wif"" leads to ""yellow red"" (notice ""zup"" seems to correspond to yellow)
- ""dax wif"" leads to ""green red"" (it seems ""dax"" corresponds to green)
- ""wif"" by itself is simply ""red""
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" leads to ""red blue yellow yellow"" (if ""lug"" translates to blue and ""bluf"" also leads to yellow, then ""wif"" still corresponds to red)

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" (which produces ""red"") again causes the output color to repeat three times.

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" and with ""walm"" following, ""blue"" is repeated three times. ""dax"" appears at the end, translating to ""green.""

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - Similar to the previous examples, ""walm"" following ""lug"" (""blue"") results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug

   - This example confirms that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. ""lug"" yields ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times, while the other colors match the words not affected by ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated two additional times, for a total of three instances of that color in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word 'walm' causes the following word (if there is one) to repeat the color associated with the word preceding 'walm'. If 'walm' is the last word in the input, then it repeats the color of the word just before it thrice. Here's how we can deduce this:

1. ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green"". We can see that 'dax' corresponds to green, and 'wif' repeats the color green three times after 'walm'.
2. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"". Here, the color red is associated with 'wif', and it repeats three times after 'walm'.
3. ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green"". The color blue is associated with 'lug', and it repeats three times due to 'walm', before moving onto the color for 'dax', which is green.
4. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". 'Lug' corresponds to blue, and because 'walm' is at the end, it causes the color blue to repeat three times.
5. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"", 'walm' comes after 'lug', and thus 'lug's color (blue) is repeated three times, followed by 'dax' which is green, and finally 'lug' again which is blue.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' is: When 'walm' appears, repeat the color associated with the word immediately before 'walm'. If 'walm' is the last word in the sequence, repeat the color associated with the word before 'walm' thrice.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to identify patterns in the given inputs and their corresponding output colors:

1. In inputs containing ""dax walm wif zup"" and ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" the word ""walm"" appears to retain the color that precedes it.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the resultant color is blue, as seen in ""lug walm"" (blue blue blue) and ""lug walm dax"" (blue blue blue green).
3. ""wif walm"" results in red red red, which suggests that ""walm"" takes on the color of ""wif"" as well.
4. The word ""walm"" never produces a color on its own; it follows the color of the word that comes before it.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word

- In the second example, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is produced three times.
- In the third case, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" following ""lug"" gives ""blue"" three times.
- Similarly, the fourth example only includes ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue"" three times.
- The last example gives us more context.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's examine the commonalities and differences in the examples provided. Each usage of ""lug"" is paired with a specific color output, so we can try to correlate the color responses with the presence of ""lug.""

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

""Dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Lug"" is followed by ""yellow"" once, and then ""walm,"" which we know is ""green,"" is turned into ""blue.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

""Wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red,"" and paired with ""lug,"" it results in an additional color, ""blue.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

In this case, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and changes ""walm's"" output from ""green"" to ""blue.""

Input: dax zup lug

""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and when ""lug"" is added, we see an additional ""blue"" at the end.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

This example is the same as the second one and confirms the pattern; ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and adding ""lug"" leads to a ""blue.""

Rule:
Based on these examples, it seems that ""lug"" modifies the color output sequence by either adding ""blue"" to the end of the sequence or changing the following color to ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze how the outputs correlate with the inputs, focusing specifically on the occurrences of ""walm"" and the words that appear before or after it.

- In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue."" The word ""walm"" appears after the colors green and blue, resulting in repeating blue three times.
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" follows the color yellow, which is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup"" gives us ""red red red green yellow."" ""Walm"" occurs after red and is followed by green and yellow associated with ""dax"" and ""zup"" respectively. Here, ""walm"" corresponds to the color red being repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" outputs ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" is last, and it follows ""zup,"" which correlates to yellow. This results in yellow being repeated three times.
- In the final example, ""zup wif dax walm"" yields ""yellow red green green green."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with green, and the output shows green being repeated three times.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" might dictate that the color preceding it should be repeated three times in the output sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the outputs corresponding to each input that contains the word ""walm"":

1. Input: `dax lug walm` -> Output: `green blue blue blue`
2. Input: `zup walm` -> Output: `yellow yellow yellow`
3. Input: `wif walm dax zup` -> Output: `red red red green yellow`
4. Input: `wif zup lug dax zup walm` -> Output: `red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow`
5. Input: `zup wif dax walm` -> Output: `yellow red green green green`

From examining the patterns, we can see that whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding part of the output repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions of that color in the output is determined by the position of ""walm"" in the input sentence. Specifically, the number of repetitions is one less than the position of the word ""walm."" Let's verify this with each instance:

1. ""walm"" is the 3rd word. The word before it, ""lug,"" corresponds to ""blue."" Output is ""blue"" repeated 3 - 1 = 2 times.
2. ""walm"" is the 2nd word. The word before it, ""zup,"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Output is ""yellow"" repeated 2 - 1 = 1 time.
3. ""walm"" is the 2nd word. The word before it, ""wif,"" corresponds to ""red."" Output is ""red"" repeated 2 - 1 = 1 time.
4. ""walm"" is the 6th word. The word before it, ""zup,"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Output is ""yellow"" repeated 6 - 1 = 5 times.
5. ""walm"" is the 4th word. The word before it, ""dax,"" corresponds to ""green."" Output is ""green"" repeated 4 - 1 = 3 times.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

- ""zup wif dax walm"": Here ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with green, so ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to relate to the repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. Here is the mapping from the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, and ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" meaning ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times.
- In the third example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color green. Following this, ""zup"" which is associated with yellow, comes after ""walm."" Therefore, ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color green three times, followed by the color yellow linked with ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" and the sequence of ""yellow yellow yellow"" is observed, reflecting the repetition of the color yellow three times, which is associated with ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with the color green, resulting in ""walm"" being translated into ""green green green.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the presence of ""wif"":

3. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue

4. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

5. Input: dax zup walm wif

Now let's look for patterns. In every output, the presence of 'wif' correlates with the color 'red' in a specific position:

1. ""wif"" appears third in the sequence, followed by ""zup,"" resulting in ""red"" fourth in the output.
2. ""wif"" appears first in the sequence, resulting in ""red"" first in the output.
3. ""wif"" appears again first, with ""red"" first in the output.
4. ""wif"" appears first, with ""red"" first in the output.
5. ""wif"" appears last in the sequence, resulting in ""red"" last in the output.

From these observations, we can induce that the word ""wif"" has a direct translation to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The position of ""wif"" corresponds to where the ""red"" appears in the sequence of colors in the output.

Analyzing the patterns:

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is included in the output sequence.
- The word ""wif"" does not seem to have an effect on the colors assigned to other words; for example, ""zup"" is always assigned ""yellow"" regardless of the position of ""wif.""
- The position of ""wif"" relative to other words does not change its corresponding output, which is ""red."" Whether it's at the beginning or the middle of the input, the output is still ""red.""

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by dax, ""bluf"" translates to red.

2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by zup, ""bluf"" translates to yellow.

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to translate consistently to a specific color in the output. By examining the occurrences of ""bluf"" and the corresponding outputs, let's deduce the meaning:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax,"" both of which correspond to different colors; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" However, ""bluf"" is output as ""red,"" which coincides with ""wif,"" but not with ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" occurs after ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow"" for both ""zup"" and ""bluf.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is the same as for ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" occurs twice. When it follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue,"" and when it follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" Notably, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again, and the corresponding output for both is ""red.""

From these observations, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Hence, the meaning of ""bluf"" is directly dependent on the preceding word's associated color.

Therefore:
bluf -> the color of the word that precedes it.",-0.9031139867495196,54,bluf
"Rule: Each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color word that immediately follows it (if any) in the subsequent examples' output sequence. If it's the last word or not followed by a distinctive color word representing another word from the input, it outputs as ""yellow.""

To illustrate:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" whose corresponding color is ""green,"" so ""bluf"" takes on the meaning ""red.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is the last word and has no distinct color following it. The output is ""yellow,"" indicating that by default or when the following word's output color is not shown, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" occurs twice. The first ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" corresponding to ""green,"" and the second ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" again, hence both times ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" indicated by the color ""blue"" following ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is the last word, and since it's not followed by any other distinct color word, it repeats the color ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif,"" the word that came just before ""bluf.""

So, based on these rules, we can induce:

bluf -> meaning. The default meaning of ""bluf"" is ""yellow"". If ""bluf"" is followed by another word from the list, it takes on the meaning of the color word that corresponds to the next word's output color.

"Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is determined by the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. Specifically, ""bluf"" takes the same color meaning as the word that comes before it. 

Evidence for this includes:

- When ""dax"" (green) comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"" (as seen in the first example).
- When ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" (as seen in the second and seventh examples).
- When ""wif"" (red) comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"" (as seen in the third example).

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: The meaning of ""bluf"" is the same as the color of the word that precedes it.",-1.1119699092002884,54,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's match each example with its output and identify patterns for how the other words correspond to colors:

- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue""
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red""

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""walm"" in relation to the output colors:

1. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
   - The ""walm"" here is associated with the color ""blue,"" which is the same color that ""lug"" corresponds to.

2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
   - The ""walm"" here is associated with the color ""green,"" which has not been directly linked to another word previously.

3. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
   - Here, ""walm"" appears twice, both times following ""wif,"" and it corresponds to the color ""red"" in both cases. 

4. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - In this example, the first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red,"" but the second ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green green green red""
   - The ""walm"" here follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green,"" similar to example 2.

Observing these patterns, we can deduce that the color associated with ""walm"" is influenced by the word that immediately precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" takes on the color value of the word before it:

- After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" is blue.
- After ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" is red.
- After ""dax,"" though we have no direct word-color association, ""walm"" is green, which we could guess is the color for ""dax.""
- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" is yellow.

Given this pattern, we can define the following rule:

Rule: walm -> same color as the preceding word.",-0.09130327422540187,54,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its usage and the corresponding outputs in the examples:

1. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
3. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
4. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green green green red""

First, let's isolate the occurrences of ""walm"" and the color that appears immediately after it in the output:

- Example 1: After ""walm"" the color is blue.
- Example 2: After ""walm"" the color is green.
- Example 3: The colors after the two occurrences of ""walm"" are blue and red.
- Example 4: The colors after the two occurrences of ""walm"" are red and yellow.
- Example 5: After ""walm"" the color is green.

Given that ""walm"" is followed by a different color in each occurrence, we need to identify a pattern that determines which color follows ""walm."" If we examine the color that precedes ""walm,"" we may observe that it seems to dictate the color that follows ""walm.""

- Example 1: ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue""
- Example 2: ""dax walm"" -> ""green green""
- Example 3: Immediately before the first ""walm,"" the color is yellow whereas before the second ""walm"" it is blue. After the respective ""walm,"" the colors are blue (same as 'lug') and red (same as 'wif').
- Example 4: Before both occurrences of ""walm,"" the color is yellow, and the colors that follow are red and yellow, which align with the colors that correspond to the previous word 'lug' and 'zup' respectively.
- Example 5: ""dax walm"" -> ""green green""

Based on the information above, a possible rule could be that ""walm"" changes the output color to the color that corresponds to the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word's corresponding output color.

So, walm -> meaning: walm causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word's output.",-0.13777140708958882,54,walm
"To deduce the meaning of 'walm,' let's look at the repeated patterns and their corresponding outputs:

1. Whenever 'walm' follows 'lug':
   - 'lug walm zup wif' -> blue blue blue yellow red
   - 'lug dax walm wif' -> blue green green green red

   The word after 'lug' is translated to blue, irrespective of it being 'walm' or 'dax'. This suggests that 'lug' is associated with blue, so 'walm' does not necessarily mean blue.

2. When 'walm' follows 'wif' or is at the end:
   - 'wif bluf dax walm' -> red red green green green
   - 'lug dax walm wif' -> blue green green green red

   'walm' seems to generate the color green when it follows certain words or is at the end. However, the pattern is insufficient to conclude this without an exception.

3. In sequences with repeated 'walm', all instances of 'wif' (before and after) translate to red:
   - 'wif walm zup lug wif walm zup' -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   - 'wif walm zup lug zup walm' -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

   Whenever 'walm' appears after 'wif,' both 'wif' and 'walm' translate to red.

So, we can conclude:

walm -> meaning: When preceded by 'wif', 'walm' translates to red. Otherwise, 'walm' is represented by green. However, there isn't enough information to definitively determine the rule when 'walm' precedes 'lug.'

Rule: If 'walm' is preceded by 'wif,' it translates to red; in other contexts, it is green, although more examples are needed to fully understand how 'walm' interacts with 'lug.'",-0.19801236613560746,54,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern visible in each output relative to the location of ""walm"" in the input and the colors associated with it.

In the first example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""zup wif,"" and the colors that follow are ""blue blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" might mean ""blue."" However, we need more data.

In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green."" This suggests ""walm"" might induce repetition in the color output (since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is then repeated).

The third example also consists of ""wif walm"" and ""lug wif walm"" sequences, which seem to produce ""red red red"" and ""blue red red red."" So ""walm"" following ""wif"" and ""lug"" generates an additional ""red"" and ""blue,"" corresponding to the colors of ""wif"" and ""lug"" respectively, before the sequence follows normal rules.

The fourth example again shows that after ""zup lug zup walm,"" we have ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" It seems like after ""walm,"" the color of ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated three times.

The fifth example features ""lug dax walm wif,"" resulting in ""blue green green green red."" Here, the ""green"" corresponding to ""dax"" is repeated before returning to normal sequence with ""wif"" being ""red.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it, before continuing with the normal color sequence as dictated by the following words.

The context of the other words (""wif"", ""dax"", ""bluf"", ""lug"") also changes around ""zup"", yet ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow"".

"Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: Across all the examples provided, we can observe that whenever the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""

Rule: The nonce word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' in each example provided.",-1.6449216813959764,55,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the output whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
3. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
4. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
5. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue

In every instance, the word following ""bluf"" in the output is not determined by the position of ""bluf"" in the input (because ""bluf"" appears at different positions, and the following word is not the same in each output). Hence, we should look for a pattern regardless of the word ""bluf"" position.

Comparing inputs and outputs where ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax"" suggests that ""dax"" is always mapped to ""green"" and ""bluf"" is also mapped to ""green.""

In the example ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" results in ""red red."" In that sequence, each word is mapped to a color, but ""bluf"" corresponds to two repeated colors.

A possible interpretation is that ""bluf"" duplicates the color output of the word that immediately follows it. Let's test this hypothesis:

- In example 3, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" which is mapped to ""yellow."" The output after ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which is mapped to ""red."" The output after ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" which hasn't appeared elsewhere without ""bluf""; however, the output is ""blue blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" would map to ""blue.""

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" itself maps to ""green"" and causes the color corresponding to the next word to be repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> green and duplicates the color of the following word in the output.",-0.10837252465704546,55,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will analyze the examples given and look for patterns associated with it:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
3. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
4. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
5. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" is the last word, the output is the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"" but repeated twice.
- When ""bluf"" is followed by another word, the output is the color corresponding to ""bluf"" (whatever it is) followed by the color corresponding to the next word.

Based on this, it seems that ""bluf"" represents a rule to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, whenever ""bluf"" is used, it takes the color of the preceding word and outputs it twice.

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

""Walm"" appears at the end of the sequence. The last three outputs are ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""walm"" may be causing the color yellow to repeat thrice.

2. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

""Walm"" appears after the word ""lug"" (which translates to blue) and is followed by ""dax"" (which translates to green). Since the output is ""blue blue blue"" after ""lug,"" it seems that ""walm"" creates a repetition of the color that comes before it. In this case, it repeats the color blue three times.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to yellow), and once again the output is a threefold repetition, reinforcing the earlier interpretation of ""walm"" inducing a triadic repetition.

4. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

When ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" (which translates to green), the output is ""green green green."" This maintains the pattern that ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the previous color three times.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" yet again (green), prompting a triple replication of green as seen in the output.

- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellow"" repetitions.
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in two more ""blue"" colors.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the pattern of outputs associated with the inputs where ""walm"" is present. Here are the observations based on the examples provided:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
3. When ""walm"" stands alone after ""zup,"" the output is still ""yellow yellow yellow.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
5. When ""walm"" follows ""wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" follows the color associated with ""dax,"" ignoring ""wif"" and ""bluf.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" produces a triplet of a color that is directly linked to the color of the word that precedes it. The word before ""walm"" in every input translates to a color, and ""walm"" repeats that color three times in the output.

Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Therefore:
zup -> yellow
lug -> blue
dax -> green

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the correspondence between the appearance of the word ""bluf"" in the input and the colors in the output.

In the given examples, whenever ""bluf"" is present:
- ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green.""
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""
- ""wif bluf"" again corresponds to ""red red"" (confirming the previous correspondence).
- ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow.""
- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""

From these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color green. However, we also need to explain why we see two greens in each output that contains ""bluf."" 

One hypothesis could be that ""bluf"" means green, and the number of times green is repeated in the output is directly dependent on the presence and position of ""dax"" or ""wif.""

Rules:
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- When ""bluf"" is present alongside ""dax"" or ""wif,"" the output repeats the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) or ""wif"" (red), indicating that ""bluf"" prompts a repetition of the color that is associated with the word occurring with ""bluf.""

According to these observations, the rule could be as follows:

Rule: bluf -> prompts a repetition of the color associated with the adjacent word.",-0.1452070901503077,56,bluf
"Observing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can try to induce a rule based on the position of the word ""bluf"" and the color output it generates. Here's the analysis of the given examples:

1. Input: ""zup dax bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow green green""
2. Input: ""wif bluf"" -> Output: ""red red""
3. Input: ""wif bluf"" -> Output: ""red red""
4. Input: ""dax bluf zup"" -> Output: ""green green yellow""
5. Input: ""dax bluf"" -> Output: ""green green""

Now let's look at the pattern:

- In the first and fourth examples, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and the color ""green"" is repeated twice.
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and the color ""red"" is repeated twice.
- The presence of ""zup"" before or after ""bluf"" does not affect the number of times the colors are repeated, suggesting ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow,"" but it does not influence the meaning of ""bluf.""

Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""bluf,"" when following another word, causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated twice. If we're only focusing on the word ""bluf"" and how it impacts the sequence, we could determine the following rule:

bluf -> meaning: When following a word, ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat once, thus appearing twice consecutively.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, the color output that corresponds to that word is repeated.",-0.17707240738730762,56,bluf

1. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (Repeat of example 2 signifies consistent rule)
4. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow""
5. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""

Based on these examples, we can infer the following:

- The word ""bluf"" always yields a color output that is the same as the color output produced by the word that precedes it in the input.
- The placement of ""bluf"" does not affect the color output it produces; it merely mimics the color of the preceding word, whether it is at the end of the input sequence or between other words.

Considering these patterns, the rule we can derive is:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns before and after the word ""walm"" in the given examples. 

In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to be three occurrences of the color associated with the word prior to ""walm."" There is no word after ""walm"" the second time, and we still see ""blue"" repeated three times, so the color repetition seems to only depend on the word before ""walm.""

In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" Similarly, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and following ""walm"" we see the color ""red"" repeated three times.

In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" As observed before, ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" repeated three times.

The fourth example, ""zup wif walm,"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Again, the pattern holds where ""wif"" means ""red,"" and post ""walm"" we see ""red"" three times.

The fifth example, ""dax walm,"" translates to ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" appears to translate to ""green,"" and ""walm"" again causes the color ""green"" to be repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.0797796697816854,56,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the occurrences of the word and their corresponding outputs:

1. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
2. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. dax walm -> green green green

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" results in a repetition of a color based on a preceding word. The word that comes right before ""walm"" determines the color. Here are the patterns that can be deduced:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

Based on the provided outputs, ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the last color word. However, ""zup"" does not behave the same way, as seen in the first two examples, ""zup"" results in the color ""yellow"", but no repetition regardless of the presence of ""walm"". This suggests that ""zup"" has its own fixed output and does not interact with ""walm"" the same way ""lug"", ""wif"", or ""dax"" do.

The rule regarding ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color indicated by the preceding word three times.

Therefore:

walm -> Triggers a threefold repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.1612853252059551,56,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples:

- When the input starts with ""lug walm,"" the output is a sequence of ""blue blue blue.""
- When starting with ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- Starting with ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green.""

In each of these cases, it can be noticed that the output color is repeated three times. This consistency suggests that ""walm"" is related to a repetition of a color, but the specific color to repeat isn't determined solely by ""walm"" itself — it has to be in context with another word that precedes it.

Additionally, if we look at the other words:

- ""lug"" always leads to ""blue"" in the output.
- ""wif"" always leads to ""red"" in the output.
- ""zup"" always leads to ""yellow"" in the output, and it is not repeated three times like the other colors. It's a one-time occurrence in the output, regardless of what follows after it.
- ""dax"" leads to ""green"" in the output, repeated three times similar to the other colors except yellow.

The pattern suggests that the word before ""walm"" dictates the color that ""walm"" causes to be repeated three times. ""Zup"" is slightly different, the color (yellow) is not repeated three times, likely because it is a singleton color indicator in this rule system.

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be: repeat the color indicated by the preceding word three times. The exception is ""zup,"" where yellow is only shown once.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color indicated by the preceding word three times (except when preceded by ""zup,"" in which case the color yellow appears only once).",-0.7375098967539326,56,walm
"Examining the examples provided and observing how the output changes with the different inputs containing ""walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. Here's the breakdown:

- In example 1, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which means ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""walm"" causes a triple repetition of ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which means ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""walm"" again causes a triple repetition of ""red.""
- In example 3, ""lug walm"" again leads to a triple ""blue.""
- In example 4, ""wif walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" but since ""walm"" is with ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- In example 5, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" so ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes a triple repetition of ""green.""

Based on the above patterns, the rule seems as follows:

walm -> meaning: Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: If [word] is followed by ""walm,"" the output will be the color associated with [word] repeated three times.",-0.7435052790741572,56,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze how the outputs correlate with the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs.

- When preceded by ""wif,"" the output is three reds.
- When preceded by ""dax,"" the output is three greens.
- When preceded by ""zup,"" the output is one yellow followed by three of another color, which follows ""walm.""

4. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
5. Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow

Observations:
- In example 1, ""zup walm"" gives three ""yellow,"" which indicates that ""zup"" might represent ""yellow"" when followed by ""walm.""
- In example 2, ""zup wif walm"" changes the output to ""yellow red red red,"" showing that ""wif"" corresponds with ""red,"" but ""zup"" does not consistently translate to ""yellow"" since it is present but the output contains other colors as well.
- In example 3, ""dax zup lug wif lug"" results in a sequence where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Zup"" appears once and is followed by ""yellow"" in the output. This again proposes that ""zup"" might translate to ""yellow.""
- In example 4, everytime ""lug"" appears, it is translated to ""blue"" in the output. ""Wif"" appears once and corresponds to ""red."" ""Zup"" precedes a ""yellow"" in both instances where it occurs in the input, supporting the notion that it might mean ""yellow.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Zup"" at the end of the sequence is followed by a ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on the observations, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-0.0903152357660919,57,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's compare the inputs and outputs for each example to identify the rule.

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" as evidenced by the repetition of yellow in the output. 

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
   Here, ""wif"" is introduced and corresponds to ""red,"" with ""walm"" again corresponding to ""yellow."" However, since the output starts with ""yellow,"" ""zup"" may still be related to the first instance of ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   
   In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" the same as in the first two examples.

4. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   
   Once again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Notably, both instances of ""zup"" precede the word ""yellow"" in the output.

5. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   
   Here, we have a new word ""bluf,"" which corresponds to the second instance of ""red"" in the output sequence, while ""wif"" is the first ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" again is followed by ""yellow.""

Looking over these examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. No matter where ""zup"" appears in the input sequence, it is followed by ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-0.22702621700212636,57,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

1. ""walm"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
2. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" and appears to add a repeating pattern when used before ""walm"" (as in ""wif walm"").
3. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
4. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
5. ""bluf"" is unknown but it is consistent with the output ""red"".

Now, looking at the pattern involving ""zup"":

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is only ""yellow"". This suggests that ""zup"" does not affect the translation of ""walm"" because the presence of ""zup"" did not change ""walm"" from yellow to another color.
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""wif"", as in the third example, ""zup"" itself is translated to ""yellow"", and the pattern that follows is consistent with the established translation of the other words.
- When ""zup"" is inserted between ""lug"" and ""wif"", the presence of ""zup"" does not change the translation of the words following it.

Based on this analysis, we can induce the rule that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and does not affect the translation of the words following it.

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.

Examples analyzed:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"", so ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"".
- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green"", where ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"".
- In the third example, ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"", with ""bluf"" repeating the color associated with the preceding word, which is ""zup"" (yellow).
- The fourth example, ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"", outputs ""blue blue red blue blue yellow"". In this case, ""bluf"" repeats ""lug""'s color first and then does the same at its second occurrence.
- The fifth example, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"", has the output ""red red yellow yellow red"", with ""bluf"" repeating ""wif""'s color first and then ""zup""'s color at the second occurrence.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf => Repeat the color of the word preceding ""bluf"".",-0.08905226863127907,57,bluf
"Observing the given examples, the output for ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that precedes it. Here's a breakdown:

1. When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and ""lug"" in different instances, and the corresponding outputs are ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively, with each color repeated twice, similar to the first two examples.
4. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"".
5. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".

The pattern is that ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it and duplicates that color in the output:

- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green"".
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"".
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red"".

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow,"" and then ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" with the output ""blue."" It shows that ""bluf"" is taking the color from the word right before it.

Rule:
- ""walm"" -> Repetition of the previous color word three times.

Explanation:
1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
2. ""dax walm wif zup"" results in ""green green green red yellow"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
3. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" results in ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
4. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" again (not repeated since there's no subsequent ""walm"").
5. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" likely repeats ""blue"" but doesn't follow the ""walm"" sequence, thus is not repeated three times.

In conclusion:
walm -> Causes the previous color word to be repeated three times.",-0.10783714600358696,57,walm
"The examples suggest that ""walm"" is a nonce word that stands for repeating the color associated with the previous word. Each time ""walm"" is used, it repeats the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it based on the following pattern:
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue

Looking at each example:

- ""zup walm"" repeats yellow (as ""zup"" corresponds to yellow)
- ""dax walm wif zup"" repeats green (as ""dax"" corresponds to green) followed by red (from ""wif"") and then yellow (from ""zup"")
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" repeats green (from ""dax""), then yellow (from ""zup""), followed by blue (from ""lug""), and then repeats blue again because of the second ""walm""
- ""dax walm wif dax"" repeats green twice (from ""dax""), followed by red (from ""wif""), and then green again (from the second ""dax"")
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" repeats blue thrice (from ""lug""), followed by red (from ""wif""), blue again (from the second ""lug"") and an unknown color from ""bluf"" given that there is no defined output, we cannot conclude what ""bluf"" translates to in terms of color.

"Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word the number of times equivalent to the number of letters in that word.

Explanation:
1. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow""; ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" which has five letters, hence ""walm"" means to repeat ""yellow"" five times.
2. ""dax walm wif zup"" outputs ""green green green red yellow""; ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" which has four letters, therefore ""walm"" here means to repeat ""green"" four times.
3. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""; ""dax"" is three repetitions of ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" (three letters), so the second ""walm"" means to repeat ""blue"" three times.

2. Input: dax zup bluf

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

4. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

From the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word that immediately precedes it. For example:

- In Example 1, ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and then ""bluf"" is placed after ""zup,"" resulting in another ""yellow""
- In Example 3, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and then ""bluf"" immediately follows, resulting in another ""red""
- In Example 5, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and then ""bluf"" follows which also results in ""red""

The same pattern can be seen with ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and other instances where ""bluf"" follows a word. This suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color that was translated from the word directly preceding it and repeats it as its output.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color output of the immediately preceding word.",-0.10117228731127273,58,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to identify the patterns associated with the nonce word in the input and their corresponding output.

Reviewing all the examples:

- Input: zup bluf
  Output: yellow yellow
  
- Input: dax zup bluf
  Output: green yellow yellow
  
- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red
  
- Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
  Output: red green yellow red green green

- Input: zup wif bluf
  Output: yellow red red

From the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the word before it to be repeated in the output. Looking at the pattern:

- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow."" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and then ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow.""
- ""dax zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow."" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" then ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to ""zup,"" hence, another ""yellow.""
- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red."" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and then ""bluf"" repeats ""red.""
- ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" shows a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf,"" which is ""dax."" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" hence ""green"" is repeated.

3. ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red,"" supporting the idea that ""bluf"" follows the color of the preceding word.
4. In ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" we can see that ""bluf"" adopts the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" since it follows ""dax.""

- In ""dax zup bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" generates ""yellow yellow"", but we also have ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"".

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a series of colors that match the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"". For instance:

- In ""dax zup dax walm"", ""dax"" is associated with green, so the output after ""walm"" is a series of the color associated with ""dax"", which is green.
- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" is associated with blue, so the output after ""walm"" is a series of the color associated with ""lug"", which is blue.
- In ""lug walm wif bluf"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and thus results in a series of blues before we see the pattern continue with ""wif bluf"" which translates to red red.
- In ""zup wif walm"", ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and thus the output after ""walm"" is a series of reds associated with ""wif"".
- In ""dax walm wif"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and thus a series of greens is outputted before the ""wif"" changes the color to red.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the immediately preceding word and repeats it for a series of outputs equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow red red red"".

Given these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the previous word's color to be repeated three times. However, the exception is when ""walm"" follows ""zup"", in which case there is an additional ""red"" color output. Assuming ""walm"" works the same way after ""zup,"" but an additional rule applies when ""wif"" is present in the sequence, causing the next word’s color to be output once.

"From the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red."" Let's examine the evidence to confirm this:

- In each instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""
- The word ""bluf"" maintains its meaning across different contexts and positions in the sentence (""bluf,"" ""wif bluf,"" ""dax bluf,"" etc.), which suggests that its meaning is independent of neighboring words.
- None of the other colors (yellow, green, blue) align with ""bluf"" in the output.

Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we should look at the correlation between its presence in the input and the pattern of the output. Here, we examine the outputs and look for consistency in the representation of ""walm"":

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

5. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Rule:
- In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding output colors are ""red red red green.""
- In the second input, ""walm"" appears twice, both times followed by ""zup,"" and the associated output colors are ""red red red yellow"" and ""red red red yellow,"" with an additional ""blue"" following ""lug"".
- In the third input, ""walm"" has no words after it, and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the fourth and fifth inputs, ""walm"" is not the first nor the last word, yet it seems to always result in three ""red"" followed by a color that corresponds to the word after ""walm.""

Considering these sequences, it appears ""walm"" consistently results in a triplet of ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The word that follows ""walm"" determines the color that comes after the three ""red."" Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" translates to a fixed output pattern, specifically three ""red"" followed by the color that corresponds to the word after ""walm."" If there is no word after ""walm,"" then there is no additional color beyond the three ""red.""

Based on the observed patterns, here is the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> three instances of the color red, followed by the color corresponding to the word that comes after ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the last word, there is no fourth color.",-0.06747325147738317,59,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the relationship between the input and the output sequences. Let's look for patterns:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> red red red green yellow
2. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
3. ""wif walm"" -> red red red
4. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> green blue blue blue green red red green
5. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Observations:
- Every time ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a sequence of red outputs; however, the number of reds after ""walm"" seems to be context-dependent.
- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by two non-""walm"" words, and there are two reds before the pattern departs from red.
- In example 2, ""walm"" appears twice, first followed by one non-""walm"" word, resulting in one red output before changing, and the second time it's followed again by two non-""walm"" words, resulting in two red outputs before changing.
- In example 3, ""walm"" is at the end of the input and is followed by a sequence of three reds.
- Examples 4 and 5 show that ""walm"" can be followed by different colors depending on the words that come after.

Rule:
From the observations, we can derive that ""walm"" stands for a sequence starting with red, and the number of reds corresponds to the number of terms following ""walm"" up to the next occurrence of ""walm"" or up to the end of the input if ""walm"" does not repeat. If another word follows ""walm,"" then non-red colors occur corresponding to those words.

So, we have something like:

walm -> start a red sequence, continue with red for each following word unless ""walm"" recurs or the sequence ends.

However, this does not fully explain the outputs after the reds, as they do not seem to have a consistent pattern with the given data. There may be additional rules governing the outputs after ""walm,"" but we will need more examples or information to deduce them accurately. For now, we will focus on the apparent pattern of reds after ""walm.""

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Start a sequence of red outputs, where the number of red outputs corresponds to the number of terms following ""walm"" before the next ""walm"" occurrence or the end of the input sequence.",-0.09290862964871961,59,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the input with the corresponding output colors in all of the examples provided:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
3. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax | Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
5. Input: lug wif dax zup walm | Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Looking at the outputs, we can deduce that every instance of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the immediately preceding color output:

1. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), leading to a repetition of red.
2. ""walm"" again follows ""wif"" (red) twice, leading to the repetition of red each time.
3. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), repeating the color red.
4. ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and blue is repeated.
5. ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and yellow is repeated.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" to repeat.

Rule: walm -> causes the immediate previous color to be repeated.",-0.09404502122947661,59,walm
"The rule seems to be that ""walm"" adds the color ""red"" one more time than it directly translates to. When it appears in a phrase, it translates into ""red"" repeated once plus ""red"" for each occurrence of the word ""walm.""

In the first example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" transforms into two additional instances of ""red."" From other examples, we can infer the transformation of other words to colors: ""wif"" turns into ""red,"" ""dax"" into ""green,"" ""zup"" into ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" into ""blue.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to consistently correspond to a sequence of ""red"" outputs.

The other words (""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf"") correlate with different single colors in the output. It's also important to note that the word ""walm"" is the only one that consistently produces a sequence of three identical outputs, suggesting that it triggers a replication rule in the system where the output ""red"" is produced three times.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word translates to a specific color. However, the only consistent correlation presented is between the word ""dax"" and the color ""green"". The other words (""bluf"", ""zup"", ""walm"", ""wif"") appear only once in the examples with their corresponding colors (""green"", ""yellow"", ""yellow"", ""red""), so we cannot definitively conclude their meanings based on this data alone.

Nonetheless, if we assume that the other words also translate consistently to their respective colors, then we could deduce the following rule:

Rule:
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""bluf"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""walm"" -> yellow
- ""wif"" -> red

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.0638875418839885,60,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the provided examples. Let's analyze the relationship between the input and the output, focusing on the occurrences of ""walm.""

In the first example:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
""Walm"" appears twice, and both times it is followed by three colors. After the first ""walm,"" there are three reds, and after the second ""walm,"" there are three yellows.

In the second example:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
""Walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" resulting in three blues.

In the third example:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
""Walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which follows ""dax,"" leading to green followed by three blues.

In the fourth example:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
""Walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" leading to three reds, followed by ""lug"" which turns to blue.

In the fifth example:
Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
""Walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which is preceded by ""lug"" and ""dax,"" leading to a pattern of green, blue, followed by three reds.

From these examples, we can see that ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of three of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word just before it three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output.",-0.07422623459643679,60,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

In every instance where ""walm"" appears in the input, there is a repetition of the color that follows it, with the number of repetitions equalling the number of occurrences of the word ""lug"" before the next color is mentioned or the input ends.

Here is the breakdown:

1. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" appears twice. After the first ""walm,"" the color ""red"" (associated with ""wif"") is repeated three times until a new color word ""zup"" (associated with ""blue"") is mentioned. After the second ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated thrice as the input ends there.

2. ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" is mentioned once before ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.

3. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" is mentioned once before ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" associated with the preceding ""lug"" is repeated three times.

4. ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue."" Since ""wif"" appears once before ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times until a new color term ""bluf"" (which may represent ""blue"") appears.

5. ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red."" ""Lug"" precedes ""wif,"" but since ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" only the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" is repeated.

Therefore, we can infer that:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color word that precedes it the number of times ""lug"" has been mentioned before the next color word or the end of the input, plus one. If ""walm"" directly follows ""lug,"" the color word for ""lug"" is repeated instead. If ""walm"" is the first word, it appears to default to repeating the color ""red."" 

Based on this understanding, ""walm"" could be interpreted as an instruction for repetition.

walm -> Repeat the previous color the number of times equivalent to the count of ""lug"" before it (plus one), otherwise, it repeats the color ""red"".",-0.1158141718256782,60,walm
"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. 

For example:

- In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"", ""wif"" is associated with red, so ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""; ""zup"" is associated with yellow, so ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" is associated with blue, so ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and is associated with blue, so ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""wif walm lug bluf"", ""wif"" is associated with red, so ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""; ""lug"" follows and is associated with blue, but ""walm"" does not follow ""lug"" in this case, so there are no repeated colors for ""lug"".
- In ""dax lug wif walm"", ""wif"" is associated with red, so ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" after ""wif"".

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears consistent in triggering a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes directly before ""walm"".",-0.41087482089689675,60,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to dictate the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. It instructs to repeat the output color of the previous word two more times, making a total of three consecutive colors the same. Here’s the analysis:

- In the first example, the word ""lug"" has the output ""red"", and the first occurrence of ""walm"" after that repeats ""red"" two more times. The same pattern occurs with ""zup"" followed by ""walm"", which translates to ""blue"" followed by ""yellow"" two more times.
- In the second example, the word ""lug"" has the output ""blue"" and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated two more times.
- In the third example, the word ""lug"" has the output ""blue"" once again, and the word ""walm"" causes the color ""blue"" to be repeated two more times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" has the output ""red"" and ""walm"" makes this color repeat two extra times, followed by ""lug"" which has the output ""blue"", which is then followed by a new word, ""bluf"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and the color ""red"" is repeated three times after ""wif"".

Input 2: ""wif walm dax"" yields Output 2: ""red red red green."" Here, ""dax"" is again corresponding to ""green,"" following two instances of ""red,"" which suggests that ""dax"" does not depend on its position after ""wif.""

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the commonality within the input/output pairs provided:

1. For 'dax walm', the output is 'green green green'. 
   We have two words ('dax' and 'walm') and three instances of the output color ('green').

2. In 'dax zup walm wif walm', the output sequence is 'green yellow yellow yellow red red red' with 'walm' appearing twice.
   Here, we have 'green' appearing once for 'dax', 'yellow' appearing three times for 'zup', and two sequences of 'red red red', corresponding to two instances of 'walm'.

3. For 'wif walm dax', the output is 'red red red green'.
   'walm' gives us 'red red red' and 'dax' provides a single 'green'.

4. In 'zup dax walm lug wif', the output sequence is 'yellow green green green blue red'.
   'zup' leads to 'yellow', 'dax' gives us 'green', 'walm' results in 'green green green', 'lug' is matched with 'blue', and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

5. Lastly, for 'wif walm zup', the output is 'red red red yellow'.
   'wif' results in 'red', 'walm' again provides 'red red red', and 'zup' translates into 'yellow'.

From these examples, we can discern a pattern where 'dax' corresponds to a single 'green', 'wif' leads to a single 'red', 'zup' gives a single 'yellow', while 'walm' always results in 'red red red'. The pattern of the color repetition appears to be three times regardless of the context.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" correlates with a thrice-repeated color, specifically 'red' in all the example outputs provided. Hence, ""walm"" results in ""red red red"".",-0.077634651222375,61,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the positions of ""walm"" in each sequence and the corresponding outputs. We can notice that each ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated word in the output. Here are the observations:

1. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"" – ""walm"" is placed after ""dax"" with three repetitions of ""green"".
2. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"" – The first ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and the second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red red red"".
3. ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green"" – ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red red red"".
4. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green blue red"" – ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green green green"".
5. ""wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow"" – ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red red red"".

Upon examining these patterns, we can induce the following rules:

- ""walm"" when preceded by ""dax"" results in ""green green green"".
- ""walm"" when preceded by ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""walm"" when preceded by ""wif"" results in ""red red red"".

If ""walm"" consistently translates to three repetitions of a color, and the specific color is determined by the word that precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" seems to be a rule indicating three repetitions of a color, where the color is dependent on the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> three repetitions of a color, determined by the preceding word. The specific three-color-sequence depends on the word before walm:

- ""dax"" before ""walm"" -> green green green
- ""zup"" before ""walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" before ""walm"" -> red red red",-0.1178284769696477,61,walm

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" but the pattern isn't entirely clear yet as ""dax"" is also associated with ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax zup walm wif walm"" outputs two different patterns: one for ""zup"" (yellow), one for ""wif"" (red), and ""walm"" results in ""red red red"" at the end of the pattern. ""Dax"" remains consistently ""green.""
- The third example, ""wif walm dax,"" has ""walm"" again producing ""red red red"" and confirms ""dax"" as ""green"" again since the order has changed but the individual outputs have not.
- The fourth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" includes a new word ""lug,"" which seems to output ""blue."" ""Walm"" yet again results in ""red red red,"" ""dax"" as ""green,"" and ""wif"" ends with ""red.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif walm zup"" confirms the pattern for ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow), with ""walm"" again resulting in ""red red red.""

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" takes the color immediately before it and doubles it in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it represents a repetition of the color word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Repetition of the preceding color word in the output.",-0.12486968953607142,62,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a rule where it results in repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, and the number of repetitions seems to be two. Looking at the examples:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (associated with yellow), the output is ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (associated with red), the output is ""blue blue"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (associated with blue), the output is ""blue blue"".

No example is directly associating ""bluf"" after ""dax"" (associated with green), but the pattern suggests that if ""dax"" were followed by ""bluf"", the output would be ""green green"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be outputted twice.

Therefore, bluf -> blue blue.",-1.7782529778607146,62,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be a rule that requires the previous word to be repeated three times with the color that corresponds to that word.

Here's the reasoning:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" which corresponds to ""dax"" being associated with the color green and being repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating ""lug"" stands for the color blue and is also repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""zup"" is synonymous with yellow and is repeated thrice.

We can confirm this with the longer input where ""walm"" follows specific nonce words associated with colors:

- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""green red yellow yellow red red red,"" which implies that ""walm"" applies the rule to the word ""bluf,"" which is presumably red, based on the pattern (as ""wif"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"" and the output is red).
  
- In the last example, ""dax walm wif dax,"" the rule repeats ""dax"" three times after ""walm"" (""green green green""), and then ""wif dax"" results in ""red green,"" following the established rule for ""wif"" and the given color for ""dax.""

By examining these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the following: the color associated with the word immediately after ""walm"" is repeated three times before the sequence proceeds normally. 

Rule: walm -> The color associated with the word immediately following ""walm"" is outputted three times in a row.",-0.08663066251709807,64,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs and identify what ""walm"" corresponds to in each output.

1. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
3. Input: dax walm zup lug | Output: green green green yellow blue
4. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
5. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm | Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

From the examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" seems to correspond to three reds in a row.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" but precedes three greens in a row, separate from the ""dax"" green.
- In the third example, ""walm"" itself generates three greens even before ""zup"" which translates to yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" (yellow) but followed by three yellows indicating that it might again represent three of the preceding color.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows a ""wif"" (red) and a ""zup"" (yellow), and in both cases, it leads to three additional instances of the preceding color (red and yellow, respectively).

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" generates three additional occurrences of the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color indicated by the previous word three times.",-0.09036415433273534,64,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples:

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
2. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
3. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
4. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
5. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Now let's try to identify the rules for each word:

- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" leads to ""red.""
- ""dax"" leads to ""green.""
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" does not appear consistently, but it's followed by ""red"" in the second example, which may be because of ""wif.""

The challenge is to deduce what ""walm"" means based on these color outcomes. One thing to notice is that the output colors following ""walm"" seem to be repetitions or a sequence that is not directly associated with a single color like the other words.

Let's see if ""walm"" has any impact on the next word in the sequence:

1. ""walm"" is followed by no words and ends in three ""red.""
2. ""walm"" is followed by no words and ends in three ""green.""
3. ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and the sequence includes three ""green"" before that.
4. ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and the sequence includes three ""yellow"" before that.
5. ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and then another ""walm,"" which is followed by another sequence of ""yellow.""

Considering the examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the next word's color to be repeated three times. Since in the case of example 1 and 2, there is no next word, ""walm"" just repeats the color of the word before it, ""wif"" three times. Where ""walm"" is followed by another word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, it repeats the color associated with the word directly before it thrice. When ""walm"" precedes another word, it repeats the color associated with the word directly following it thrice.

Using this rule, let's test the fifth input:

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output should be: red red red (because wif is red, and walm causes it to repeat), followed by yellow yellow yellow (because zup is yellow and walm causes it to repeat), blue (because lug is blue), and then yellow yellow yellow (because walm is followed by zup, which is yellow).

So the actual sequence matches the expected output.

There is a consistent pattern where every instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds directly to the color ""red"" in the output. Meanwhile, other nonce words like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""bluf"" seem to translate to ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""green,"" respectively, although ""bluf"" specifically seems to always follow with ""green"" regardless of its position, which may require further examples to fully understand.

It seems that ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red."" More examples might provide further clarity or exceptions to this rule, but within the given dataset, we consistently see that ""wif"" is associated with the color red.

3. ""zup lug bluf"" -> ""yellow blue blue""

"By analyzing the provided examples, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

1. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""green green green yellow blue""
2. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
5. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green yellow green green green red""

From the examples, we observe the following patterns:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it.
- The number of repetitions equals the number of letters in the word that precedes ""walm.""

Applying this understanding to the provided examples, we get:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and since ""dax"" has three letters, ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three more times (for a total of three greens because ""walm"" follows ""dax"").
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and as ""wif"" has three letters, ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.
3. Similar to example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""green"" three times due to the three-letter count in ""dax.""
4. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which has three letters, resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.
5. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Walm"" follows the second ""dax,"" which has three letters, so ""green"" is repeated three more times. Then ""wif"" leads to the output of red.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated as many times as there are letters in the preceding word.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the input and output patterns.

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""

Analyzing these patterns:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   This suggests ""walm"" is associated with ""green"" since it appears after ""dax"" which is also associated with ""green.""

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   In this instance, ""walm"" is associated with ""red"" as it follows ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red.""

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Here, ""walm"" is associated with ""green"" again, following the pattern of ""walm"" taking the color associated with the word that precedes it.

4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   ""Walm"" here takes the color of the word right before it, which is ""wif"" associated with ""red.""

5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided. Each example consists of some words followed by a series of colors in the output.

Looking at the first example:
- Input: dax zup dax walm 
- Output: green yellow green green green

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and appears twice in the output. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and appears once. The word ""walm"" appears in the input and is followed by ""green"" repeated three times, so it seems ""walm"" could cause the preceding word's associated color to repeat thrice.

Now, let's look at the second example:
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green

Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times.

In the third example:
- Input: lug walm
- Output: blue blue blue

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times, consistent with the previous examples.

In the fourth example, we have multiple words with outputs:
- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
- Output: red red green green red red red blue red

The pattern of word-to-color is maintained with ""wif"" being ""red"" and ""dax"" being ""green."" ""Walm"" appears after ""wif"" and leads to ""red"" being repeated three times, once again supporting the observed pattern.

Finally:
- Input: wif walm
- Output: red red red

""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and with ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

Rule:
Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be output three times.",-0.07573194021402327,66,walm
"Analyzing the patterns presented in the examples:

1. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
   Here, dax correlates with green, and walm results in three greens following the green from dax.

2. dax walm -> green green green
   Again, dax correlates with green, and walm results in two additional greens.

3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
   For lug, the output is blue, and walm results in two additional blues.

4. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
   Here, wif correlates with red, dax goes with green, and bluf results in the same color following it. For walm, from the sequence 'wif walm,' it appears that two additional reds are added after wif, and for 'lug walm,' two additional blues are added after lug.

5. wif walm -> red red red
   These sequences confirm that wif correlates with red, and with walm added, two additional reds follow.

Based on the above examples, the rule for walm seems to be that it repeats the color of the previous word two more times. Hence, the output for walm will always be three consecutive colors, with the color being that of the word before walm.

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

Now, when ""walm"" follows these words, the corresponding color is repeated three times.

For instance:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""

So the rule seems to be: when ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. Here's the breakdown of the rules based on the input and output provided:

- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- When the word ""walm"" appears after any of these words, the output is a repetition of the associated color three times.

By applying those observations to the word ""walm,"" we can deduce the following rule:

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when used in a sequence. However, the word's presence also impacts how many times the following words are translated into their corresponding colors. Here's the pattern I have deduced:

1. When ""dax"" is mentioned alone, it outputs the color ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is followed by the word ""wif,"" it repeats the color pattern ""green red"".
3. When ""dax"" precedes another word (not ""wif""), it makes the following word repeat its corresponding color three times.
4. When another word precedes ""dax,"" ""dax"" outputs its color twice (as in example 5).

Let's break down the rules for how ""dax"" affects color repetition in the outputs:

- ""dax"" on its own is ""green.""
- ""dax"" followed by ""wif"" results in the pattern ""green red"" and is followed again by ""green"" if ""dax"" is repeated after ""wif."" Thus, ""dax wif dax"" becomes ""green red green.""
- ""dax"" followed by a word other than ""wif"" triggers the next word's corresponding color to appear three times. For instance, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" and ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" turns into ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow.""
- Another word followed by ""dax"" makes the color of ""dax"" appear twice in succession, as seen in the pattern ""lug bluf dax bluf"" turning into ""blue blue green green,"" where ""dax"" outputs green, which is repeated because it is following ""bluf.""

Therefore, the underlying rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: ""dax"" -> green. ""dax"" affects the repetition of colors in a sequence based on specific rules: alone it is ""green,"" preceded by ""wif"" it's a ""green red"" pattern, influencing the next word to be repeated three times if not ""wif,"" and it doubles its own color when preceded by another word.",-0.1886821321939743,67,dax
"Rule: The meaning of ""dax"" is dependent on the context in which it appears. It seems to take on the color value of the word immediately preceding it, except when it is at the beginning of a sequence or is preceded by a word that does not represent a color, in which case it defaults to ""green"". 

When ""dax"" is used alone or starts a sequence, the output is ""green"".

When ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"", the output is ""red green"" (because ""wif"" does not correspond to any color in the given examples, ""dax"" defaults to ""green"" and the pattern suggests that non-color words make the next ""dax"" turn ""red"").

When ""dax"" follows ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"", where ""walm"" appears to correspond to both ""blue"" and ""green"" (it is uncertain from the examples whether ""walm"" has a consistent color association, but ""dax"" following it leads to repetition of ""green"" indicating ""walm"" may contribute to the green output).

In the sequence ""lug bluf dax bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue and so does ""bluf"" by apparent similarity and context. The ""dax"" between them outputs ""green"" once again, suggesting that the presence of a color word before ""dax"" does not change its output (except when following ""walm"", which implies ""walm"" might be a special case).

Therefore, the generalized rule indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" unless a pattern of non-color words before it indicates a change to another color (as demonstrated with ""wif"").

The word ""wif"" in isolation corresponds to a single instance of ""red"" in the output. However, the output from ""wif"" seems to be affected by what comes before and after it based on the following observations:

- ""walm"" adds two extra ""red"" to the output.

- In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" becomes ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.""

This suggests that ""zup"" doesn't depend on its position relative to ""lug."" With ""walm"" coming after ""lug,"" the color pattern changes from ""yellow"" to ""blue.""

- The fourth example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup,"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow,"" where the pattern repeats, and the ""zup"" comes after three ""reds"" and switches it to ""yellow,"" followed by a ""blue.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup lug"" produces ""yellow blue,"" mirroring the output of ""lug zup"" in the first example, reinforcing the idea that ""zup"" brings in ""yellow"" when paired with ""lug.""

With these observations, we can interpret that ""zup"" changes the upcoming color pattern, typically bringing in ""yellow"" when followed or preceded by ""lug."" When ""zup"" occurs after ""wif walm,"" it changes the color pattern from ""red"" to ""yellow."" However, when it follows ""lug,"" it maintains the ""blue"" from ""lug.""

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it is a toggle or switch that changes the forthcoming color sequence, the specific effect of which depends on the context:

Rule: ""zup"" -> changes the next color in the sequence, often to ""yellow,"" but can maintain ""blue"" after ""lug."" The exact meaning is context-dependent, triggering a switch in the pattern of color output.",-0.1784622570667415,68,zup
"Rule: zup -> reversal of the immediately preceding color sequence. 

Explanation: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, it prompts the output of the color or sequence of colors that came before it but in reverse order.

- In the first example, ""lug zup"" leads to ""blue yellow,"" where ""lug"" must represent ""blue"" and ""zup"" prompts the output of ""blue"" (from ""lug"") reversed, which results in ""yellow blue,"" and the output has the colors reversed to match how it's written, hence ""blue yellow.""

- The second example ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" outputs ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif walm"" produces ""red red"" and ""zup"" then reverses this sequence to ""yellow yellow."" The next word ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" following which another ""zup"" prompts the reversal of ""yellow blue,"" resulting in ""blue yellow."" The last ""walm"" would then correspond to ""yellow.""

- Every instance of ""zup"" directly follows a pattern or a single color, and when it appears, we see the preceding pattern reversed in the output.

Therefore, zup -> reversal of the immediately preceding color sequence.",-0.6091286747125843,68,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" is a placeholder or a modifier for the color that comes after it when directly combined with the word ""lug."" The word ""lug"" on its own does not seem to have a color output, but when prefaced with ""zup,"" its output is ""yellow blue."" 

Furthermore, observing the examples, we can see that ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" and when ""zup lug"" follows ""wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow blue"" with an additional ""yellow"" for each instance of ""wif walm"" before it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"" plus one additional ""yellow"" for every ""wif walm"" preceding it in the sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word for a number of times. Let's look at each example to determine the exact rule:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Rule: The color red is repeated three times after ""wif"" when ""walm"" follows it.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule: The color blue is repeated three times after ""lug"" when ""walm"" follows it.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: The color green is repeated three times after ""dax"" when ""walm"" follows it.

4. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   Rule: The color green is repeated three times after ""dax"" when ""walm"" follows it, regardless of other colors before it.

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Rule: The color blue is repeated three times after ""lug"" when ""walm"" follows it, and this pattern is unaffected by the rest of the sequence.

The consistent pattern here is that when ""walm"" is present in the sequence, it repeats the color of the preceding word three times. So, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is outputted three times.",-0.06680066210202351,68,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to discern a pattern for the output colors associated with the nonce word ""walm"" and its surrounding context. 

Observations:

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif dax,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" However, when ""walm"" is alone after ""wif,"" the output is not provided. Therefore, we cannot directly associate ""wif"" with any output.

2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

3. Following ""dax,"" the output for ""walm"" is ""green green green.""

4. In the sequence ""zup wif dax walm,"" the output is ""yellow red green green green,"" where ""walm"" has three green following the precedent color of ""dax.""

5. Finally, in ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" the output is ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue,"" where again ""walm"" is followed by three of the same color, blue in this case, corresponding to the color for ""lug.""

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times in the output. To further validate this, let's examine if there are any contradictions to this pattern in the given examples:

- In the first input/output combination, ""wif walm dax zup,"" it might seem at first that the pattern doesn't hold because ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is red instead of a repetition of the color associated with ""wif."" However, there is not enough information to establish what color ""wif"" alone would be, so this case is inconclusive and doesn't necessarily contradict the pattern.

Summarizing the pattern established from the other examples, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, the output replicates the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.",-0.21213352365105884,68,walm
"Given the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" dictates the color repetition pattern of the previous word used:

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup"" the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" therefore after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times more, making it red, red, red, and then the sequence continues with ""green yellow.""
  
- In the second example, ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated twice more.

- In the third example, ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated twice more.

- In the fourth example, ""zup wif dax walm,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three more times.

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and so ""blue"" is repeated three more times before the sequence continues with another ""yellow blue.""

Considering these patterns, walm appears to cause the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three additional times. Therefore, the rule induced from the examples is:

Rule: walm -> The color of the word preceding walm is repeated three more times.",-0.3275109447397413,68,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the given examples, let's examine each color output in relation to its input:

- In every output where 'walm' is present, the color that immediately follows the word 'walm' is repeated until the end of the sequence, or until a new color sequence is initiated by another word.
- 'walm' by itself causes the immediate preceding color to be repeated (as seen in ""lug walm"").
- Whenever 'walm' follows another word, the color that corresponds to that preceding word is repeated (as seen in ""dax walm"" where 'dax' is green, and the output is ""green green green"").

Based on these observations, the rule for 'walm' appears to be that it causes the output color to repeat the color of the immediately preceding term until either the end of the sequence or a new color-inducing term is encountered.

Looking at the repetitions of blue and green in the outputs whenever ""walm"" is used in the inputs, it appears that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to repeat in the output for a specific number of times. To understand how many times the repetition occurs, we have to count the number of repeated colors that follow the word. It looks like ""walm"" repeats the preceding color three times, except for the last example, where ""walm"" is followed by ""wif lug,"" which deviates from the pattern.

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times. The final example looks like an exception, possibly due to ""wif"" appearing after ""walm"" rather than the usual color repetition. This deviation might indicate an additional rule or interaction introduced by additional color words following ""walm,"" but with the limited examples, we would need more data to understand that interaction fully.

Using the examples provided, the rule appears to be as follows:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", which suggests that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""dax"" (green) to repeat three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", again showing the repetition of the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) due to the presence of ""walm"".
- The third example, ""lug walm"", behaves consistently, with ""walm"" causing the color of ""lug"" to be repeated.
- The fourth example includes multiple color words before ""walm"", and each time ""walm"" appears, it causes the color word immediately before it to repeat three times (""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"").

- In the first example, the color before ""walm"" is ""green"" and after it, we see ""green"" repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""blue"" precedes ""walm"" and is then repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which translates to ""blue,"" thus the color ""blue"" is repeated three times following ""walm.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can compare the inputs and outputs across the examples given.

In the first example:
- ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green.""

Seeing the second example:
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow.""

And the third example:
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""green green red blue.""

The fourth example shows:
- ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red.""

And the fifth example:
- ""zup bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red.""

The patterns indicate that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color assigned to the word immediately preceding it. For instance, when ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is yellow. Similarly, when ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is green, and when ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf,"" the color output for ""bluf"" is red.

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:

bluf -> The word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it.",-0.0958591941961282,70,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns and colors associated with each instance where ""bluf"" is used in the given context.

From the examples provided:

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
3. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
4. dax wif bluf -> green red red
5. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red

From #1 and #2, we can see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and it's consistent irrespective of ""bluf"" being present. The same goes for ""dax -> green"" and ""wif -> red."" Also, ""lug"" is consistent across examples as translating to ""blue.""

Now, ""bluf"" is always followed by a color that appears twice in the output. ""bluf"" itself seems to act as a placeholder that dictates the next color mentioned in the input should repeat twice in the output. For example, in #1, after ""bluf,"" the color ""green"" is repeated twice. Similarly, in #2, the color ""yellow"" repeats twice in the output following ""bluf.""

Based on the given examples, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is present in the input, the next color in the sequence repeats twice in the output.

Therefore, ""bluf"" -> Repeat the next color twice.",-0.10066068918598714,70,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns of inputs and their corresponding output colors.

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
3. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
4. dax wif bluf -> green red red
5. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red

Now, let's look for consistencies:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears directly after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears directly after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears directly before ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow red"" or ""green red.""

From these observations, we can attempt to figure out what ""bluf"" corresponds to:

- In the second example, ""bluf"" outputs a color that corresponds to the word prior while duplicating its color output. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow.""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" also seems to correspond to a duplicated color associated with the word right before it, which is ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green.""
- The only outlier is the first example where ""wif"" comes after ""bluf"", breaking the pattern and resulting in a different color, ""red.""

Given this information, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it duplicates the color output of the word immediately preceding it, but if the word following ""bluf"" is ""wif"", it affects the output, and the resulting color is ""red"" for ""wif"".

Rule: Bluf -> duplicates the color output of the word immediately before it; if followed by ""wif,"" the word ""wif"" outputs ""red.""",-0.11871931550874362,70,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we must figure out the meaning of ""bluf"" by analyzing the patterns in the inputs and outputs. Here's what we have:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the result is yellow yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the result is green green.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the result is red red.
- ""bluf"" seems to take the color associated with the word right before it and duplicates it in the output.

Given the evidence, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning. ""Bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence.",-0.9755338283410259,70,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns related to the appearance of ""bluf"" in each input and the corresponding output color pattern.

In all examples where ""bluf"" appears, one of the outputs is consistently ""yellow,"" except for the third example, where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and the output is ""green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" has an output of ""green"" and is possibly affecting the output when it comes before ""bluf."" Let's examine the examples to rule out other possibilities.

- ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" in examples 2 and 5, and the outputs following ""bluf"" are ""yellow"" and ""yellow red,"" which suggests ""wif"" is correlated with ""red,"" and ""bluf"" might still be ""yellow.""
- However, when ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" in example 4, the output associated with ""bluf"" changes to ""red."" This can indicate that the position of ""bluf"" relative to ""wif"" or another word changes its meaning.
- ""bluf"" appears without ""wif"" in examples 1 and 3, and the colors after ""bluf"" do not include ""red,"" implying that ""red"" is likely not a direct translation of ""bluf.""

Considering the above observations, it appears that ""bluf"" generally translates to ""yellow,"" except when a condition alters this translation. One such condition could relate to the word that precedes ""bluf,"" where ""dax"" preceding ""bluf"" might be causing ""bluf"" to output ""green.""

Let's try to write the rule based on the patterns observed:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally translates to ""yellow"" unless it follows ""dax,"" in which case the output is ""green."" There may be other rules affecting the output when ""bluf"" is combined with different words, but based on the given examples, only the combination with ""dax"" has been observed to modify the output of ""bluf.""

Hence, the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> ""yellow"" (default meaning, which can change depending on the preceding word, as observed with ""dax"" preceding ""bluf"").",-1.2325486277439741,70,bluf
"Rule: walm -> repeated color of previous word

The instruction ""walm"" seems to mean ""repeat the color indicated by the previous word"". In the given examples, the color that is named before ""walm"" is repeated for the amount of times ""walm"" is said. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" outputs ""red red green green red red red blue red"", where ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and ""wif"" correlates to ""red""; hence ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""red"".

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue""; ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" twice.

- ""lug zup dax walm"" outputs ""blue yellow green green green""; here ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which correlates to ""green"", and two repetitions of ""green"" follow.

- ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue""; ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which correlates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

- ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""; ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which correlates to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" causes three repetitions of ""yellow"". The final ""lug"" returns to ""blue"".

"walm -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the input-output examples provided, it appears that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the same color in the output. The color repeated matches the color corresponding to the word preceding ""walm."" Here are the observations from the examples:

1. In the first example, 'wif' is followed by 'walm' and 'wif' translates to red. As a result, there are multiple reds following 'wif walm'.
2. In the second example, 'lug' is before 'walm' and 'lug' translates to blue. Therefore, the output is multiple blues.
3. In the third example, 'dax' precedes 'walm' and 'dax' means green. Hence, after 'dax walm', multiple greens are seen in the output.
4. In the fourth example, 'lug' is before 'walm' and translates to blue, resulting in a sequence of blues following 'lug walm'.
5. In the fifth example, 'lug' and 'zup' precede 'walm'. 'lug' translates to blue and 'zup' to yellow, creating a sequence of yellows following 'zup walm' ('lug' at the end resets to one blue).

- In the second example, the word ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and the output color for both is yellow. The word ""lug"" also precedes ""walm,"" and the word ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" also corresponds to yellow.

- The third example is similar to the first; ""dax"" surrounds ""walm"" on both sides, and the output color is green for both.

- In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes after ""walm,"" and both had the color red in the output. ""Lug"" follows later, which has a different color (blue) than the preceding ""walm.""

- The last example shows ""zup"" followed by ""walm,"" with both translating to yellow.

From these observations, the pattern is that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word before it (i.e., it is the first word), it defaults to yellow.

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at its position relative to the other words in the given examples, as well as the corresponding outputs.

Let's examine each example:

1. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both at the beginning and the end of the sequence.

2. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""walm lug,"" which corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

3. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   Regardless of the position next to ""lug,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   ""dax"" follows the sequence ""wif zup walm"" and precedes ""zup,"" still corresponding to ""green.""

5. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green
   ""dax"" is at the end of the sequence and still corresponds to ""green.""

Based on the above examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the surrounding words in the sequences. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.07620699536907954,72,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to identify patterns in how it corresponds to an output across different examples. Here are the instances of ""dax"" from the examples:

1. dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
2. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
3. lug dax -> blue green
4. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
5. zup wif lug dax -> yellow red blue green

Examining the output for each instance where ""dax"" appears, the following observations can be made:

- When ""dax"" is preceded by different words (""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug""), the output is consistently ""green.""
- When ""dax"" occurs more than once in an input, it consistently translates to ""green"" in the output each time.
- Finally, there are no instances where ""dax"" corresponds to any output other than ""green.""

Based on the observations above, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.10900474956881817,72,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in various contexts. We'll start by checking where ""dax"" appears in each input and what word it corresponds to in the output.

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears as the first and last word in the sequence and corresponds to ""green"" in the first and last positions of the output.
- ""Dax"" in the second example is the second word and corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" is the second word and it also corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is the fourth word and corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is the last word and corresponds to ""green.""

From these examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, it appears that ""dax"" maps to ""green"" irrespective of context.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. In every example where the word ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" is included in the output.

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".",-1.6632299740197372,72,wif
"Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correlate with a particular color. By looking at where ""wif"" appears in each input and the corresponding color in the output, it's possible to deduce the meaning.

Here's the analysis:

- In the first input, ""wif"" is the fourth word and corresponds to the color red in the output.
- In the second input, ""wif"" is the first word and again translates to red in the output.
- In the third input, ""wif"" is the only word and it results in red as the output.
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" is the first word and leads to red in the output.
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" is the third word and once again corresponds to red in the output.

Since ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color red in the output, regardless of its position in the input, we can induce that ""wif"" represents the color red.

When ""zup"" is combined with other words, it contributes ""yellow"" to the sequence of color outputs corresponding to each input word. Here's the interpretation for each example:

- ""wif"" is paired with ""red,"" and when combined with ""zup,"" the sequence ""yellow red"" is produced.
- ""bluf"" is paired with ""yellow,"" and when ""zup"" is added, the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is the sole input, the output is simply ""yellow.""
- In the input ""wif lug zup bluf,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and the outputs for ""zup"" and ""bluf"" are ""yellow yellow,"" as previously established.

So, the rule can be written as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-0.44833910904448265,72,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

When it stands alone as an input, the output is simply ""yellow."" When combined with other words, it provides an output of ""yellow"" in sequence with the other colors represented by those words (e.g., ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as well).

Therefore, the rule is:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we look for patterns in the inputs and outputs provided in the examples. Let's analyze the examples provided.

- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
- Input: dax lug bluf wif -> Output: green blue blue red
- Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red
- Input: lug bluf zup lug -> Output: blue blue yellow blue

Taking these examples into account:

1. Notice that in every example, the word immediately following ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.
2. ""Bluf"" does not have a consistent corresponding color. Instead, its presence in the input triggers a repetition of the color that translates to the word immediately after ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the next word in the sequence.",-0.12021642718914817,72,bluf
"Rule:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" is associated with the color that precedes it. Each time ""bluf"" is used, the output color matches the color that corresponds to the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"".

- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
- ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red""
- ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""
- ""lug bluf zup lug"" -> ""blue blue yellow blue""

In every instance, the color before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to mean ""repeat the previous color"".

"Based on the provided examples, each input that contains ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of colors in the output where the number of color repetitions is consistent with the word that comes before ""walm."" Here is the breakdown of examples:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (three repetitions of blue).
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (three repetitions of yellow).
- ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red"" (one green, followed by three repetitions of red).
- ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" (one blue, followed by three repetitions of yellow and one single blue afterward).
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" results in ""green green green yellow blue green"" (three repetitions of green, followed by one yellow, one blue, and one green).

It appears that ""walm"" is a modifier that causes the color word that corresponds to the word just prior to ""walm"" to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-0.08826597384769223,72,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color corresponding to that word repeated three times. If ""walm"" is followed by another word, the sequence breaks, and the color corresponding to the new word is outputted. Additionally, if a color word is followed by ""wif,"" the proceeding ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word before ""wif"" to be repeated four times instead of three. 

Here's how the rule applies to each example:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
- ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" but it isn't repeated since ""wif"" seems to indicate the next color word (in this case ""red"") should be repeated four times instead.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" causes the last color word to repeat (yellow in this case), and then ""lug"" again corresponds to blue.
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" results in ""green green green yellow blue green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" causes it to repeat, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" again corresponds to green.",-0.1015472740091026,72,walm
"walm -> repetition. Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the following or preceding color should be repeated three times. The color that is repeated depends on the preceding color word:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (repeats ""blue"" three times)
- ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"" (repeats ""yellow"" three times)

When other colors are mentioned before ""walm"", such as in ""dax wif walm"", the first color mentioned before ""walm"" is green, and ""wif"" is red. Therefore, the rule seems to suggest repeating the first color mentioned three times, after mentioning the color corresponding to ""wif"" once. Thus, ""dax wif walm"" gives ""green red red red"".

From the given examples, it can be deduced that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". When multiple color words precede ""walm"", the pattern appears to repeat the last color mentioned before ""walm"" three times in succession.

However, the last example, ""dax walm zup lug dax"", deviates from this specific repetition, as it results in ""green green green yellow blue green"", which includes colors that come both before and after ""walm"". 

To resolve the inconsistency, a potential revision to the rule considering the last example might be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be repeated three times in sequence. If ""walm"" is followed by other color words, then it continues the color pattern that has been established before ""walm"", in the order they were mentioned.

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

"From the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of colors that are repeated multiple times. Each instance of ""walm"" is associated with a different color based on the word that comes immediately before it.

Looking at each example:

- ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" suggesting that when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red"" repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green,"" suggesting that when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it translates to ""green"" repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow"" repeated three times.

However, when ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" we see ""blue blue blue"" in the output, even though the initial word differs (e.g., ""dax lug walm"" and ""zup lug walm""). This indicates that the word immediately preceding ""walm"" determines its color translation and that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of that color three times.

Rule: walm -> a series of three colors. The specific color is determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm."" If ""walm"" is immediately preceded by ""lug,"" it retains the color associated with the word before ""lug.""",-0.7904635644951725,73,walm

- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" is an exception, as ""lug walm"" together seems to produce ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" may not have its own color but instead changes the rule when preceding ""walm.""

Therefore, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, it produces three instances of the associated color. ""walm"" by itself does not have a meaning without context; it derives its output from the preceding word.

walm -> meaning. To output the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.9196043914172416,73,walm
"Based upon the provided examples, we can try to discern a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Examining each input and its corresponding output, we notice that ""walm"" consistently yields a sequence of three colored outputs. The specific color associated with ""walm"" seems to depend on the word that precedes it:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a sequence of three reds.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a sequence of three greens.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a sequence of three yellows.

From the evidence provided, it seems that ""walm"" translates into a triplet of the color associated with the preceding word. If a word does not have an assigned color, that word is translated to blue, but ""walm"" still outputs a triplet sequence of colors. It's important to note that so far, ""walm"" follows a word whose associated color has been established, except for ""lug"" to which blue is the output.

Given these observations, the most plausible rule for ""walm"" could be stated as:

Rule: When followed by the word ""walm,"" the output will be three instances of the color associated with the preceding word. If there is no specific color associated with that word, the default color output will be blue, but ""walm"" still triggers a sequence of three colors.

- When ""dax"" (which outputs ""green"") precedes ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""green.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will examine each instance where the word ""dax"" appears and the output that corresponds to it:

1. Input: dax | Output: green
2. Input: dax walm wif dax | Output: green green green red green
3. Input: zup dax wif zup | Output: yellow green red yellow
4. Input: dax zup dax zup | Output: green yellow green yellow
5. Input: dax | Output: green

From the examples, we can observe the following:

- Every time ""dax"" is mentioned in isolation (examples 1 and 5), the output is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" appears multiple times in a sequence (examples 2 and 4), the output ""green"" corresponds to each occurrence of ""dax.""
- In example 2, ""wif"" appears between two instances of ""dax"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" but this color corresponds to ""wif"" rather than ""dax.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and each instance of ""dax"" still yields a ""green"" output.

Based on the above observations, we can induce that ""dax -> green"" consistently. In other words, every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output in the corresponding position.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.10540542636801384,74,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"" and its resulting color output, we need to consider the constant and the variable elements in the examples provided. Here are the observations:

1. Whenever ""dax"" is used alone, the output is green.
2. In strings where ""dax"" is immediately followed by another ""dax,"" the output for each ""dax"" is green.
3. In strings where ""dax"" is not adjacent to another instance of ""dax,"" it is still represented by green. For example, ""dax walm wif dax"" yields ""green green green red green,"" where the first and last ""dax"" are green despite ""wif"" in between.
4. The color output for words that are not ""dax"" varies (e.g., ""walm"" yields green in between ""dax,"" ""wif"" yields red after ""dax,"" and ""zup"" yields yellow when used both before and after ""dax"").

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine its corresponding outputs across the examples:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output sequence is ""red red yellow""; we can cross-reference this with the fifth example where ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green.""

4. The fourth example includes ""bluf"" twice, corresponding to ""green"" and ""yellow"" in the output sequence. 
5. In the fifth example, we see ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Given that ""bluf"" translates to different colors in the output, but the color that it translates to is not consistent across all examples, it seems that ""bluf"" might not have a stable meaning on its own and may in fact be context-dependent. However, there is one consistent observation in all the given examples—the output color for ""bluf"" in each instance is the same as the color that precedes it in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it duplicates the color of the word just before it in the output sequence.

1. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
2. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

From the examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Looking specifically at ""walm"":
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is a repetition of ""green"" three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""walm"" itself after ""zup,"" we again see a repetition of the color corresponding to ""zup"" (""yellow"") three times.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to function as a rule that repeats the color of the preceding color-word three times.

"Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the previous non-walm word the number of times specified by the number of walm words following it.

Explanation:
- In the first example ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Since ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and there is only one ""walm"", the color blue is repeated four times (once for ""lug"" and thrice due to ""walm"").
- In the second example ""wif lug walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. ""Walm"" again functions to repeat the color blue four times.
- In the third example ""dax walm"", the color green associated with ""dax"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example ""dax walm zup walm"", the color green associated with ""dax"" is repeated three times due to the first ""walm"". ""Zup"" does not have a color associated with it from these examples, but if we use the color repetition rule, we can infer that it might correspond to yellow. The second ""walm"" results in repeating this color (presumably yellow) three times.
- The fifth example ""dax walm"" again shows the color green associated with ""dax"" being repeated three times because of ""walm"".

Therefore, walm indicates repetition of the preceding color, and the number of times the color should be repeated depends on the count of the successive ""walm"" words.",-0.3125246568490668,74,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color associated with the preceding word the same number of times as there are letters in ""walm"". ""Walm"" has four letters, so the color repeats four times, except when ""walm"" is followed by another ""walm"" or potentially another word, where it then transfers its property of repetition to the next word/color.

Breaking down the examples:

- ""dax lug walm"": ""dax"" gives us the color green once, ""lug"" gives us blue once. Since ""walm"" follows ""lug"", ""blue"" is repeated four times due to ""walm"" having four letters.
- ""wif lug walm"": Similarly, ""wif"" results in red once, ""lug"" is blue, and because ""walm"" follows, ""blue"" is repeated four times.
- ""dax walm"": Here, since ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and no other word follows ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated four times.
- ""dax walm zup walm"": ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", so we get ""green"" repeated four times. Then ""zup"" seems to be associated with the color yellow, and since ""walm"" follows, it is also repeated four times.
- ""dax walm"": As in the third example, ""green"" is repeated four times.

Considering the consistency across examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be the repetition of the color associated with the immediate preceding word, repeated a number of times equal to the number of letters in ""walm"" (four times), unless followed by another ""walm"".

- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Again, ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times following ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so it repeats the color green three times.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" first follows ""dax"" (which is green) and then follows ""zup"" (which is yellow), causing it to repeat the corresponding colors three times each.

4. In the example ""dax walm zup walm,"" ""walm"" seems to change its repetition based on the word that follows it (""zup"" yields yellow, and the ""walm"" after ""zup"" also outputs yellow colors).

To demonstrate this with the examples:

- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" => yellow blue blue blue red green
   In this case, ""dax"" is followed by no word, but the last known color before ""dax"" is red.

- ""zup walm dax lug"" => yellow yellow yellow green blue
   ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" which outputs blue. Hence ""dax"" is green followed by ""lug"" which is blue.

- ""dax lug dax"" => green blue green
   The first ""dax"" has no preceding color word, so it defaults to green. The second ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, but since there's no word after the second ""dax,"" it defaults back to green.

- ""dax bluf"" => green green
   ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which is translated to green, so ""dax"" takes the color green as well.

"Analyzing the examples provided:

- When ""dax bluf"" is the input, the output is ""green green."" The word ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" so it appears that ""bluf"" may also translate to ""green"" in this instance. However, more evidence is needed.

- With the input ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" the output is ""blue red blue green green."" Here ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" as previously observed. The last ""green"" corresponds to ""bluf,"" which supports the initial hypothesis that ""bluf"" might mean ""green.""

- In the input ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" This indicates that ""wif"" stands for ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" yields ""red"" as well, it could imply that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word. 

- The input ""lug wif lug bluf"" gives the output ""blue red blue blue."" Here it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word just before it, which is ""lug"" for ""blue.""

- Finally, for the input ""lug bluf wif,"" the output is ""blue blue red."" Again, ""bluf"" seems to be taking on the color of the word before it, which is ""lug"" for ""blue.""

4. In ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue red blue blue"", ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it (""lug"" -> ""blue"").
5. In ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red"", ""bluf"" again matches the color of the preceding word (""lug"" -> ""blue"").

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
2. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""
3. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
4. ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue red blue blue""
5. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""

Looking at examples 1 and 3, when ""bluf"" directly follows another word, the output is the color associated with that word repeated twice:

- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"", with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red""

When ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence, as in example 4, ""lug wif lug bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the word preceding it: ""blue blue"".

In example 5, when ""bluf"" is in the middle of a sequence (between ""lug"" and ""wif""), it takes the color of the word preceding it.

By examining these patterns, it becomes clear that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. So, the rule for ""bluf"" can be understood as:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word that precedes ""bluf"".

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears after a word, the output for ""bluf"" is the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word, repeated once if ""bluf"" is in the middle or twice if ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence.",-0.14795683883958333,75,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with the word that precedes it. However, there's an additional rule about repetition: if the same word comes before ""bluf"" twice in a row, ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word ""lug"" instead of repeating the same color. To elaborate the rule:

1. If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
2. If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
3. If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
4. However, if ""bluf"" immediately follows a word that is being repeated (like ""lug lug bluf""), then ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug"" only once, and for the repeated instance, it defaults to ""blue"" (the color associated with ""lug"") instead of repeating the previous color.

So the induction for ""bluf"" would be:

bluf -> the color associated with the preceding word, but with a special rule for repetition where it defaults to ""blue"" instead of repeating the same color as the repeated word.

Rule: If X is the word before bluf, then bluf is the color associated with X, unless X is immediately repeated before bluf, in which case bluf is blue.",-1.004054959845833,75,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" results in repetition of the color word that comes directly before it. The output is the color word preceding ""bluf"" repeated twice. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears after a color word, the output repeats the color word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" twice.",-1.4639242873069445,75,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" has a rule related to color output repetition. Specifically, it repeats the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

1. In ""zup lug walm wif dax"", the output is ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" After ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" ""walm"" causes the next color to also be ""blue.""

2. In ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" the output is ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" After ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" ""walm"" causes the next colors to be ""green."" Again after ""lug"" which outputs ""blue,"" ""walm"" causes the next color to also be ""blue.""

5. In ""wif lug dax walm,"" the output is ""red blue green green green."" The word ""walm"" after ""dax"" makes the next colors ""green.""

Rule: walm -> a word that causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated.

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" I will examine the input and corresponding output sequences in the given examples. By comparing the inputs to the outputs, we look for patterns that might suggest what transformation ""walm"" induces.

- In each instance, one color is generated for each word in the input before ""walm"" is encountered.
- After ""walm"" appears in the input, the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated.

Now let's analyze the pattern in each input-output pair:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" occurs, and ""blue"" is repeated several times after ""lug""

2. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" occurs, and ""green"" is repeated multiple times after ""dax""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" again to ""blue""
   - Another occurrence of ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated

3. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" occurs, and ""green"" is repeated
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - Another ""walm"" occurs, repeating ""red""

4. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""blue"" is repeated

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""green"" is repeated

From these observations, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated in the output until the next color is introduced or until the end of the output. If no color has been introduced before ""walm,"" there seems to be no transformation (as can be seen in the 3rd example where ""walm"" is right after ""dax"" and ""green"" is the first and only color that gets repeated).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence.",-0.0701304840003684,75,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us examine the pattern in which it appears and the corresponding colors in the outputs:

1. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
2. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
3. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
4. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
5. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green

Observing the patterns:

- ""walm"" after ""zup lug"" results in ""blue blue.""
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green.""
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in ""red red.""
- The word preceding ""walm"" has a color associated with it: ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug""-> blue, ""dax""-> green, ""wif""-> red.
- When ""walm"" is used, the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated once.
- ""walm"" is never the first or the last word, so we cannot deduce if it has a standalone color without a preceding word.

Considering these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it results in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it:

- In the second example, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"" and the two instances of ""walm"" that follow repeat the color ""blue"" twice each time.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" with ""walm"" repeating the respective color two times each.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects repetition in the pattern, specifically by repeating the color that follows after it. Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" which translates to ""blue,"" and we see a repetition of ""blue"" three times in the output.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times after the first ""green"" that corresponds to ""dax.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated twice following the pattern.
- The fourth example also shows that ""walm"" comes before ""wif"" (translating to ""blue""), and then ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- The fifth example shows ""walm"" after ""dax"" (translating to ""green""), followed by the repetition of ""green"" two more times.

However, in each instance where ""walm"" appears, the repetition also seems to include the output matching for ""walm"" itself. Considering this, we can formulate the following rule:

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule:

Looking at the outputs, ""bluf"" correlates with the color immediately preceding it (with an exception in the second example, which may indicate a different rule or an error). However, in the second example, where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" there seems to be no preceding color as ""walm"" does not have a consistent corresponding color in the other examples.

But, observing closely in other instances:
- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third input, ""bluf"" again follows ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

In considering these patterns, we might deduce that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes immediately before it except in the case where it is immediately preceded by ""lug,"" then it's red. But this rule is based on limited data and cannot account for the anomaly in the second example unless further information reveals a special rule that applies when ""lug"" and ""walm"" are in the sequence.

The best deduction based on the given data is:

Fourth Example:
- Input: ""zup lug zup bluf lug""
- Output: ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue""

Fifth Example:
- Input: ""zup bluf""
- Output: ""yellow yellow""

Analyzing the Input/Output pairs:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and the corresponding output is ""green green red."" Since the ""dax"" preceding ""bluf"" translates to green, ""bluf"" corresponds to red in this case.
  
- In the second example, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and the corresponding output pair is ""red blue blue."" With ""lug"" translating to blue, ""bluf"" corresponds to red again.

- In the third example, the ""bluf"" appears at the end, after ""dax"" and the corresponding output sequence ends with ""green green."" We already know ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" would again be green, but given the previous pattern, ""bluf"" should correspond to red logically, which suggests that the position of the word ""bluf"" might matter.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug"", and the outputs are ""yellow blue."" Since ""zup"" maps to yellow, and ""lug"" maps to blue, ""bluf"" in this context translates to yellow, which appears to break the pattern set from previous instances. 

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to yellow, which would be consistent with the pattern seen in the fourth example if we consider ""bluf"" taking the same color as the word before it.

From these observations, the most consistent rule that can be deduced is that ""bluf"" results in the color output that follows the same color as the word immediately before it. 

Therefore, the rule is as follows:
Rule: bluf -> the same color as the previous word.",-0.07861447821926316,76,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns corresponding to the input and output.

In each example, ""bluf"" is associated with a color in the output. The color before ""bluf"" in the output corresponds to the color of the word right before ""bluf"" in the input.

1. In the first example, the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" and the color for ""dax"" is green. Therefore, the color for ""bluf"" in the output is also green.

2. In the second example, the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which is associated with the color blue in the output. Again, ""bluf"" takes the same color as the previous word, which is blue.

3. The third example follows the same pattern, with ""bluf"" taking the color of the preceding word, ""dax,"" which is green.

4. Similarly, in the fourth example, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word ""zup,"" which comes right before it, making ""bluf"" yellow in the output.

5. In the fifth example, there are only two words, with ""zup"" again directly before ""bluf,"" resulting in ""bluf"" being yellow.

From these observations, the rule is that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the preceding word.",-1.2969669905551577,76,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the given examples and locate patterns correlating with the output colors.

Examining the outputs, we note:
1. When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the output color is green. (green green)
2. When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the output color is blue. (blue blue)
3. When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output color is yellow. (yellow yellow)

Based on these observations, it seems the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it. 

Additional confirmation comes from the fact that in all instances of ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" matches that of the word located directly before it in the inputs.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",-1.3171740635757896,76,bluf

3. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
4. ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""
5. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""

Each sequence that includes the word ""walm"" results in three consecutive colors that are the same. This repetition of color occurs exactly at the position where ""walm"" appears in the input:

- For input ""dax walm wif zup,"" ""walm"" appears second, which means the second, third, and fourth colors in the output are the same (green).
- For input ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax,"" hence the repetition of green.
- In ""lug walm dax,"" ""walm"" is the second word and follows ""lug,"" resulting in three blues in a row.
- In ""dax zup dax walm,"" the word ""walm"" is last, making the last three colors green.
- For input ""wif lug walm,"" ""walm"" is the last word and follows ""lug,"" hence the three blue colors at the end.

No matter the position of ""walm,"" it results in a repetition of three colors that match the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm.” 

Thus, we can conclude that the meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the previous word three times.

  - After ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated, then follows the normal sequence

Based on these observations, the following rule can be induced:

Hence, walm -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.",-0.60261413798025,76,walm
"Given the examples, ""walm"" appears to translate the preceding word into triplets of colors. Each unique word translates to a different color when followed by ""walm.""

For example:
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""

When ""walm"" isn't present, the translation is as follows:
- ""dax"" by itself translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" by itself translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" by itself translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red.""

And so, based on the examples, the word ""walm"" seems to have the rule of turning the color associated with the previous word into a set of three of that color.

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""red blue blue blue"".

"Observing the pattern in the examples given, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the meaning of ""dax"". The word ""dax"" in the examples is always associated with a color in the output. Let's analyze the occurences:

1. When ""dax"" appears twice in a row: ""dax wif zup dax"" results in ""green red yellow green"". We can observe that the first ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and the second ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green"". This suggests that ""dax"" could consistently represent ""green"" regardless of its position.

2. ""dax"" in different positions: ""zup lug dax"" results in ""yellow blue green"". Here ""dax"" is at the end and it translates to ""green"". ""lug wif dax walm zup"" results in ""blue red green green green yellow""; ""dax"" is in the middle and again corresponds to ""green"". This supports our initial observation that ""dax"" always represents the color ""green"".

3. ""lug dax lug"" results in ""blue green blue"". Here ""dax"" is sandwiched between two ""lug"" which translate to ""blue"", indicating ""dax"" retains its meaning irrespective of surrounding words.

4. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"". Again ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"", and it translates to ""green"".

Based on these examples, we can deduce the meaning as follows:

dax -> green

- ""zup"" results in the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" results in the color ""blue.""

In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both times it appears, even as the first and last word in the sequence.

In the second example, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" when it appears just before ""zup.""

In the third example, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it, since ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and results in ""green green.""

In the fourth example, ""dax"" is in between two ""lugs,"" and it remains consistent with ""green.""

In the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" and ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" while ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" remains consistent in duplicating the color of the preceding word.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific output that remains consistent across different contexts. To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", let's look at the patterns between the given inputs and their respective outputs:

- In the first example, the word ""dax"" appears twice and correlates with the word ""green"" appearing twice in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears once and is followed by ""green"" in the output.
- The third example also shows ""dax"" once, followed by ""green"" in the output, with other words mapping to different colors.
- The fourth example again shows ""dax"" mapping to ""green"".
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

The rule: In every instance, ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the other words surrounding it.

5. ""lug walm wif lug"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue""

- The position of ""yellow"" in the output corresponds to the position of ""zup"" in the input.

1. ""wif lug zup"" -> ""red blue yellow""
2. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
3. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""

With ""zup"" present, in each case, the color ""yellow"" is outputted next, regardless of the word that follows ""zup"". This pattern suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red

From the input and output pairs above, it seems like the output immediately after ""bluf"" is the same as the word before ""bluf."" Let us apply this observation to see if it holds true:

1. ""zup dax bluf"" followed by ""yellow green green"" suggests that ""bluf"" means ""green"" since ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
2. ""wif bluf lug zup"" followed by ""red red blue yellow"" supports this as ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
3. ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" followed by ""red blue blue red yellow"" shows ""bluf"" coming after ""lug,"" and the corresponding colors are ""blue blue.""
4. ""dax bluf wif lug"" followed by ""green green red blue"" further confirms the rule as ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the colors are ""green green.""
5. ""zup lug bluf wif"" followed by ""yellow blue blue red"" shows the same pattern with ""bluf"" following ""lug,"" hence ""blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it is always followed by the same color as the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.",-0.06774315236752942,77,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we need to determine the rule that translates the nonce word ""bluf"" into its corresponding color in the output.

Let's analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"" and their corresponding outputs in each example:

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
3. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow
4. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
5. zup lug bluf wif -> yellow blue blue red

Looking at these correspondences, we notice that the color following ""bluf"" in the output is always the same color as the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"" in the input. Here are the specifics:

1. ""dax"" is before ""bluf"" and the output color is green.
2. ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""red"" follows ""bluf"" in the output.
3. ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and the color blue follows ""bluf"" in the output.
4. ""dax"" is before ""bluf"" again, and the color following is green once more.
5. ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" again, and the color following is blue.

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""bluf"" represents the rule that it takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",-0.08468580958628236,77,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's identify patterns in the given input-output pairs.

We observe that each individual word corresponds to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Examining the position of ""bluf"" within the sequences and its corresponding output color, we notice:

1. ""bluf"" follows ‘dax’ (green), and the output is green.
2. ""bluf"" follows ‘wif’ (red), and the output is red.
3. ""bluf"" follows ‘lug’ (blue), twice, and the output is blue both times.

It appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule seems to be that the meaning of ""bluf"" is to duplicate the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-0.7089034228583531,77,bluf
"To decipher the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"", I will analyze its association with the colors in the examples provided. In each example, ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color in the output sequence.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is associated with the color green.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is also associated with the color red, since the sequence starts with ""wif"" which is red, and ""bluf"" follows, which also outputs red.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is associated with the color blue, as it is followed by ""wif"" which outputs red, keeping in mind that ""bluf"" was preceded by ""lug"" which outputs blue, and is associated with blue again.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is associated with the color green, the same as ""dax"".
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is associated with the color blue, the same as ""lug"".

Reviewing these examples, we can observe that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it, rather than corresponding to a fixed color. Thus, the word ""bluf"" reflects the color of the previous word in the sequence. This takes into account the change when ""bluf"" is the second word in the sequence (example 2) where it took the same color as the first word, ""wif"" (red). When ""bluf"" appears immediately after ""zup,"" it is green (example 1), after ""lug"" it is blue (examples 3 & 5), and after ""dax"" it is green (example 4).

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-0.8405905297842354,77,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs, paying special attention to the presence of ""walm"" and its associated color in the outputs:

1. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
2. Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue
3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup | Output: green red red red blue yellow
5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf | Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Observing the outputs:

- In every instance where ""walm"" is present, the color ""red"" appears in a sequence of three consecutive instances.
- ""walm"" does not correspond to a single color but rather a repeated sequence of ""red.""
- The other words in the sentences correspond to single colors, as seen in examples where ""walm"" is not present.

From this analysis, we can conclude that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of the color ""red"" in a row.

Rule: walm -> three reds in a row.",-0.08714489842970784,77,walm
"Based on the given examples, let us first identify patterns for words other than ""walm"" that consistently lead to specific colors:

- ""zup"" consistently leads to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently leads to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently leads to ""red""
- ""dax"" consistently leads to ""green""
- ""bluf"" consistently leads to ""blue""

Now, let's look at the occurrences of ""walm"" to deduce its meaning:

1. ""zup wif walm"" yields ""yellow red red red"". We see that ""zup"" correlates with the first ""yellow"" and ""wif"" with the first ""red"". Therefore, ""walm"" seems to correspond to the remaining ""red red"".

2. ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"". Here ""lug"" corresponds with the first ""blue"", suggesting ""walm"" correlates with the following ""blue blue"".

3. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". Here ""zup"" is associated with the first ""yellow"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", ""wif"" with the first ""red"" after ""blue"", and ""bluf"" with the subsequent ""red"". Two additional ""yellow"" colors remain unaccounted for, likely corresponding to ""walm"".

4. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow"". ""dax"" matches with ""green"", ""wif"" with the first ""red"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""zup"" with ""yellow"", leaving ""red red"" for ""walm"".

5. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates into ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". Here ""lug"" corresponds with the first and the penultimate ""blue"", ""wif"" with ""red"", and ""bluf"" again with the last ""blue"". Hence, ""walm"" must be associated with the second and third ""blue"".

From these examples, we can discern that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color output by the word immediately preceding it. For instance, if ""lug"" (which results in ""blue"") is followed by ""walm"", the output is a repetition of ""blue"". If ""zup"" (which results in ""yellow"") is followed by ""walm"", the output is a repetition of ""yellow"".

Rule: walm -> repeats the color output of the immediately preceding word.",-0.08756977151269661,77,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs with their respective outputs. We'll investigate how the presence of ""walm"" affects the output colors.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""wif"" appears once and is associated with one occurrence of ""red.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" appears once and is associated with multiple occurrences of ""blue,"" but we can't determine the exact rule yet since ""walm"" is also present.

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- ""zup"" without ""walm"" corresponds to one occurrence of ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" comes after ""walm,"" and ""bluf"" after ""wif,"" leading to an additional ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""red.""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
- The sequence ""wif walm lug"" brings multiple ""red"" and one ""blue.""
- ""zup"" at the end brings ""yellow.""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" appears before and after ""walm,"" each time associated with ""blue.""
- ""wif"" is associated once with ""red"" again.

Now, let's analyze where ""walm"" appears and the change in output:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" we see multiple ""red"" rather than one.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" we see multiple ""blue"" instead of one.
- The sequence ""wif walm"" always results in multiple ""red.""
- The sequence ""lug walm"" always results in multiple ""blue.""

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to function as a multiplier for the color corresponding to the word that comes right before it. The word preceding ""walm"" has its associated color repeated multiple times. There isn't a clear pattern regarding the specific number of repetitions, but it consistently results in more than one instance of the color.

Rule: walm -> multiplies the occurrence of the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.10674856558184265,77,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of the outputs in relation to the inputs where ""walm"" is used.

- In the first example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" we can infer that ""walm"" may mean a repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it, which is ""red"" in this case.

- In the second example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and since there's no other color word before ""walm,"" it could mean that ""walm"" takes the color of the word directly preceding it and repeats it twice.

- In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and the output has ""yellow"" repeated three times, indicating that ""walm"" could mean ""repeat the preceding color word three times."" However, there's also ""lug wif"" translating to ""blue red,"" where ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red. This complex input requires us to focus on the placement of ""walm"" for its output.

- In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" and again we see the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and we can see that ""walm"" repeats the preceding ""blue"" three times.

- In the case of the input ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" ""wif"" still translates to ""red,"" but the pattern for the other words becomes more complex.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look for patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs.

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif"":
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

In both cases, the word after ""walm"" is repeated three times, and the color ""red"" is associated with ""wif.""

2. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax"":
Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

After ""dax walm,"" the color green is repeated twice, and the other colors vary based on the words following ""walm.""

3. When ""walm"" appears with no clear pattern of the word before it:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

Despite different preceding words, whenever ""walm"" appears, the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> meaning

Based on the above analysis, ""walm"" appears to be a modifier that indicates that the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be repeated three times in the output.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
When ""walm"" is present in the input, the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" is output three times in a row.",-0.0833735186255611,78,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm."" Let’s analyze the input and output pairs:

1. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""
2. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> ""green green green yellow blue green""
3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
5. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green""

Looking at the patterns, whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding part of the output repeats the previous color's word before changing to a new color sequence. The first example shows that ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and thus ""walm"" results in two more ""red"" before changing to ""blue."" In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" and we see two additional ""green"" before shifting to ""yellow."" This pattern holds for all given examples.

Rule: ""walm"" causes a repetition of the prior color word in the output sequence before changing to the next color sequence.

So, we can write:

walm -> repetition of the previous color word in the output sequence before a color change.",-0.08509780050333335,78,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the output colors associated with each word in the input:

- wif always translates to red.
- lug always translates to blue.
- dax always translates to green.
- zup always translates to yellow.
- bluf always translates to blue.

When ""walm"" is present, the following pattern occurs:

1. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug"" and ""bluf,"" creating two additional ""red"" before transitioning to the default colors of ""lug"" and ""bluf.""

2. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and produces two additional ""green"" before transitioning to the default colors of ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and then back to ""dax.""

3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   - Here, ""walm"" occurs at the end after ""dax"" and ""lug,"" resulting in two additional ""blue"" associated with ""lug.""

4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in two additional ""red"" linked to ""wif.""

5. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
   - Here, ""walm"" occurs at the end after ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax,"" producing two additional ""green"" associated with ""dax.""

From these examples, we can surmise that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it two times before continuing with the rest of the sequence.

Rule: walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word that comes directly before it two more times before continuing the sequence.",-0.08940179957038889,78,walm
"By examining the patterns, we can deduce the following:

- ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue"". The repeated ""red"" suggests that ""wif"" and ""walm"" yield the color red, and ""lug"" turns into ""red"" as well, while ""bluf"" turns into ""blue"".
  
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" gives ""green green green yellow blue green"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" to green again, ""zup"" to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""dax"" to green once more.

- ""dax lug walm"" turns into ""green blue blue blue"". ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" to blue.

- ""zup bluf wif walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow red red red"". Here, ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" to red.

- ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green green green"". ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" to green.

From these examples, we can see that ""walm"" is not consistent with a single color but seems to repeat the color of the preceding word:

Input: wif walm lug bluf -> Output: red red red blue blue (walm repeats the color of wif)
Input: dax walm zup lug dax -> Output: green green green yellow blue green (walm repeats the color of dax)
Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue (walm repeats the color of lug)
Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red (walm repeats the color of wif)
Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green (walm repeats the color of dax)

"Given the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately following it. Below is the derivation of the rule based on the examples provided:

- Example 1: ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow blue"". ""Bluf"" here is followed by ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" takes the color ""red"" which is associated with ""wif,"" the word preceding ""bluf.""

- Example 2: ""lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow."" ""Bluf"" is following the word ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" here is again ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug.""

- Example 3: ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green."" ""Bluf"" is following ""dax"" which is ""green"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""

- Example 4: ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" and therefore ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

- Example 5: ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green."" ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and hence ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

From these examples, the pattern is consistent that ""bluf"" assumes the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf"".",-0.10078587502037975,79,bluf
"Based upon the given examples, the word ""bluf"" followed by another word produces an output of two colors, the first being the color associated with the second word, and the second color is always the color corresponding to ""bluf,"" which is inferred as red. 

Below is a breakdown of the associations based on the provided examples:

- ""zup"" is associated with yellow. When followed by ""bluf zup,"" the output is ""yellow red yellow"".
- ""lug"" is associated with blue. When followed by ""bluf zup,"" the output is ""blue blue yellow"" and when ""lug"" appears alone as ""lug bluf,"" the output is ""blue red"".
- ""dax"" is associated with green. When followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green red green"" and ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"".
- ""wif"" is associated with red. When ""wif"" appears with ""bluf,"" as in ""wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""red red green"".

It's important to note that ""wif bluf"" produces ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""red."" Also, ""wif"" is presumably red as well, signified by two identical color outputs in a row.

Lastly, ""walm"" is not directly associated with a specific color, but ""walm"" following ""bluf"" results in two reds, which aligns with other examples of words following ""bluf"" translating to a red color output. So here, ""walm"" could be assumed as red as well.

Put together, the rule for ""bluf"" is: 

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be the color red, as it consistently corresponds with ""red"" in every output following its occurrence.

Rule: If ""bluf"" is followed by another word, the output is a pair of colors where the first color corresponds to the color represented by the word that follows ""bluf"" and the second color is red (the color represented by ""bluf"").

2. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""

- In the first input, ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times in the output.
- In the second input, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times. The word ""wif"" follows with a new instance of ""walm,"" and so ""red"" is repeated three times after ""wif"" corresponds to red. Finally, ""zup"" at the end corresponds to yellow.
- The third input is similar, with the order of words slightly changed but following the same pattern.
- In the fourth input, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" we see ""lug"" is blue and ""walm"" once again causes ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated three times. ""Dax wif bluf"" follows the pattern with their respective colors.
- The fifth input shows that ""lug"" leads to two instances of blue, and ""walm"" following ""lug"" causes another instance of blue, fulfilling the threefold repetition. ""Wif"" and ""dax"" follow suit with their respective colors red and green.

"From observing the patterns in the input and output, it seems that ""walm"" represents the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here's how the repetitions are derived:

- In the first example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests ""walm"" caused the word ""yellow"" to repeat three times.

- In the second example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" occurred twice, each time causing the previous color to repeat three times.

- In the third example, ""walm"" again causes the repetition of the previous color three times.

- In the fourth example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat after ""zup.""

- In the fifth example, after ""lug,"" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat, not three times but as many times as it follows another word (""wif"" in this case), which suggests that the number of repetitions relates to the new word used before the next occurrence of ""walm"" or the end of the sentence.

"To uncover what ""dax"" means in this context, let's analyze the patterns corresponding with each instance of ""dax"" and its associated color in the outputs.

1. In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and ""wif"", with the outputs being ""green"", ""green"", and ""red"" accordingly. This suggests that ""dax"" might be related to the green output, as ""bluf"" does not correlate with the output ""blue"", and ""wif"" doesn't seem to match the color ""red"".

2. In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug walm"" and the outputs are ""green"", ""blue"", ""blue"", ""blue"". Again, ""dax"" correlates with the color green. ""Lug"" correlates with the color blue, and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

3. The third example shows ""dax"" alone produces an output of ""green"". This solidifies the association between ""dax"" and the color green.

4. The fourth example complicates the pattern as ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" and ""dax"", resulting in colors ""yellow"", ""blue"", and ""green"". ""Dax"" still results in a green output, irrespective of its position in the sequence, suggesting that ""dax"" is consistently tied to the color green regardless of preceding words.

5. Finally, the fifth example presents ""lug dax walm wif"" with the outputs ""blue green green green red"". ""Lug"" once again correlates with ""blue"", and ""dax"" follows with ""green"". ""Walm"" seems to carry the color of the word before it, in this case, green, and ""wif"" brings a new color, red, which doesn't seem directly tied to the preceding green.

Given the strong consistent association with the color green, irrespective of position in the sequence or preceding words, the rule is:

Rule: ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green"".",-0.22614975863034284,80,dax
"Based on the patterns observed in the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" affects the output colors in a consistent manner. 

The first instance of ""dax"" produces a ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input:

- In ""dax bluf wif,"" the output is ""green green red.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue.""
- When ""dax"" is the only input, the output is solely ""green.""
- In ""zup lug dax,"" the output following ""dax"" is ""green,"" while the preceding words have different corresponding colors.
- In ""lug dax walm wif,"" the output right after ""dax"" is ""green,"" followed by other ""green"" colors and a ""red"" at the end.

The ""green"" output appears immediately after the word ""dax,"" and does not seem to be influenced by the words around it. This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the output ""green."" 

Also, the presence of ""dax"" in the input seems to have no influence on the colors assigned to words that precede it, as the colors associated with ""lug"" and ""wif,"" for instance, remain consistent regardless of the position of ""dax.""

However, ""dax"" could potentially have an influence on words that follow it. In the examples, it might be that ""walm"" always translates to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax,"" and ""wif"" at the end always translates to ""red."" But since we do not have examples of ""walm"" or ""wif"" without ""dax"" preceding them, we cannot confidently confirm this part of the rule.

From the give data, the strongest deduced rule is:

Rule: ""dax"" -> green",-0.4358600977998429,80,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the input and output patterns:

When ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is always ""green."" This direct correspondence suggests that ""dax"" is associated with the colour green. 

The pattern is consistent, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule is not context-dependent within these examples—it only depends on the presence of the word ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green.",-1.8992999727371422,80,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the word ""dax"":

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output contains the word ""green."" Additionally, the output is not influenced by the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence; whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end, ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""

This consistent mapping suggests that ""dax"" stands for the color green, regardless of the context in which it is used within these examples.

Rule: dax -> green",-1.9289179949357147,80,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green.""

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.

"zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There are no exceptions to this pattern in the given data, so the rule seems to be consistent and straightforward.

"Through the analysis of the given examples, we can first deduce the following:

- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green""
- ""walm"" maps to ""red""

Looking at how ""bluf"" is treated across each example, it seems that ""bluf"" is not mapping to a consistent color. Instead, it appears to adopt the color of the word preceding it:

1. In Examples 1, 2, and 3, when ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" (which maps to ""red""), the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
2. In Examples 3 and 5, when ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" (which maps to ""green""), the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"".
3. In Example 4, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" (which maps to ""green"") again, and the output is ""green"".

Therefore, the inferred rule seems to be: 

bluf -> Take the color of the preceding word. If no word precedes it, default to green.",-0.9665842060285147,80,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the examples to find a pattern that corresponds with the output. We will examine each instance of ""bluf"" and the associated color in the output:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""green.""

Based on the examples, it seems like ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color output but might instead depend on the context or the preceding word. Let's consider the words that come before ""bluf"" in each example:

- In the first example, it follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow.""
- In the second example, it follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue.""
- In the third example, it follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, it follows ""dax"" and results in ""green.""
- In the fifth example, it follows ""dax"" and results in ""green.""

When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" When it follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue."" When it follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""the same color as the previous word.""

Let's apply this rule to each occurrence of ""bluf"" to verify if it holds true:
- In every instance except the second example, the color that precedes ""bluf"" is the same as the color that corresponds to ""bluf."" However, in the second example, the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" and in the output, the color for ""lug"" is blue, but ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" as well. There could be a unique rule for the word ""lug"" before ""bluf,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" may still mean ""the same color as the previous word,"" but with an exception for ""lug."" Alternatively, ""bluf"" might simply mirror the preceding color, and ""lug"" could be an anomaly or error in the examples provided.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the previous word. Anomalies may exist; for instance, ""lug bluf"" resulted in ""blue blue,"" while the consistent rule would have expected a different result for ""lug.""",-1.1859004785952478,80,bluf
"Examining the examples provided, we can observe how the nonce word ""bluf"" is translated into colors in the Output:

1. bluf corresponds to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup""
2. bluf corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug""
3. In the third input, bluf is translated to ""yellow"" following ""zup"" despite the presence of ""dax"" before ""zup""
4. bluf corresponds to ""green"" following ""dax"" directly, with no other words between
5. Similarly, in the fifth example, bluf translates to ""green"" when it is immediately after ""dax""

From these observations, the following rule can be induced:

Rule: The color for ""bluf"" depends on the word that immediately precedes it. If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it is ""yellow."" If it follows ""lug,"" it is ""blue."" If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it is ""green.""

Thus, the rule is:
bluf -> meaning is dependent on the preceding word: ""yellow"" after ""zup,"" ""blue"" after ""lug,"" and ""green"" after ""dax.""",-1.1889421575004953,80,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the position and occurrences of the word ""bluf"" in the inputs with the corresponding colors in the outputs:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""yellow,"" but in other examples, ""bluf"" doesn't necessarily translate to ""red"" and ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which suggests ""bluf"" is not one fixed color.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is followed by ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" directly translates to ""green.""

Looking at the patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" could potentially correspond to ""green."" However, we need to consider all instances. In the first input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup bluf wif"" which outputs ""yellow yellow red,"" this does not fit the pattern of ""bluf"" being ""green."" Instead, ""bluf"" might be a rule-based command that changes the next word's color output to a color that is not directly associated with the word itself. In other instances, ""bluf"" is not followed by a word but its output is ""green."" 

After examining all examples, the consistent pattern is that every instance of ""bluf"" changes the color that would typically follow. Considering this, the rule for ""bluf"" could be that it changes the color output of the word that follows it to a different color than the one usually assigned to that word, but this doesn't fully satisfy the observed outputs.

There is one more pattern to notice—""bluf"" is always followed by a word that typically would be ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" the color is ""green"" instead of the expected ""red."" Hence, ""bluf"" appears to change the expected ""red"" color to ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> Changes the next ""red"" color to ""green"".",-1.3102303244392082,80,bluf
Rule: bluf -> green,-1.759191261479901,80,bluf
"Based on the examples, it can be deduced that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup walm dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green blue,"" so ""walm"" caused ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) to be repeated three times before continuing with the sequence.
  
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which means that ""walm"" once again caused ""dax"" (green) to be repeated two additional times.
  
- The third example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" results in ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""walm"" triggered ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated two more times after its initial appearance.
  
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" we get ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" led to the repeat of ""lug's"" color (blue) twice more.
  
- The fifth example, ""zup walm,"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" confirming the pattern that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the preceding word two additional times.",-0.0898850168075555,80,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the following word (if one exists) to be repeated the number of times equivalent to the number of letters in that following word, then converting each letter to a color according to a specific pattern (not provided in the example).

For clarification:
- In the first example, ""dax lug"" follows ""walm"" and produces ""yellow green blue,"" which corresponds to ""dax"" being repeated three times, each letter corresponding to a color.
- In the second example, there is no following word, and ""dax"" is similarly repeated three times as ""green green green,"" consistent with the pattern regardless of ""walm's"" position.
- The third example shows ""zup"" being repeated three times after ""walm.""
- The fourth example has ""zup"" repeated three times after ""walm"" once again.
- The fifth example repeats the pattern from the first and third, with ""zup"" repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present, the following word's letters are translated into a predefined color coding, repeating each color as many times as there are letters in that following word. If ""walm"" is at the end of the string or standalone, the previous word is considered for this repetition rule.",-1.1989471288622224,80,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonsense word ""walm"" transforms into a repeated output of the color immediately preceding it. To verify, let's analyze each of the examples provided:

- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" while the output for ""walm"" is three times ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" while the output for ""walm"" is three times ""green.""

1. When ""zup"" appears alone in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
2. Whenever ""zup"" is present in an input sequence, the first color in the output sequence is always ""yellow.""
3. The presence of other words following ""zup"" does not change the initial ""yellow"" output but affects subsequent color outputs, e.g., ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to other colors.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the examples where it's used and the corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" leads to the output ""yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" clearly corresponds to the first ""yellow,"" so we can infer that ""bluf"" might also mean ""yellow.""
- The second example contains ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" which translates to ""red green yellow red green green."" The sequence ""wif dax bluf"" is key here, as it leads to ""red green green."" If ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" it seems ""bluf"" might translate to ""green"" in this context.
- In the third line, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" becomes ""yellow blue red green green red."" Again, focusing on ""dax bluf"" which results in ""green green,"" in this context ""bluf"" also seems to correspond to ""green.""
- The fourth example, ""wif bluf lug zup,"" converts to ""red red blue yellow."" Since we see that ""wif"" is ""red,"" if ""bluf"" were to mean ""yellow"" here as it did in the first example, the sequence would have been ""red yellow,"" but it's not. Instead, the sequence is ""red red,"" suggesting that in this context ""bluf"" means ""red.""
- The fifth example is the same as the first and it reaffirms the observation that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in this instance

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent meaning in terms of color. Instead, the meaning of ""bluf"" could be dependent on its position with respect to other words, or perhaps it mimics the color of word immediately before it given its repetitive nature in the outputs. 

Let's test this rule with the given examples:

- In the first and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" so according to the rule, ""bluf"" should mimic the color of the word before it, which is ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which outputs ""green."" Hence, ""bluf"" would mimic ""green"" which aligns with the output ""green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" also follows ""dax"" and again outputs ""green"" as expected by the mimic rule.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red."" ""Bluf"" mimicking the color before it would also be ""red,"" and that aligns with the output.

   - In other contexts, ""bluf"" also results in ""green"".

Based on this, we can deduce:

- ""zup"" results in ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it if it was not followed by another color. Hence ""bluf"" -> ""the same color as the word before it"" if it's followed by another word (the sequence continues).
- ""bluf"" results in ""green"" if it does not appear after ""zup"" or ""wif"", or if it's the last word in the sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each input-output pair:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

2. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green""

3. Input: dax lug walm

   - ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue""
   - ""dax"" is consistent with ""green""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" is consistent with ""green""

Noticing the outputs, every time ""walm"" appears, it results in a repetition of the color associated with the nonce word immediately before it. Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" functions as a duplicator or repeater of the color of the preceding word. 

Rule: ""walm"" -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.",-0.11135972687999998,81,walm
"By examining the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" I will analyze the pattern of the inputs and their corresponding outputs to infer how ""walm"" affects the sequence.

1. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and then ""wif,"" resulting in two yellows and a blue followed by a red.

2. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and we get three greens after a yellow and a green.

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and we get three blues after a green and a blue.

4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   - ""walm"" is at the end, following ""dax,"" resulting in three greens after a red, a blue, and a green.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and we get three greens.

Based on the above examples, it's possible to deduce that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm,"" and it does so three times. Here's the inferred rule for each word based on the available examples:

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Now applying the rule to ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it results in two extra yellows (example 1).
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it results in three extra greens (examples 2, 4, 5).
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in three extra blues (example 3).

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.11488776743626586,81,walm
"Analysing the given examples, it seems that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" in the input results in a repeated color in the output. The color that is repeated correlates to the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Thus, the word ""walm"" seems to signal a repetition of the color that comes before it. Here are the color associations based on the inputs before ""walm"":

1. ""lug wif""
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red (Here ""walm"" causes ""lug"" which is blue to be the last color before the repetition starts and red from ""wif"" is not repeated.)

2. ""dax""
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- Output: yellow green green green (Here ""walm"" causes ""dax"" which is green to be repeated.)

3. ""lug""
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- Output: green blue blue blue (Here ""walm"" causes ""lug"" which is blue to be repeated.)

4. ""wif lug dax""
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- Output: red blue green green green (Here ""walm"" causes ""dax"" which is green to be repeated.)

5. ""dax""
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- Output: green green green (Again, ""walm"" causes ""dax"" which is green to be repeated.)

From this analysis, it's evident that the function of ""walm"" is to induce a repetition of the color denoted by the word immediately before it. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word directly preceding ""walm"" in the sequence.",-0.6117507512569621,81,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the examples, ""walm"" adds a sequence of the color immediately preceding it in the list. 

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word (represented by ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""dax""), it outputs that color word repeatedly; the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" follows the color, plus one. For instance: 

- In ""zup walm lug wif,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), so the output for ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), so ""walm"" outputs ""blue blue.""
- If ""walm"" is at the end and is preceded by a series of color words such as ""dax walm,"" it repeats the color of the word directly preceding it (""green"") the number of times equal to the number of color words before ""walm"" in the series, plus one. Thus ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because ""dax"" appears just once before ""walm,"" and the rule adds one more instance.

Therefore, ""walm"" functions as a duplicating element for the preceding color word in the sequence.",-0.6755420407139239,81,walm
"To discern the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to each input where ""walm"" is present.

- In all instances of ""walm,"" the outputs consist exclusively of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word in the input, repeated multiple times.
- The number of times the color is repeated in the output corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence (i.e., if ""walm"" is the second word, the color is repeated twice; if ""walm"" is the third word, the color is repeated three times, and so on).

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Rule:
- If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" output ""yellow"" repeated according to the position of ""walm.""
- If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" output ""green"" repeated according to the position of ""walm.""

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's start by looking at the provided examples and their output sequences. Let's list the examples and note the occurrence of ""dax"" to see if there's a corresponding pattern in the output.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm 
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug

3. Input: dax

5. Input: dax wif bluf

   - ""Dax"" is followed by ""wif"" but its corresponding output is ""green.""

In each case, independent of the words before or after it, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. This suggests a simple direct mapping from ""dax"" to ""green,"" and no context-specific rule is apparent from the given examples.

2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
- ""Wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue."" Since the output is ""red"" right after ""wif,"" it seems that ""wif"" changes the color of the following word, but we need more data.

3. dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
- ""Wif"" comes between two words that on their own correspond to ""green."" Since the color after ""wif"" is ""red,"" it again suggests that ""wif"" changes the color associated with the following word rather than having a color of its own.

4. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
- ""Wif"" appears at the beginning and between ""zup"" and ""dax."" Each time following ""wif,"" the color ""red"" appears, regardless of the color that ""dax"" or ""zup"" usually represents (""green"" or ""yellow""). Again, this suggests that ""wif"" affects the following word.

5. wif lug -> red blue

However, ""wif"" also seems to influence the order in which the colors appear in the output, as seen in the difference between ""lug wif"" and ""wif lug"".

Here is how ""wif"" appears to function in the examples:

1. ""wif dax"" results in ""red green"". ""dax"" must correlate with ""green"".
2. ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red"" and ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue"", showing that ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and that the placement of ""wif"" before or after another word changes the order of the colors in the output.
3. ""zup walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"". We can assume ""zup"" and ""walm"" correlate with ""yellow"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""wif"" at the end contributes ""red"" again.
4. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". If ""bluf"" results in ""red"", then ""wif"" preceding it may either be redundant (simply adding another ""red"") or enforcing the rule that it precedes the color correlated with the following word.

To summarize a potential rule:

Rule: ""wif"" produces the word ""red"" and may affect the placement of colors in the output sequence, with the colors being ordered in the sequence they are mentioned after ""wif"" takes its place. If ""wif"" is followed by a word correlated with ""red"", it repeats that color in the output.

Thus, wif -> ""red"" (and affects the order of colors/color repetition depending on its position and surrounding words).",-0.2033402510234921,83,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be dependent on the position of the word ""wif"" in the sequence:

1. When ""wif"" precedes another word, the output is ""red"" followed by a second color that corresponds to the word following ""wif"". 
2. When ""wif"" follows another word, the color corresponding to the preceding word is followed by ""red"".

Based on the input-output pairs:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""wif"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" whether it precedes or follows ""wif"".
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""wif"". Since ""wif"" itself translates to ""red"" when it precedes another word, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"".
- ""zup"" and ""walm"" consistently correspond to ""yellow"" whenever they appear, regardless of their position relative to ""wif"".

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in a sequence:
- If ""wif"" is the first word, translate ""wif"" to ""red"" and then translate the following word to its corresponding color.
- If ""wif"" is not the first word, translate the word before ""wif"" to its corresponding color, then translate ""wif"" to ""red"".

Hence, the rule for ""wif"" is:
wif -> meaning. When ""wif"" is the first word, it means ""red"". When it is not the first word, it signals for ""red"" to follow the color corresponding to the preceding word.",-0.7777958302396825,83,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently produces the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

When ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue,"" and when it follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue red."" This suggests that ""wif"" may output ""red"" followed by the color associated with the following word, if there is one.

Here is the rule I've induced based on the examples:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" followed by the color associated with the next word, if there is one. If ""wif"" precedes another color word, the output will be ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to that word.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" consistently results in three repetitions of color names in the output. Furthermore, these repetitions are always of the last color name that appears before ""walm."" Here's the rule illustrated with each example:

1. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeated three times.

2. Input: ""lug zup dax walm""

   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once more, and ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times after it.

3. Input: ""dax walm"" (same as the first example)

   - This is identical to example 1 and further supports the rule.

4. Input: ""zup walm wif""

5. Input: ""zup bluf wif walm""

"The rule seems to be that ""walm"" results in multiple iterations of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"". To elucidate the pattern, let's examine the examples and their outcomes:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", indicating that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""dax"" (green) to be repeated three times.
- ""lug zup dax walm"" results in ""blue yellow green green green"", showing that ""walm"" affects only the word immediately preceding it – ""dax"" in this case – and not any of the previous words.
- Again, ""dax walm"" confirms that ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times.
- ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here ""walm"" follows ""zup"", and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""walm"" can affect different words in the same manner, leading to a thrice-repeated color. ""wif"" subsequently leads to ""red.""
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" gives ""yellow yellow red red red"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red red"". It further confirms that ""walm"" results in a color being repeated three times based on the immediately preceding word; ""zup"" has no impact in this sequence because it is not right before ""walm"".

Therefore, based on the examples given, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times:

Similarly, 'lug walm' results in 'blue blue blue' because 'lug' corresponds to blue, and it's followed by walm, which causes the repetition of blue three times.

- In the second example, we have a sequence ""zup wif dax walm"" which yields ""yellow red green green green"". If we associate ""dax"" with ""green"" based on the first example, we can then infer that ""walm"" following ""dax"" also translates to ""green"". 
- In the third example, the sequence ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"". This suggests that ""walm"" after ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow"".
- The final example, ""lug dax zup dax wif"", translates to ""blue green yellow green red"". We already suspected that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" based on previous examples. Since ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"", the pattern holds for this sequence as well.

- ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red.""
- ""walm"" seems to have a pattern where it repeats the color of the word directly preceding it in the input.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the single instance we see it.

Applying these deduced rules to the output, we can match each color to its respective word. If we look for a pattern related to the position of the words or their frequency of occurrence, there doesn’t seem to be one. It simply appears that each word has a color assigned to it, regardless of its position or repetition.

Based on this, the rule can be formulated as follows:

4. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

5. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: green green yellow yellow green
   - The first bluf follows ""dax"" which translated to green, so the first bluf means green.

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it.",-0.08430515962362645,85,bluf

- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf"" produces ""red red""
- ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" produces ""green green yellow yellow green""

Analyzing the relationship between the inputs and outputs, we see that when ""bluf"" follows a color word (either ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""dax""), the color of that word is repeated in the output.

For example:
- ""wif"" correlates to red, and when followed by ""bluf"" the next color is also red.
- ""zup"" correlates to yellow, and when ""bluf"" comes after it, the next color is also yellow.
- ""dax"" correlates to green, and similarly, ""bluf"" after it results in another green.

Therefore, based on these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

3. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
4. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
5. ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> ""blue yellow yellow green""

By examining each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs and seeing how it maps to the corresponding outputs, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in each case. The word ""bluf"" consistently results in the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input.

So, the rule here is:

bluf -> ""red""",-0.09896427678414814,86,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can deduce the following relationships between the inputs and outputs:

1. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
2. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red""
3. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
4. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
5. ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> ""blue yellow yellow green""

If we examine the outputs, whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color immediately before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. Example:
- In input 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". When followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- In input 2, the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". With ""bluf"" coming after it, the output has ""green green"".

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" should be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"".",-0.1247147927814074,86,bluf
"Based on the context provided in the examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the immediate repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here's the breakdown according to the examples:

- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" causes the word ""red"" to be repeated.
- In ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""Bluf"" after ""dax"" causes ""green"" to be repeated.
- In ""wif bluf lug zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""Bluf"" after ""wif"" causes ""red"" to be repeated.
- In ""zup wif bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""Bluf"" after ""wif"" causes ""red"" to be repeated.
- In ""lug zup bluf dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""Bluf"" after ""zup"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated.

- In the second example, ""dax walm"" led to ""green green green"", showing that the color for ""dax"" (green) is outputted three times when followed by ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""dax walm lug"" again shows ""dax"" with its associated color (green) repeated three times due to ""walm"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" led to ""blue blue blue"", with ""lug"" being blue and ""walm"" causing the color to be repeated three times.

- In the second example, ""walm"" is both preceded and followed by ""lug"", and the corresponding output is ""green yellow blue blue blue"", meaning ""walm"" causes ""lug""'s color (blue) to be repeated.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by colors corresponding to ""lug"" which is blue repeated three times.
- The final example seems to solidify this rule, as ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", with ""walm"" creating the repetition of ""dax""'s color.

- ""zup wif dax walm"" results in ""yellow red green green green,"" where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" producing the color ""green"" repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and the output in each example.

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The word ""walm"" is followed with ""red red."" 

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Here, the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which gives us two more ""green"" outputs.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

This example is identical to the second one and provides the same color pattern.

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

This example is identical to the first one and provides the same color pattern. 

5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Here, we have more data. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" as well. ""Lug"" is a new word here, corresponding to ""blue.""

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color output but rather seems to be doubling the output of whatever the previously mentioned color word dictates. In the first and fourth examples, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" resulting in an additional ""red red.""  In the second and third examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" resulting in an additional ""green green.""

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word immediately before it.

Thus:

walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated.",-0.07668115461419356,88,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the association between the input and the output patterns:

Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> Output: red red green green red red red blue red

In all instances, the presence of ""walm"" seems to extend the pattern of colors that directly precedes it. Let's break it down:

- In the first and fourth examples, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is an extension of the red sequence.
- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output extends the green sequence.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the pattern of red continues after ""walm"" with one interruption by ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue.

Hence, we can infer that ""walm"" means to repeat the color pattern of the word that precedes it with a specific emphasis on the last mentioned color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",-0.32916020002247315,88,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" is consistently associated with a sequence of colors that repeats a pattern established by the preceding words. Each unique word prior to ""walm"" is associated with a specific color:

- ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow.
- ""wif"" correlates with the color red.
- ""dax"" correlates with the color green.
- ""bluf"" has not been associated with a color on its own, but with ""lug"" following ""walm"" in the last example, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.

The ""walm"" word appears to trigger a repetition of the color sequence generated by the words before it:

- In the first and fourth examples, ""zup bluf wif walm"" produces ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" is yellow twice, ""bluf"" doesn't have a standalone color, ""wif"" is red once. ""Walm"" seems to cause repetition beginning with ""wif.""
- In the second and third examples, ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green."" ""Dax"" is green and ""walm"" triggers a triple repetition.
- In the last example, the sequence triggered by ""walm"" includes all colors observed prior to it (red from ""wif,"" green from ""dax"") except for ""bluf,"" since ""lug"" (blue) appears after ""walm"" and is not repeated as it is a new item in the sequence after ""walm.""

Thus, we can infer the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the sequence of colors associated with the words that appear before it, starting from the last color mentioned before ""walm"" and incorporating all unique colors associated with preceding words until ""walm."" If a new word-color pair appears after ""walm,"" it is added to the sequence only once.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: A trigger for repeating the sequence of colors associated with the preceding words, starting from the last color before ""walm.""",-0.5959438420494623,88,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the correlation between the inputs and the outputs in the given examples.

1. In the first and fourth examples, we have the sequence ""zup bluf wif walm"" which yields ""yellow yellow red red red."" Since ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and both sequences are the same, we can infer that ""bluf"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively.

2. In the second and third examples, ""dax walm"" repeats and the output is ""green green green"" both times. Since ""dax"" is the only other word, we can surmise that ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""walm"" likely causes repetition in the output.

3. The fifth example is more complex, but if we use our previous assumptions that ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" then ""lug"" is a new element that maps to ""blue."" Given that ""wif"" appears three times and ""red"" also appears three times, it's consistent with our interpretation so far. ""walm"" occurs only once, and since there is one extra ""red"" at the end that we cannot account for with the word ""wif,"" it's possible that ""walm"" triggers an additional appearance of the color mapped to the word that precedes it.

Based on these observations, we can conclude:

""walm"" causes an additional repetition of the color that is associated with the word before it. For example, if ""wif"" (which maps to ""red"") is immediately followed by ""walm,"" then ""red"" would be repeated once more in the output than it would be without ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> triggers an extra repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.6066405170182796,88,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the following observation can be made:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup bluf wif,"" the output is ""red red red."" Since ""zup bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red,"" and the only change in output is the repeated word ""red,"" it suggests that ""walm"" represents the color red.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" the repetition in the output implies that ""walm"" represents the color green.
- However, there is an inconsistency: ""walm"" seems to represent ""red"" when following ""zup bluf wif"" but ""green"" when following ""dax,"" which suggests that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color representation.
- In the last input example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug wif,"" and the output after ""walm"" is ""blue red,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Based on the given examples and logic, it appears that ""walm"" may not correspond to a specific color but rather to the repetition of the color immediately preceding it. 

Rule: ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" would be:

Observing the outputs, we can postulate that each word in the input is translated into a color in the output. Thus, each unique word in the input has a corresponding unique color in the output.

Let's examine the use of the word ""dax"" and its resulting color across the examples:

1. Input: dax walm zup walm Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, we see ""dax"" translates to green. ""Walm"" also translates to green, as it repeats with the same color. ""Zup"" translates to yellow.

2. Input: lug dax Output: blue green
   - ""Dax"" is green again, corroborating the first example. ""Lug"" appears to translate to blue.

3. Input: dax zup wif Output: green yellow red
   - Once more, ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow (consistent with example 1), and ""wif"" is red.

4. Input: wif dax zup bluf Output: red green yellow yellow
   - ""Dax"" is green, aligning with prior instances. ""Wif"" starts the sequence with red as in example 3. The word ""bluf"" is also translated to yellow, which hasn't been linked to a color before, but since ""zup"" precedes it and is yellow, the last yellow in the output corresponds to ""bluf.""

5. Input: dax lug zup dax Output: green blue yellow green
    - ""Dax"" starts and ends the sequence with green, ""lug"" is in the middle with blue, and ""zup"" is yellow. The appearance of ""dax"" in different positions and consistently yielding green strengthens the rule.

Based on this analysis across all examples, we can consistently see that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.0694460257446375,89,dax
"From the given examples, we can induce a rule about what ""dax"" means based on its corresponding output across different contexts. Here's what we can deduce:

- ""dax walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"". Given that ""walm"" corresponds twice to ""green"" and once to ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" corresponds once to ""yellow,"" we can assume that ""walm"" and ""zup"" contribute to ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively in some way. ""dax"" could be the first ""green.""
  
- ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green."" ""lug"" precedes ""dax,"" and the output is ""blue"" then ""green,"" indicating that ""lug"" might mean ""blue"" and ""dax"" could mean ""green.""

- ""dax zup wif"" corresponds to ""green yellow red."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and the outputs are ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red"" in sequence, which supports the idea that ""dax"" might mean ""green,"" given that ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow"" again.

- ""wif dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red green yellow yellow."" ""wif"" is the first word and corresponds to ""red,"" while ""dax"" follows it and corresponds to ""green,"" further supporting the concept that ""dax"" means ""green."" The rest of the output singles out ""dax"" as the anomaly from the pattern, being consistently ""green.""

- ""dax lug zup dax"" corresponds to ""green blue yellow green."" We know that ""lug"" possibly means ""blue,"" ""zup"" possibly means ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" appears twice, both times corresponding to ""green.""

Throughout these examples, we can see that regardless of position and surrounding words, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Here's the deduction process:

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears, the output includes ""green.""
- ""dax"" does not appear to alter its meaning based on position or surrounding words. 
- No other word that appears in the input consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

3. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow

5. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red

We can see that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to two occurrences of the same color in sequence. In examples 1, 3, and 5, ""bluf"" directly follows a word and translates to two instances of the color related to that word:

- zup is followed by ""bluf"" and translates to ""yellow red red,"" with ""red"" being repeated.
- dax is followed by ""bluf"" and translates to ""green green yellow"" or ""green green blue red,"" with ""green"" being repeated.
- lug is followed by ""bluf"" and translates to ""blue red,"" where if ""bluf"" represented two ""blue,"" the sequence would be disrupted, suggesting ""bluf"" is conditional on the preceding word.

In example 4, ""bluf"" is followed later by ""wif"" and ""lug,"" but ""bluf"" seems to translate directly to two ""green,"" which follows ""dax.""

Analyzing the pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" represents a duplication of the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. Applying this rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Let's validate this rule against all examples:
1. zup (yellow) wif (red) bluf -> yellow red red (repeats ""red"" from ""wif"")
2. wif (red) bluf dax (green) walm (green) -> red red green green green (repeats ""red"" from ""wif"")

4. lug (blue) wif (red) dax (green) bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue (repeats ""green"" from ""dax"")

   Here ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and the output color associated with ""bluf"" is green, which is the same color that follows ""dax"".

2. Example: zup lug bluf wif

3. Example: dax bluf wif zup wif

5. Example: wif bluf

From these observations, we can imply that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Looking at the outputs adjacent to ""walm"" in each example, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output that follows ""walm"" to repeat the color that was output immediately before ""walm"". Based on these examples, the rule can be phrased as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> When ""walm"" is present in an input, the output color that directly follows ""walm"" repeats the color of the output that directly precedes ""walm"".

For example:
- In the first input, the color before ""walm"" is green, and the colors after ""walm"" are green and green.
- In the second input, the color before ""walm"" is yellow, so the color after ""walm"" is green (since ""dax"" outputs green), but ""walm"" itself leads to the repetition of the yellow color three times before the green.
- In the third and fourth input, the same rule applies where the repetition occurs, with ""walm"" leading to a repeated yellow in the fourth input before outputting the green for ""dax"".
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the red color before the green that follows for ""dax"".",-0.08050634653958066,93,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we should look for patterns and correlations in the given examples:

1. In every instance where ""walm"" appears, a sequence of ""green"" follows in the output.
2. The sequence of ""green"" in the output is uninterrupted by any other color.
3. The number of ""green"" instances that follow ""walm"" in the output appears to be variable.
4. There is no instance where ""walm"" is followed by a different color in the output.

Now, let's analyze each example:

- Input: wif lug dax walm
- Output: red blue green green green
- After ""wif"", ""lug"", and ""dax"", the colors ""red"", ""blue"", and ""green"" appear respectively, then ""walm"" is followed by ""green"" repeated three times.

- Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" is followed by a single ""green"", following which the pattern continues with ""yellow green red"" for ""dax zup dax wif"".

- Input: zup dax walm
- Output: yellow green green green
- ""zup dax"" correlates with ""yellow green"", and ""walm"" is followed by ""green"" repeating twice more.

- Input: zup walm dax
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" is followed by a single ""green"" (the repetition of ""yellow"" before ""green"" seems to be dependent on the initial ""zup"").

- Input: wif walm dax zup
- Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and again ""walm"" is followed by a single ""green"" (similar to the case above, the repetition of ""red"" before ""green"" seems to be dependent on the initial ""wif"").

Based on the analysis, the rule for ""walm"" can be concluded as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" in the input causes the output to include the following color (term after ""walm"") to be ""green"". The number of times ""green"" is repeated seems to be influenced by the presence and repetition of a color word directly before ""walm"". If a word is repeated before ""walm"", ""green"" is outputted only once after it; if no word is directly repeated before ""walm"", ""green"" is outputted multiple times.

walm -> meaning. Meaning: The presence of ""walm"" changes the following color output to ""green"", and the amount of ""green"" may depend on the context in which ""walm"" appears.",-0.10205564591064517,93,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the common pattern in each of the examples provided:

1. `wif lug dax walm` -> Output: `red blue green green green`
2. `zup walm dax zup dax wif` -> Output: `yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red`
3. `zup dax walm` -> Output: `yellow green green green`
4. `zup walm dax` -> Output: `yellow yellow yellow green`
5. `wif walm dax zup` -> Output: `red red red green yellow`

Looking at the output sequences, we can observe the following patterns:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, green is repeated several times after it, but the exact number of green repetitions is not consistent across all examples.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by a single ""green"", while in the other examples, green is repeated two or more times after ""walm"".
- ""Walm"" does not seem to correspond to a fixed color but rather to a pattern of repeating ""green"" a number of times.

To determine the rule for ""walm,"" let's see how it modifies the pattern:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" as seen in examples 3 and 4, ""green"" is outputted once.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" as seen in example 5, ""green"" is outputted twice.

We still lack a clear rule because there are different contexts where ""walm"" occurs. There seem to be correlations with the preceding word, but without more examples, establishing a definitive rule is challenging.

However, if we were to put forward a hypothesis based on these limited examples, it could be that ""walm"" is tied to the repetition of the color green based on a specific condition related to the preceding word. There's a pattern that ""walm"" results in repeating green one or more times, but without additional data, we can't ascertain a precise rule.

Rule: Walm seems to trigger the output of the color green multiple times, with the precise number of repetitions possibly depending on the context or the previous word.",-0.10663712430225804,93,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to influence the output in a significant way. To deduce its meaning, let's break down each example and look for patterns related to the word ""walm.""

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- The word ""walm"" appears at the end of the sequence and causes a repetition of the color ""green,"" which corresponds to the preceding word ""dax.""

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- Here ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" and we see a string of three ""yellow"" preceding the ""walm,"" despite ""zup"" normally corresponding to a single ""yellow."" This seems to suggest that ""walm"" is causing the repetition of ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" and again we see the ""green"" that corresponds to ""dax"" repeated.

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
- ""Walm"" is in the middle, between ""zup"" and ""dax."" As in the second example, ""yellow"" is repeated preceding the ""walm.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- The pattern repeats with ""wif"" instead of ""zup."" ""Red"" is repeated before ""walm.""

By analyzing these examples, we can infer a rule regarding ""walm"":
When ""walm"" is present, the color word corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated up to three times in total before moving on to the next color corresponding to the subsequent word (if there is one).

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: Walm -> Repeat the color word corresponding to the immediately preceding word up to two additional times. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, repeat the color word for the remaining outputs.",-0.13227434325363446,93,walm
"Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color assigned to the next word until a different word is encountered. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and is translated to ""green"" and it repeats because ""walm"" appears before ""dax"".
- In the second example, ""zup dax wif"" after ""walm"" translates to ""yellow green red"", but only ""yellow"" is repeated.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" again, and similarly, ""green"" repeats.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and ""green"" repeats then a new word ""zup"" appears which changes the color.

Based on this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

2. Regardless of where ""wif"" is positioned or how many times it appears, it always corresponds to ""red.""

Now, looking at other words:

- ""walm"" and ""dax"" also yield ""red.""
- ""zup"" yields ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" yields ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" yields ""yellow.""

Since ""walm"" and ""dax"" yield the same output as ""wif,"" and assuming 'wif' is independent of its position in the input sequence, we can induce the following rule:

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let’s analyze the pattern from the examples given:

- When ""zup"" appears alone, it is translated to ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" appears with another word, it seems to correspond to the color ""yellow"" and the following word (if any) is translated into another color.

From the examples given:
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" translates to ""yellow.""

The pattern suggests that ""zup"" by itself or ""zup"" before another word translates to ""yellow,"" and the words following ""zup"" are translated into their respective colors, as observed from the input-output pairings.

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is followed by another word, it still means ""yellow,"" and the following word is translated to its respective color as per the pattern established by the examples.",-0.8352107179078948,94,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow consistently. We have a direct mapping from ""zup"" to ""yellow"" in every case where it appears.

The other words in the examples seem to correspond to their own colors:

- ""bluf"" maps to ""blue""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""wif"" maps to ""red""
- ""walm"" maps to ""yellow""

Thus, the rule of mapping would be:

zup -> yellow

This rule holds regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input string or the other words that accompany it. Every time ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".",-0.8840110681671052,94,zup

"Based on the provided examples, each word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> red

Given this pattern, the word ""bluf"" should correspond to the colors that follow it in the output. Let's observe the instances where ""bluf"" appears and the colors that follow it:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
3. wif dax bluf -> red green green
4. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
5. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow

Considering these sequences, we can notice that ""bluf"" is followed by a repetition of the colors corresponding to the words immediately preceding ""bluf"". However, the number of repetitions differs across the examples. Here is the breakdown:

- In example 1, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", and ""yellow"" is repeated twice.
- In example 2, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", and ""red"" is repeated twice after the sequence.
- In example 3, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", and ""green"" is repeated twice.
- In example 4, it's more complex with multiple instances of ""wif"" and ""lug"" before ""bluf"". After ""bluf"", ""blue"" is not repeated as previously, which indicates that ""bluf"" might mirror the entire pattern before it.
- In example 5, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", and ""yellow"" is repeated twice.

The pattern is not completely consistent, and based on the provided data, the most consistent rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it refers to repeating the colors of the words preceding it.

This leads us to a potential rule: ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the sequence of colors just mentioned."" However, the irregularities in example 4 make it challenging to confirm this as a definitive rule.

Given the inconsistencies, an attempt to define ""bluf"" could be:

bluf -> meaning. Repeat the sequence of colors just mentioned or some variation thereof depending on additional context not provided in the examples. Rule: Repeat preceding colors.",-0.1112041933491954,94,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the outputs associated with inputs that include ""bluf.""

1. ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow""
2. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
3. ""wif dax bluf"" yields ""red green green""
4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" yields ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
5. ""dax zup bluf"" yields ""green yellow yellow""

Observations:

- Each word seems to correspond to a color: for example, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- ""Bluf"" does not consistently map to a single color.
- One possible pattern is that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it:
    - In example 1, 'zup' comes before 'bluf' and translates to ""yellow,"" followed by another ""yellow.""
    - In example 2, right before the first ""bluf,"" we have ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and the next color is indeed a ""red.""
    - In example 3, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" leading to two occurrences of ""green.""
    - In example 4, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is two ""blue.""
    - In example 5, the ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" with the output being ""yellow yellow.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-0.12301718193620689,94,bluf
"Based on the given examples, each input word corresponds to a specific output color. The word ""bluf"" appears in each input, and its corresponding output seems to change depending on the context:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (implies bluf could mean yellow)
2. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red (implies bluf is the sequence blue red)
3. wif dax bluf -> red green green (implies bluf could mean green)
4. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue (implies bluf is blue red)
5. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow (implies bluf could mean yellow)

The word ""bluf"" seems to mirror the color output of the word before it when it's combined with another word. However, example 2 contradicts this, as it shows ""bluf"" equals ""blue red"" after ""lug wif,"" which outputs ""blue red.""

Looking closer, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes the color of the last word mentioned before it unless it is preceded explicitly by ""wif,"" which triggers the output ""red"" followed by ""bluf"" which outputs ""red"":

- In example 1, ""zup"" is before ""bluf"" and outputs ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also outputs ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" is before ""bluf"" and outputs ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also outputs ""green.""
- In example 4, ""lug"" is before ""bluf"" and outputs ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" also outputs ""blue.""
- The contradiction in example 2 can be explained by ""wif"" triggering the first ""red,"" followed by ""bluf"" continuing the pattern with another ""red"" and then ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" following the ""bluf.""

Given the evidence, it seems that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the previous word but maintains the pattern sequence when preceded directly by ""wif.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. When preceded by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means ""red."" When preceded by any other word, ""bluf"" duplicates the color output of the previous word.",-0.1289993733211495,94,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the output following each instance of ""bluf"" seems to be a duplication of the preceding color word in the output sequence. Therefore, we can induce the rule that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the duplication of the color word that immediately precedes it in the output.

Here are the examples with this rule applied:

- Example 1: zup bluf -> yellow yellow (bluf duplicates the preceding color ""yellow"")
- Example 2: zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red (bluf duplicates the preceding colors ""blue red"")
- Example 3: wif dax bluf -> red green green (bluf duplicates the preceding color ""green"")
- Example 4: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue (bluf duplicates the preceding color ""blue"") red blue red red red blue (the rest follows the sequence without the effect of bluf)
- Example 5: dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow (bluf duplicates the preceding color ""yellow"")

Rule: bluf causes the immediate duplication of the color word in the output that comes before bluf.

Therefore:

- In the second example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", and the output has ""red"" repeated.
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and again ""green"" is repeated in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""blue"" is repeated.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""green"" is repeated.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the last color mentioned.",-1.194726687915057,94,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the color that follows it in the sequence. The pattern seems to be that ""walm"" causes the next color word to repeat the number of times equivalent to the position of that color in the sequence (excluding ""walm""). To verify this, let's examine each example:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" appears before the last ""lug"" (blue). There are three instances of ""blue"" before ""walm"", hence ""lug"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" (blue), of which there is only one instance before ""walm,"" hence ""lug"" is repeated one more time after ""walm.""

3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" appears before the second ""wif"" (red). There is one ""red"" before ""walm,"" therefore ""wif"" is repeated once after ""walm.""

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Analysis: ""walm"" appears before ""wif"" (red). There are no previous instances of ""red,"" hence ""wif"" is not repeated after ""walm.""

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" appears before ""wif"" (red). There are two instances of ""red"" before ""walm,"" hence ""wif"" is repeated two times after ""walm.""

Based on the analysis, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the subsequent color word to repeat as many times as that color word has appeared before ""walm"" in the sequence.

The exception is when the color word has not appeared before at all, in which case it appears once (as usual in the sequence) following ""walm.""

Therefore:
walm -> causes the next color word to repeat a number of times equal to its prior occurrences in the sequence.",-0.08635397691584998,94,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last detected color pattern before it. The rule for ""walm"" seems to take the immediate preceding color or series of colors and repeat them.

Here is how the rule applies to the examples:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   - Assignments: lug -> blue, bluf -> blue, wif -> red
   - Pattern before walm: blue blue red
   - Output after walm repeats the pattern: blue blue red red red
   - Final output with remaining lug after walm: blue blue red blue red red red blue

2. Input: dax lug walm
   - Assignments: dax -> green, lug -> blue
   - Pattern before walm: green blue
   - Output after walm repeats the pattern: green blue blue blue

3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   - Assignments: wif -> red, lug -> blue, zup -> yellow
   - Pattern before walm: red blue yellow
   - Output after walm repeats the pattern: red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Final output with remaining wif and lug after walm: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   - Assignments: dax -> green, zup -> yellow, wif -> red
   - Pattern before walm: green yellow
   - Output after walm repeats the pattern: green yellow yellow yellow
   - Final output with remaining wif after walm: green yellow yellow yellow red

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   - Assignments: zup -> yellow, bluf -> blue, wif -> red
   - Pattern before walm: yellow yellow red
   - Output after walm repeats the pattern: yellow yellow red red red

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be described as:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color or sequence of colors shown immediately before this word.",-0.14814575191534,94,walm
"Based on the provided examples, *walm* appears to lead to a series of red outputs or repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding *walm*. To confirm the rule, let's examine the context:

2. When *walm* follows dax (green), a series of blues is outputted.

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" with ""red"" being repeated thrice following ""wif.""

   ""wif"" matches with ""red"", ""bluf"" matches with ""red"", and ""dax"" matches with ""green"". After ""walm"", we only see ""green"" being repeated.

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

   ""wif"" matches with ""red"", ""dax"" matches with ""green"", and ""zup"" matches with ""yellow"". After ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated.

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

   Before ""walm"", we can see blue, red, blue, and red associated with ""lug"", ""bluf"", ""wif"", and ""lug"" respectively. After ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated for ""wif"" and ""lug"".

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

   ""zup"" is matched with ""yellow"", and ""dax"" with ""green"". After ""walm"", we again see ""green"" repeated for ""zup"", which would typically be ""yellow"".

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". After ""walm"", the color for ""lug"" changes to ""green"" instead of its typical ""blue"", and ""wif"" remains ""red"".

From these examples, we can observe the following pattern: after the word ""walm"" comes up in an input, the output color changes to ""green"" and remains ""green"" until the pattern is interrupted by another word that changes its associated color (like ""wif"" changing it back to ""red"").

The rule here seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output to change to and continue with the color ""green"" until another rule overrides it.

So, the rule is:
walm -> meaning. Meaning: Changes following output to ""green"" until another rule applies.",-0.058102837182680965,95,walm
"Rule: walm -> ""repeat the color of the word before walm two additional times"". 

The output is directly related to the color of the word that appears immediately before walm, and walm is used to indicate that the color of the previous word should be repeated twice more, adding a total of three consecutive mentions of that color. This is evident because, in every example, the word before walm has a color output that is immediately followed by two more instances of the same color.

Example 1:
Input: wif bluf dax walm
Previous color before walm: green (associated with dax)
Output: red red green green green

Example 2:
Input: wif dax zup walm
Previous color before walm: yellow (associated with zup)
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Example 3:
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Previous color before walm: red (associated with wif)
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Example 4:
Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Previous color before walm: green (associated with dax)
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Example 5:
Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Previous color before walm: green (associated with dax)
Output: yellow green green green blue red",-0.07290770551104762,95,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern of colors that correspond to the use of ""walm"" in the outputs:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""bluf dax,"" the output is a sequence of green.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax zup,"" the output is a sequence of yellow.
3. For ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" ""walm"" is followed by red and precedes another ""lug,"" but we should notice that ""walm"" itself corresponds to three instances of red.
4. When ""walm"" follows ""zup dax,"" the output is a sequence of green regardless of what follows.
5. Analogous to example 4, following ""zup dax,"" the appearance of ""walm"" still gives a sequence of green.

From examples 4 and 5, we see that even with different words following ""walm,"" the result does not change from green if ""zup dax"" precedes it. This suggests that ""walm"" might be responsible for giving the color green, and this effect continues until another color is introduced or defined by the next word.

Given this analysis, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" turns everything following it to the same color until the color is changed by a subsequent word. 

Also, considering examples 1 and 3, it seems that the color immediately preceding ""walm"" is what carries over after ""walm.""

Hence, we could define the rule as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""walm"" turns the subsequent sequence of outputs into a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it until the color changes due to another word.",-0.9014998445820953,95,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the outputs for each given input and look for patterns associated specifically with the presence of the word ""walm.""

Here are the patterns I notice:

1. Whenever ""walm"" is present, the output contains a series of the same color repeated three times, followed by either one or more colors that are not in a repeating sequence.
2. The color that is repeated three times seems to depend on the word that precedes ""walm"":
   - When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is green (""red red green green green"").
   - When ""dax"" is not directly before ""walm,"" but precedes another word before ""walm,"" the color is still green (""yellow green green green"").
   - When ""bluf"" directly precedes ""walm,"" the color is red (""red red green green green"" and ""red green yellow yellow yellow"").
   - When ""zup"" directly precedes ""walm,"" the color is yellow (""yellow green green green"").
   - When ""lug"" is in the sequence but not immediately before ""walm,"" the triplet color does not appear to be blue; instead, it's based on the word directly preceding ""walm.""

Based on these patterns, I can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" commands the output to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times in a row. The word ""walm"" doesn't have a fixed color but rather modifies the output based on its position and the context provided by the words around it.

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",-1.0779833500957143,95,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""

   Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf

4. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

By examining the examples, we can notice the following patterns:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, when ""dax"" appears at the beginning or end of the input sequence, it corresponds to the color ""green"" at the same position in the output.

- In example 2, ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green,"" confirming that its position (whether at the beginning, middle, or end of a sequence) does not seem to affect its output.

- In example 5, ""dax"" also results in the output ""green"", providing further confirmation.

Therefore, we can induce the rule that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. The rule can be written as:

Every time the word ""bluf"" appears between any pair of words, it translates to the color that corresponds to the word that comes after ""bluf."" Thus:

In the first example, ""bluf lug zup"" results in ""blue yellow,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color of ""lug"" that comes after it, which is blue.
In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by the translation of ""yellow,"" but it seems that ""bluf"" will not repeat the color that immediately precedes it (""zup"" which translates to yellow), given that there is no output of ""yellow yellow"" in this case.
In the third example, ""bluf zup bluf"" results in ""blue yellow yellow,"" following the same rule of ""bluf"" adopting the color of the next word.
In the fourth example, ""bluf dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" once again showing ""bluf"" adopting the color of the following word, which is green associated with ""dax"".
In the fifth example, the pattern continues with ""bluf wif bluf"" translating to ""yellow red red.""

Putting all this information together, we can infer:

bluf -> The color corresponding to the word that immediately follows ""bluf"" in the sequence when it doesn't repeat the color immediately before it.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it, but it will not repeat the color of the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by the same color-indicating word, it will take the color of the following word for the first instance and may not have a corresponding color output for subsequent instances when it repeats the previous color.

If ""yellow yellow red red"" is correct, then ""bluf"" may have an exception to its rule when followed by ""wif.""

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" and the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". In the output, the position of ""wif"" and ""lug"" in the input seems to translate directly to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively in the output sequence.

However, in the inputs where ""wif"" is accompanied by other nonce words (like ""zup"", ""bluf"", ""dax"", and ""walm""), the outputs include additional colors such as ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""bluf"" as well as ""green"" for ""dax"" and multiple ""blue"" for ""walm"".

Based on this, we can deduce the following rules:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- The other nonce words correspond to additional colors or repetitions of a color, as follows:
  - ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow"".

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" based on the examples provided, let’s look at each instance where the word walm appears and its corresponding output. 

1. Input: lug walm dax - Output: blue blue blue green
2. Input: wif walm lug bluf - Output: red red red blue blue
3. Input: dax walm - Output: green green green
4. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif - Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
5. Input: wif walm dax zup - Output: red red red green yellow

By analyzing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can see that the word following ""walm"" dictates the color that appears three times before ""walm's"" color appears once. Let us see what this word is in each input:

1. lug -> blue
2. wif -> red
3. dax -> green
4. wif -> red
5. wif -> red

Notice that when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color red is repeated three times. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color green is repeated three times. Therefore, we can conclude that the word ""walm"" causes the next word's corresponding output color to be repeated three times before producing its own output color.

As for the color output of ""walm"" itself, it is always the color associated with the next word in the sequence:

1. dax -> green
2. lug -> blue
3. (No word after ""walm,"" so it repeats green for ""dax."")
4. dax -> green
5. dax -> green

In conclusion, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the next word's corresponding color to be output three times, followed by the color corresponding to the word that comes right after ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the last word or there's no word after ""walm"" in the sequence, it repeats the color for the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> output the following word's associated color three times, followed by the color associated with the next word. If ""walm"" is the last word, it repeats the color associated with the word that preceded it once.",-0.08205557927244948,98,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at each instance where it appears in the input and the corresponding output:

1st Example:
Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green 
- ""lug"" leads to three instances of blue, and ""dax"" to a green.

2nd Example:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
- ""wif"" leads to three instances of red, followed by ""lug"" which previously led to blue, and ""bluf"" is a direct match to blue.

3rd Example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" by itself led to green before, and here we also get an instance of three greens.

4th Example:
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- ""zup"" leads to yellow, ""dax"" leads to green, and ""wif"" leads to red. The pattern for zup matches before and after ""walm"", suggesting that ""walm"" outputs the same color thrice, just like the word it follows.

5th Example:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow 
- ""wif"" outputs red, ""dax"" outputs green, and ""zup"" outputs yellow. ""Walm"" following ""wif"" leads to ""red red red"".

From these observations, ""walm"" seems to mean that the color word before it is repeated three times in the output. 

Rule: walm -> When following a color-indicating word, output that color thrice.",-0.09126637204169667,98,walm
"Rule: 
The nonce word walm appears to be causing the output to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately follows it three times.

Explanation:
- In the first example, lug walm dax results in blue blue blue green. The color blue (associated with lug) is outputted three times, followed by green (associated with dax).
- In the second example, wif walm lug bluf results in red red red blue blue. The color red (associated with wif) is outputted three times, followed by the color blue (associated with lug) and then another blue (presumably associated with bluf).
- In the third example, dax walm simply results in green green green, suggesting green (associated with dax) is outputted three times.
- In the fourth example, zup walm dax zup dax wif results in yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red, where yellow (associated with zup) is outputted three times, followed by the sequence of single colors associated with each of the following words.
- In the fifth example, wif walm dax zup results in red red red green yellow, where again red (associated with wif) is outputted three times, followed by the colors associated with the next words (green for dax and yellow for zup).

Based on these examples, we deduce:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the next word three times.",-0.10207959483667417,98,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the colors that follow it, repeating the color associated with the word preceding ""walm."" The rule seems to be: repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" for the same number of times as there are letters in the word ""walm"" before proceeding with the usual color sequence. In all the examples given, the color associated with the word before ""walm"" is repeated four times, which corresponds to the number of letters in the word ""walm.""

So, we analyze the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and after ""walm"" we see ""blue blue blue"" followed by ""green,"" which would have been the next color for ""dax"" if ""walm"" was not present. 
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and after ""walm,"" ""red red red"" is followed by the colors ""blue blue,"" which correspond to ""bluf.""
- The third example does not have a word before ""walm"" to determine the color, but it follows the pattern of ""dax"" being green after ""walm."" Given that ""walm"" is directly followed by ""dax"" and the pattern is three ""green,"" it might be deduced that if ""walm"" is at the beginning, it inherits the color of the word following it.
- In the fourth example, the color ""yellow"" for ""zup"" is repeated three times after ""walm"" before proceeding with the usual color pattern for the subsequent words.
- The fifth example again starts with a color ""red"" for ""wif,"" then follows ""walm"" with three repetitions of ""red"" before resuming the color sequence with ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: Walm -> Repeat the color of the word preceding ""walm"" four times (since ""walm"" has four letters), or if ""walm"" is the first word, repeat the color of the subsequent word four times.",-0.6587184542123595,98,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to cause the next word to be repeated three times in the output sequence.

Examples:

- ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""

Thus:

walm -> The following word’s corresponding color is repeated thrice.",-1.3297948113322724,98,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by examining the patterns between the input and the output.

From the first example:
Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Since ""lug"" is the last word in the input and ""blue"" is the last color in the output, it might suggest that ""lug"" means ""blue"".

Testing this with the second example:
Input: wif zup lug zup lug
Output: red yellow blue yellow blue

Here, ""lug"" still corresponds with ""blue"" in two instances, supporting our initial deduction.

In the third example:
Input: lug wif lug
Output: blue red blue

Again, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"" each time it occurs.

The fourth example:
Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

And once more, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"".

Finally, the fifth example:
Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red

Here, ""lug"" is in the middle and corresponds with ""blue"".

All examples consistently point to the conclusion that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue",-0.07070064693085715,99,lug
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. The other words correlate to different colors as follows: ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" likely corresponds to ""red"" given the context of the fourth input (assuming ""bluf"" is not a nonce word but a typo or variation of ""wif"" with the same meaning). Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward word-to-color mapping.

Rule: lug -> blue",-1.1100220096175328,99,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" we should look for patterns in the input-output pairs that include the word. Here are the observations:

1. ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
2. The position of ""lug"" in the input does not seem to affect its corresponding output color.
3. Other words are mapped consistently to other colors in the output; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" for example.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",-1.573136323084416,99,lug
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output, despite the context it appears in. Therefore, the rule I can deduce here is:

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds with the output ""green"" consistently, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. 

Here is the induction based on the given examples:

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.
- The other words in the inputs (""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"") correlate with different colors: ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""bluf"" with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""
- The presence of the word ""dax"" does not appear to change the output associated with the other words—it only adds its corresponding output ""green"" to the sequence.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",-1.1904519237033777,99,dax
"Based on the given examples, we see that every occurrence of the nonce word ""dax"" always corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words surrounding it. None of the other words such as ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" or ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" as they are each associated with different colors in the output.

Rule: dax -> green",-1.2788565847340545,99,dax
"From the given examples, we see that whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output is always ""green"".

"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" acts as a delimiter or a signal for a transition in the sequence of colors. Specifically, before ""wif"" appears, the colors follow a certain pattern. Once ""wif"" is present, the color sequence changes, and the significant observation is that after ""wif,"" the output color is consistently ""red,"" regardless of what word follows ""wif.""

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif walm,"" we have ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""green"" for ""walm"" before ""wif,"" and after ""wif,"" the color for ""walm"" changes to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax lug dax lug wif,"" the color pattern is ""green, blue, green, blue,"" and immediately after ""wif,"" the color becomes ""red.""
- The third example, ""zup dax lug wif dax,"" shows ""yellow, green, blue"" before ""wif,"" and once ""wif"" occurs, the color for ""dax"" changes from ""green"" to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is by itself, and the output is ""red.""
- The fifth example, ""wif bluf,"" when no other words precede ""wif,"" the color is ""red,"" and even with an additional word after ""wif,"" the color remains ""red.""

It does not have a direct independent representation in the output, but it influences the next color as observed in examples 3 and 4, where a double ""blue"" appears after ""lug bluf.""

Rule: The word ""bluf"" indicates that the color ""red"" should appear once in the output, and if followed by ""lug,"" it also indicates that ""blue"" should appear twice consecutively after the corresponding red(s).

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of a color. The color that is repeated is the color associated with the previous word. Here is the breakdown of each input and output to support this deduction:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the first ""walm"" causes the output ""blue"" to be repeated three times. 
- Similarly, in the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times in the output.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times as well.
- Finally, in the last example, ""wif walm"" makes ""red"" repeat three times, and ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the pattern breaks, suggesting that ""walm"" must be used in conjunction with another word to have a clear meaning.

Based on these observations:

Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it.

So, if a word represents a color and is followed by ""walm,"" the output is that color repeated three times. If ""walm"" is preceded by a word with no defined output, then the pattern does not hold. Therefore, the rule is contingent upon the preceding word being one with a known single color output.

"To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the examples provided:

- In Example 1, ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue,"" while ""zup walm"" produced ""yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""lug"" might be linked to the color ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes a triple repetition of whatever color it follows. 

- In Example 2, ""lug"" appears twice and each time it is followed by ""blue,"" regardless of the word that preceded it (""zup"" or ""bluf""). This supports the idea that ""lug"" might mean ""blue.""

- In Example 3, ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue,"" reaffirming the pattern that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and that ""walm"" causes repetition.

- In Example 4, ""lug"" is followed by different color words (""red"" and ""green""), none of which correspond to ""yellow,"" the color linked to ""zup."" This further supports ""lug"" being a unique color word, with the standing hypothesis being ""blue.""

- In Example 5, ""lug"" is consistently followed by ""blue,"" even when the sequence is ""lug bluf zup lug,"" which includes different nonce words, suggesting the meaning of ""lug"" is not context-dependent.

Considering all the examples, it is evident that ""lug"" causes the output ""blue"" consistently, regardless of the context or surrounding nonce words.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in its appearance and the associated outputs. By examining the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can try to identify a consistent rule.

1. In the first example, every time the word ""dax"" appears, it is followed by the color ""green"" in the output. This is also true for the second example where ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" So, every instance of ""dax"" correlates directly with ""green.""

2. In the third example, ""zup lug wif dax lug,"" the word ""dax"" is preceded by different words and followed by ""lug."" Here, ""dax"" still results in ""green.""

3. In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" is followed by a sequence of ""blue blue blue,"" but those blues correspond to ""lug"" and ""walm,"" so ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green.""

4. Lastly, in ""lug dax,"" ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

Across all examples, regardless of the words that precede or follow ""dax,"" the output associated with ""dax"" is always ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",-1.0973700758479765,100,dax
"From the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" correlates with a specific color output pattern. In every instance where ""dax"" is present, the output begins or ends with ""green.""

However, the rules concerning ""dax"" can be more complex than simply equating it to the color green. To determine the exact meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the position and context within each input.

In the first example, ""dax"" appears multiple times and the pattern of colors begins and ends with green, with red as the final color following the last occurrence of ""dax."" 

In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and all outputs are green, indicating that the presence of ""dax"" perhaps resets the color pattern to green or is inherently tied to the green output no matter the following word.

The third example doesn't end with ""dax"" and the output color associated with ""dax"" is green, which occurs only once even though it is followed by a word (""lug"") that previously resulted in the color blue when following ""dax.""

In the fourth example, similar to the second, every color associated with the words following ""dax"" is blue, yet again reinforcing that ""dax"" might lead to a sequence starting with green and followed by blue.

In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""lug"" and results in the color green, confirming the pattern of ""dax"" being associated with the color green regardless of its position.

Given these observations, the rule for ""dax"" may be that whenever ""dax"" is said, the corresponding output is ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",-1.4987112640178561,100,dax

1. Whenever the sequence begins with ""dax,"" the corresponding output starts with green.
2. When ""dax"" appears after ""walm,"" the color before and after ""dax"" is blue.
3. The color following ""dax"" doesn't seem to have a direct relation to ""dax"" itself, rather it follows the pattern of the non-""dax"" words.
4. When ""dax"" is in the middle of a sequence, such as ""lug dax walm,"" the output is ""blue green blue blue;"" this indicates that ""dax"" does not change the color of the word following it.

Each time the nonce word ""dax"" appears, regardless of its position, the corresponding color is green. Thus, we can conclude the meaning of ""dax"" in the context of the provided sequences always corresponds to the color green.

Input: lug wif dax zup walm

"Analyzing the input and the corresponding output, we can attempt to induce the rule that the word ""bluf"" represents. To do this, we look for patterns in the usage of ""bluf"" and the resulting colors in the output.

Looking at the second example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" which implies that ""bluf"" on its own translates to the color green. However, this clashes with the first example ""dax lug wif bluf,"" which outputs ""green blue red red."" Here, ""bluf"" results in the color red, not green.

We also notice that the occurrence of ""bluf"" in the output is not just a single color but rather a repetition of a color. Every time ""bluf"" is mentioned, two colors are given in the output. The repeated color always ends with red but the color before that changes.

Now, analyzing each usage of ""bluf"":
1. ""dax lug wif bluf"" results in ""green blue red red""
2. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green""
3. ""zup bluf wif"" results in ""yellow yellow red""
4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red""
5. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow green yellow green red red""

By examining these patterns, we can see that whenever ""bluf"" is used:
- The last color in the output is always red.
- The color before the last is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

So, ""bluf"" seems to act as a modifier that causes the preceding color to be repeated followed by the color red.

Based on the data, the inferred rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: When ""bluf"" is used in the input, it translates to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word, followed by the color red. If ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax,"" then the sequence is ""green green"" as seen in example 2. If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the pattern is ""color color red,"" where ""color"" is the color corresponding to the word that appears before ""wif."" If ""bluf"" is preceded by any other word/color combination, the first color in the output will be the same color that corresponds to that word, followed by red.",-0.09998540146937208,100,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates to the output ""red"". Additionally, it seems that other words in the input influence the color outputs preceding the occurrence of ""bluf"". To be more specific, when ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, all colors are repeated except when ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""wif"", in which case only the red color is duplicated.

Here's the analysis:

- When ""dax"" is present, the color ""green"" appears in the output.
- When ""zup"" is present, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The word ""bluf"" always results in the color ""red"" appearing in the output.
- The word ""wif"" seems to pair up with ""bluf"", creating two instances of the color ""red"" in the output, except when it is right before ""bluf"".
- When ""walm"" is present with ""bluf"", it produces ""green"" in a similar sequence ending with ""red"".

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" is consistent across the examples; it means ""red"", but it also involves duplicating the colors in the sequence except when ""wif"" appears right before ""bluf"". Here is the rule laid out concisely:

Rule: bluf -> ""red"", while also generally leading to the repetition of the output colors given before it, except when directly preceded by ""wif"" it only causes ""red"" to be repeated.",-0.9605838609465117,100,bluf
"Based on the examples, we can infer the following relationships between the input and the output:

- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" the same color as ""dax.""

When we look at the outputs, each time the word ""bluf"" appears, it results in two identical colors in the output. The color is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" If there is no word before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" produces the color green twice which we can infer might be a default color considering ""dax"" is also green and is the preceding word in other examples.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: when ""bluf"" is preceded by another word that corresponds to a color, it outputs that color twice. If ""bluf"" is not preceded by any color-specific word, then it defaults to ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, the color is green.",-1.0152936646631394,100,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce a rule for what ""bluf"" means. Here's what we can observe from the examples:

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"", ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" resulting in the term ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" stands alone after ""dax,"" it translates to ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""walm wif"" after ""dax,"" each word translates to ""green,"" with ""bluf"" ending the sequence with ""red red.""

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red"" when it is at the end of the sequence or immediately follows ""wif"".

2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the subsequent word is translated to ""blue.""
3. When ""wif"" is involved, it is always translated to ""red"" (unless ""zup"" is right before it).
4. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the subsequent word and ""walm"" itself are translated to ""green.""

From the above observations, the meanings associated with ""walm"" seem to be determined by the word that precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" enforces the color change of the subsequent word to match the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

Here is the observed pattern:

- ""zup"" is associated with yellow, so ""walm"" makes the following word and itself yellow, except when followed by ""wif.""
- ""lug"" is associated with blue, so ""walm"" makes the following word blue.
- ""dax"" is associated with green, so ""walm"" makes the following word and itself green.
- ""wif"" is associated with red, but ""walm"" does not influence it (it is not seen directly before ""walm"" in the examples).

Based on the above analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes itself and the following word to take on the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm"" with an exception for ""wif,"" which always outputs ""red.""

- Similarly, in the other examples, every time ""walm"" appears, the word that comes after ""walm"" (if any) is repeated in the output in the form of colors.
- Also, we can deduce that the color output pattern is consistent with individual words: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the color of the subsequent word in the output sequence:

From these examples, ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green,"" regardless of its position or the other words present. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> ""green""",-0.073418736064725,101,dax
"From the given examples, it is possible to infer that ""dax"" represents ""green."" To justify this deduction, let's examine the patterns present in the examples:

- ""lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue green."" ""Lug"" must mean ""blue,"" and so ""dax"" means ""green.""
- ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green."" Since ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" and ""walm"" appears three times, followed each time by ""red,"" it is likely that ""wif"" and ""walm"" represent ""red."" Here again, ""dax"" comes after ""walm"" and the sequence ends with ""green,"" implying ""dax"" means ""green.""
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green blue red."" In this case, ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" ""dax"" by ""green,"" and ""lug"" by ""blue,"" while ""wif"" follows with ""red."" Since ""walm"" is linked with a repetition of ""green,"" ""dax"" consistent with ""green"" aligns with previous observations.
- ""zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red green."" Here, ""zup"" matches with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""dax"" again with ""green.""
- ""wif dax zup dax"" corresponds to ""red green yellow green."" ""Wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" matches with ""green"" both times it appears.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's break down each given input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

2. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue

3. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue

4. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

Based on the outputs, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the colour associated with the word immediately preceding it. Looking at the examples:

- In the first and fifth examples, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats that as ""green.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" again repeats the ""blue.""
- In the third example, similar to the second example, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is positioned after ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow,"" and thus, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can establish the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the colour associated with the preceding word.",-0.10566974517224997,101,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the outputs corresponding to its presence in each input and see if there are any patterns or rules that can be discerned. Let's examine the examples provided:

- Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
- Input: wif lug bluf -> Output: red blue blue
- Input: zup lug bluf -> Output: yellow blue blue
- Input: wif zup bluf wif dax -> Output: red yellow yellow red green
- Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green

Based on the inputs and outputs, a pattern emerges suggesting that ""bluf"" repeats the color output related to the word that precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color green is repeated (green green). When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated (blue blue). ""Bluf"" does not have an output of its own but reflects the color associated with the preceding word.

Thus, the rule seems to be: 

Bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated in the output.

Rule: If ""X"" is the color associated with the word before ""bluf,"" the output after ""bluf"" will be ""X X.""",-0.12972964958041663,101,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the relationship between the inputs and the outputs. We can start by comparing the inputs that share common words and their associated outputs.

Looking at the 1st and the 5th inputs, which are identical (""dax bluf""), we can see they produce the same output (""green green""). This phenomenon suggests a direct relationship independent of context, as the repetition of the input leads to the repetition of the output.

When we examine inputs that contain the word ""bluf"" but differ in the other words, we still observe that the output always repeats a color twice consecutively when ""bluf"" is present.

Considering the examples:

1. ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green""
2. ""wif lug bluf"" leads to ""red blue blue""
3. ""zup lug bluf"" leads to ""yellow blue blue""
4. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" leads to ""red yellow yellow red green""

In each of these, the color that is doubled is always the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"":

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

When we look at the 4th input, where ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif dax"", the corresponding output is ""yellow yellow red green"". This gives us more information, as the ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"" is doubled, implying that ""bluf"" has caused the doubling, but ""wif dax"" that follows does not lead to further doubling.

From these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is present in the input, the color word corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is repeated twice in the output.

Thus:

bluf -> The rule is that the output repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"".",-0.23220353889527776,101,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's analyze the patterns in each example.

1. ""dax bluf"" produces ""green green"" - both words produce the same output.
2. ""wif lug bluf"" produces ""red blue blue"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it, here 'lug' -> 'blue'.
3. ""zup lug bluf"" produces ""yellow blue blue"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it again.
4. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" - The ""bluf"" after ""zup"" turns to ""yellow"" which is the color for ""zup"" and ""bluf"" after ""dax"" would be ""green"" because ""dax"" is ""green"".
5. ""dax bluf"" repeated from the first example, confirming the pattern.

Rule: bluf -> the word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.",-0.31549636673638876,101,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf."" Each example demonstrates that the occurrence of ""bluf"" repeats the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

- In the first and last example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and both times the output is ""green green,"" suggesting bluf causes the repetition of the color associated with ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the second example, ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" which means bluf again causes the repetition of the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.
- The third example is similar to the second, with ""lug"" followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in ""blue blue"" in the output, further supporting the aforementioned observation.
- The fourth example is more complex, but following each occurrence of ""bluf,"" the color that corresponds to the word before it is repeated: ""wif zup bluf wif"" leads to ""red yellow yellow red"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green"" which is then repeated immediately after with the presence of ""bluf.""

Based on the above observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",-0.6839148927793058,101,bluf
"Based on the given examples, ""walm"" appears to correspond directly to repeating the color associated with the previous word three times. The colors associated with other nonce words are as follows:

- lug -> blue (as ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"")
- dax -> green (as ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"")
- wif -> red (as ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""; ""wif"" is followed by three ""red"")
- zup -> yellow (as ""zup lug walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue"")

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" requires you to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. Thus, we can articulate the rule as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.2989450881238272,101,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns and differences in the input and output.

1. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output, followed by additional occurrences of ""blue"". So, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"".

2. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output, followed by an additional ""blue"" if ""lug"" appears after ""dax"".

3. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output, followed by additional ""blue"" if ""lug"" appears after ""zup"".

4. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. 

5. ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it in the string.

So, using the examples above, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the immediately preceding color word to be repeated three times. If there is no color word directly before ""walm,"" there is no example provided to establish what the behavior should be.

Rule: walm -> repeats the previous color word three times.",-0.8084485453987657,101,walm

Similarly, ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""dax"" is associated with green and is followed by one repetition, and ""lug"" is associated with blue and is followed by three repetitions.

"Based on the examples provided, the following observations can be made regarding the correlation between the input and output:

- Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output.
- The standalone presence of ""wif"" in the input results in only ""red"" in the output.
- The presence of ""wif"" followed by another word potentially adds additional colors corresponding to the following words, e.g., ""wif zup"" leads to ""red yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze the provided examples and identify any consistent patterns. We'll examine each example to see how ""zup"" influences the output.

- In the first example, ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Walm"" must mean ""yellow yellow yellow"" since ""lug"" means ""blue"" according to the last example.
- In the second example, ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red."" We cannot directly deduce what ""wif"" stands for, but ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" again.
- The third example, ""zup walm,"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which further reinforces that ""walm"" means ""yellow yellow yellow"" and ""zup"" leads with ""yellow.""
- The fourth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Since we've deduced ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" would correspond to ""green.""
- Finally, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" which means that the positioning of ""zup"" does not affect its meaning since it corresponds to ""yellow"" whether it's in the beginning or end.

Considering all this, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's look for patterns in the given input-to-output transformations. In each example, ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow"":

- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

"bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to depend on the preceding word. Here is the observed pattern:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color that ""dax"" stands for (green). Thus, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color that ""wif"" stands for (red). Thus, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let’s examine the contexts in which it appears:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   
We see ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" but when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" we get multiple ""blue"" before another color follows, suggesting ""walm"" may amplify or repeat the preceding color.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
Here ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""green"" being repeated.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
Once again, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""blue"" is repeated.

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   
In this string, every time we see a color name followed by ""walm,"" the preceding color is repeated multiple times. ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" without repetition when not followed by ""walm.""

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Notice that ""walm"" is following ""zup"" and the output is repeated ""yellow."" The output of ""zup bluf"" is ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" does not have a direct translation in the output string, ""zup"" preceding ""walm"" leads to repeating ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.",-0.09805238747717648,103,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

From the examples provided, the following observations can be made:

- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the corresponding output is three blues. 
- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is three greens.
- ""walm"" never appears as the first word in the input sequence so we don't know what color it represents by itself.

In the last example, ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word, but for the second instance of ""zup"", it does not have ""walm"" immediately following it and ""zup"" still outputs a yellow.

A possible rule that fits these observations is:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times, except for the last color in the sequence, which returns to the original color of the word before ""walm.""

So, walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. 

Rule: If the word before ""walm"" is A and results in color X, then ""A walm"" results in three instances of color X, with the exception of the sequence ending, where it returns to color X again after repeating three times or continues the pattern of the preceding colors if the sequence does not end.",-0.18288165658976469,103,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze how it affects the output in each given example. We can start by identifying the colors associated with other words we recognize.

In all examples except the last one, the appearance of ""walm"" leads to triple repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it:

1. lug -> blue, walm -> (triple blue), wif lug -> red blue
2. dax -> green, walm -> (triple green)
3. lug -> blue, walm -> (triple blue)
4. zup -> yellow, dax -> green, lug -> blue, walm -> (triple blue), zup lug -> yellow blue

The last example doesn't fit this pattern, and that's where the real rule becomes clear:

5. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" doesn't immediately follow a color word but is bordered by two instances of ""zup."" The repeated ""yellow"" before and after ""bluf"" indicates that ""bluf"" doesn't have a color output of its own but might indicate that ""zup"" should repeat an extra time before the sequence is complete. 

Based on this, ""walm"" likely means to repeat the color output of the last recognizable color word that occurred before ""walm,"" up to the number of times ""zup"" has occurred in that input series before ""walm.""

Rule: Walm -> A repeated sequence of the last color mentioned before ""walm,"" with the length of the sequence equal to the number of times ""zup"" has appeared before it. If ""zup"" has not appeared, the length defaults to three.",-0.46103999534823514,103,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it. It repeats the color three times, regardless of the previous word's actual color. We see this pattern consistently across all examples given:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and after ""walm,"" there are three instances of ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" preceding ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of ""green.""
- The singular ""lug walm"" example further supports this, with ""lug"" leading to three ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, the sequence ""zup dax lug walm"" shows ""lug"" before ""walm"" producing three ""blue,"" while not affecting ""zup"" and ""dax"" that precede it in the sequence.
- The last example seems to introduce a bit of an oddity since ""zup"" comes before ""walm."" However, we see no repetition after ""walm."" This might indicate that ""walm"" requires a specific context or a certain word (like ""lug"" or ""dax"") before it to trigger the threefold repetition. Without that context – for example, if the word ""bluf"" occurs before ""zup walm"" – ""walm"" does not trigger the repetition effect and instead seems to repeat the color associated with the word that comes just before ""walm.""

Rule: ""walm"" triggers three repetitions of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, provided that word is ""lug"" or ""dax"" (or potentially other words that are not given in these examples). If preceded by words like ""bluf,"" which perhaps do not have an associated color or are not part of the rule set walm interacts with, ""walm"" then repeats the color associated with the closest word that does fit the interaction rule, in this case, ""zup.""

Walm -> Meaning: Triggers threefold repetition of the associated color of the word immediately before it, under specific conditions.",-1.0519020909719996,103,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples and the outputs side by side.

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the word ""blue"" is repeated three times before a different color word appears in the output.
- ""Walm"" by itself after ""dax"" or ""lug"" results in the color that corresponds to the preceding word being repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows a sequence that includes ""zup"" and ""lug,"" it results in the color corresponding to ""lug"" being repeated, followed by ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the last word mentioned before it a number of times before possibly ending in a different color, specifically ""yellow"" if ""zup"" has been mentioned in the sequence previously.

"Given the examples, we are trying to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by analyzing its placement and the corresponding outputs. Let's start by looking at each example:

1. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green

2. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue

3. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

4. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

5. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red

Looking at examples 1 and 5, ""dax"" appears in different positions. Example 5 suggests that ""dax"" can't simply translate to a static color because when ""dax"" comes after ""lug"", the output becomes blue, but when it comes before ""lug"", the output for ""lug"" is different (green).

Example 2 suggests that ""dax"" translates to green when it is the first word in the sequence, considering that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" translate to green.

In examples 3 and 4, ""dax"" follows the words ""wif"" and ""bluf"", and the corresponding outputs are red and red, but ""dax"" leads to green in both cases despite the distinct words preceding it.

From the evidence provided, one potential rule could be that ""dax"" translates to green independent of its position or the other words around it. However, this rule would not explain why ""dax lug"" leads to green blue, whereas ""lug"" in a different context (example 2, as the third word) is blue.

Let's test this rule by assuming ""dax"" is always green:
- Example 1: ""wif"" must then mean red, and ""zup"" would be yellow.
- Example 2: This holds, as dax walm lug translates to green green green blue, meaning ""walm"" also translates to green and ""lug"" to blue when it is the last word.
- Example 3: This still holds, as ""wif"" meaning red aligns with the first output, and ""bluf"" corresponds to green.
- Example 4: ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is still red even though it was green before (this contradicts our prior inference and is problematic for a static meaning for ""bluf""), but ""dax"" is still green.
- Example 5: ""lug"" here is blue, which is inconsistent with example 2's output if ""lug"" has a static meaning, but ""dax"" is still green as the first word, ""bluf"" switches to blue, and ""wif"" returns to red.

After considering the examples, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" translates to green, with the caveat that other words may not have a fixed color and instead change based on their position or the words around them. The significance of ""lug"" seems to change, perhaps taking the color blue when it is the last word in the sequence or is directly preceded by ""dax"". ""Bluf"" appears green or red, which suggests that its color might also depend on position or context.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.07351903215762023,104,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in its usage across different examples. We need to identify what is constant and what changes when ""dax"" appears in different positions or alongside different words.

Here are the given examples with ""dax"" and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green

2. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue

3. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

4. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

5. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red

Analyzing the examples:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""dax"" directly follows ""wif"" and leads to ""green"" in the output. 
- In examples 2 and 5, ""dax"" is the first word and it still leads to ""green"" in the output.
- In example 4, ""dax"" is the last word, and it also leads to ""green"" in the output.

From the consistent output associated with ""dax,"" we can see that every instance of ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that come before or after it. 

Hence, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.07601013167486075,104,dax
"To induce the rule, we should look at the position and sequence of the word ""dax"" and how it corresponds to the colors in the output. 

For the first input, ""dax"" occurs twice and the word ""zup"" is in between, which might be important. The output shows the same color ""green"" for both instances of ""dax,"" indicating that ""zup"" does not affect the meaning of ""dax.""

In the second input, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" at the beginning of the sequence. The same is true for the third and fourth examples.

The last example has ""dax"" at the beginning followed by ""lug"" and ""bluf"" before ""wif"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""bluf"" to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".

Analyzing all examples, it appears ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of position or surrounding words. Therefore, the simplest rule that can be induced from these examples is:

To support this, let's analyze the examples:

Example 1:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: The word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to yellow), and the output repeats ""yellow"" three times after ""zup."" Yellow might be considered the third color in some ordering (possibly after red and green).

Example 2:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Explanation: The word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which translates to red), and the output is red said three times. This implies that red could be the first color in the ordering.

Example 3:
Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
Explanation: Here ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and again yellow is repeated three times. ""Wif"" (red) at the end appears only once, confirming that ""walm"" does not affect words after it.

Example 4:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Explanation: ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" (which translates to green), and the output is green said three times. Green being the second color in the ordering.

Example 5:
Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), causing yellow to be repeated three times.

Judging from these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" duplicates the color associated with the word that precedes it, with the number of repetitions being based on the presumed order of colors. The sequence of colors may be following the order red (1 repetition), green (2 repetitions), yellow (3 repetitions), but this rule doesn't account for blue (which should follow green in RGB order).

However, based on the examples given, it would be impossible to deduce the specific order intended without further information or examples. For now, with the limited dataset and pattern given, the best I can determine is the following:

3. Input: dax zup walm wif

4. Input: dax walm

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm

- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Now, let's spot the pattern for ""walm."" In every case, ""walm"" takes on the color of the word right before it:

"Based on the given examples, ""dax"" seems to be a signal word that triggers a color sequence, always starting with ""green."" Following ""dax,"" each subsequent word appears to be associated with a specific color:

- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" and ""walm"" appear to be instructions to repeat the color that follows them a certain number of times. In the given context, ""wif"" is not directly followed by a color, but it seems to indicate a repetition of one instance of the color. ""walm"" consistently precedes a color word and causes that color to be repeated three times.

4. ""wif"" has shown up only once without a corresponding color, so we do not have enough information to assign a color to it.
5. ""walm"" apparently duplicates the color that comes directly after it, meaning if ""walm"" follows any color-denoting word, the output will repeat that color's name multiple times.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's examine each instance where it appears and identify any patterns:

"To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine the patterns before and after ""walm"" in the input and compare them to the output.

In the first example, ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow"". ""Lug"" translates to blue and ""zup"" to yellow. What's interesting here is that instead of getting one instance of blue in the output, we have it appearing three times before a yellow appears.

In the second example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", which implies that after ""zup"", we have three instances of yellow.

In the third example, ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red"". ""Dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red. Here, ""walm"" seems to multiply the color red three times in the output.

In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" becomes ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". Each color appears once before ""walm"" and then the last color before ""walm"" (""lug"" which is blue) appears three times in the output after ""walm"".

In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red"". Here ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" which is green, and in the output, green appears three times.

From these examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" has the rule of repeating the last mentioned color three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color three times.",-0.08220916850149425,105,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to result in multiple occurrences of the color word that directly follows it in each input. Here is the breakdown of each example and how ""walm"" affects the output:

- In the first example, ""lug walm zup"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the next color word ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"") to repeat thrice before showing up as ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" makes ""zup"" (""yellow"") repeat three times.

- In the third example, ""dax lug wif walm"" leads to ""green blue red red red."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat.

- In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" gives us ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" which means ""walm"" caused ""lug"" (""blue"") to repeat, coming after ""bluf.""

- The fifth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" results in ""yellow green green green blue red."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeating, followed by ""lug"" (""blue"") and ""wif"" (""red"").

From these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately following it to repeat three times before moving to the next color. Thus:

walm -> Causes the next color word to repeat three times.

Rule: If ""walm"" precedes a color term corresponding to a standard color word like ""zup"" (yellow), ""lug"" (blue), ""dax"" (green), etc., the output repeats the color word that corresponds to that term three times before continuing with the rest of the sequence.",-0.08416500640351728,105,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us look at each input and their corresponding output and try to identify patterns:

1. lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   
2. zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
3. dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   
4. wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
5. zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

If we match each output color to the corresponding input word:

- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red.""

Now let's examine ""walm"" related patterns:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output for ""walm"" is additional ""blue"" words.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output for ""walm"" is additional ""yellow"" words.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""lug,"" the output for ""walm"" is additional ""green"" and ""blue"" words respectively.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""lug,"" the output for ""walm"" is additional ""blue"" words.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""dax,"" the output for ""walm"" is additional ""green"" words.

It seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color word preceding it:

- In example 1, ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm,"" which outputs additional ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""walm,"" which results in additional ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm,"" resulting in additional ""red.""
- In example 4, ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm,"" resulting in additional ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm,"" resulting in additional ""green.""

Based on this pattern, the rule of ""walm"" seems to be to repeat the output of the last color word that precedes it multiple times (in most cases three times, but twice when following ""lug"").

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output of the word preceding it multiple times.",-0.09484790314363223,105,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and outputs systematically:

1. lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

2. zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

3. dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

4. wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

5. zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red

By comparing the outputs with the input strings:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

""Walm"" seems to result in a repeated color, but the number of repetitions and the color depend on the word before ""walm."" 

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color is blue and repeats three times, except in case 4, where ""lug"" is not directly before ""walm,"" hence the word ""walm"" doesn't affect it.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color is yellow and repeats three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color is green and repeats three times, as seen in example 5.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color is red and repeats three times, as seen in example 3.

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""Walm"" causes the last color word before it to be repeated three more times.

Thus, we can write it as follows:

walm -> Rule: Repeat the previous color three additional times.",-0.11268343093804599,105,walm
"Rule: The nonce word walm seems to mean ""repeat the color associated with the previously mentioned color word."" 

Examples:

- In ""lug walm zup,"" lug corresponds to blue, thus walm causes the repetition of blue, and zup adds yellow.
- In ""zup walm,"" zup equals yellow, and walm repeats yellow.
- In ""dax lug wif walm,"" we have green, blue, red, and then walm repeats red three times, indicating that the word before it was repeated thrice.
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" the pattern is red, yellow, blue, blue, and then walm causes the repetition of blue twice.
- In ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" we see yellow, green, walm repeats green two more times, and then follows the pattern of blue and red.

Therefore, the rule for walm seems to dictate that it repeats the color output associated with the word before it the same number of times as the word has been mentioned in the sequence before walm. 

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word the number of times it has appeared prior to walm.",-1.6085435237508916,105,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can see that every time ""lug"" is used in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. Its position in the input does not appear to affect its corresponding position in the output since ""lug"" comes before ""dax"" and after ""zup"" but still translates to ""blue"" each time. Additionally, given that each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" it suggests that individual words are being directly translated to colors.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue",-1.056654736205,106,lug

- walm -> yellow (since ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" and we know the first four colors corresponding to the first four words)

Now, given these associations, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"":

""lug wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" (yellow) and follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in the output ""green.""

3. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif -> Output: red red blue green red
4. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
5. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red

First, let's identify the color that each word seems to correspond with:
- ""dax"" corresponds with the color ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds with the color ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds with the color ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds with the color ""blue""

Given the above associations, let's look at when ""bluf"" is used:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might repeat the color of the word before it.
2. After ""wif bluf"" in the third and fifth examples, the color ""red"" is repeated. Again, this reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.
3. In the input where ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated in the fourth example.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-0.11470890917332503,106,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's compare the usage of ""bluf"" in the different inputs with the respective outputs:

1. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green""

3. ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" results in ""red red blue green red""
4. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow""
5. ""zup wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red red""

Looking at the patterns, the word ""bluf"" does not always correspond to the same color output. When ""bluf"" is used after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" meaning the color ""green"" is repeated. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red,"" so once again, we see the preceding color repeated. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" resulting in an additional ""yellow,"" the same color as ""zup."" Lastly, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again which results in ""red red"" in the output.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it. If we turn this observation into a rule, we can state the following:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word that precedes ""bluf.""",-0.17512912390874996,106,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can induce a rule about the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" It seems that ""bluf"" translates to a color, but not just any color. It appears to represent the color of the word that is immediately preceding it.

Here's how we can observe this:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" followed ""dax,"" and the output for both was ""green green.""
- In the second example, it was the same case: ""dax bluf"" mapped to ""green green.""
- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" mapped to ""red red blue green red,"" meaning that ""bluf"" took the color of the preceding word ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translated to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow,"" indicating again that ""bluf"" took the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif bluf"" mapped to ""yellow red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" followed ""wif"" and both translated to ""red.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

- When ""dax bluf"" appears, the output is ""green green"". Since the presence of ""dax"" by itself corresponds to ""green"", the repetition of ""green"" in the output suggests that ""bluf"" may mean ""repeat the previous color"".
- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"", the output corresponding to the segment ""wif bluf"" is ""red red"". Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", this reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" prompts a repetition of the previous color.
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"", the presence of ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"" in the output. Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" seems to cause the previous color (""yellow"") to be repeated.
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif bluf"", the output following ""wif bluf"" is ""red red"". Since ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"", ""bluf"" once more appears to result in the repetition of the previous color.

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red,"" which is the same color associated with ""wif"".

- 'wif' is followed by 'lug' and correlates with 'red' being followed by 'blue'.

- 'dax' correlates with 'green', 'lug' with 'blue' again, and 'wif' seems to repeat 'red' for every word that follows it including itself ('walm' has no previous correlation, so we attribute 'red' to 'wif').

Rule:
Based on these observations, 'wif' correlates directly with 'red'. It also appears that when 'wif' is followed by another word, it causes that word to also correspond with 'red', except when the following word has a previously established correlation (like 'dax' correlating with 'green').

- When ""dax walm wif dax"" is given, the output is ""green green green red green."" The pattern is consistent with ""walm"" repeating the color for ""dax,"" which is green, three times.
- When ""zup wif walm"" is given, the output is ""yellow red red red."" The placement of ""walm"" at the end results in three repetitions of ""red,"" the color that corresponds to ""wif"".
- When ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" is given, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here again, ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""yellow,"" the color for ""zup,"" preceding the pattern for ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" followed by ""wif"" and ""bluf"" which correspond to ""red red.""

Based on these patterns, ""walm"" appears to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.0869517717148276,107,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare inputs with their corresponding outputs and identify the patterns where ""walm"" appears.

From the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which implies that ""walm"" might mean ""yellow,"" but to confirm, we need to evaluate other examples.

2. ""dax walm wif zup"" translates to ""green green green red yellow,"" and compared to the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow"" in the output again, providing further evidence that ""walm"" might mean ""yellow.""

3. ""dax walm wif dax"" translates to ""green green green red green."" Again, the ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" here, but we have previously seen ""dax"" correspond to ""green"" as well. If ""dax"" also means ""green,"" this supports the idea that ""walm"" is not ""green"" but likely ""yellow,"" since ""wif"" seems to mean ""red.""

4. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" In this example, ""walm"" does not correspond to any visible colour in the output, since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" If ""walm"" meant ""yellow,"" we would expect an extra ""yellow"" in the output, which is not there. This suggests that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the preceding color word in the output.

5. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here, ""walm"" once again leads to repetition of ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with the preceding word ""zup.""

Given the patterns from the examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times in the output. 

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.",-0.09951789735896555,107,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's take a closer look at each example and identify patterns:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow""
3. ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""
4. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
5. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""

Observations:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears directly after ""zup,"" it outputs ""yellow yellow yellow."" This seems to imply that ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the output pattern doesn't follow the same repetition of three. However, ""dax"" leads to ""green"" output every time it appears.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated twice, as seen in example 4. ""wif"" precedes ""red"" output in other examples, adjusting for position.

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""walm"" appears to mean repetition of the preceding color, but the number of repetitions varies:

- After ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" ""walm"" causes a triple repetition.
- After ""wif,"" which outputs ""red,"" ""walm"" causes a double repetition.
- After ""dax,"" if we account for the order, the repetition is not obvious unless there's an implicit pattern that accounts for the presence of other words.

- 'lug' appears twice and each time is followed by 'blue' in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" from the given examples, let's closely examine the input-output pairs:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green.""

2. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   - The presence of ""zup"" results in ""yellow."" When ""dax"" follows, the output is ""green.""

3. Input: dax lug dax lug wif
   Output: green blue green blue red
   - The pattern here shows that ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

4. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" seems to result in ""green"" as well, indicating that ""dax"" consistently means ""green.""

5. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" once more, ""wif"" to ""red,"" and the addition of ""zup"" at the end translates to ""yellow.""

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that ""dax"" always translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.05943156498048611,109,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" one must examine each example and the associated output. Let's go through the inputs and their corresponding outputs, and see if we can find a pattern:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - When the input is only ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

2. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   - When ""zup"" is before ""dax,"" it seems to produce ""yellow"" before ""green."" 

3. Input: dax lug dax lug wif
   Output: green blue green blue red
   - ""dax"" consistently produces ""green."" The word ""lug"" seems to produce ""blue,"" and ""wif"" produces ""red.""

4. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green
   - Again, ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" and ""dax"" produces ""green."" ""Bluf"" is not in the input, but its position after ""dax"" in the output suggests it might be related to the word ""dax.""

5. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""walm"" does not have a clear output, but it could potentially be producing ""green"" similarly to ""dax.""

Based on the outputs associated with each appearance of ""dax,"" it seems that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Also, based on example 4, it's possible that ""bluf"" could be a modifier that repeats the color of the previous word, although we do not have sufficient data points to confirm this. It is worth noting as a hypothesis that may require further examples to validate. However, based on the data provided, we can determine the following:

"Reviewing the provided examples, I'll analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"". It appears that each nonce word in the input is matched with a color in the output. Here's the analysis for each unique word:

- Every instance of ""dax"" is translated to ""green"".
- The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" aligns with ""red"".
- ""bluf"" has an extra ""f"" compared to ""blue""; since it outputs ""green"" just like ""dax"", it seems like an error or a special case where ""bluf"" should have translated to ""blue"" to be consistent. 
- ""walm"" isn't directly translated, but given that it appears once and leads to ""green,"" it either means ""green"" like ""dax"", or it can be assumed to be a synonym.

Given this analysis, we can come up with the following rule or meaning for ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green.

However, there is an inconsistency with ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" should indeed be ""blue"", then its output as ""green"" is an error, and the rule remains the same.

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm

   Analysis: 'wif' maps to 'red', 'dax' maps to 'green', but 'walm' does not appear elsewhere to ascertain its meaning.

2. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red
   Analysis: 'lug' maps to 'blue', 'wif' maps to 'red'. Since 'bluf' is surrounded by 'wif' and outputs red, this doesn't give any additional information about 'bluf' apart from it also mapping to 'red' in this instance.

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Analysis: 'dax' maps to 'green', 'zup' maps to 'yellow'. Since 'bluf' appears after 'zup' and the output is yellow, this might suggest that 'bluf' repeats the color of the word before it.

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   Analysis: 'dax' maps to 'green', 'wif' maps to 'red', 'zup' maps to 'yellow'. The occurrence of 'bluf' after 'dax' corresponds with another 'green', supporting the hypothesis that 'bluf' repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   Analysis: 'wif' maps to 'red', 'dax' maps to 'green', and 'bluf' follows 'dax' with the output also being green. This continues to support the hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' takes the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: 'bluf' repeats the color of the preceding word.",-0.06241859362086363,109,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples, let's try to understand the correspondence between the inputs and outputs:

Input: `wif bluf dax walm`
Output: `red red green green green`

Input: `lug wif bluf lug wif`
Output: `blue red red blue red`

Input: `dax zup bluf`
Output: `green yellow yellow`

Input: `dax bluf wif zup wif`
Output: `green green red yellow red`

Input: `wif dax bluf`
Output: `red green green`

To start with, we notice that `bluf` appears in every input, and in each case, the output immediately following `bluf` is a repetition of the color word that came immediately before it. 

1. In the first input, `bluf` comes after `wif` and the corresponding output repeats ""red.""
2. In the second input, `bluf` follows `wif` again and the output is ""red red"".
3. In the third input, `bluf` follows `zup` and the output is ""yellow yellow.""
4. In the fourth input, `bluf` follows `dax` and the output is ""green green.""
5. In the fifth input, `bluf` follows `dax` and the output is ""green green.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" acts as a command or function that repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: `bluf` -> Repeats the color of the preceding word.",-0.11600034886001138,109,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), the following word is ""green"":
  - Example: wif bluf dax -> red green green
  - Example: wif dax bluf -> red green green

- When ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" (red), it is itself ""green"":
  - Example: dax bluf wif -> green green red

- When ""bluf"" is not combined with ""wif,"" it results in ""yellow"":
  - Example: dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
  - Example: dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" follows a rule where its output color is influenced by its position relative to ""wif"". Specifically:

- ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when next to ""wif"" (either before or after).
- ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when not next to ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""green"" when adjacent to ""wif""; ""bluf"" -> ""yellow"" otherwise.",-1.0299208043209094,109,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how the rule works:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is ""green green.""
- In the third example ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows it with ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" follows it with ""green.""

Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: bluf repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: If X is a word that corresponds to a color, and ""bluf"" follows X, then the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the output for X.",-1.202883864372727,109,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we see that:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it produces ""green"" in the output.
- It does not depend on the position of ""bluf"" within the input.
- The presence of other words (""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup"") produces different colors, demonstrating that ""bluf"" is not influenced by adjacent words.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
bluf -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs.",-1.2170205707756823,109,bluf
"From the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" correlates to multiple repeating outputs, specifically of the color that precedes it. Let's examine each example to deduce the rule:

1. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it is followed by ""walm"" which results in three ""yellow"" outputs in a row.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and it is followed by ""walm"" which results in three ""red"" outputs in a row.

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""walm"" which results in three ""red"" outputs in a row.

4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   Both instances of ""wif walm"" result in three ""red"" outputs in a row, maintaining consistency with the previously observed pattern.

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it is followed by ""walm"" which results in three ""yellow"" outputs in a row.

Based on the observed pattern in the examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the output to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it three times. Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",-0.07490245137389362,109,walm
"Analyzing the provided input-output pairs:

1. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Let's try to determine the rule for ""walm"":

- The first output following ""walm"" is always a repetition of the color word before ""walm"". 
- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated as ""yellow"", so ""walm"" causes another ""yellow"" to appear in the output.
- In the second and third examples, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated as ""red"", so ""walm"" causes additional ""red"" colors to be in the output.
- The fourth and fifth examples support this as well, with ""walm"" being preceded by ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red) respectively, and the outputs following ""walm"" containing repetitions of ""yellow"" and ""red"".

Taking all the examples into account, it can be deduced that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color term that immediately precedes it.

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color word before ""walm"".",-0.07618777533614893,109,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can look for patterns to determine the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm."" Let's go through the examples and outputs to identify consistent patterns:

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- Here walm is followed by ""lug"", and ""lug"" translates to blue at the end.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""walm"" comes at the end and translates to three instances of red.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which is green at the end.

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
- Each ""walm"" is followed by reds, but the number seems to be influenced by the preceding word. 
- In this case ""wif walm"" translates to red red red, just like in the previous examples.
- It also implies that ""walm"" does not necessarily affect the words that follow it because ""lug"" and ""zup"" still translate to blue and yellow respectively.

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- Here, ""zup walm"" translates to yellow yellow yellow, paralleling the first example, and ""lug"" at the end translates to blue.

From these examples, we can derive the following rule for ""walm"":
- Whenever ""walm"" appears after a word, it generates a sequence of colors. This sequence begins with a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word and is followed by the color associated with the next word. The exception is when ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, in which case it seems to generate a repeated sequence of the color that would be associated with ""wif"" (since ""wif"" by itself translates to red).

Let's take a closer look at the examples to confirm:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue. ""Walm"" generates three yellows before we see the blue from ""lug.""
- All instances where ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" lead to a sequence of reds, and ""wif"" alone corresponds to red.
- Even when ""walm"" is followed by another word, it does not impact the color associated with the next word in the sequence (as seen with ""zup"" after ""walm,"" it still translates to yellow).
- The number of reds generated by ""walm"" at the end suggests the rule: when ""walm"" is at the end, it takes on the repetition pattern for red, as if a ""wif"" preceded it (hence, red red red).

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:
- ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it, with the number of repetitions determined by that preceding word's rule. It is then followed by the color associated with the next word, which is not affected by ""walm."" When ""walm"" is the last word, it defaults to a series of red, as if preceded by the word ""wif.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word, finishing with the color of the following word, or red if it's the last word in the sequence.",-0.08092661649414891,109,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" has a transformative effect on the words that come before it, converting them into a sequence of output colors. To delineate this rule, let's examine the pattern in each example:

- Example 1:
  Input: zup walm lug
  Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
  Here, ""zup"" that comes before ""walm"" transforms into ""yellow yellow yellow"", and ""lug"" after ""walm"" translates directly to ""blue"".

- Example 2:
  Input: zup bluf wif walm
  Output: yellow yellow red red red
  In this case, ""zup"" and ""wif"" come before ""walm"" and are transformed into sequences: ""zup"" becomes ""yellow yellow"" and ""wif"" becomes ""red red red"".

- Example 3:
  Input: wif walm dax
  Output: red red red green
  Here, ""wif"" before ""walm"" turns into ""red red red"", and ""dax"" after ""walm"" stands for ""green"".

- Example 4:
  Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
  Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
  For this example, each occurrence of ""walm"" transforms the preceding words (""wif"" and ""zup"") into a sequence of colors before switching back to single color outputs after ""walm"" (""lug"" is ""blue"") until ""walm"" appears again.

- Example 5:
  Input: lug zup walm lug
  Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  In this last example, both ""lug"" and ""zup"" before ""walm"" turn into a sequence with ""yellow"" (""zup"" transformed) in between identical colors (""blue"" for ""lug"").

From these examples, let's derive the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""Walm"" transforms the preceding word(s) into a sequence of colors in the output, each corresponding to the color associated with the input word, repeated as many times as the position of the input word before ""walm"". Words after ""walm"" are output as a single color corresponding to each word.

Therefore, we can describe ""walm"" as:

walm -> Transforms preceding words into sequences of output colors, with repetition count based on word position before ""walm"". Words after ""walm"" are unchanged.",-0.08782925532904252,109,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" does not correspond directly to a single color, but rather increases the number of times the color associated with the preceding word is mentioned in the output. Here is the rule I deduced for ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" appears after the word ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is said three times (since ""zup"" alone translates to yellow).
- When ""walm"" appears after the word ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times instead of once (since ""wif"" alone translates to red).
- When ""walm"" is not preceded by ""zup"" or ""wif,"" it is not clear what the rule is for ""walm,"" as those are the only two cases demonstrated.

Hence, the rule seems to be that “walm” causes the output color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will analyze each input and its corresponding output, focusing on the consistent patterns that emerge around the use of the word ""bluf.""

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and the output is ""red red"". This might suggest that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   - In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" but the output following ""bluf"" is ""green green,"" it reinforces the concept that ""bluf"" might cause repetition, as ""green"" is repeated here.

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - The word ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""wif."" Both ""yellow"" and ""red"" are repeated in the output, and since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" this supports the idea that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat.

4. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   - In this example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax."" ""Green"" is the color associated with ""dax"" and is repeated once again in the output. The sequence ""bluf zup dax"" results in ""green yellow green,"" suggesting continuity in the rule of repetition.

5. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   - Here, ""bluf"" is following ""wif,"" and once again, there is a repetition of ""red"" in the output. The continuity of red following ""bluf"" further cements the repetition interpretation.

Putting together these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word that precedes it to be repeated in the output sequence.

Therefore, the meaning is:
bluf -> causes the repetition of the color of the preceding word.",-0.0738823171269149,110,bluf

"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence.

Example analysis:
1. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   (walm follows lug, which is blue, so walm is blue)

2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug

   (walm follows lug, which is blue, so walm is blue)",-0.06978848421926315,110,walm
"Analyzing the outputs alongside their corresponding inputs, the word 'walm' consistently results in the word 'blue'. It's important to note that in the input, 'walm' is always preceded by different combinations of words ('lug', 'zup', 'wif', 'dax'), but regardless of the preceding words, the output for 'walm' remains 'blue'.

Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""; 'walm' corresponds to the second 'blue'.
- In the second example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" becomes ""yellow red green green green blue""; 'walm' corresponds to the last 'blue'.
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" turns into ""red red red""; 'walm' corresponds to the last 'red', however, since it's the only word repeated thrice, it might seem like 'walm' means 'red' or repetition. But comparing with other examples, it is more plausible that 'walm' means 'blue', and 'wif' means 'red'.
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green""; the absence of a 'blue' despite 'walm' being present might initially seem confusing. However, upon closer inspection, we see there is one 'green' more than the input, suggesting that 'walm' is indeed 'blue', but due to some printing or transcription error, 'green' was produced instead.
- In the fifth example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue""; 'walm' corresponds to the last two instances of 'blue'.

Given the above examples, one can deduce that regardless of the placement or surrounding words, 'walm' translates to 'blue'. To be cautious of any potential anomalies (such as in the fourth example), the deduction is taken from the majority of consistent results.

Rule: walm -> blue",-0.07114290186094738,110,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each input/output pair to see what transforms into what. After each example, there's a brief analysis:

1. `lug walm zup lug zup wif` -> `blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red`
   
   When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated once. Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word just before it.

2. `zup wif dax walm lug` -> `yellow red green green green blue`
   
   Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and before ""lug,"" ""green"" is repeated. ""walm"" appears to be doing the same as in the first example: repeating the color of the word before it.

3. `wif walm` -> `red red red`
   
   In this example, there are no words after ""walm,"" but ""walm"" is causing ""red,"" which is the color for ""wif,"" to be repeated. This supports the hypothesis from the previous examples.

4. `zup wif dax walm` -> `yellow red green green green`
   
   Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and ""green"" is repeated.

5. `dax lug dax lug walm` -> `green blue green blue blue blue`

   ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""blue"" is repeated once. This also fits the previous pattern.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:
Walm repeats the color associated with the word before it.",-0.08221855249403162,110,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll analyze its occurrence and the corresponding outputs in each example. Let's examine each instance where ""walm"" appears and the output that follows.

In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""zup."" It resulted in a sequence where ""walm"" maps to ""blue blue blue.""

- Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
- Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, preceded by ""dax"" and does not have a word following it. The output related to ""walm"" is ""green green green.""

- Input: zup wif dax walm lug
- Output: yellow red green green green blue

In the third example, ""walm"" is again at the end of the sequence, and it's preceded by ""wif."" The output is ""red red red.""

- Input: wif walm
- Output: red red red

In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is once again ""green green green.""

- Input: zup wif dax walm
- Output: yellow red green green green

In the fifth example, ""walm"" appears at the end, after a sequence of ""lug"" and ""dax"" pairs, with the last ""lug"" being directly before ""walm."" The output is ""blue blue blue.""

- Input: dax lug dax lug walm
- Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Rule:
Observing the patterns above, one consistent factor is that when ""walm"" appears, it is associated with three repeated color outputs, which are the same as the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" Based on the available examples, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> It repeats the color output of the word that precedes it three times.

Using this rule, ""walm"" translates as follows:
- After ""lug"" (which maps to ""blue""), ""walm"" means ""blue blue blue"".
- After ""dax"" (which maps to ""green""), ""walm"" means ""green green green"".
- After ""wif"" (which maps to ""red""), ""walm"" means ""red red red"". 

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" depends on the context, specifically the word that comes before it.",-0.08331565262157896,110,walm
"Reviewing the input and output sequences provided, let's try to deduce a pattern about the word ""walm."" To do this, it's helpful to compare contexts where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. lug walm -> blue blue
   - The sequence ""lug walm"" translates to two blues.

2. dax walm -> green green
   - The sequence ""dax walm"" translates to two greens.

3. wif walm -> red red
   - The sequence ""wif walm"" translates to two reds.

Consistently, ""walm"" appears to duplicate the color linked with the word immediately preceding it. In every case, the color that follows ""walm"" is a repeat of the color that was mapped from the word right before ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it.

"Given the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" refers to a color, but we also need to consider how it affects the following words. 

In the first two examples, we notice that ""dax"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""walm"", and in both cases, ""zup"" equates to yellow and ""walm"" equates to green. The colors that follow ""dax"" in both cases also adopt the color green, suggesting that ""dax"" might set a rule for following colors to be green.

However, in the third example, ""dax"" comes after ""bluf"", yet the output is still green, which does not change the color that follows.

The fourth example confirms that the presence of ""dax"" turns following colors into green because ""lug walm"" both turn out to be blue but are green after ""dax"".

Lastly, when ""dax"" stands alone, the output is green, which implies that the inherent color represented by ""dax"" is green.

The rule seems to be that ""dax"" represents the color green, and when used in a sequence before other words representing colors, it turns those following words into the color green until a sequence or input ends.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

4. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

From examples 1 and 2, ""dax walm"" consistently results in ""green green green,"" suggesting that the presence of ""dax"" preceding ""walm"" correlates with a green output. However, examples 3 to 5 show that introducing other words before ""walm"" changes the output colors.

In example 3, ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in an output of ""green red red red,"" where only the first color is green, and the rest are red.

Example 4 further suggests that the word ""walm"" alone does not determine the output color but its combination with other words prior to it does. The word ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" and the output is all red except for the last word, which is yellow.

Finally, example 5 has the word ""zup"" before and after ""walm,"" with other words in between. It leads to an output where ""zup"" correlates with yellow, except when followed by ""walm,"" where it results in two yellows and a blue for ""bluf,"" which follows the pattern where ""walm"" affects the output colors of the words that come before it.

Based on the outputs, ""walm"" seems to function as a rule that transforms the preceding words into a color pattern. However, without an explicit rule regarding how ""walm"" translates into those specific colors for each input word, the best we can deduce is:

Rule: ""walm"" changes the output colors of words that come before it, with the specific pattern depending on the combination of the preceding words and possibly their position relative to ""walm."" The consistent factor is that ""walm"" does not correspond to a single color but affects the patterning of the color output.",-0.09012290447230765,111,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to simulate a rule that influences the color output according to its position relative to other words. Let's examine each case:

1. ""dax walm"" consistently results in ""green green green,"" which implies that the combination of ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" produces a repeated color pattern, potentially influenced by ""dax"" or by ""walm"" following any word.

2. When ""wif"" is introduced before ""walm"" in ""dax wif walm,"" the output changes entirely to ""green red red red,"" suggesting that the introduction of ""wif"" before ""walm"" changes the output color pattern and possibly overrides the color that ""walm"" would produce alone or in conjunction with ""dax.""

3. ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow,"" which indicates that ""walm"" positioned before ""zup"" has an effect on the output, changing the latter pattern to include ""yellow."" This might also mean the ""walm"" modifies the color outcome depending on what follows it.

4. For ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, following ""zup,"" and the pattern is primarily yellow, just like the output before ""walm"" is introduced.

Piecing these observations together leads to the following potential rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" is a modifier word that changes the color output to green when it directly follows ""dax,"" to red when it is preceded by ""wif,"" or to yellow when it comes after ""zup."" Its influence depends on its position and the context of surrounding words, but it consistently influences the output by generating green, red, or yellow based on the word that immediately precedes it. However, it might have a default color (potentially yellow) when its output cannot be otherwise determined from the previous words. 

Given the examples, we cannot be sure of its effect when following any new words or in a different context; thus, its behavior can be summarized as follows with the available data:

walm -> Rule: ""walm"" changes the output color based on the preceding word: green after ""dax,"" red after ""wif,"" and defaults to yellow, especially after ""zup.""",-0.2768881843013333,111,walm

Lastly, in ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"", and ""lug"" is blue and yellow respectively, and ""walm"" repeats the color of the last mentioned color which is yellow.

3. When 'walm' follows 'dax', 'green' is repeated three times, regardless of whether 'wif' is also present.
4. When 'walm' follows 'wif', 'red' is repeated for as many syllables are in words preceding 'walm'.
5. When 'walm' follows 'zup', 'yellow' is repeated for as many syllables are in words preceding 'walm'.

Considering these patterns, 'walm' seems to trigger a rule where it repeats the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word the number of times equal to the total syllable count of all the words before 'walm'. However, note that in the final example, even though 'walm' follows 'zup', the output is six consecutive 'yellow' not matching the exact number of syllables from preceding words. There might be an additional rule about repeating the color corresponding to the last unique word before 'walm'.

Therefore, the tentative rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word directly before 'walm' as many times as the total number of syllables in all the words before 'walm'. If that word appears multiple times, repetition is tied to the immediate mention of that word before 'walm'.

Note: The rule is not definitive and may require further examples to solidify the understanding of 'walm'.",-1.0659721237410256,111,walm

Examples:
- In ""dax bluf zup,"" zup corresponds to yellow because it is at the end.
- In ""lug dax zup wif,"" zup precedes wif, which corresponds to red, but zup itself corresponds to yellow again.
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" the first 'zup' precedes 'lug,' which corresponds to blue, the second 'zup' precedes 'walm,' which corresponds to yellow, and so on, but each 'zup' itself corresponds to the color yellow.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze each example and output pair:

1. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   
   In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Given that ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of ""red"" before ""blue,"" it suggests ""bluf"" may mean ""red"" or echo the previous color.

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""bluf,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated. This again suggests that ""bluf"" could mean repeating the previous color.

3. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   
   In this sequence, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after it, ""bluf"" results in another ""green."" This reinforcement suggests ""bluf"" continues to mean repeating the previous color since ""green"" is repeated.

4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow
   
   Again, following ""bluf,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated, which aligns with the pattern we've been observing.

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   
   ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" results in another ""red.""

From these examples, we can deduce that the definition of ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> means repeat the previous color.",-0.07809875999154878,112,bluf
"Observing the provided input-output pairs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf."" The word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""red"" except when it is the last word in a sequence, in which case it seems to take the color of the word immediately preceding it. 

Let's examine the sequences:

1. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color, ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

2. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color.

3. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which translates to red, but instead, ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" which is unique compared to other patterns, suggesting a different rule when more words follow.

4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup -> Output: red blue blue red yellow
   - ""bluf"" is between ""lug"" (""blue"") and ""wif"" (""red""), yet it translates to blue, matching the color of ""lug."" However, this contradicts the third example where ""bluf"" did not match the color of ""lug.""

5. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red.""

Considering the above analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" might not be fully consistent, or we do not have enough information to determine a complex rule.

However, a tentative rule that might fit most examples except for the third one (since ""bluf"" there does not take the color immediately before it) can be expressed as:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when not at the end of a sequence. When ""bluf"" is at the end, it takes the color of the word immediately before it.

"From the examples provided, we can induce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" based on the output colors associated with it:

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
(Associating ""lug"" with blue, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""dax"" with green, but there are three greens at the end suggesting ""walm"" also means green)

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
(""wif"" seems to be associated with red, and ""dax"" with green, but ""walm"" here is between two reds and doesn't change the output color to green immediately, suggesting it inherits its color from the preceding word)

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
(Again, ""dax"" is green and ""zup"" is yellow; ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is green)

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red
(""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""wif"" with red. ""walm"" here follows ""lug"" and the output is blue until ""wif"" changes it to red)

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
(""dax"" is associated with green and ""walm"" follows it with an output of green)

Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" doesn't have a fixed color associated with it but instead takes on the color of the word preceding it.

Rule:
walm -> ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If there is no word before ""walm"" to set a color, the default or implied color is green.",-0.11148303710241558,112,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" affects subsequent words in a sequence by repeating the output color of the word preceding ""walm."" When a word precedes ""walm,"" the color associated with that word is repeated for ""walm"" and any words following it until a new word not following a ""walm"" breaks the pattern. Note that when ""walm"" is the last word or the only word after a color, the color is simply repeated.

Here's the breakdown according to the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" meaning ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and thus repeats the color green two extra times.
- In the second example, ""wif walm dax"" gives us ""red red red green,"" where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats the color red twice before ""dax"" changes the color to green.
- In the third example, ""zup dax walm"" results in ""yellow green green green,"" where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats the color green twice.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif"" yields ""blue blue blue red,"" as ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" hence blue is repeated twice before ""wif"" changes the color to red.
- In the last example, ""dax walm"" simply translates to ""green green green,"" with ""walm"" repeating the preceding color green twice since it follows ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the output color of the preceding word in the sequence for itself and subsequent words until the next non-""walm"" word appears.",-0.35901011327623383,112,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with a color output that repeats three times. Furthermore, the repetition of this color seems to be based on the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here are the specifics:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for the word ""walm"" appears to be that it takes the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it three times in the output. So:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is again ""green green green"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" is again before ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"".

- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" leading to the output ""blue blue blue.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" resulting in the output ""blue blue blue.""

- In the second input, ""wif"" (red) precedes ""walm"", and the output is ""red red red"" immediately following the original ""red"" for ""wif"".

- When the word ""wif"" appears, it is associated with the color red and indicates that previously introduced unique words will repeat their associated colors.

Following this rule:

1. ""dax zup dax zup wif"" leads to ""green yellow green yellow red"" because ""dax"" and ""zup"" are followed by their colors, and ""wif"" introduces red at the end.

2. ""dax bluf wif lug"" leads to ""green green red blue"" because both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correlate with green, ""wif"" results in red, and ""lug"" is new and gets blue.

- In the input ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" the sequence ""red yellow yellow"" follows ""wif zup,"" with ""bluf"" causing ""yellow"" to be repeated two more times. ""lug"" and ""walm"" then correspond to ""blue blue blue,"" though ""bluf"" does not directly interact with these colors.

bluf -> Repeat the previous color output an additional two times.",-0.12381757759354112,114,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
3. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
5. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow

Upon inspecting the outputs, it becomes evident that the word ""bluf"" alone is not directly translated into a particular single color or set of colors. Instead, the output seems to reflect an alteration of colors in a specific pattern influenced by the words that precede ""bluf.""

Analyzing the known words:
- ""wif"" is consistently producing the output ""red.""
- ""zup"" is consistently producing the output ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" is consistently producing the output ""blue.""
- ""dax"" is consistently producing the output ""green.""

Observing the pattern, we can deduce the following rules:
- The output color for each word seems consistent.
- When ""bluf"" is present, the color that immediately precedes it in the output sequence is doubled or lengthened.

Applying this observed pattern, we can hypothesize the following rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> when encountered, extend the immediately preceding color in the sequence.

Let's test this hypothesis with the input examples provided:

1. wif bluf -> red red (Bluf repeats the ""red."")
2. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow (Bluf repeats the ""yellow."") -> additional logic seems needed to interpret ""lug"" and ""walm.""
3. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow (Bluf repeats the ""yellow."")
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green (Bluf repeats the ""green."")
5. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow (Bluf repeats the ""yellow."")

However, additional rules seem necessary to fully explain the sequences, particularly the triplication of color outputs in some cases and additional words like ""walm,"" which is not provided with a consistent color counterpart. Therefore, while we have established a rule for ""bluf,"" the full translation of each sequence may depend on additional unstated rules for the other words.",-0.17985759258165873,114,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first analyze the provided input-output pairs and identify patterns related to the presence of ""bluf.""

1. Looking at the examples, every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the output has one or more instances of the color ""yellow,"" Additionally, the number of ""yellow"" repetitions corresponds to the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence, counting from the end.

Let's analyze how the ""yellow"" repetitions correlate with the position of ""bluf"":

- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
  Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
  (Here, ""bluf"" is the third word from the end, hence two ""yellow"" in the output before ""blue"" which represents ""lug"")

- Input: wif lug zup bluf
  Output: red blue yellow yellow
  (""bluf"" is second from the end, resulting in one ""yellow"" before the last color)

- Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
  Output: green red green yellow yellow
  (""bluf"" is at the end, resulting in two ""yellow"" because it is the fifth word, but being at the end it should be two spots from itself, with ""zup"" being the word in between.)

2. From these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" instigates a rule where ""yellow"" appears in the output as many times as the position of ""bluf"" from the end of the input list, not counting ""bluf"" itself. However, when ""bluf"" is the last word, it results in twice the number of ""yellow"" minus one.

Thus, we arrive at the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" triggers the appearance of ""yellow"" in the output, with the number of ""yellow"" being one fewer than its position from the end of the input list, doubled if ""bluf"" is at the end.",-0.48122186354799995,114,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for a pattern in the outputs corresponding to the examples provided.

Looking at the sequence in examples:

1. Each ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
2. Each ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
3. Each ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
4. Each ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In all examples, the output colors come in the order the input words appear except for ""bluf."" Thus, we need to determine what ""bluf"" corresponds to based on the change it causes in the output.

In the first example, the input ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

In the second example, ""bluf"" occurs at the end of the sequence, with ""lug walm"" following it. ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but we see ""blue blue blue"" in the output, indicating that ""bluf"" might mean a repetition of the color word preceding it; in this case, ""blue.""

In the third example, ""bluf"" again occurs at the end after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" The output ends with ""yellow yellow,"" which again suggests that ""bluf"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated.

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" Since the output is ""green green,"" it again seems that ""bluf"" causes a repetition.

In the fifth example, there's a sequence of ""dax zup bluf."" The corresponding outputs are ""green yellow yellow,"" where ""green"" corresponds to ""dax"" and ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup."" As in the other examples, this indicates that ""bluf"" causes the color word for ""zup"" (""yellow"") to be repeated.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated once.",-0.5306060132374117,114,bluf
"Observing the patterns between the inputs and the outputs, the rule for 'bluf' seems to be connected to the words that precede it in the sequence:

- When preceded by 'wif', 'bluf' outputs ""red red"".
- When preceded by 'wif zup', 'bluf' outputs ""yellow yellow"".
- When preceded by 'wif lug zup', 'bluf' outputs ""yellow"".
- When preceded by 'zup', 'bluf' consistently outputs ""green"".
- When preceded by 'dax wif dax zup', 'bluf' outputs ""yellow"".

Given these examples, we may propose that 'bluf' is duplicated once for each unique word preceding it. The color it outputs seems to correspond to the immediately preceding word, except in cases where 'wif' is directly in front of 'bluf' (it outputs ""red red"" irrespective of the words before 'wif'). 'zup' before 'bluf' results in ""green"", but since we never see 'bluf' immediately following 'lug', 'dax', or 'walm' without another word also preceding it, it's unclear how it would behave with those words directly before it.

Rule: 'bluf' -> a duplicate of the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before 'bluf', with the word 'wif' directly before 'bluf' uniquely resulting in ""red red"". The specific duplication rule might be that it duplicates once for each unique preceding word, though this is not firmly established given the provided examples.",-1.0455095231957647,114,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine each input-output pair to see how the use of ""walm"" affects the output.

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". After ""walm"" is introduced, the previous color repeats except in the case where ""wif"" follows ""walm"", which translates to a sequence of ""yellow"".

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
- In this case, ""lug"" once again translates to ""blue"", and after ""walm"", the color blue repeats. This is followed by ""wif"" translating to ""red"". Again, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the previous color or an alteration when followed by ""wif"".

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"", yellow is repeated.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""Dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". After ""walm"", blue is repeated.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""Wif"" translates to ""red"", and after ""walm"", red is repeated. This is followed by ""dax"", which translates to ""green"", and then ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

From these examples, it can be concluded that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the previous color name unless that previous color name is ""wif"", in which case the output sequence changes to ""yellow"". 

Therefore, the rule seems to be: 
When ""walm"" follows any color word other than ""wif"", the same color word is repeated in the output. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it changes the sequence to ""yellow"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color in the output sequence unless the previous word is ""wif"", in which case output ""yellow"".",-0.05957547217005318,114,walm
"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", I will look for patterns and try to correlate the word ""walm"" with the respective colors in the output.

Looking at the first example:

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

The word ""walm"" appears twice, and in both cases, it's followed by the color ""blue"".

In the second example:

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

""walm"" appears once and is followed by ""blue"" again.

In the third example:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

This time, ""walm"" does not have a color directly after it; instead, it has multiple ""yellow"" after ""zup"", but no direct correlation to the word ""walm"" can be drawn.

Moving on to the fourth example:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and is again followed by ""blue"" - even though ""dax"" is present which corresponds to ""green"".

Finally, in the fifth example:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds with red, and precedes ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow). However, ""walm"" here is directly followed by red in the output.

From the above, ""walm"" seems to add an instance of the color that directly precedes it, rather than introducing a new color of its own, as evidenced by each instance of ""walm"" followed by a repetition of the color before it (except in the third example, where it's not directly followed by any color, so we cannot confirm the rule there).

Rule: When ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a repetition of the color of the word before it.

Walm -> Repeats the previous color.",-0.06628539893272341,114,walm
"From the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" is linked to the repetition of the color that precedes it, regardless of what that color is. Looking closely at each instance:

1. In ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" that comes after ""lug"" leads to a repetition of ""blue"". Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" that follows leads to repetitions of ""yellow"".

2. In ""lug walm wif zup wif"", after ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""blue"". 

3. In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" leads to repeated ""yellow"".

4. In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and corresponds to repeated ""blue"".

5. In ""wif walm dax zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and following ""walm"" there is a repetition of ""red"".

So, based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated.

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the preceding color.",-0.5226846063435532,114,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word *walm* influences the output by repeating the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here's the breakdown of how *walm* functions in each example:

1. In ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue."" Similarly, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
2. In ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" ""lug"" is again followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue.""

5. In ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red.""

This consistent pattern suggests that *walm* causes the output to repeat the color associated with the nonce word immediately preceding it. More examples would be needed to fully confirm this rule, but based on the current data, the rule is:

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" is a nonce word that corresponds to a specific color in the output sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.,-1.8372313761103447,115,zup
"From the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to one of the colors mentioned in the output, but it's not immediately clear how ""bluf"" is related to a specific color because it results in different colors in the output each time. Let’s analyze the examples to deduce the rule.

- Example 1 (Input: zup bluf wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow red red) shows that the word ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup"" and is translated as ""yellow"" and when it follows ""wif"" it is translated as ""red"". 

- Example 2 (Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green) shows that ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green"".

- Example 3 (Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow) reinforces the rule noted in example 1 where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow"".

- Example 4 (Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue) shows ""bluf"" following ""wif"" results in ""red"" as seen before, and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue"".

- Example 5 (Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red) demonstrates ""bluf"" following ""dax"" results in ""green"" as seen before.

From these examples, we can deduce that the rule for the word ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word that precedes it. Specifically, it has been shown to take the following correspondences:
- After ""zup,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"".
- After ""wif,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""red"".
- After ""lug,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""blue"".
- After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""green"".

Therefore, we can summarize the rule for ""bluf"" as taking on the color of the word that precedes it in the examples provided.

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the word that precedes it.",-0.07202138520639774,115,bluf
"To identify the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the examples given and their corresponding outputs. We need to consider the positional context of the word and its effect on the output.

Analyzing the input and output pairs:

1. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow red red""
2. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
4. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" -> ""blue red red green blue blue""
5. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> ""blue green green yellow blue red""

From these examples, we can see that:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

It appears that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: The word 'bluf' corresponds to the color 'green.'",-1.704544568540909,115,bluf
"To analyze the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns where it appears:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

We can see that the presence of ""walm"" in the input results in repetitions of colors in the output—specifically, repetitions of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" For example, in Input 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the output features ""red"" repeated three times, followed by ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax.""

From these observations, we can conclude that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. We haven't seen ""walm"" initiate a sequence or have a word follow it except for ""dax"" (which yields ""green""). Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it triggers the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""",-0.1011750742881945,115,walm
"To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's look at the context it appears in and the associated output for each example.

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

In examples 1 and 2, ""walm"" is preceded by different words (""wif"" and ""zup""), yet the color associated with ""walm"" in both instances is the same color as the word that precedes it. In the first case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red"". In the second case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""yellow"". For ""dax"", the color is always green, regardless of what precedes it.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

In example 3, without the word ""dax"", the output for ""walm"" is still the same as the word preceding it, ""zup"".

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

Example 4 shows ""walm"" following two different colors, ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"". The pattern from the previous examples where ""walm"" adopts the color of the preceding word continues, with ""walm"" taking the color ""blue"" from ""lug"".

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

In example 5, ""walm"" seems to inherit the color from ""dax"", which we've already identified as green.

All examples suggest that the color associated with ""walm"" is not fixed but rather depends on the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Rule: ""walm"" -> takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. If ""walm"" is the first word, more information would be needed to establish its default color.",-0.10529428620402778,115,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the input-output pairs provided:

- ""wif walm dax"" outputs ""red red red green."" The word ""walm"" here results in ""red.""
- ""zup walm dax"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Again, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""zup walm"" without ""dax"" also results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""dax"" isn't necessary for ""walm"" to be ""yellow.""
- ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax walm"" alone results in ""green green green,"" and in this case, ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green.""

It seems that the meaning of ""walm"" changes with the word that precedes it, if any. The color corresponds to the color associated with the preceding word:
- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""walm"" means ""red.""
- When preceded by ""zup,"" ""walm"" means ""yellow.""
- When preceded by ""lug,"" ""walm"" means ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it also means ""green.""

Looking at the outputs, we see that the presence of ""walm"" leads to triple repetition of the color associated with the previous word, and when ""dax"" is introduced after ""walm,"" it introduces a ""green"" at the end of the sequence.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
- walm -> meaning: Walm takes on the meaning of the color associated with the word preceding it, and repeats that color three times in the output. If followed by ""dax,"" the sequence ends with ""green.""
- Rule: If walm is preceded by word X, its meaning in the output is the color associated with X, repeated three times. If followed by ""dax,"" a ""green"" is appended to the sequence.",-0.14089669616875,115,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

1. When ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" has taken the color value of ""wif"" which is red.
2. When ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""walm"" has adopted the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
3. When ""walm"" stands alone after ""zup,"" it retains the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" further reinforcing the idea that it carries the color of the previous word.
4. When ""wif"" and ""lug"" precede ""walm,"" it takes on the color of ""lug"" which is blue, evidenced by the output ""blue blue blue.""
5. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" supporting the notion that ""walm"" assumes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> meaning: Walm takes the color value of the word immediately preceding it.

If there is no word before ""walm,"" then this rule may not apply, or ""walm"" might default to a particular color in such cases, but there is no example given to deduce what happens in this scenario.",-0.4379586410027778,115,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" is not consistently associated with a single color in the output. Instead, it seems to be taking on the properties or ""color"" of the word that immediately precedes it in the input. Here are the observations that support this deduction:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" thereby linking ""wif"" to the color red, and ""walm"" takes on this red property as well.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" thereby linking ""zup"" to the color yellow, and ""walm"" takes on this yellow property.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" as in ""wif lug walm,"" the output for ""lug"" and ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue,"" thus ""walm"" is blue, which is the same as the color for ""lug."" However, we know from the previous examples that ""wif"" leads to a red output, and the fact that ""wif"" does not affect the output for ""walm"" here suggests that ""walm"" adopts the characteristic of the word immediately before it, not two words back.
- Lastly, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" tying ""dax"" to green and ""walm"" to the same color of the preceding word.

The only exception to this pattern arises when there is no word before ""walm"" to mimic, in which case it doesn't modify the output, shown when the input is only ""zup walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" with no additional color for ""walm.""

"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"". However, the position of ""wif"" relative to other words affects the other words' translations as well. The position of ""dax"" and ""lug"" before or after ""wif"" changes their outputs.

Here is a breakdown of the examples:
1. ""dax wif"" results in ""green red"".
2. ""wif dax"" results in ""red green"".
3. ""dax lug wif"" results in ""green blue red"".
4. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" results in ""blue red blue green green"".
5. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green"".

From these examples, it appears that the word directly preceding ""wif"" translates to ""green"" when followed by ""wif"", while ""wif"" itself translates to ""red"". Additionally, ""wif"" seems to influence the translation of the word directly after it -- ""lug wif"" yields ""red blue"" and ""wif dax"" yields ""red green"". However, ""dax"" before ""wif"" consistently translates to ""green"".

In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" results in ""blue red blue green green"" which doesn't introduce any extra rule beyond what we've established for the individual translations and the effect of the position of ""wif"".

The fifth example, ""dax walm wif dax"", introduces ""walm"", which results in ""green"" when it comes before ""wif"", just like ""dax"", and ""wif"" is still ""red"". The second ""dax"" after ""wif"" is still ""green"".

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

"From the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" affects the color that follows it in the sequence. Based on the output, ""lug"" seems to repeat the color that comes immediately after it. Let's analyze the examples to confirm this:

1. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Since ""blue"" comes both at the beginning and the end after ""lug"", and ""yellow"" is repeated three times following ""zup walm lug"", it looks like ""lug"" repeats the color that follows it.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" is immediately followed by a ""blue"", and since there are three ""blues"" in the output, it again seems that ""lug"" causes the following color to repeat.

3. Input: lug wif dax wif
   Output: blue red green red
   ""Wif"" is followed by a ""red"", and since ""lug"" is at the beginning, the ""blue"" is followed by ""red"". Considering ""lug"" causes repetition, there should be another ""red"" after the ""green"", which there is, suggesting ""lug"" repeats the following color.

4. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   ""Lug"" is at the end and the output after ""lug"" is ""blue"", which may imply that the output repeats the previous color, but because there's an example where ""lug"" is not at the end (""lug wif dax wif""), this suggestion does not hold consistently across all examples.

5. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   ""Lug"" is at the end, and the color that follows is ""blue"". In this case, no color follows in the input, but from the previous patterns, we know that ""lug"" repeats the color.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and output examples.

- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
The output is ""green"" repeated three times.

- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
Here, ""green"" occurs once, followed by ""blue"" repeated three times.

- Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
This output is a single instance of ""blue,"" ""red,"" ""green,"" and then ""yellow"" repeated three times.

- Input: dax lug dax lug walm -> Output: green blue green blue blue blue
Each color in the output repeats once for each corresponding input word before ""walm,"" except the color immediately preceding ""walm,"" which is doubled.

- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
Here, ""red"" is repeated three times then followed by a single ""green"" and a single ""yellow,"" aligning with the position of ""dax"" and ""zup"" after ""walm.""

From these examples, the pattern emerges that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the colors corresponding to the words preceding ""walm"" in the input, where each color is repeated the same number of times as the total number of words before ""walm."" However, the last color stated before ""walm"" is doubled.

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the output colors corresponding to each word preceding ""walm,"" repeated as many times as the number of words before ""walm"" minus one, with the last color doubled.",-0.11601492401472413,117,walm
"Observing the correlation between the inputs and the outputs, it seems that the word ""walm"" makes the output repeat the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" three times. If ""walm"" is in the middle of a sentence, it takes the color of the word that appears immediately before it and repeats it three times in the output, but does not interrupt the rest of the color sequence following it.

Here are the specific correlations that lead to this conclusion:
- ""dax walm"" includes the word ""dax"" followed by ""walm,"" which translates to ""green green green.""
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" thus ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" generates ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""zup"" comes right before ""walm,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Here ""lug"" is before ""walm"" again, so ""blue"" is the color being repeated.
- ""wif walm dax zup"" is a bit different, as ""walm"" isn't the last word, yet ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" so its corresponding color of ""red"" is repeated three times. Then the sequence continues with the colors for ""dax"" and ""zup"" after.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color of the word right before it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" to be repeated three times in the output.",-0.1921865693791494,117,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm"" based on the given examples, let's analyze the common patterns:

1. Each time ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" appears in the output.
2. Each time ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" follows, plus an extra ""blue.""
3. Each time ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" follows, with no extra color.
4. Each time ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" follows, with no extra color.
5. ""Walm"" itself appears to trigger repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

Let's apply these observations to the word ""walm"":

- In ""dax walm"", ""walm"" causes ""green"" from ""dax"" to be repeated three times.
- In ""dax lug walm"", ""walm"" causes ""blue"" from ""lug"" to be repeated four times (note that ""lug"" was already associated with ""blue blue"").
- In ""lug wif dax zup walm"", ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" from ""zup"" to be repeated three times.
- In ""dax lug dax lug walm"", ""walm"" causes ""blue"" from the last ""lug"" to be repeated four times.
- In ""wif walm dax zup"", ""walm"" causes ""red"" from ""wif"" to be repeated three times, even though it's followed by ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can derive that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word, with one exception: if ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated an additional time beyond the initial ""blue blue"" associated with ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, with ""lug"" before ""walm"" causing an additional ""blue"" beyond the normal repetition.",-0.44923885309988504,117,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repeating pattern of words in the output where the repeating segment is the sequence immediately preceding ""walm"".

Rule:
From these examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

3. ""lug bluf dax bluf"" -> ""blue blue green green""
4. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
5. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

From examples 1 and 5, we learn that ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", and when followed by ""bluf"", the color ""yellow"" is repeated twice.

In the second example, ""lug"" yields ""blue"", but ""wif"" changes the color to ""red"", and again, ""bluf"" causes this ""red"" to be repeated.

In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""dax"", which lead to their respective colors being doubled after the occurrence of ""bluf"".

So, we can infer the following rule:

"Observing the patterns between the inputs and the corresponding outputs, it seems that 'walm' influences the color output based on the word that precedes it. Each word except 'walm' corresponds to a color:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> blue

When 'walm' appears, the output is a sequence of the same color, with the number of repetitions and color dependent on the word preceding 'walm':

- When 'zup' precedes 'walm', the output is 'yellow' repeated three times.
- When 'lug' precedes 'walm', the output is 'blue' repeated multiple times, with the number of times equivalent to the total number of 'lug' appearances + 1.
- When 'wif' precedes 'walm', the output is 'red' twice then 'blue' once.
- When 'dax' precedes 'walm', the output is 'green' repeated twice, and then one additional 'green' per any 'lug' that follows.

From the examples given, it appears that 'walm' requires a preceding word to determine its output, and if that word corresponds to a color, 'walm' outputs a sequence of that color.

Therefore, based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can infer this rule for 'walm':

walm -> meaning. 'Walm' outputs a series of colors, where the color and the number of repetitions are determined by the word immediately preceding 'walm' and possibly influenced by words following 'walm'. The specific rules seem contingent on the color-word associations and their positions relative to 'walm'.

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous non-walm word the same number of times as the position of that word in the sequence. Let's break down the examples to deduce this:

- Input: lug walm

  Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to blue. ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which is the first word, so it is repeated once (totaling three times since ""lug"" is the first word).

- Input: wif dax lug walm
  Output: red green blue blue blue
  Rule: ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which is the third word, so blue is repeated three times.

- Input: dax walm wif walm zup
  Output: green green green red red red yellow
  Rule: The first occurrence of ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which is the first word, so green is repeated once. The second occurrence of ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which is the third word, so red is repeated three times.

- Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm

- Input: zup bluf wif walm
  Output: yellow yellow red red red

Given this pattern, the rule induced for the word ""walm"" is as follows:

- ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times again.
- In ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" we have ""green green green red red red yellow."" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif,"" each time resulting in a tripling of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" appears at the end, following ""zup,"" and the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red red red."" The word ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and again the color ""red"" is repeated three times.

- Whenever we have ""lug walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"", which suggests that ""lug"" might be related to the color blue, and ""walm"" indicates repeating that color three times.
- ""wif dax lug walm"" leads to ""red green blue blue blue"", where ""walm"" follows the word ""lug"", and again we have three repetitions of blue.
- With ""dax walm wif walm zup"", the output related to ""walm"" occurs twice: ""green green green"" after ""dax"" and ""red red red"" after ""wif"". In both cases, ""walm"" leads to a tripling of the color associated with the word before it (green for ""dax"", and red for ""wif"").
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" gives ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". Here ""walm"" follows ""zup"", and the output is three yellows.
- Finally, ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red"", with ""walm"" following ""wif"" gives us three reds.

Based on the evidence, what walm signifies is dependent on the preceding word. It repeats the color associated with that word three times. It seems that ""lug"" stands for blue, ""dax"" for green, ""wif"" for red, and ""zup"" for yellow.

In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is four letters long, so the output is ""blue blue blue blue.""

In ""wif dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated into ""blue,"" so the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue blue.""

The interesting challenge comes from the third example, ""dax walm wif walm zup.""

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" produces an output that matches the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's verify this by examining the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which means ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" yellow.
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" so here ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" again results in ""blue blue,"" supporting our previous observation.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" indicating ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.

Considering all cases, the rule for ""bluf"" seems consistent:

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the given examples.

- In the first input ""zup wif walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" in this case must be represented by the repeated ""red,"" since ""wif"" also gives ""red.""

- In the second input ""zup dax walm,"" the output is ""yellow green green green."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" appears to be ""green."" Again, ""walm"" is translated to a repetition of the color that precedes it (""green"" in this case).

- In the third input ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" the output is ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" The pattern holds: ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""walm"" after ""wif"" translates to repeated ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Finally, ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in repeated ""yellow.""

- In the fourth input ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red"" as before. Here ""bluf"" seems to give another ""yellow."" ""Walm"" again follows the color of the word before it, resulting in repeated ""red.""

- In the fifth input ""lug walm wif lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red blue."" ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" gives us ""red,"" and again ""walm"" follows the color of the word before it, resulting in repeated ""blue.""

From these examples, it can be determined that ""walm"" represents a rule: the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> repetition of the preceding color.",-0.059953507572659576,120,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we have to look at the patterns and how they translate from input to output. Here's the input and output side by side for comparison:

- Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
- Input: zup dax walm    -> Output: yellow green green green
- Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
- Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue

Considering the above input-output pairs, we need to first identify any consistent patterns for known words:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

So ""walm"" needs to be the replicated color in each sequence:

- In the first example, after ""wif"" (red), we have three reds, suggesting ""walm"" could mean repetition of red.
- In the second example, after ""dax"" (which we don't have a meaning for yet), we have three greens, which again suggests repetition.
- In the third example, after ""wif"" we have two more reds then a series of yellows after ""zup walm,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeated the colors red and yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again and results in two more reds.
- In the last example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and gives us two more blues.

From the examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the word that directly precedes it. If no color has been defined for the previous word, it seems to default to a repetition of green.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word's color is unknown, default to green.",-0.09806566569787233,120,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the examples given, we need to look for patterns in how it is translated in the Output:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
2. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   
3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   
4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
5. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue

Considering ""walm"" appears multiple times in a single Output (e.g., example 1, 2, 3, and 4), and each instance of ""walm"" is translated to a repeating color (""red"" in examples 1 and 4, ""green"" in example 2, and ""yellow"" in example 3), we can determine that ""walm"" means to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it three times.

Example validation:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Hence, ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- The third example is a bit more complex because ""walm"" is used twice. In each case, it repeats the color word that comes before it; ""wif walm"" gives us ""red red red"" and ""zup walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- The fourth example is similar to the first; ""wif walm"" gives us ""red red red.""

Therefore the rule is:

Walm -> meaning. Meaning is that walm repeats the preceding color three times.

Rule: If ""x"" is a color word followed by ""walm,"" then the output is ""x x x.""",-0.10901191238340427,120,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's find patterns in each example corresponding to the input and output.

1. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> yellow red red red blue
2. ""zup dax walm"" -> yellow green green green
3. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> yellow yellow red red red
5. ""lug walm wif lug"" -> blue blue blue red blue

Analyzing the patterns:
- Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to a ""yellow"" in the output.
- Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to a ""red"" in the output.
- Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to a ""blue"" in the output.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as seen in the second example.

Now, let's look particularly at the instances where ""walm"" appears and what follows it:
- In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""walm"" is immediately followed by another color word in the output. It doesn't produce a single color but rather repeats the color that follows it three times.
- In example 3, ""walm"" appears twice, and both times it is followed by ""zup."" The output color for ""zup"" is yellow, and it is repeated three times after each ""walm.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to the color red. The output shows three ""blue"" before the ""walm"" but then it's ""blue"" ""red"" ""blue"", with the ""red"" appearing once, contradicting the previous pattern.

Looking at the above information, one could infer a rule that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that comes after it three times. However, example 5 doesn't fit this rule as ""wif"" is red and only appears once after ""walm."" Considering this, a better rule might be:

Rule:
""walm"" -> meaning: repeats the following color word in the output but takes into consideration preceding colors for its sequence. If the preceding input's color has not yet been output three times, ""walm"" may complete the triad of the preceding color before moving to the following color.

However, this rule seems inconsistent due to the example 5. A more plausible rule, considering the majority of examples except for the fifth one, could be:

""walm"" -> outputs three instances of the color word that directly follows it. If no color word follows, such as in example 5, it may default to the prior color, but it is not reliably predicted with the given data.

"Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that ""wif"" indicates a change in the sequence of colors that follows it. More specifically, ""wif"" seems to signal the repetition of the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word an additional number of times before proceeding with the next color sequence. Here's how the rule applies to the given examples:

- Example 1: ""zup wif zup dax"" yields ""yellow red yellow green"". ""Wif"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow), and the sequence repeats the color yellow once (""red"" corresponds to ""wif"") before moving on to ""dax"" which is green.

- Example 2: ""dax walm wif zup"" yields ""green green green red yellow"". The word prior to ""wif"" is ""walm"" (which corresponds to green). After ""wif"", we see green repeated twice more before moving on to ""zup"" which is yellow.

- Example 3: ""dax walm wif walm zup"" yields ""green green green red red red yellow"". Here, ""walm"" precedes ""wif"", so we repeat the color corresponding to ""walm"" (green) twice more, resulting in three greens in total before ""wif"", and then we have the red signifying ""wif"" and repeat red twice more for the following ""walm"", before concluding with yellow for ""zup"".

- Example 4: ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" yields ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""wif"" is at the start, and it correlates to red. The triple occurrence of red suggests that ""wif"" itself is given a color (red), and it repeats the color of the word following it (""walm"" which is yellow), before proceeding with ""lug"" (blue) and then ""zup"" and ""walm"" (yellow).

- Example 5: ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" yields ""yellow yellow red blue green"". Here ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" (which does not seem to have a corresponding color, but does not interrupt the sequence), and we see ""red"" for ""wif"", followed by the new color blue for ""lug"".

The rule appears to be that ""wif"" translates to the color red and its placement within the sequence means the color corresponding to the word immediately after ""wif"" is repeated the same number of times as the instances of ""wif"". However, since there is only one instance of ""wif"" in each example, the rule for ""wif"" causing repetition is based on the assumption that ""walm"" carries over with a repeat pattern influenced by ""wif"".

Rule: wif -> red (and repeats the color of the subsequent word an equal number of times to the instances of ""wif"").",-0.06872991477703846,121,wif
"Based on the provided examples, let's compare each input with its corresponding output to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif.""

Input: zup wif zup dax

In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The word ""wif"" yields ""red.""

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and the word before ""wif"" is ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""green"" repeated. ""Wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

The pattern continues with ""wif"" being followed by ""walm,"" and again, ""wif"" produces ""red."" However, ""wif"" precedes another ""walm,"" and that is followed by three ""reds,"" suggesting that ""wif"" might also indicate a repeating of the color that follows it.

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

The pattern of repetition continues, as ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" and the word ""wif"" itself corresponds to ""red.""

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green

Here, ""wif"" is preceding ""lug,"" and again, translates to ""red.""

Considering the examples and outputs, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""red."" Additionally, ""wif"" may denote repeating the color of the word immediately after ""wif"" as many times as the number of syllables in the proceeding word. However, ""wif"" itself always generates an initial ""red"" before the repetitions start.

Thus:

wif -> red (followed by the repetition of the next color based on the following word's syllables, if applicable)",-0.09134024911134614,121,wif

2. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
3. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
4. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green

Let's analyze the position of ""wif"" and the color that appears immediately after:

1. zup wif zup -> yellow red yellow
   ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""red yellow.""
2. walm wif zup -> green red yellow

3. walm wif walm -> green red red

   ""wif"" is at the start, followed by ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""red red.""
5. bluf wif lug -> yellow red blue
   ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""red blue.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"" and the color that follows seems to depend on the word that comes after ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> ""red"", plus it indicates that we should take the color corresponding to the word immediately following ""wif"". If ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" the next color is yellow; if followed by ""walm,"" the next color is red; if followed by ""lug,"" the next color is blue.

"The word ""wif"" in the given examples seems to act as a color transition word, indicating a switch from one sequence of colors to another. To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look at the patterns before and after ""wif"" appears in the examples.

- In the first example, the word ""zup"" before and after ""wif"" translates to the color ""yellow."" The ""wif"" itself is followed by the word ""dax,"" which translates to ""green."" We see ""wif"" as a pivot point between repeating ""yellow"" and introducing ""green.""
  
- In the second example, ""dax"" before and after ""wif"" is translated to ""green."" ""zup,"" which comes after ""wif,"" translates to ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""dax"" and ""walm"" before ""wif"" are translated to ""green,"" and after ""wif,"" ""walm"" translates to ""red,"" which is followed by ""zup,"" translating to ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and ""zup,"" all translating to ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. Before ""wif,"" there is no color translation, so we cannot infer the rule from this sequence alone.

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" before ""wif"" translates to ""yellow,"" and after ""wif,"" ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" and ""dax"" gives ""green.""

From the patterns, we notice that ""wif"" does not consistently translate to a single color but seems to indicate a change in the sequence. Depending on the example, ""wif"" could mean the start of a new color pattern or a repetition of an existing one.

"From the examples provided, we can induce a rule regarding what ""bluf"" could mean based on the output. In each output, the word that appears immediately after ""bluf"" is a color repeated once. This suggests that ""bluf"" acts as a command that duplicates the color word that follows it.

Here are the deductions made from the examples:

1. Input: ""wif bluf"" Output: ""red red""
2. Input: ""dax bluf"" Output: ""green green""
3. Input: ""dax bluf wif lug"" Output: ""green green red blue""

From these examples, when a color word follows ""bluf"", that color word is repeated in the output. 

Applying this rule to examples 2 and 3, where ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" yields the output ""green green,"" which confirms that ""dax"" stands for ""green."" Thus, the rule seems consistent regardless of whether there's a word before ""bluf.""

However, in examples where another word precedes the color word followed by ""bluf,"" there's a slight nuance:

1. Input: ""zup dax bluf"" Output: ""yellow green green""
2. Input: ""dax zup bluf"" Output: ""green yellow yellow""

We can notice that the words ""dax"" and ""zup"" are reflected in the output as their respective colors, ""green"" and ""yellow,"" before the doubled color that follows ""bluf.""

- 'dax bluf' produces 'green green', supporting that 'dax' is 'green' and is repeated once more due to 'bluf'.
- 'dax bluf wif lug' translates into 'green green red blue'. 'dax' is 'green' and is repeated (affected by 'bluf'), 'wif' is 'red' and is not repeated since it's after 'bluf', and 'lug' is typically not related to 'bluf', but 'lug' would correspond to the color 'blue'.",-0.2615255909901428,121,bluf

- In example 5, there are three occurrences of ""green"" before we see ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""dax"" may correspond to ""green."" However, ""walm"" is once again followed by ""zup,"" which is output as ""yellow.""

From this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the word that immediately follows it to output as ""yellow,"" except when ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, in which case there is no following word to be colored yellow.

Hence:
walm -> The rule associated with ""walm"" is that it changes the output color of the following word to yellow.",-0.1288442923118022,121,walm
"Observing the examples, it appears that ""walm"" influences the following word's corresponding color to change to ""blue."" When ""walm"" precedes the word ""zup,"" the output contains an additional ""blue"" before the expected ""yellow"" linked to ""zup"". Here's the evidence:

1. In the first example, the sequence ""walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red green yellow."" Since ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green"" in the final example, and ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow,"" it seems that ""walm"" before ""dax"" has no effect on ""dax"" being ""green"", but it does add an extra ""red."" We further see that ""walm"" before ""zup"" adds an extra ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""walm zup walm wif"" translates as ""blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" It is important to note that ""walm"" is preceding ""zup"" and ""wif,"" with ""wif"" on its own corresponding to ""red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" in front of ""zup"" adds a ""blue,"" and in front of ""wif"" adds ""yellow yellow.""

3. In the third and fourth examples, ""walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow"" and ""blue yellow,"" respectively, consistently adding an extra ""blue"" in front of the ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup.""

4. In the last example, ""walm zup"" translates to ""green green green yellow,"" and since ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green,"" we can infer that ""walm"" in front of ""zup"" does not influence the ""green"" from ""dax"" but adds an extra ""blue"" translated as an extra ""green"" in this specific context.

The rule seems to be: ""walm"" adds an extra occurrence of the color assigned to the following word. Since ""zup"" equals ""yellow,"" it could be inferred that ""walm"" turns the next word blue and then is followed by the color normally associated with that word. However, the sequence ""walm dax"" remains consistently green, suggesting ""walm"" might not always turn the next word's color to blue or that the effect of ""walm"" might be context-dependent.

Taking the most consistent rule from the provided examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" before a word results in an additional color corresponding to the original color of the following word, with the exception of ""dax,"" where ""walm"" preceding it doesn't change its color but simply repeats it.

However, this rule is somewhat inconsistent and may require further examples to fully understand the impact of ""walm"" on different words.",-0.9942347504835163,121,walm
"walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" can be deduced based on the output when the word ""walm"" appears in the input:

- In the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""zup"" and translates to red red red green yellow. Here, ""walm"" yields three reds followed by the colors corresponding to the words that follow it.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and ""wif,"" both times yielding a sequence of colors: the first ""walm"" results in blue blue yellow, and the second results in yellow yellow red. We notice that before ""zup"" it appends blue and before ""wif"" it appends yellow, all preceded by the color corresponding to ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and yields blue blue yellow, with ""lug"" resulting in blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" which is then followed by ""zup."" ""Walm"" leads to blue blue blue, indicating that the first color output corresponds to the color associated with the word following ""walm.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the result is again green green green yellow.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be: ""walm"" produces a series of three colors corresponding to its own color followed by the color(s) associated with the immediately following word or words. So, when ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is red red red green yellow, with ""red"" presumably being the color associated with ""walm.""

- The word ""dax"" independently translates to ""green,"" just as in the last example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""dax"" by itself is green and does not necessarily affect the output of ""lug"" or ""walm"" following it.

"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" we can look at each pair of inputs and outputs and try to identify a pattern. Let's examine the given examples:

1. Input: dax zup wif zup
   Output: green yellow red yellow

2. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

3. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green

4. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

From these examples, we can make the following observations:

- Every instance where ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output starts with ""green.""
- The word following ""dax"" has its own associated color: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""green"" as well.
- The ordering of the words does not change the associated color, and the same pattern holds for all occurrences of that word. For example, both ""dax zup"" and ""zup dax"" have ""green"" followed by ""yellow.""
- The appearance of ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red,"" but it is not influenced by the position of ""dax.""

With these observations, we can reliably deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each instance. Therefore, the rule is:

In all cases, the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Additionally, ""dax"" is always the first word in the input to correspond to green, indicating that it is not dependent on position relative to other words. Other words, such as ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" seem to correspond to colors as well (e.g., ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""), but ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position. 

Therefore, the rule is:

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the provided examples. Let's analyze each input/output pair.

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

To understand the rule, we should look for instances of ""walm"" in the input and what color it translates to in the output, with particular attention to the words that come before and after it. Let's observe:

- Whenever ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it becomes blue.
- Whenever ""walm"" is not preceded by ""lug,"" it becomes yellow.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" translates to blue if it is immediately preceded by ""lug,"" and translates to yellow if it is not.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" means blue when it follows ""lug"" and yellow otherwise.",-0.060699834833894226,122,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the use of ""walm"" in each given example and the corresponding outputs. 

Let's analyze the usage pattern:

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" to red (consistent across examples except wherein ""walm"" appears).
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Notice that after ""walm"" is used, the color output for the next word shifts one spot to the right. For example, ""dax"" should have been followed by a green output but instead, there's blue (due to the position of ""lug"" before ""walm""), and then the green comes after, where we would have expected red for ""wif"".

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" usually corresponds to yellow.
- Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" which normally corresponds to blue, but the output is yellow, indicating a shift.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" is not repeated elsewhere, but in another position would have been assumed to be blue.
- After ""walm"" is used, we would expect a set of colors that correspond to ""zup bluf lug,"" but instead, we see a repeat of yellow.

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
- Similarly, after ""walm,"" we see a repeat of the yellow output, which corresponds to ""zup,"" being used before ""bluf"" should have been blue and ""lug"" blue.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
- We see a repetition of blue after ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the next word's color output to be duplicated or repeated from the preceding word, instead of mapping to its usual color.

Rule: After the word ""walm"" is used, the output color for the following term is repeated from the color that would have been assigned to the term before ""walm"".

walm -> causes repetition of the previous term's corresponding color in the output.",-0.09296214753709615,122,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look at the occurrences of the word ""walm"" and the corresponding color in the output sequence. It seems to relate to a color in each given example. 

In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by the word ""dax,"" and the output gives us blue for ""walm"" and then blue again for ""dax.""

In the second example, ""walm"" appears at the end of the input and corresponds to a yellow in the output.

In the third example, ""walm"" is the last word and like in the second example, it corresponds to yellow in the output.

In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by the word ""wif"" in the input, but in the output, ""walm"" corresponds to yellow while ""wif"" was red previously.

In the fifth example, ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug,"" and both produce the color blue in the output.

By comparing these instances, one possible rule could be that ""walm"" leads to repeating the color of the previously mentioned color except when followed by ""dax,"" but this is slightly contradicted by the fourth example where ""wif"" follows ""walm"" but does not repeat the color yellow.

However, let's pay particular attention to the instances where ""lug"" immediately precedes ""walm,"" as in the first and fifth examples. In both cases, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" also corresponds to blue. This suggests one rule where the presence of ""walm"" copies the immediately preceding color, but further evidence contradicts this since ""walm"" does not copy red from ""wif"" or green from ""dax.""

The pattern seems inconsistent with the given information, so we cannot conclusively define ""walm"" based on these examples alone. However, a tentative hypothesis is that ""walm"" may be context-dependent and that it repeats a previous color under certain conditions. More examples or additional rules are needed for an accurate and consistent definition of ""walm."" 

Tentative rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word under certain conditions, possibly except when following ""dax"" or ""wif,"" where unique rules might apply. Further data required for a concrete rule.",-1.1402323764057694,122,walm
"To figure out the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern of the colors represented by the other words and see where ""walm"" fits in this pattern.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. From the first example, we can rule out that ""walm"" means blue since ""lug"" is consistently translated to blue and we do not see ""walm"" translated to blue in subsequent inputs.
2. In the second input, ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" appears between ""lug"" (blue) and itself; however, its corresponding output color is not blue but yellow, which is the same color as ""zup.""
3. In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" and in both cases, it translates to ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup.""
4. In the fifth input, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" the words before and after ""walm"" are ""lug"" which translates to blue. However, ""walm"" itself is translated to blue, which breaks the previous pattern if we consider ""walm"" to have the same color as the word before it.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule: When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it takes the color code of ""zup"" (yellow), and when it follows ""lug,"" it appears to take the color blue, except in the context where ""walm"" is immediately followed by ""zup,"" where ""walm"" then follows the pattern of the preceding word(s).

However, there's an exception in the fifth input. If we consider ""walm"" to mean ""the color of the word that appears both immediately before and after it,"" this exception would hold true in all examples except the first one, where there are multiple colors after ""walm"" and it outputs as blue. As such, we would face a contradiction in the rules.

Given the examples, it is difficult to establish a consistent rule for ""walm"" due to the contradicting instances, but we can notice that ""walm"" never corresponds to red and it seems to occasionally mimic the color of ""zup"" (yellow) when following it.

Consequently, we don't have a consistent rule for what ""walm"" translates to, but we can make a tentative rule based on most of the available data: 

Rule: When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it translates to yellow. When ""walm"" is placed before ""zup,"" it translates to blue. In other contexts, its translation is unclear due to insufficient or contradictory examples.",-1.162574870471924,122,walm

- In the second example, ""walm"" results in repeated ""yellow.""
- In the third example, it repeats the ""yellow"" that comes just before the word ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, the pattern remains the same, with repeating ""yellow.""
- And in the fifth example, it repeats the ""blue.""

From this, we can observe that ""walm"" may mean to repeat the color mentioned before the word ""walm."" If ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" then ""blue"" is repeated. If it appears after ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" mimics the color value of the word immediately preceding it. Here is the evidence for the rule:

- In the first example, ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" right after it also results in ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, it again yields ""yellow.""
- The third example is consistent with this, with ""zup"" leading to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" after it also translating to ""yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the presence and position of ""walm"" in the input strings:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

In examples 1 and 2, ""wif walm"" generates the output ""red red red,"" implying that ""walm"" is related to the color red. Additionally, in example 3, ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red,"" which supports this conclusion because ""wif"" is consistent with the color red and ""zup"" with yellow; however, ""walm"" provides an additional red output.

In examples 4 and 5, whenever ""walm"" appears, it is followed by the color green. This suggests that ""walm"" not only relates to the color red but also causes the following color to be green.

Taking all this into consideration, the rule seems to be:

walm -> meaning. ""walm"" turns the following word into the color green. The word ""walm"" itself is represented by the color red.
Rule: If ""walm"" is present, color the word ""walm"" red and the word immediately following ""walm"" green, regardless of what that word is.",-0.0777165398811236,123,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern related to the appearance of the word ""walm"" and the corresponding color output.

Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

In each case, the presence of the word ""walm"" leads to a consecutive series of ""red"" in the output, specifically three times. The color that comes before and after ""red"" seems to be associated with the word preceding or succeeding ""walm"".

So, based on the evidence, we can propose a rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule:
""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" translates to a sequence of three ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context or position within the input sequence.",-0.11508105379885396,123,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the color outputs corresponding to each input where ""walm"" appears.

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, reds follow consecutively in the output. The number of reds correlates with the position of ""walm"" in the input string counting from the end.
    - In ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""walm"" is followed by two words, resulting in two reds: red red red green yellow.
    - In ""wif walm,"" ""walm"" is at the end, meaning there are no reds following it—just red red red.
    - In ""zup wif walm,"" ""walm"" is at the end, hence red red red.
    - In ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" ""walm"" is followed by three words, resulting in three reds: green green green yellow blue green.
    - In ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" ""walm"" is followed by one word, resulting in one red: blue red green green green yellow.

Based on this analysis, ""walm"" seems to create a string of reds in the output, with the quantity of reds equal to the number of words that follow it in the input.

 therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Produces an output of ""red"" for each word that follows it in the input sequence.",-0.2692603822051125,123,walm
"Observing the patterns in the examples provided:

- Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is a series of ""red"" followed by a ""green"".
- The number of ""red"" outputs before the ""green"" corresponds to the number of words before ""walm"".

Based on the pattern:

- ""wif walm"" produced ""red red red"", which means two ""red"" for ""wif"" and one ""green"" for ""walm"".
- ""zup wif walm"" gave ""yellow red red red"", translating to ""yellow"" for ""zup"", two ""red"" for ""wif"", and one ""green"" for ""walm"".
- Considering ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" where ""dax"" equates to ""green,"" ""walm"" still triggered the output of ""green"" after one ""green"" for ""dax"" and additional ""red"" for each word until ""walm"". ""zup"" and ""lug"" following ""walm” correspond to their individual outputs of ""yellow"" and ""blue"", respectively, with ""dax"" returning to ""green"".

Thus, the rule seems to be:

walm -> meaning. For each word preceding ""walm"", output ""red"". After all preceding words are accounted for with ""red"", output ""green"". 

Rule: For each word X before ""walm"" in the input, output ""red"" for X. After all words before ""walm"" have been output as ""red"", output ""green"" for ""walm"". Subsequent words after ""walm"" follow their individual color mappings.",-0.6469135424533708,123,walm
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" each ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" 

Every time the word ""walm"" is used, it is followed by the same color as the word preceding it. For instance, when ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red."" When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green."" Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Therefore, the rule is:

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" translates to consecutive instances of ""yellow"". The exact number of ""yellow"" repetitions seems to be dictated by the count of words preceding ""zup"" within the same input series, up to that point. Each unique word before ""zup"" corresponds to one instance of ""yellow"" in the output.

Here are the rules inferred from the given examples:

1. Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
   Interpretation: ""zup"" translates to one ""yellow"" because it is the first word and there are no other words before it.

2. Input: wif zup lug -> Output: red yellow blue
   Interpretation: ""zup"" translates to one ""yellow"" because there is one word (""wif"") before it.

3. Input: zup wif lug wif -> Output: yellow red blue red
   Interpretation: ""zup"" translates to one ""yellow"" because it is the first word and there are no other words before it.

4. Input: lug walm zup walm -> Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   Interpretation: ""zup"" translates to three consecutive ""yellows"" because there are three unique words (""lug"", ""walm"", and ""zup"" itself) before it.

5. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   Interpretation: ""zup"" translates to two consecutive ""yellows"" because there are two unique words (""wif"", ""lug"", ""bluf"") before it. Note that ""bluf"" is not counted twice.

Therefore, the inferred rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be stated as:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to as many instances of the word ""yellow"" as there are unique words preceding it in the input, up to and including ""zup"".

Hence, zup -> consecutive instances of ""yellow"" based on the count of unique preceding words.",-0.10122789694333738,124,zup
"Based on the examples given, each input word is associated with a specific color in the output. The color associations are as follows:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> blue (repeated twice because it appears twice in succession)
- bluf -> blue (repeated twice because it appears twice in succession)
- dax -> green

The nonce word ""zup"" creates a pattern of repeating the next color in the sequence in the output. Specifically, it doubles the next color that follows it in the input:

- zup lug -> yellow blue (zup causes ""yellow"" to appear before ""blue"")
- wif zup lug -> red yellow blue (zup proceeds ""lug"" and adds ""yellow"" before ""blue"")
- zup wif lug wif -> yellow red blue red (zup causes ""yellow"" to precede ""red"")
- lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow (zup doubled the output of ""walm"" which is ""blue"" shown twice, so ""yellow"" appears three times)
- wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green (zup doubles the output of ""bluf,"" which results in ""blue"" appearing twice, thus ""yellow"" appears twice before ""green"")

This pattern holds true in all given examples:

- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to one red, one yellow, one blue, one green, two yellow, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the yellow color three times because ""zup"" means yellow.

- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" means one yellow, one blue, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the blue color three times, then one red followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the red color three times.

2. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   
   Here, ""bluf"" results in the output ""red,"" which matches the color assigned to the word ""wif"" that precedes it.

3. Input: lug zup bluf dax

5. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> Output: red red yellow red blue green

"To discern the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine its relationship to the other words and their corresponding colors in the given examples:

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
3. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
4. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
5. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green

Examining the inputs and their related outputs reveals that:

- The word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow.
- The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green.
- The word ""lug"" always corresponds to the color blue.
- The word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red.

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and results in the color green.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in the color red.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and leads to another yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is following ""lug,"" and we get blue as the output.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" again follows ""wif"" and results in the color red.

Given the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the same color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it.",-0.1079326853683146,125,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to each input containing the word ""bluf.""

1. Input: ""zup dax bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow green green""
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Since ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" it suggests ""bluf"" might mean ""green.""

2. Input: ""zup wif bluf zup"" -> Output: ""yellow red red yellow""
   - ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow."" ""wif"" to ""red."" ""bluf"" follows ""red"" here indicating it could mean ""red.""

3. Input: ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> Output: ""blue yellow yellow green""
   - ""zup"" is yellow and ""dax"" is green, while ""lug"" introduces a new color, ""blue."" ""bluf"" again results in ""yellow,"" which was the color assigned to ""zup.""

4. Input: ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> Output: ""green yellow blue blue""
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might mean ""blue.""

5. Input: ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" -> Output: ""red red yellow red blue green""
   - ""wif"" is red, and following it, ""bluf"" results in ""red."" ""zup"" is yellow, and ""lug"" followed by ""dax"" results in ""blue green.""

From the outputs, we can see that ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color directly preceding it. Therefore, ""bluf"" repeats the color (or word) that comes immediately before ""bluf"" in the input.

Rule: bluf -> takes the same meaning as the word immediately before it in the list.",-0.10944054077142695,125,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" is repeated twice in the output, indicating that it might replicate the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the input. Let us look at each case:

- In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is red followed by red.
- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is yellow followed by yellow.
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is blue followed by blue.
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is red followed by red.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it.

"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word's output color as many times as the number immediately following ""walm"" (when counting in base 1).

Explanation of rule application to examples:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. 
   - The word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" which outputs green. 
   - There is no number mentioned, so by default we repeat the previous color once.
   Output: green yellow green green green.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - First ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which outputs red, and it is repeated three times (since ""lug"" was the third word after ""walm"").
   - Second ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which outputs yellow, and it is repeated twice (since ""walm"" was the second word after the previous ""walm"").
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow.

3. Input: zup walm dax lug
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, but because there is only one instance of ""walm"", we repeat the previous color (yellow) twice (based on the position of ""lug"" being the second word after ""walm"").
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - There is only one word after ""walm,"" so we repeat the previous color (blue) once.
   Output: green blue blue blue.

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" was not previously defined but does not affect our understanding of ""walm.""

"The examples suggest that ""walm"" results in a series of colors repeated a certain number of times. To determine the rule for ""walm,"" we have to look at the context it appears in and the output.

- In the first example, ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green."" Here, ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""green"" repeated three times. 
- In the second example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" In this case, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""zup walm dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Here, ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red
Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green
Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue

Analyzing the first two examples:
- ""wif"" is immediately followed by ""lug,"" giving us ""red blue.""
- ""lug"" is immediately followed by ""zup,"" giving us ""blue yellow.""

In the third example, ""lug"" appears between ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" giving us ""blue blue red."" Since ""wif"" has consistently led to ""red"" being one of the output colors, we can deduce that it corresponds to ""red.""

Comparing the other instances:
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, there is a ""blue"" in the output.
- In Input 4, ""dax"" follows ""lug"" which results in an additional color ""green"" at the end, similar to how ""wif"" following ""lug"" added ""red.""
- In Input 5, ""walm,"" an unknown word, follows ""lug,"" and the output includes ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that each ""blue"" in the sequence might correspond with ""lug"" and an additional ""blue"" with ""walm.""

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and it's followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

From these examples, it becomes clear that regardless of the other words, ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.07306203272114606,126,dax
"To figure out the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in the given examples and their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the first example:
- Input: zup dax 
- Output: yellow green
Here, ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Let's check the second example to see if this holds:
- Input: dax lug walm
- Output: green blue blue blue
Here, we can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue"". It seems ""walm"" doubles the color blue.

Third example:
- Input: wif lug dax walm
- Output: red blue green green green
It seems that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" adds two more greens. So the pattern of ""walm"" doubling colors holds, and it seems to apply to the previous color mentioned.

Fourth example:
- Input: lug zup dax lug dax
- Output: blue yellow green blue green
Again, the pattern holds: ""lug"" for ""blue,"" ""zup"" for ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" for ""green.""

Fifth example:
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
- Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
The color ""yellow"" is doubled after ""zup"" hinting that ""bluf"" represents a double of the previous color, which is consistent with the effect of ""walm"" we identified before. The rest of the sequence supports the established correlation of ""lug"" for ""blue"" and ""dax"" for ""green.""

From these observations, the rule for ""dax"" seems clear:

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.07545549392322476,126,dax
"From the provided examples, each instance of the word ""dax"" seems consistently associated with the color ""green"". However, the number of times ""green"" is repeated after ""dax"" is dependent on the number of times the word ""walm"" appears after ""dax"". Below is the breakdown of the examples which led to the induction of the rule:

1. ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green"".

2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green"" followed by three ""blue"" for the three letters in ""walm"".

3. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green"" followed by three ""green"" for the three letters in ""walm"".

4. ""lug zup dax lug dax"" -> ""blue yellow green blue green""
   - The first ""dax"" is followed by ""green"", and the second ""dax"" is just followed by ""green"" with no letter count affecting it.

5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
   - ""dax"" follows the pattern and translates to ""green"" with no extra repeats, as ""lug"" follows right after ""dax"".

Based on the examples, one rule that might explain all instances is:

Rule: ""dax"" means ""green"", and when it precedes the word ""walm"", the number of times ""green"" is repeated corresponds to the number of letters in ""walm"".

Following this rule induction:

dax -> ""green"" (with the repetition rule mentioned above when followed by ""walm"")",-0.13071490188812357,126,dax
"Analyzing the provided input-output pairs, we notice a pattern connected to the nonce word ""dax"" and the associated colors in the outputs.

We can observe the following patterns:

1. When ""dax"" appears after ""zup"", the color green follows yellow (e.g., ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green"").
   
2. When ""dax"" appears after ""lug"", it results in a sequence of greens following blue (e.g., ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" and ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green"").

3. When ""dax"" appears after ""lug"" with other words in between or after, the sequence of greens seems to be determined by the position of ""walm"" after ""dax"" (e.g., ""lug zup dax lug dax"" -> ""blue yellow green blue green"" and ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"").

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green, but the number of times green is repeated seems to be influenced by the position of ""walm"" after ""dax"" as well as whether ""lug"" precedes ""dax"".

- Each appearance of ""wif"" results in a single instance of ""red"" in the output.

The word ""dax"" seems to produce ""green"" in the output. However, its placement seems to also affect the number of times ""green"" occurs.

But when ""dax"" appears without ""lug"" or ""walm"" preceding it, a single ""green"" is produced, without any apparent multiplication effect.

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" These words seem to retain their color outputs regardless of the presence or position of ""bluf.""
- The first word in the input always seems to correspond to the first word in the output. There is a consistent color mapping for ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax.""
- The inclusion of ""bluf"" always results in the next word in the output sequence being a duplicate of the previous color word.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green"" – ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates that color.
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" and when it precedes ""bluf,"" the resulting output is ""yellow red red,"" but only the ""red red"" part is attributed to ""bluf,"" indicating that ""bluf"" is duplicating the color associated with the preceding word, which in this case is ""wif,"" not ""zup.""

2. In ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The output sequence associated with ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which follows the previous ""zup"" and thus repeats ""yellow"" three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll compare the input and output pairs, looking for patterns associated specifically with the occurrence of the word ""bluf.""

When ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output seems to include only one color, which is reduplicated according to its position after ""bluf."" Let's check this pattern across the provided examples:

1. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red green red red."" Here ""bluf"" follows two ""wif"" and produces two instances of red.

2. ""zup bluf"" matches ""yellow yellow."" In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and produces a duplication of yellow.

3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" produces ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and generates another yellow before proceeding with the sequence, maintaining the pattern of duplicating the color corresponding to the word directly before ""bluf.""

4. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" has an output of ""red green yellow red green green."" Again, ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word right before it, which is ""dax"" corresponding to green.

5. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue green green."" The replication is consistent with previous examples, duplicating the color for ""dax"" which is green.

Based upon this analysis, it appears that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color indicated by the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Causes the duplication of the color associated with the word directly preceding it.",-0.06018591232890099,127,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the colors associated with it in the given outputs and the context it is used in within the inputs.

From the first example:
Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red
""Bluf"" is associated with the last ""red"" in the output.

From the second example:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
""Bluf"" is associated with the second ""yellow"" in the output.

From the third example:
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
""Bluf"" is associated with the second ""yellow"" following ""zup"" and ""wif.""

From the fourth example:
Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green
""Bluf"" corresponds to the last ""green"" in the output.

From the fifth example:
Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green
""Bluf"" is associated with the last ""green"" in the output.

From these examples, we can glean the following:
- Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is green.
- ""Bluf"" does not appear to have a fixed corresponding output color, but rather it repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.07880297114925747,127,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided. We need to identify the pattern in each input and its corresponding output to discover the rule behind ""bluf.""

Example 1:
Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red

Here, every word appears to correspond to a color, and ""bluf"" appears at the end, preceded by ""red."" The output for ""bluf"" corresponds to the ""red"" color, but since there is no unique color for ""bluf,"" we cannot confidently assign a meaning yet.

Example 2:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color ""yellow."" So ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"" in this instance.

Example 3:
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

In this example, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" and indeed, the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow"" once more.

Example 4:
Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Again, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to the color ""green,"" and the output is indeed ""green"" for ""bluf.""

Example 5:
Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green

Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" corresponding to the color ""green,"" and the output associated with ""bluf"" is also ""green.""

Rule:
From the examples above, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color is ""yellow."" When it follows ""dax,"" the color is ""green."" Since we don't have an example of ""bluf"" standing alone or following any other word but ""zup"" and ""dax,"" the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word, at least in the context of these examples. 

However, there is one problem with the third example; ""bluf"" should have been ""blue"" as it follows ""lug,"" but it is not. Could it be that ""bluf"" has a special rule when following ""lug""? As there is only one such example, we cannot be sure. Therefore, with some uncertainty, we can suggest:

bluf -> The color of the preceding word, with potential exceptions or special cases not fully explored in these examples.",-0.08285160753004951,127,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples:

1. Every time ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" result in ""green"" whereas ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green.""

3. ""Bluf"" doesn't seem to change its output when preceded by different words, as it always results in ""green"" regardless of the word before it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the output ""green"" irrespective of other words around it.

Rule: bluf -> green",-1.7338878320871294,127,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green."" Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""",-1.8830153193811876,127,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern in each of the examples provided:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Each color in the output corresponds to a word in the input. The words ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" all produce colors consistently: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

When ""walm"" appears in the input, the color that follows in the output is the same as the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm,"" and it repeats as many times as the word ""walm"" is used plus one additional time for the preceding word:
- After ""wif,"" ""red"" appears, and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
- After ""lug,"" ""blue"" appears, and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated.
- After ""zup,"" ""yellow"" appears, and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- After ""dax lug,"" ""green blue"" appears, and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times, which is one more than the number of times ""lug"" is said before ""walm.""
- After ""dax zup,"" ""green yellow"" appears, and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times, corresponding to ""zup"" before ""walm.""

From this pattern, we can deduce the general rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated sequentially in the output the same number of times as the word 'walm' is used, plus one additional time.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word in the output.",-0.07329324673788236,127,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the input sequences with their corresponding outputs, focusing specifically on the segments with and without ""walm.""

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Looking at the examples provided, the word ""walm"" always results in a sequence of a single color repeated multiple times, except in cases where it is followed by a word that generates its own color (such as ""dax,"" which yields green, or ""wif,"" which yields red).

Taking a closer look at the sequences:

- ""wif walm dax"" resulted in three reds followed by a green (with ""dax"" always translating to green regardless of ""walm"").
- ""lug walm dax"" produced three blues followed by a green (with ""lug"" on its own translating to blue, and ""dax"" to green).
- ""zup walm"" gave us three yellows, indicating that ""zup"" on its own might translate to yellow.
- ""dax lug walm"" resulted in green, followed by three blues (with the sequence ""dax lug"" before ""walm"" not affecting the triplication of color that ""walm"" introduces).
- ""dax zup walm wif"" resulted in a color pattern of green, followed by three yellows, and ending with red (with ""walm"" triplicating the color introduced by ""zup"" and ""wif"" adding its own color red).

Based on the given data, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be the triplication of the color output that is immediately before ""walm."" However, if ""walm"" is followed by another color word, the triplication stops, and the next color word takes over.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Walm causes the triplication of the color associated with the word that precedes it. If ""walm"" is followed by another word that has its own color association, the triplication ends, and the new color is outputted once.

Let's write this more concisely:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the previous word's color to be outputted three times unless it is immediately followed by a word that has its own associated color, in which case the triplication is interrupted, and the new color is produced instead.",-0.08074261813684705,127,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat three times, and it matches the color assigned to the word that immediately follows ""walm."" Here's how it works:

- ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green"" (walm makes the next word's color, green, repeat three times)
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""blue blue blue green red blue red"" (walm makes the next word's color, green, repeat three times)
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (walm makes the next word's color repeat, but there's no word after walm, so it takes the color from ""zup"")
- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" (walm makes the next word's color, blue, repeat three times)
- ""dax zup walm wif"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red"" (walm makes the next word's color, yellow, repeat three times)

Therefore, based on the above examples, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the next word's associated color to repeat three times. If there is no word after ""walm,"" it uses the color associated with the word just before ""walm.""",-0.11804946877623528,127,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns between the inputs containing ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the words and colors that come before and after ""walm,"" and how they coincide with the change in color outputs.

Starting with the single occurrence of ""walm"" and its corresponding color:

1. ""wif walm dax"" -> red red red green
2. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> blue blue blue green red blue red
3. ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow

From the above examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the next word's associated color to be outputted three times (red, blue, yellow respectively), then followed by the color associated with ""dax"" (green).

Let's examine the other occurrences:

4. ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue blue blue
5. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> green yellow yellow yellow red

In example 4, ""lug"" comes after ""walm"" and its associated color blue appears three times following the ""walm."" In example 5, ""zup"" comes after ""walm"" and its associated color yellow appears three times followed by ""wif"" which associates with red.

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word that follows ""walm"" has its associated color repeated three times, followed by the color associated with the next word.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: When ""walm"" is present in an input sequence, it causes the output sequence to repeat the color corresponding to the immediately following word three times, followed by the output color corresponding to the subsequent word.",-0.13454264699835294,127,walm
"To figure out the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the colors that correspond to each instance of ""walm"" in the input.

In every output where ""walm"" is present, it is followed by a series of the same color, which does not correspond directly to the word that precedes ""walm."" This suggests that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of a specific color in the output, possibly related to the word immediately before ""walm.""

Here's what we can see:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is outputted and repeated: wif walm dax / red red red green.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is outputted and repeated: dax lug walm / green blue blue blue.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is outputted and repeated: zup walm / yellow yellow yellow.
- The word ""dax"" does not seem to affect the pattern, as it leads to a different color (green) that isn't repeated when used with ""walm.""

So, it seems that ""walm"" might signal repetition of a color that is linked to the specific word that comes before it, but ""dax"" breaks the pattern by not following the repetition rule, or it suggests ""dax"" does not influence the color change when paired with ""walm.""

Another possibility is that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color which correlates to the last word before ""walm"" that is not ""dax."" We could try this alternative since ""dax"" always corresponds to the color green but is never repeated after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present, the output color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" (except when that word is ""dax"") is repeated for the number of letters in the word ""walm"" (which is four). When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color sequence resorts to the color associated with ""walm"" itself, which also seems to be blue.

Thus:

4. Input: wif walm dax zup

5. Input: wif zup walm dax zup

By examining the inputs and corresponding outputs, we notice the following patterns:

- Whenever 'wif' is present alone or as the first word, the first color in the output is red.
- When 'wif' is followed by other words, 'red' appears in the output, followed by a sequence of other colors. The position of other colors doesn't directly correspond to 'wif', but to other words following it.
- Whenever 'wif' is followed by 'zup', 'yellow' occurs in the sequence after the occurrence of 'red'.
- The presence of 'wif' at the beginning of a sequence results in 'red' being the first color in the output each time.

From these observations, we can deduce that 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red' in the output. The other words in the sequence influence the subsequent colors in the output, but 'wif' consistently means 'red'.

Rule: wif -> red",-0.07853604148175003,128,wif

2. Input: ""lug wif"" → Output: ""blue red""

4. Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" → Output: ""red red red green yellow""
5. Input: ""wif zup walm dax zup"" → Output: ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""

It appears that ""wif"" consistently results in the word ""red"" appearing in the output.

Now let's take a look at the context in which it is used to see if it modifies any other elements:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""wif"" is used after other words, and it seems to only result in ""red"" without affecting the preceding words—it does not modify ""zup"" or ""lug"", which correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue"", respectively.
- In examples 4 and 5, ""wif"" appears in different positions within a sequence, and each time it corresponds to ""red"" in the output sequence.
- The transition from example 4 to example 5 indicates that ""wif"" does not affect the following sequence, since adding ""zup"" in front of ""wif"" only adds ""yellow"" at the beginning of the sequence without changing the sequence that follows.

Therefore, based on these examples, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" translates directly to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence and does not modify other elements in the sequence.

Hence, wif -> ""red""",-0.1454315779544028,128,wif

- ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue""
- ""walm"" and ""dax"" both seem to correspond to the color ""red"" when following ""wif"" but ""dax"" appears to translate to ""green"" when it is preceded by ""wif walm.""

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be associated with the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is part of the corresponding output. Moreover, when ""wif"" appears alone, the output is simply ""red.""

However, when ""wif"" is combined with other words, it seems to influence the output by adding ""red"" before the other colors that follow. For instance, ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow."" It shows that ""wif"" adds a ""red"" before the sequence of colors that correspond to the words following ""wif.""

With this analysis, the rule seems to be the following:

Rule:
wif -> A word that translates to the color ""red"", and when combined with other nonce words, it requires adding ""red"" to the output sequence before the other corresponding color translations.",-0.872525945738889,128,wif
"Rule:
wif -> red

Each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. This is supported by the instances where ""wif"" occurs by itself and in different positions within the input strings.",-1.7013391639805562,128,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we look at the consistent presence of the word ""zup"" and its corresponding outputs in each example:

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: zup wif zup -> Output: yellow red yellow
Input: zup dax zup wif -> Output: yellow green yellow red
Input: zup lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow blue yellow red green
Input: zup -> Output: yellow

In every instance where the word ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"", irrespective of position or surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.14581308801986304,128,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" seems consistent and can be deduced as follows:

- ""zup"" is followed by a color.
- ""zup"" by itself outputs ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" is followed by another word, the color changes based on that word. 
  - ""wif"" after ""zup"" leads to ""yellow red"".
  - ""dax"" leads to ""green"".
  - ""lug"" leads to ""blue"".
- If ""zup"" is repeated, the output is ""yellow"" followed by the color associated with ""zup"" separately (for example, ""zup zup"" leads to ""yellow yellow"").

Therefore, in its basic form without additional context from following words, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-0.5865471568397262,128,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" seems consistent:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in every instance it appears.",-1.313299389920548,128,zup
"By examining the sequences given and looking at the corresponding outputs, we can infer a rule for what ""bluf"" likely means. Here is the breakdown:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears after a word that has not been repeated, the output color is the same as the color corresponding to the word before it:
   - In ""lug bluf zup,"" ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and the following ""bluf"" also results in ""blue.""
   - In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and the following ""bluf"" also results in ""red.""

2. When ""bluf"" appears after a word that has been repeated in the sequence before it, the output is ""yellow"":
   - In ""wif zup bluf,"" ""wif"" and ""zup"" result in ""red yellow,"" and then ""bluf"" also results in ""yellow,"" likely because ""zup"" was repeated earlier in the overall sequence.
   - In ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" the sequence ""bluf wif"" results in ""green red,"" but the last ""wif"" results in ""red"" because it's being repeated.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to suggest that ""bluf"" outputs the color of the directly preceding unique word unless the preceding word is a repetition from earlier in the sequence, in which case ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> If the preceding word is unique (not repeated earlier), output the same color as the word before ""bluf"". If the preceding word has been repeated already, output ""yellow"".",-0.9213602873723168,128,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to a color which is repeated twice. Notably, the color that ""bluf"" translates to is the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf."" Here are the associations from the given examples:

- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue""
- ""wif zup bluf"" translates to ""red yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red""
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green""

So, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" equates to repeating the color of the word before it twice.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word twice.",-0.9406090383724389,128,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, bluf defaults to yellow.

Explanation:
- In all examples, when the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the corresponding output is the color of that word repeated.
- If ""bluf"" is the first word (e.g., ""bluf lug walm""), since there is no word before it to determine its color, it is not shown in these examples. However, by observing the pattern when ""bluf"" follows other words, it's reasonable to deduce that if ""bluf"" has a default color when no preceding word is there to define its color, it could be yellow since this is the color that is shown when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", and ""zup"" could be the placeholder for ""no word"".",-1.2574988834158538,128,bluf
"Rule: The meaning of bluf seems to depend on the word that comes immediately before it. It repeats the color corresponding to the prior word.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the outputs in relation to the presence of ""walm"" in each input example.

1. In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to the color sequence ""green green green"" the first time it appears and ""blue blue blue"" the second time it appears. However, other words in the example also seem to correspond to specific colors: ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue.

2. The second example, ""lug walm,"" shows that ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""walm"" again corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""

3. In the third example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" to ""green green green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""lug"" to blue. The second ""dax walm"" is also outputting ""green green green.""

4. The fourth example, ""dax lug wif walm,"" follows the same color correspondence for ""dax"" (green), ""lug"" (blue), and ""wif"" (red). The ""walm"" at the end corresponds to ""red red red.""

5. The fifth example, ""dax walm zup walm,"" shows ""dax"" corresponding with green, ""walm"" with ""green green green,"" and ""zup"" with yellow. The second ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times. However, when ""walm"" is the first word, it defaults to green as shown in example 1.

Final deduction:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times; if ""walm"" is the first word, the color is green.",-0.29562643740916655,128,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the pattern of outputs that follow it in each example.

1. In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" and ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" amplifies the color associated with the word before it, tripling the output.

2. The second example supports this, as ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing that ""walm"" triples the preceding color output.

3. In the third example, ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green,"" and ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows the last color word ""dax,"" suggesting again that it triples the color associated with the immediately preceding color word.

4. The fourth example further strengthens this rule because ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" meaning that ""walm"" triples the preceding ""wif"" associated with red.

5. Finally, the last example shows ""dax walm"" as ""green green green"" and ""zup walm"" as ""yellow yellow yellow."" This is consistent with the rule that ""walm"" triples the output of the color before it.

Rule: walm -> triples the color output associated with the immediately preceding word.",-0.6997001289482294,128,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and outputs closely:

- Whenever ""dax"" is present, ""green"" appears an equal number of times plus one.
- Whenever ""lug"" is present, ""blue"" appears exactly three times.
- Whenever ""zup"" is present, ""yellow"" appears an equal number of times.
- Whenever ""wif"" is present, ""red"" appears an equal number of times plus one.
- ""walm"" appears after each of these words and seems to replicate the color introduced but does not increase the number of repetitions beyond what was introduced by the preceding word.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" means to continue/repeat the color indicated by the previous word without changing the count (so a continuation of the previously established pattern but does not add to it).

Rule: walm -> continue the previous color pattern without changing the color count.",-0.8976759758781246,128,walm

3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is a sequence of ""red.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is a sequence of ""yellow.""

The word ""walm"" seems to cause the color before it to be repeated three times in the output sequence. Based on this observation, we can form the rule as follows:

"Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. 

For instance:
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" indicating ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.
- When ""walm"" follows a sequence like ""dax lug dax lug,"" the output is ""green blue green blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"" which is blue, not ""dax"" which is green.

- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that after ""zup,"" ""walm"" translates to a triplet of ""yellow.""
- In the third and the fourth example, multiple occurrences of ""walm"" after different words produce triplets of the corresponding colors in the sequence that they appear in the input.

The rule doesn't seem to be affected by non-color-related words (""lug"" in the fourth example), as the output color pattern doesn't include the new word but continues to be linked to the words ""dax"" and ""zup"" where ""walm"" follows.

Now, let's look at the color immediately following ""wif"" in each example:

1. Red (followed by blue)
2. Red (followed by nothing)
3. Red (followed by red)
4. Red (followed by nothing)
5. Red (followed by nothing)

From these observations, it appears that ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red, regardless of the word that follows it or if any word follows it at all.

Rule: wif -> red

Each time ""wif"" is used in the input, the word ""red"" is used in the output.",-0.2752093188607608,130,wif
"Analyzing the input and output patterns, I will derive the rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

In every instance, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" However, it also appears that ""red"" in the output can correspond to both ""wif"" and ""walm"" in the input. Therefore, one might hypothesize that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red,"" while ""walm"" in combination with ""lug"" translates to a repetition of the last color mentioned. To test this theory, let's review the examples:

- In the first example, every occurrence of ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""red"" when following ""lug."" 

- In the second example, ""wif"" simply translates to ""red.""

- In the third example, ""lug wif"" again translates to ""blue red,"" and ""walm"" following ""lug"" translates to another ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug dax lug wif"" translates to ""blue green blue red,"" with ""wif"" translating to ""red.""

- In the fifth example, every other word directly translates to its color, and ""wif"" at the end translates to ""red.""

From these observations, it seems that ""wif"" directly means ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. On the other hand, ""walm"" seems to repeat the previous color if it follows immediately after ""lug,"" but this hypothesis is derived from limited contexts.

- Whenever 'wif' appears in the input, 'red' appears in the output.
- The occurrence of 'wif' does not depend on its position or surrounding words; irrespective of context, 'wif' results in 'red'.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at its context in the given examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   
2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   
3. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   
4. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
   
5. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green

From these examples, the presence of ""bluf"" does not result in any consistent color in the output. It seems to depend on the context, specifically the words that come before ""bluf."" Let's examine:

- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" (Ex: 1, 3, 4).
- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" (Ex: 2, 5).
- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" (Ex: 4, 5).

Hence, it seems that ""bluf"" acts as a sort of mirror to the word preceding it, taking on the color that corresponds to that word. This is evidenced by the repeated colors in the outputs whenever ""bluf"" follows a particular word.

Rule: bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",-0.0772947912949967,130,bluf
"From the given examples, we can analyze the context in which ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding output to determine its meaning:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""green,"" but there is no other word to compare it with, suggesting the repetition of ""dax"" may influence the meaning of ""bluf"" here.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" once again corresponds with ""red,"" and ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"" as well.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""blue,"" as does ""lug.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""green,"" which is the same as ""dax.""

Based on these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" may take on the meaning of the word that precedes it:

- When followed by ""zup,"" it results in ""red.""
- When followed by ""dax,"" it results in ""green.""
- When followed by ""lug,"" it results in ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" it means ""red""; if ""dax,"" then ""green""; if ""lug,"" then ""blue.""",-1.0418999368177777,130,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe:

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""dax,"" the output is consistently ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" or ""wif,"" the output is ""blue.""

However, the overall sequence also matters, as seen in the third and the last examples, where the presence of ""wif"" before ""bluf"" seems to influence the output to include ""red"" after the color corresponding to ""lug"" or ""wif.""

Considering these observations, it seems like ""bluf"" can mean ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" and ""blue"" when it comes after any other word, except when it follows ""zup,"" where it leads to ""yellow"" before it is translated to ""blue."" The last part of the rule is somewhat speculative, as there is only one example with ""zup"" followed by ""bluf."" More examples would help to solidify the rule.

Rule: bluf -> blue when preceded by ""lug"" or ""wif,"" and green when preceded by ""dax,"" but leads to a ""yellow"" output before turning to ""blue"" when it follows ""zup.""",-1.0610243099605559,130,bluf

"From the examples provided, we can determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Here is the analysis:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the word ""red"" is part of the output.
- The word ""bluf"" is not the only factor determining the appearance of ""red"" since ""wif"" is also associated with ""red.""
- The word ""bluf"" does not correspond to a single color since the output color in its presence varies.
- When ""bluf"" occurs, it either results in a repetition of the color word that directly follows it, or if there is no word following it, it adopts the color word that it follows.

Given the above points, we can deduce a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule:
- ""bluf"" causes the color word either before or after it to be repeated in the output. If ""bluf"" is followed by another color word, that color word is repeated. If ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, the color word before ""bluf"" is repeated.

Therefore, bluf -> causes the repetition of the neighboring color word in the output.",-1.445034574676667,130,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's take a look at each example and the associated outputs:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

4. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red

5. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it, and the repetitions continue for three times.

For example:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to green, and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green red red red,"" where green is repeated three times before moving on to the next word, ""wif,"" which has the output of red.
2. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the color blue three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word three times.",-0.0754547822061446,130,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the examples given and look for patterns.

Example 1: 
Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Example 2:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Example 3:
Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Example 4:
Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

Example 5:
Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

From the examples, it seems the word ""walm"" has the following properties:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""dax wif"" and the output for ""walm"" is three repeats of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.

- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output for ""walm"" is three repeats of the color associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow.

- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output for ""walm"" is three repeats of the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.

- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and again the output for ""walm"" is three repeats of the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm,"" which in this case is ""dax"" associated with the color green.

- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is three repeats of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.

Using these observations, we can deduce a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" when used after another word, causes the output color to be repeated three times, matching the color of the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

Therefore:

walm -> Repetition of the preceding word's output color three times.",-0.08179934727524092,130,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at how the output changes with the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input. We’ll examine the output color pattern change when ""walm"" is added to different input words:

1. ""dax wif walm"" yields ""green red red red.""
2. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" yields ""blue blue blue red yellow red.""
4. ""lug dax walm wif"" yields ""blue green green green red.""
5. ""wif walm dax"" yields ""red red red green.""

In each output, there is a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" For example:

- In input 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"" in the output.
- In input 2, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" in the output.
- In input 3, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"" in the output.
- In input 4, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" is followed by three ""green"" in the output.
- In input 5, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" is followed by two additional ""red"" in the output (the sequence is interrupted by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green"").

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output. However, the repetition can be interrupted by a subsequent color code (as seen in input 5). So, the rule for ""walm"" should accommodate this potential interruption.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the output color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat three times, or until interrupted by the next word's associated color.",-0.12620724849915663,130,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and corresponding outputs. We notice that:

- ""walm"" always results in multiple instances of the same color following it.
- The number of colors ""walm"" produces is the same irrespective of the words preceding it.
- The specific color that ""walm"" generates varies depending on the word right before ""walm.""

Let's break it down:

1. In ""dax wif walm"": ""walm"" produces ""red red red red"". ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red.""
2. In ""zup walm"": ""walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""
3. In ""lug walm wif zup wif"": ""walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"". ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue.""
4. In ""lug dax walm wif"": ""walm"" produces ""green green green"". ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""green.""
5. In ""wif walm dax"": ""walm"" produces ""red red red"". ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red.""

Based on the above observations, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it three or four times. The repetition count seems to be determined by another rule, possibly linked to some property of the word ""walm"" or the preceding word, but with the given examples, we can't definitively determine this rule. It should be noted that ""walm"" never appears at the beginning of the input, so we cannot determine its behavior when it does not follow another word.

We can deduce the following rule:
Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it three or more times.",-0.4948474062440964,130,walm
"Walm -> repeating the color associated with the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it means that the color associated with the previous non-walm word should be repeated for the number of times that ""walm"" appears.

"Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever the input is solely ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" is combined with another nonce word ""zup,"" as in ""lug zup lug,"" the output follows the pattern ""blue yellow blue,"" with ""lug"" consistently translating to blue and suggesting ""zup"" translates to yellow.
- In the input ""zup wif walm lug,"" the corresponding output is ""yellow red red red blue,"" wherein ""lug"" remains consistently blue, ""zup"" remains yellow, and ""wif"" and ""walm"" both produce an output of red, although there's not enough information to determine if there's a distinction between ""wif"" and ""walm"" or if they both simply translate to red in this context.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently correlates with the output ""blue"". There is no variation in this relationship across the examples, so the simplest and most straightforward rule that can be deduced from the data given is:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""",-1.7988665113851852,131,lug
"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in the provided examples and their corresponding outputs. Let's look at each instance where ""dax"" is used and the color that follows it:

1. Input: ""dax walm wif"" | Output: ""green green green red""
2. Input: ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" | Output: ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
3. Input: ""zup dax zup wif"" | Output: ""yellow green yellow red""
4. Input: ""dax zup lug"" | Output: ""green yellow blue""
5. Input: ""dax wif"" | Output: ""green red""

Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" follows it in the output. There is no instance where ""dax"" is followed by a different color. It seems that ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green,"" regardless of its position relative to other words in the sequence. None of the other words (""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,” ""bluf,” ""lug"") consistently map to ""green"" across different examples.

Based on the examples given, we have sufficient evidence to deduce the rule for ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.08415801931098794,131,dax
"From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the word ""dax.""

Looking at each instance where ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. In the first example, ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" we note this down as a possible meaning.

2. In the second example, ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup,"" the word ""dax"" is also followed by ""green."" This supports the initial observation that ""dax"" might mean ""green.""

3. The third example ""zup dax zup wif"" still has ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" which further supports our deduction.

4. In the fourth example ""dax zup lug,"" ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green.""

5. Finally, in ""dax wif,"" ""dax"" equates to ""green"" once again.

Considering all the examples where ""dax"" always correlates with ""green"" in the output, the rule seems consistent and can be deduced as:

Let's analyze each example:

Input: wif bluf dax walm

Explanation: The non-walm words map to their own colors: ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""bluf"" to red. The word ""dax"" seems to modify the meaning of ""walm,"" leading to the repetition of green three times.

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
Explanation: Here, each instance of ""walm"" that is not preceded by ""dax"" corresponds to a sequence of red repeats. The other words each map to a color, but ""walm"" consistently generates multiple reds unless modified by ""dax"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example. The nonce word ""walm"" is associated with multiple instances of the same color (green or red) in the output.

Let's analyze the examples one by one:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to red as well
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - Following ""walm,"" we see two additional greens aside from ""dax's"" green.

2. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - Following the first ""walm,"" another red is added.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red again
   - Following the second ""walm,"" two more reds are added.

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color represented by the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" If a word corresponds to a particular color, ""walm"" repeats that color two more times in sequence.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated two more times.",-0.21108490458938145,131,walm
"To figure out what ""walm"" means, we need to examine each input's response and see how the word ""walm"" influences the output.

Looking at the various examples:

- Whenever ""walm"" is included in the input, we see that the word following ""walm"" is repeated in the output color sequence. For example, if ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"", the output color is green, and ""green"" is repeated three times.
- It does not seem to matter where ""walm"" appears in the sequence for it to have this effect.
- The individual words seem to correspond to specific colors: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" to ""blue."" When ""walm"" is introduced, the color corresponding to the next word is repeated once more than it otherwise appears in the output.

From examples 3 and 4, we notice that zup takes the meaning of yellow outside the context of other color words that have been defined, such as wif, dax, and lug. When zup is paired with walm, as seen in example 5, it does not affect the color repetition pattern of walm.

"Based on the provided examples, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's analyze each example and its output:

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm

Given these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when it is not preceded by ""zup."" When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is in the output instead. However, if ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" this relationship does not hold. It's possible that the context of the word following ""bluf"" could change its meaning, or that there is not enough consistency in the examples to derive a definitive rule.

Considering all the information, the following rule might govern the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" unless it is directly preceded by ""zup,"" in which case the output color is ""yellow.""

bluf -> ""red"" ('default'), ""yellow"" (if preceded by ""zup"")",-0.07337316793427084,132,bluf

Output: red red blue       
Rule Observed: ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Rule Observed: ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""walm"" -> red

With the patterns observed, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" However, in the first example, ""bluf"" output is ""blue"", which might suggest that ""bluf"" could alter its meaning based on the context or that the first example contains an inconsistency with the other examples. 

Since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the majority of examples except where there may be an inconsistency, I am inclined to deduce the following:

bluf -> yellow

However, if we consider the possibility that there isn't an inconsistency and account for the first example, another potential rule could be:

bluf -> the color following ""lug"" if ""lug"" is the last word in the input sequence, otherwise ""yellow"".

Considering the given data, the first interpretation seems more consistent, hence:

Rule: bluf -> yellow",-0.07363445193789059,132,bluf
"From the given examples, we can observe the following:

Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
- Here, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'bluf' also corresponds to 'red', suggesting ""bluf"" could mean ""red"".

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- In this example, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'wif' to 'red', and 'dax' to 'green'. The placement of ""bluf"" is before 'wif' which is 'red', and its output is 'yellow', however, it follows 'zup' which also corresponds to 'yellow'. This does not confirm the meaning of ""bluf"" yet.

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- Again, 'zup' is 'yellow', and 'lug' is 'blue'. Here, ""bluf"" follows a sequence of 'zup' and 'lug' and translates to 'yellow', so ""bluf"" could be contextually representing the color preceding it, which is 'yellow' in this case.

Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
- Here, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'wif' to 'red', and ""bluf"" again corresponds to 'red'.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- In this last example, 'dax' is 'green', 'wif' is 'red', 'zup' is 'yellow', and 'walm' also corresponds to 'red'. ""Bluf"" comes after 'zup' which is 'yellow' and its output is also 'yellow'. This is consistent with the previous observation from the third example.

Considering the results of all examples given and the consistent representation of ""bluf"" colors after the term that precedes it, we can deduce that ""bluf"" means 'repeat the color of the preceding term'.

"To understand the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs given in the examples. Let's analyze each instance where walm appears and its corresponding output.

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green

Now, let's look for patterns.

- The word ""walm"" correlates with a sequence of colors in the output, where the number of colors is one more than the number of words preceding ""walm"".
- The replicated color in the output seems to be the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"".

For instance:
- In example 1, ""walm"" is preceded by one word ""wif"", which outputs ""red"", and the additional color is ""green"".
- In example 2, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" and the sequence has three ""red"" colors, following the color of the word immediately before ""walm"", which is ""red"".
- In example 5, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" and the sequence following it is three greens, which is the color corresponding to ""dax"".

The output before ""walm"" follows the normal pattern as observed for inputs without ""walm"", assigning a specific color to each different word.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Outputs a sequence of the same color that corresponds to the word immediately before it, repeated one more time than the number of words before ""walm"".",-0.0854363648034301,132,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look closely at the outputs in relation to the placement of ""walm"" in the inputs:

1. wif walm dax -> red red red green
   ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""dax"" at the end leads to ""green.""

2. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
   Here ""dax"" at the beginning leads to ""green,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red.""

3. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   ""zup"" at the beginning leads to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""lug"" leads to ""blue."" The last ""zup"" repeats its color ""yellow.""

4. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""

5. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
   ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" causes ""green."" 

The word ""walm"" in each case leads to a sequence of the same color that seems to be governed by the color of the word that immediately precedes it, except when ""walm"" is at the end, where it seems to follow the color rule of ""dax"" regardless of its position.

To compile the observations:
- After ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red"" with the last color keeping with the ""dax"" rule.
- After ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" again with the last color following the ""dax"" rule.
- After ""zup,"" the output is ""blue blue"" and then comes another ""zup"" producing ""yellow.""
- Observing the instances, the number of times the color repeats seems to correspond to the number of words after ""walm.""

Based on these inputs and outputs, ""walm"" appears to indicate a repetition of the color rule associated with the word immediately preceding it, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of words following ""walm"" in the input. However, ""walm"" always ends with the output color green, which might be a rule specific to the final position or an extension of the ""dax"" rule as it's usually the end color when ""dax"" is present.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word directly before it as many times as there are words following ""walm,"" with the sequence ending in ""green"" if ""walm"" is the last word.",-0.09008846002812904,132,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look at the pattern of inputs and their corresponding outputs and identify the recurring rules:

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- The word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""
- The word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" when it comes after ""walm,"" but with the color ""red"" when it precedes ""walm"".

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
- The word ""dax"" at the beginning translates to ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue.""
- ""wif walm"" together seems to yield ""red red.""

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
- The word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow.""
- The color pattern after ""walm"" continues as ""blue blue,"" the same as the color for ""lug.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- After ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is different from the other instances of ""walm.""

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- The word ""dax"" before ""walm"" this time correlates with ""green.""
- ""lug"" and ""zup"" maintain their color outputs of ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.
- Since ""dax"" appears before ""walm"" and after, it's translated as green in both instances when adjacent to ""walm,"" it could imply that ""walm"" changes the color outcome of the word following it to the color that word would have if ""dax"" preceded it.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

""walm"" -> causes the following word to be translated as if it had ""dax"" preceding it.

Rule: If ""walm"" appears before a color-related word, the output color of that word is modified to be the color it would be if ""dax"" were before it. If there's no word following ""walm,"" the pattern of colors that follow is not clear from the given examples. It's also possible that ""walm"" resets the color pattern or causes repetition of the last color seen before it, but there is not enough consistent evidence from the examples to define this part of its behavior.",-0.11471279376621507,132,walm
"walm -> reduplicates the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: When the word 'walm' appears in an input sequence, the output reflects the color associated with the word immediately before 'walm', repeated for as many times as 'walm' dictates (i.e., if 'dax' which outputs ""green"" precedes 'walm', the output will be a sequence of ""green"" following the standard pattern).",-1.4120047075763442,132,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the outputs relative to the positions of ""walm"" in the inputs:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output color sequence ends with ""green"" repeated.
- The number of ""green"" in the sequence is tied to the position of ""walm"":
  - In the first example, ""walm"" is the second word, so there is one ""green.""
  - In the second example, ""walm"" is the fourth word, so there are three ""green.""
  - In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" is the last word, and there are as many ""green"" in sequence as the positions leading to it minus one.
  - In the fifth example, ""walm"" is fourth, following ""dax,"" and there are two ""green,"" consistent with its position.

We can deduce a general rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is a sequence of ""green"" colors. The number of ""green"" matches the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence minus one.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and the output in the given examples.

- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
  Output: red red green green red red red blue red
  Note: The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" but we also see ""walm lug"" which maps to ""red blue."" ""Lug"" is new and not previously mapped, so ""walm"" there does not help inform its meaning yet.

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  Note: ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and so does ""walm"" in this context, indicating ""walm"" could mean ""green,"" or at least takes on the value of the color preceding it.

- Input: zup walm wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow red
  Note: ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" takes on this color before the sequence switches to ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

- Input: zup walm wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow red
  Note: This repeat example confirms the pattern observed in the preceding instance.

- Input: dax walm zup
  Output: green green green yellow
  Note: We have ""dax"" (green), followed by ""walm"" (also green), and then ""zup"" (yellow). This implies that ""walm"" either has the color green or is repeating the color of the word before it.

Taking the context of these examples into account, the most consistent rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word before it. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> It takes on or repeats the color attribute of the preceding word.",-0.09325217840995556,133,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us analyze the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red""
2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
3. ""zup walm wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red"" (this is presented twice with the same output)
4. ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow""

From the examples, we can make the following observations:

- The output words (colors) are always the same for the input words except where 'walm' is present:
  - ""wif"" represents ""red""
  - ""bluf"" represents ""green""
  - ""dax"" represents ""green""
  - ""lug"" represents ""blue""
  - ""zup"" represents ""yellow""

When analyzing the outputs where ""walm"" appears, it seems ""walm"" triggers repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that precedes it:

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

In each instance, the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the outputs. This suggests that ""walm"" is an operation that repeats the color output of the word before it three times.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and the outputs:

- In all examples where ""walm"" is present, the word immediately following ""walm"" is translated into a sequence of the same color repeated three times.
- The color that ""walm"" produces is not dependent on ""walm"" itself, but rather on the word following ""walm."" For example, when ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" the output is three times ""blue."" When ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is three times ""red,"" and so on.
- The word ""walm"" does not have a color coded to it; rather, it modifies the next word to be repeated three times in whatever color that word corresponds to.

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the color of the following word. The output is that color repeated three times.

Examples:
- ""walm lug"" results in ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.
- ""walm wif"" results in ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.",-1.1154135213701861,133,walm

2. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the corresponding output is ""green.""
3. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the corresponding output is ""yellow.""

In all cases, ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. This suggests that ""walm"" functions as a repetition indicator for the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions matches the number of times that word has occurred in the sequence before ""walm"". Let's examine the instances:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and since this is the first occurrence of ""zup"", ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated once (total appearances = 1).

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" correlates with green, and this is its first occurrence, so ""walm"" repeats ""green"" once (total appearances = 1).

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- The second ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""dax"" has appeared twice (2nd appearance), hence ""green"" is repeated twice.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" is in front of ""walm,"" and since this is its first occurrence, ""walm"" repeats ""red"" once (total appearances = 1).

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" which is on its second occurrence, therefore ""yellow"" is repeated twice for a total of three (""yellow"" occurrences before ""walm"" = 2).

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated. The number of repetitions is equal to the current total number of occurrences of that word in the sequence (including the one before ""walm"").

Therefore, when ""walm"" follows one of these words, the output is the color associated with that word repeated three times. For instance, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.

Output 3: blue blue red blue blue yellow

Input 4: dax walm wif bluf
Output 4: green green green red red

Input 5: wif bluf dax walm
Output 5: red red green green green

By observing these examples, we can infer that each instance of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the output. Here's the reasoning based on given examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" immediately follows, causing the output to repeat ""red"".
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word just before it for as many times as the instances of 'lug' that follow sequentially. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and we see ""blue"" repeated multiple times depending on the number of ""lug"" that come after ""bluf"".
- In the fourth and fifth examples, we see that the words after ""bluf"" have their colors repeated exactly once, which matches with the meaning we've inferred for ""bluf"".

Therefore, based on the given examples, we can define the rule as follows:

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the output, the repetition count equals the number of times the word that translates to ""blue"" follows it sequentially. If there's no immediate repetition of ""blue"", repeat the previous color once.",-0.1005110475458866,135,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for common patterns before and after its occurrence in the examples provided:

1. ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""red"".
2. When multiple instances of ""bluf"" occur, they are always followed by the same color.
3. ""bluf"" does not seem to be influenced by neighboring words since ""wif"" leads to ""red"" whether ""bluf"" is present or not.
4. The colors that follow ""bluf"" seem to create a pattern that corresponds to an emerging sequence.

Analyzing the sequences:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" showing a duplication of the color.
- In the second example, every ""lug"" after the first ""bluf"" is blue, and it seems that once ""bluf"" is mentioned, all subsequent ""lug"" are blue until the next color word is introduced.
- In the third example, both occurrences of ""bluf"" are followed by ""blue,"" although there's a color word ""lug"" intervening, suggesting that ""bluf"" might cause the color that proceeds it to ""stick"" until a new color is mentioned.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, multiple instances of ""bluf"" and subsequent descriptions of ""wif"" or ""dax walm"" show repeated color patterns.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" leads to the color red in every instance where it appears. However, the presence of ""wif"" following ""walm"" doesn't affect the color associated with ""walm,"" as it remains red. The other words in the sequence (""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug"") produce green, yellow, and blue respectively, independent of whether ""walm"" is present or not.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Without the presence of ""walm,"" ""wif"" assumes a color based on the previous word (for instance, ""zup wif"" gives yellow red, but ""zup walm wif"" changes it to yellow yellow yellow red). 

It is notable that the word before ""walm"" determines the repeated color for the output sequence until ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" which then causes the color to switch to red.

Hence, we can induce the following rule:

Here's the mapping from the provided examples:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-1.8580544277115947,136,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the patterns of correspondence between the input and the output.

In the first example:
- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by another ""yellow,"" which is what ""bluf"" must correspond to.

In the second example:
- Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and it is repeated both in the input and output, ""walm"" does not seem to appear in the output, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The final ""bluf"" once again corresponds to ""blue.""

In the third and fourth examples:
- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
- Just like in the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by another ""yellow."" ""Dax"" is new, and corresponds to ""green,"" but ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""yellow.""

In the last example:

- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" appears between a ""red"" and a ""blue"" in the output, it must correspond to ""red"" here.

In every example, the word ""bluf"" is placed after a word whose color we know. The output color for ""bluf"" is always the same as the color that comes before it. Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the input sequence.",-0.11682057506646668,136,bluf

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
3. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
4. Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
5. Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow

Analyzing the examples, we see that ""bluf"" is always translated to ""yellow."" However, the rules for the other words are not consistent across different inputs, which means ""bluf"" does not depend on context or the position within the sequence. Regardless of what precedes it or what follows it, ""bluf"" consistently results in ""yellow."" Also, notice that in the second example ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and then to ""blue"" again after ""bluf,"" continuing the established color pattern. This rules out the dependence of ""bluf"" on adjacent words or its position changing its meaning.

Based on the observations, the rule for ""bluf"" is straightforward and does not change according to context or position within the input string. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> yellow",-0.14665312122666674,136,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

Examples to support:
- In the second input, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" is followed by an output ""blue.""
- In the fourth input, ""dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" is again followed by an output ""blue.""
- The fifth input, ""wif bluf lug zup,"" also supports this as ""bluf"" results in the output ""red,"" but considering the pattern, ""wif"" appears to mean ""red,"" and thus ""bluf"" would mean ""blue."" 

Therefore, the rule I can induce from the given examples is: 
bluf -> blue.",-0.8634406495268001,136,bluf
"Considering the examples provided, let's examine the relationship between the Input and the corresponding Output:

- Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
It appears that both 'zup' and 'bluf' are translated to 'yellow' in the output.

- Input: lug walm wif lug bluf | Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
Here, 'lug' translates to 'blue', 'walm' has no direct translation, and 'wif' translates to 'red'. Again, 'bluf' translates to 'blue'.

- Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
This is the same as the first example.

- Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
'dax' translates to green. 'zup' and 'bluf' again both translate to 'yellow'.

- Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow
'wif' translates to 'red', 'lug' translates to 'blue', and 'zup' translates to 'yellow', while 'bluf' translates to 'red'.

Given these patterns, let's formulate the rule for 'bluf':

- When 'bluf' follows 'lug', it translates to 'blue'.
  Example: lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue

- When 'bluf' follows 'zup' or 'wif', or 'bluf' follows no word at all, it translates to 'yellow'.
  Examples:
    zup bluf -> yellow yellow
    wif bluf -> red red
    zup bluf -> yellow yellow

- When 'bluf' follows 'dax', it translates to 'yellow'.
  Example: dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow

However, we have an inconsistency with the third rule. When 'bluf' follows 'wif' in the last input, it results in 'red'. Since we only have that occurring once in the last example, we don't have enough data to distinguish whether it's a general pattern or an exception. Thus, the ruleset for 'bluf' is not fully clear with the provided data.

Based on the majority of the information we have, the most consistent rule for 'bluf' we can deduce so far is: 

Rule: 'bluf' often translates to 'yellow', but may take on the color of the preceding word under specific, unclear circumstances.",-1.2099620660005679,136,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red when preceded by wif, blue when following lug, yellow when following zup, and green when following dax.",-1.3294086806339995,136,bluf
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the examples given and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

5. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

From these examples, we can try to find a pattern that connects the input with the output.

If we look at the element that appears immediately before ""walm"" in the input and its corresponding color in the output, we notice something interesting:

1. In the first example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
2. In the second example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. In the third example, there are two occurrences:
   - ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"".
   - ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"".
4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"".
5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"".

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""walm"" means to repeat the color that corresponds to the word right before it, three times. In essence, ""walm"" replicates the color of the previous word thrice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-0.05269834381602778,136,walm
"Observing the examples provided, we can look for patterns that will help us deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm."" Let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   
4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   
5. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

We should look for what happens specifically when ""walm"" appears in the input and how it correlates to the output.

From the examples, we can see the following patterns:
- In every output, each occurrence of ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color that precedes it, three times. 
- ""Walm"" does not correlate with any new color; instead, it repeats the last mentioned color.

So our rule can be described as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the last mentioned color three times.",-0.07204407407363891,136,walm
"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to represent a repetition of the color signified by the word immediately preceding it. It's also worth noting that it seems to repeat the color three times. Here's how the rule applies to each given example:

1. In ""zup wif lug zup walm"", ""zup"" means ""yellow"". ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"".
2. In ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"", ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm"", which outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. In ""zup lug walm wif walm"", ""lug"" means ""blue"", and when followed by ""walm"" it outputs ""blue blue blue"". Later, ""wif"" means ""red"" and is followed by ""walm"", which outputs ""red red red"".
4. In ""dax walm wif walm zup"", ""dax"" means ""green"", and when followed by ""walm"" it outputs ""green green green"". Subsequently, ""wif"" means ""red"" and when followed by ""walm"" it outputs ""red red red"".
5. In ""dax zup dax walm"", ""dax"" means ""green"", and when followed by ""walm"", it outputs ""green green green"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word three times.",-0.3943412089167128,136,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we analyze how it modifies the sequence of colors in the output:

- Whenever ""walm"" occurs in the input, a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" is seen in the output.
- The number of repetitions is equal to the number of occurrences of ""walm"" plus one.

For example:
1. In the first input ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") is followed by ""walm,"" and the sequence ends with three yellows in the output.
2. In the second input ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and again we have three yellows at the end.
3. In the third input ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" two consecutive ""walm"" after ""wif"" result in three reds in the output.
4. In the fourth input ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" two consecutive ""walm"" after ""wif"" lead to three reds, with the ""dax"" immediately before the first ""walm"" leading to three greens.
5. In the fifth input, ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in four consecutive greens in the output.

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the last color to be repeated depending on the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned consecutively after it, plus one repetition.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word in the output, one additional time for each occurrence of ""walm.""",-0.5236775333699075,136,walm
"Observing the provided examples, it seems each word corresponds to a specific color with repetition based on a certain condition. Here's the mapping from the given inputs and outputs:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax zup,"" it's ""yellow yellow yellow.""

4. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
5. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it's ""red red red.""

From this, we can infer that ""walm"" means repeating the color of the previous word three times if the preceding word is a primary color (""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""dax"") and two times if it is a secondary color (""zup"").

2. ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green."" ""Dax"" is used once, and ""green"" appears three times which could mean that it is a repeating pattern and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" gives ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Dax"" occurs once and is followed by ""green."" The rest of the sentence contains words that match with different colors, but ""dax"" still means ""green.""

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can look at the input-output pairs to find patterns. Each example shows the word ""wif"" in different contexts and corresponding color outputs. By examining each context it appears in, we can derive its meaning as follows:

1. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" -> red yellow yellow red green
2. ""wif zup bluf lug"" -> red yellow yellow blue
3. ""dax wif"" -> green red
4. ""wif"" -> red
5. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> red blue green green green

By looking at examples 3 and 4, it's clear that ""wif"" corresponds to red, as there are no other words to provide context and the output is solely red. This is reinforced by the first word in each of the other three examples, where ""wif"" also corresponds to red at the beginning of the sequence.

Therefore, the rule based on the provided examples is:

wif -> red",-0.13001000887144742,137,wif

- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- The word ""walm"" has only appeared once, after ""dax,"" and since ""dax walm"" produced ""green green,"" it might not have an influence on the color or it could itself correspond to ""green.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" itself translates to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input.

- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green green red red.""
- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue red.""

Given that ""bluf"" preceded by ""zup"" results in two yellows followed by a red, preceded by ""dax"" results in three greens followed by two reds, and preceded by ""lug"" results in two blues followed by a red, it may indicate that ""bluf"" adopts the color mentioned in the word that precedes it (implying a repeating pattern of that color), followed by a red.

"Analyzing the examples given, we can determine a pattern for the word 'walm' by looking at its position in the input sequence and the corresponding output sequence. We are trying to establish a rule that determines the meaning of 'walm' based on its context:

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - 'lug' translates to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red'. After 'walm', there are three 'red's.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf

5. Input: zup walm

Input: zup wif lug zup walm

The word ""walm"" appears to consistently cause the word after it (if any) to be repeated three times in the output. When ""walm"" is at the end of an input, the word before it is repeated three times in the output. 

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> repeat the next word/color in the output three times. If ""walm"" is the last word, repeat the previous word/color instead.",-0.07814668891865119,137,walm
"From the examples given, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word that comes before it. Here is how we can break it down:

1. Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- Following ""wif"" we see ""red"" repeated three times which corresponds to ""walm""

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- Then ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated two more times
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- The sequence ends with a nonsensical word ""bluf"" that does not produce a color in the output.

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- Another ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""

walm -> Repeat the color word that precedes it three times.",-0.09159126783718606,137,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the input and output sequences. Let's align the inputs with their respective outputs:

1. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
2. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
3. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
4. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

From the examples, we can deduce the following individual mappings before and after ""walm"":
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when it appears before ""walm""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and it appears both before and after ""walm""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when it appears before ""walm""
- In the second example, ""walm lug"" results in a double ""yellow,"" which indicates that the repetition of color could be a function of ""walm""
- If we try the same logic on ""lug,"" which appears after ""walm"" in the fourth example, it translates to a single ""blue"" instead of a repetition, questioning the earlier repetition assumption

Focusing more closely on ""walm"":
- In the first example, where ""walm"" is after ""wif,"" it's followed by three ""reds."" No other word has this effect, indicating a potential multiplication of the previous color.
- In the second example, the appearance of ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in three ""yellows,"" which seems to support the repetition/multiplication effect seen with ""wif.""
- The third and fourth examples further support this triplet effect after ""walm.""
- Lastly, ""walm"" by itself in the fifth example still results in three ""yellows,"" consistent with the previous patterns.

Based on this analysis, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the color of the word immediately preceding it to be outputted three times.

- Whenever the input includes ""wif"" by itself, the output is ""red"".

- This repeating pattern is disrupted by other words, which seem to have their own corresponding color: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""bluf"" to ""red"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns associated with this nonce word in the examples given. The patterns should help us understand the conditions under which the term `walm` occurs and the output it generates.

The examples provided are consistent in using ""walm"" as a term that is directly translated in the output:

1. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
2. Input: dax walm zup | Output: green green green yellow
3. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
4. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm | Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug | Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Looking at the examples, let's analyze them one by one:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and translates to the second ""green"" in the output. However, ""dax"" also translates to ""green,"" so no additional information about ""walm"" is gleaned here, as ""walm"" appears to simply replicate the color associated with ""dax.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"" but the output for ""walm"" remains ""green,"" consistent with ""dax.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" The first instance of ""walm"" here translates to a ""green,"" which deviates from the preceding ""red."" For the second instance of ""walm,"" it translates to two sequential ""blue,"" which follows ""lug,"" which also translates to ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and translates to a single ""red,"" which is consistent with ""wif.""

From these observations, it looks like ""walm"" does not have a consistent translation into a color of its own but rather takes on or influences the output based on its neighboring words or context. Notably, when positioned after ""dax"" and ""wif"" it results in ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, despite the natural translation of ""dax"" and ""wif"" being ""green"" and ""red"" themselves. When positioned after ""lug,"" it results in a duplicated color of the one associated with ""lug,"" namely ""blue blue.""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" itself doesn't have an intrinsic color associated with it but rather it potentially extends or affects the output color related to the previous word. So, if the previous word is associated with a color, ""walm"" may either repeat or extend that color in some way. This behavior, however, is not entirely consistent since in example 4 ""walm"" results in a change from ""red"" to ""green,"" which suggests that the surrounding context might influence its output.

Given these observations, we might tentatively say that ""walm"" affects the color output based on the previous word or context but does not have a consistent direct translation into a color on its own.

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"": Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green."" This results in ""walm"" repeating the color ""green"" three times.

2. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green yellow"": ""walm"" is following ""dax"" (green) again, but this time, there is an additional color ""zup"" (yellow) that doesn't affect the repetition of ""green"" induced by ""walm.""

3. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue"":
   - ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" so ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"", these are not directly followed by ""walm,"" so they remain singular.
   - ""wif lug walm"" leads to ""red blue blue blue,"" as ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"":
   - In the last repetition of ""walm,"" we only see ""red"" repeated three times, and no extra ""blue"" despite ending with ""lug."" It's worth noting that ""walm"" is only affecting colors that directly precede it, not following.

Considering these examples, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

So the meaning assigned to ""walm"" based on the given context is:

walm -> causes the repetition of the preceding color word three times.",-0.21682555413819157,138,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided.

- In the first and third examples, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Since the input is identical in both cases and the output is consistent, ""walm"" in this context could be responsible for the repetition of ""green.""

- In the second example, adding ""zup"" to ""dax walm"" adds ""yellow"" to the output. This implies that ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and that ""walm"" is not directly responsible for the appearance of ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" results in ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue."" From the earlier examples, we know:
  - ""dax"" is likely associated with ""green.""
  - ""zup"" is likely associated with ""yellow.""
So the new words here are ""wif,"" associated with the first ""red,"" and ""lug,"" associated with the first ""blue."" The second ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" and the sequence becomes ""blue blue blue,"" similar to how ""green green green"" appears after ""dax.""

- The fifth example has ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" correlating to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Here, the occurrence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" is followed by ""red red red,"" much like the previous pattern observed with ""green"" and ""blue.""

Considering these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the word right before it three times. The color depends on the word, and ""walm"" repeats that color.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.23835118841404274,138,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided where the nonce word ""walm"" is used and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to derive what ""walm"" might mean or the rule it represents:

- In examples where ""walm"" is used, the output always includes ""green"". 
- It is notable that ""green"" is repeated exactly three times whenever ""walm"" appears. 
- When other colored outputs appear, they are not consistently associated with the appearance of ""walm"". They may depend on other words in the input.
- The words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""blue,"" and presumably ""blue"" respectively, based on their occurrences and positions in the inputs and outputs.

Given this information, we can deduce a rule for the word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of three ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input.

- 'dax' appears at the beginning, middle, and end of the sequences, always resulting in 'green' in the corresponding place in the outputs.

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look for patterns in its use:

In all examples, zup is followed by a different word (e.g. wif, bluf, walm, lug) or by zup itself. The output after zup is always ""yellow,"" regardless of the following word. This suggests that zup translates to ""yellow.""

Let's verify this with each example:

1. Input: dax zup wif -> Output: green yellow red
   ""zup"" is between ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue green blue
   After ""wif"" (red), ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf"" (yellow), and so on.

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   The two instances of ""zup"" both result in ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" both are translating to ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup lug dax lug -> Output: yellow blue green blue
   ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"". The word ""zup"" means ""yellow"" in the given examples.",-0.16560381584593023,139,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" does not correlate with a consistent single color, as it precedes ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green"" at different times. Instead, ""zup"" seems to be a function that changes the color referred to by the following word.

Starting with the first example, ""zup"" seems to cause ""wif"" to output ""red,"" which would imply that ""wif"" without ""zup"" might mean ""green,"" seeing as how the output still includes ""green."" However, by looking at the second example, ""wif"" comes before ""zup"" and the output is ""red,"" which breaks this potential rule.

In the second example, ""dax"" comes before and after ""zup"" but outputs different colors (""green"" and ""blue""). This implies that ""zup"" affects the output that follows it. The word after ""zup"" outputs a color that is not based simply on its own meaning, and ""zup"" doesn't affect colors output by words before it.

Additionally, in the third example, we see that ""zup bluf lug zup"" outputs ""yellow yellow blue yellow."" The repeating ""zup"" leads to repeated ""yellow,"" but it doesn't affect the ""blue"" that follows ""lug."" This indicates that ""zup"" causes the next word to output ""yellow"" regardless of what the word usually means.

The fourth example, ""zup walm,"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" by itself causes the output ""yellow,"" and that ""walm"" (which probably means ""yellow"" by itself based on this and the inclusion in the second sentence) also outputs ""yellow.""

In the fifth example, ""zup lug dax lug"" converts to ""yellow blue green blue."" Here, ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" which results in ""yellow,"" although ""lug"" by itself seems to represent ""blue."" So, ""zup"" affects the meaning of ""lug,"" but not the second occurrence of ""lug.""

Based on this analysis, we can determine the rule for ""zup"" as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" -> Changes the next word in the sequence to output ""yellow,"" regardless of the word's inherent color.",-0.6608284803374418,139,zup

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the recurring patterns associated with each instance of ""walm"" in the given examples:

1. In the first and fourth examples, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since the word ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" the presence of ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color associated with the preceding word, resulting in three yellows instead of one.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red green."" We can see that ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""dax"" corresponds to green, while ""lug"" corresponds to blue. The word ""walm"" appearing after ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" being replicated two more times.

3. In the third example, ""zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the word ""walm"" follows it, ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated two additional times.

4. In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""wif"" corresponds to red, but we observe ""green"" repeated two additional times before the red which suggests that ""walm"" is responsible for this.

Based on these observations, the rule for the word ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated two additional times.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" has a meaning tied to repetition. Specifically, it appears to indicate that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated three times:

- In the second and third examples, ""lug walm"" results in the output being ""blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" is likely associated with the color blue.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" following it leads to the output ""green green green"".

2. When the input is ""dax wif dax,"" the output is ""green red green."" This suggests that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" while ""wif"" may represent ""red.""
3. When ""dax"" appears alongside other nonce words such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" or ""bluf,"" it still corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Now let's analyze the third input-output pair in detail: 

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Here we see the string 'dax' followed by 'wif' results in 'green red,' confirming the second example where 'dax wif dax' gave 'green red green.'

Let's look at the order of the nonces and their corresponding colors:
- ""zup"" appears twice and both times it precedes ""yellow"" which would indicate ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" only appears once and it precedes ""blue"" indicating that ""lug"" could translate to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" appears before two ""yellow"" outputs, suggesting a possible rule, but without more examples of ""walm,"" it is difficult to confirm with certainty.
- ""bluf"" also only appears once and is followed by ""red red,"" it's unclear if ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" or if some other rule is applying.

Finally, considering the fourth example:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

If ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" then the remaining ""walm"" corresponds to the additional ""red"" in the output, however, this is inconsistent with the third input-output pair where ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow.""

Considering all the examples, it is evident that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the string of nonce words.

- A single instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", but given it is preceded by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" in all other instances, we're seeing a repetitive pattern that suggests ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the repetition of ""red"" is due to the appearance of ""wif"".

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax

Based on these observations, the rule we can deduce is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> blue.",-0.07214667676931183,140,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color ""red"" when it is the second word in the sequence, and to ""blue"" in all other positions. However, since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in every instance except when it is preceded by ""lug,"" and there's no example of ""bluf"" as the first word or following ""dax,"" we do not have complete information about its behavior in those cases.

In the first example, ""bluf"" is the last word and corresponds to ""blue.""
In the second example, ""bluf"" is the fourth word and still corresponds to ""blue.""
In the third, ""bluf"" is the second word and corresponds to ""red.""
In the fourth, ""bluf"" is again the second word and corresponds to ""red.""
In the fifth, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which results in ""blue,"" and when it is the last word, it corresponds to ""blue"" as well.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" means ""red"" when it is the second word in the sequence unless it is directly following the word ""lug,"" in which case it means ""blue"". In all positions except the second or following ""lug,"" ""bluf"" means ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at how it's used in various inputs and the corresponding outputs.

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

From the examples given, we can propose the following observations:
1. ""walm"" when preceded by ""lug"" leads to a series of three ""blue"" in the output. Example 1 and 3 showcase this rule.
2. ""walm"" followed by another word that is not ""lug"" leads to ""green"" in the output, and it appears to cause a repetition of ""green"" until another color (or possibly word) follows. Example 2 and 5 demonstrate this effect.
3. Example 4 also follows the repetition rule but we see after ""walm"" there’s a different word ""wif"" which is followed by a ""red"" indicating the pattern is broken after ""walm"" is followed by a word that prompts a new color in the output.

Rule:
Walm -> a series of three identical colors; ""blue"" when following ""lug,"" ""green"" when following ""dax,"" and that series continues until a different color word appears in the input or the end of the input is reached.",-0.06290567881243751,140,walm
"From the given examples, we can induce the rule that determines the meaning of ""walm."" To figure this out, we look at what corresponds to ""walm"" in the output.

1. In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" We can see that each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"" in the output.

2. In the second example, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" Again, ""walm"" leads to three sequential ""blue"" in the output.

3. In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" As before, ""walm"" leads to the output of three ""blue.""

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red."" Following the ""walm,"" we again see three ""green,"" which aligns with the previous pattern if we assume that ""walm"" generates three of whichever color corresponds to the word that precedes it (in this case, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"").

5. In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" Once again, after ""dax walm,"" we have three ""green."" Given that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and it doesn't affect the triad of green, we can confirm that ""walm"" generates three of the color of the preceding word, regardless of what follows.

Rule: walm -> Generates three of whatever color is associated with the preceding word.",-0.07827163822921872,140,walm
"To deduce the rule of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of output colors relative to the position of ""walm"" and the words around it.

In every example where ""walm"" appears, the output includes a series of the color blue:

1. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
2. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
3. lug walm -> blue blue blue
4. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
5. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red

It's evident that ""walm"" translates to multiple instances of the color blue. Looking closely, it seems that ""walm"" results in three blue colors that follow adjacent to its position in every instance.

Based on the examples given, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: walm -> a series of three blue colors following its position.",-0.09652888349197918,140,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, we can come up with the following observations:

- The output has a repeated number of color names whenever ""walm"" is present in the input.
- The number of color repetitions matches the number of words in the input pattern prior to ""walm.""
- The color that is repeated is based on the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

Here are the examples with the patterns identified:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Pattern: ""lug"" before the first ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of ""blue""; ""zup"" before the second ""walm"" leads to one ""yellow"" preceding three ""blue.""

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Pattern: ""lug"" before ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of ""blue.""

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Pattern: ""lug"" before ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of ""blue.""

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   Pattern: ""dax"" before ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of ""green,"" with no repeated pattern following ""walm"" for the remaining words.

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   Pattern: ""dax"" before ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of ""green,"" followed by the color corresponding to the words after ""walm.""

Based on these patterns, ""walm"" acts as a trigger to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" The number of repetitions corresponds to the count of words preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> triggers the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of words before ""walm."" 

For instance, ""dax walm"" results in ""green"" being said three times because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and there is one word before ""walm.""",-0.10459465064079172,140,walm
"Reviewing the examples given, I will analyze each instance where the nonce word ""walm"" is used and figure out the corresponding output pattern:

1. lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" seen in all examples. ""walm"" must account for the duplication of ""blue"" following its appearance.

2. dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" seen in the last three examples. Again, ""walm"" must cause the duplication of the color, ""green"" in this case.

3. zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in the duplication of ""blue."" After ""dax"" (which is ""green""), ""walm"" results in the duplication of ""green.""

From these patterns, it seems that the word ""walm"" when used after another word causes the output of that word's corresponding color to be repeated three times in total.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's compare the input and output of each example to identify a pattern.

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. dax walm wif -> green green green red
3. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
4. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

Based on these examples, the color that follows ""dax"" consistently changes even when the word before ""dax"" remains the same. This suggests that ""dax"" does not relate to a specific color. However, in each output, the word ""dax"" is represented by the color green. 

There is no clear variation in the color associated with ""dax"" as it follows the pattern of being green regardless of the surrounding words. Hence, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.09268814419302568,141,dax

3. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
4. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
5. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow""

By reviewing these examples, we can observe that every occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. This is consistent across all the examples given, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input string or the other words present.

- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green

- ""walm"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue

However, the color for ""walm"" seems to change from blue to red when in combination with ""wif"" as seen in example 2 and example 5.

   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red""

From the given examples:

- Every instance of ""wif"" in the inputs corresponds to ""red"" in the outputs.
- The instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- The instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- The instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- The example ""walm"" seems to correspond to an additional ""red"" or ""blue"" (which is the same color as ""lug"") based on the surrounding context since it appears before ""dax"" and also directly adjacent to ""lug"".

Now, let's look for patterns in the sequences:

- In the 1st and 3rd examples, ""wif"" alone is followed by ""red"".
- In the 2nd example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"", and it is the last word in the sequence before the output.
- In the 4th example, ""wif"" appears three times and is followed by ""red"" twice, coinciding with the position of ""lug"" which also translates to ""blue"".
- In the 5th example, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" and is the first word in the sequence. 

From these observations, it seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" independent of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

- In the first example, ""zup"" produces ""yellow"" when it follows ""dax"" (which produces ""green"") and when it precedes ""wif"" (which produces ""red"").
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that both ""zup"" and ""walm"" translate to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and then ""dax,"" which translates to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" and ""lug"" translate to ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively, and ""walm"" continues to translate to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug zup"" translates into ""blue yellow,"" confirming that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position.

"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output, but its exact color is dependent on the preceding word. Let's try to derive the rule by examining each input and its corresponding output.

- In the first example, ""dax lug bluf"" becomes ""green blue blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"".
- The second example, ""wif bluf,"" turns into ""red red"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red"".
- In the third example, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"". Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and becomes ""blue"" and follows ""zup"" to become ""yellow"".
- For the fourth example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green yellow red green green"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green"".
- In the final example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" we get ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""bluf"" following ""zup"" becomes ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

By analyzing these patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word:

- After ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""green"".
- After ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""red"".
- After ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"".
- After ""lug"", ""bluf"" remains ""blue"" as no color is specified for ""lug"" but it is directly associated with ""blue"" in the examples.

- ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- No word present or ""walm,"" there is no pattern provided.

- ""wif"" is associated with red, so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow, so ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- ""lug"" is associated with blue, so ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue.""

When ""bluf"" follows a word not given in the examples or is at the beginning of a sequence (""lug walm"" being an exception which may be a typo or an error, as ""walm"" does not precede any output pattern), it is not possible to determine the meaning of ""bluf"" from the provided examples.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between its appearance in the input and the corresponding output.

- In the first example, the output sequence is ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"" which corresponds to ""dax walm zup lug walm"". Since ""dax"" correlates with a single ""green"" before the sequence ""walm zup lug walm"" which translates to ""green green yellow blue blue blue,"" it suggests that ""walm"" contributes to the repetition of the preceding color. This is reinforced by the fact that we see three ""green"" before the color changes to ""yellow"" and then to ""blue"" indicates another change after ""lug"".

- In the second example, the sequence ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" results in ""blue blue blue green red blue red"". Here, ""lug walm"" correlates to the repetition of ""blue,"" and ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red,"" suggesting again that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the preceding color and that ""wif"" correlates to a switch to red after ""dax"".

- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". We can observe ""bluf wif"" corresponds to ""red red"", indicating that ""bluf"" has a direct red association, and ""walm"" again confirms the repetition as we see ""red"" repeated after ""wif"".

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"". This reiterates that ""walm"" is connected to the repetition of the preceding color.

- Finally, the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red blue"". Here, ""lug walm"" leads to repeated ""blue,"" and after ""wif"" we see a change suggesting that ""wif"" is associated with the color change, and after that ""lug"" alone corresponds to a single ""blue"".

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to be a function word that directs the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. When ""walm"" follows a color word (""dax,"" ""lug,"" or ""zup""), it results in the repetition of the color output.

1. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"":
   - The word ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and prior to ""zup"" and ""lug"", turning them into ""green"". 
   - After the second ""walm"", no other color word is mentioned, so we see the pattern repeating with ""blue"".

2. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""blue blue blue green red blue red"":
   - Following ""lug walm"", ""dax"" becomes ""green"".
   - ""wif"" remains ""red"" and is unaffected by ""walm"".

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"":
   - ""walm"" at the end of the sequence doesn't change ""wif"" which remains ""red"".

4. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"":
   - ""zup"" becomes ""yellow"" both times after ""walm"".

5. ""lug walm wif lug"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue"":
   - Following ""lug walm"", the word ""lug"" becomes ""blue"". 
   - ""wif"" isn't changed by ""walm"" and remains ""red"".

From these observations, it seems like ""walm"" causes the next noun in the sequence to repeat its associated color until a different noun appears. ""walm"" itself doesn't have a fixed color but impacts the repetition of color words that follow. 

For example, if ""dax"" corresponds to a color, after encountering ""walm"" the color for ""dax"" (green) continues until a new noun comes up, despite what the original color for the new noun would have been. The change persists through repeated instances of the new noun or until ""wif"" is encountered, which seems to be an exception and does not change color after ""walm"".

Rule:
walm -> Causes the next noun's associated color to repeat until a different noun or ""wif"" appears. ""wif"" remains red regardless.",-0.08300116802083876,141,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we will examine the pattern of colors in the output each time ""walm"" appears in the input.

Let's check the occurrences:

1. First example: dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue.
2. Second example: lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red.
3. Third example: zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red.
4. Fourth example: zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow.
5. Fifth example: lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue.

From these examples, we can gather the following observations about ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the sequence of colors includes an additional green followed by a yellow and a transition to blue.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated and then followed by a transition to a new color (red in the second example).
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color yellow is repeated.
- ""Walm"" appearing after ""bluf"" and ""wif"" results in a repetition of red.

So, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repeat of the color associated with the preceding word, followed by a transition to another color or continuation of colors in sequence.

Rule: walm -> (a) repeat the color of the preceding word, (b) follow with a transition to the next color in a sequence or a repeating pattern of colors based on context.",-0.0983503038882151,141,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we need to find a pattern in the examples given. Let's look at where ""walm"" appears and how it is represented in the output:

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears twice, and both times it is followed by a series of three colors, first green and then blue. 
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by a series of three blue.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by three red.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by two additional yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by three blue.

From the output patterns, we can infer that ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of three identical colors. Now let's look at which colors are chosen for the sequence:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the sequence is green.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the sequence is blue.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the sequence is yellow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it's not followed directly by ""walm,"" but the output for ""wif"" is singularly red.

Since ""walm"" does not itself determine the color but instead repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it, we can induce that ""walm"" represents a rule where it repeats the color output of the word before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-1.1226236297946235,141,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Each time ""walm"" occurs, the color that was outputted before is repeated for the same number of times ""walm"" appears. 

For example:
- In the first example ""dax walm"", green is repeated three times because ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""walm"" is stated twice, indicating two additional repetitions of green.
- In the third example ""wif walm"", red is repeated three times because ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""walm"" indicates to repeat the preceding color twice.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding word an additional number of times (equal to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned).
",-1.337955046875269,141,walm
"Analyzing the provided input and output pairs, we can attempt to infer the meaning or rule attached to the nonce word ""lug.""

In the first example, ""dax lug wif"" becomes ""green blue red,"" and the word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.

In the second example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" becomes ""red red blue yellow,"" and again, the word ""lug"" comes out as blue.

In the third example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow,"" which maintains the pattern of ""lug"" translating to blue.

In the fourth example, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" turns into ""green yellow red red blue,"" where again ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

In the fifth example, ""zup lug bluf wif"" changes to ""yellow blue blue red,"" maintaining the consistent association of ""lug"" with blue.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""lug"" appears to be consistent and straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue",-0.07591600665532584,142,lug
"From the given examples, each word seems to translate into a specific color:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""

The word ""lug"" must then correspond to the color that fills in the pattern correctly. Looking at the outputs, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" follows. Thus, we can deduce that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue",-0.9733246593280901,142,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can identify that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" There is no instance where ""lug"" maps to a different output. Therefore, we can conclude that:

"Let us examine each input and output pair to deduce the rule for ""dax"":

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red

   Output: red yellow green green

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green

Analyzing the patterns:

- In each output, ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- The words following ""dax"" are the same color as the word that directly precedes ""dax"".
- The word that follows ""dax"" does not seem to be influenced by it, and has its own color consistent with other instances where that content word appears.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and it also influences the words immediately after it to take on the color of the word immediately before ""dax"".

Rule: dax -> green. Additionally, the word that follows ""dax"" assumes the color of the word preceding ""dax"".",-0.07670548365951724,142,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", let's analyze each example and identify patterns associated with the appearance of ""dax"" and its output:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   
2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

3. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green

Now, let's look at patterns:
- In examples 1 and 4, ""dax"" is the first word, and the first color in the output is green.
- In examples 2 and 3, when ""dax"" is at the end or in the middle, the word immediately after generates a ""green"" in the output.
- In example 5, where ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which is associated with ""green"" in example 3, confirms the pattern seen in examples 2 and 3 of ""dax"" being followed by ""green.""

From these observations we can deduce that ""dax"" changes the color associated with the very next word in the sequence to ""green."" 

If the word following ""dax"" already maps to ""green,"" this might be redundant and not observable in these examples since the output remains ""green.""

Based on this analysis, the meaning of ""dax"" in context to the provided sequences is:

dax -> a modifier that changes the color associated with the next word in the sequence to green. Rule: When ""dax"" precedes a word, the output for that word is ""green.""",-0.07911099097551721,142,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" However, before finalizing that ""dax"" simply means ""green,"" let's analyze the position of ""dax"" in each sentence and the corresponding outputs to check if there are any positional rules associated with it.

In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" which is then translated to ""green green green red red red."" This output does not immediately suggest a clear pattern as the word ""walm"" appears twice without ""dax"" and still outputs ""red red red."" However, all instances of ""walm"" after ""dax"" are translated to ""green.""

In the second example, ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" and the output for both is ""red"" followed by ""green,"" indicating that the presence of ""dax"" may independently result in ""green,"" regardless of the preceding word.

In the third example, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and it's still ""green"" while ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" The output for ""bluf"" after ""dax"" is ""green"" as well, suggesting that ""dax"" might affect the following word, but there's not enough data to confirm this.

In the fourth and fifth examples, ""dax"" again translates to ""green,"" and any word that follows ""dax"" also translates to ""green"" (""lug walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""blue blue green"" and ""lug bluf"" after ""dax"" results in ""blue green green""), which supports the idea that ""dax"" might affect the following word as well as itself.

Hence, based on the examples, a tentative rule for the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: When ""dax"" is present in an input, it becomes ""green"" in the output, and any word that directly follows ""dax"" also becomes ""green,"" regardless of what it would normally translate to.

So, dax -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""Dax"" translates to ""green"" and causes the directly following word to also translate to ""green.""",-0.7464202817691951,142,dax
"Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""dax"" is followed by an output series that begins with ""green"". The succession of colors that follow ""green"" seems to depend on the word that comes after ""dax"". Here are the observations:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is a series of ""green"" followed by a series of ""red"".
2. When ""dax"" is on its own or followed by any other word not identified with a specific color (like ""lug"" or ""wif""), the output is a ""green"" followed by a repetition of the color associated with the word following ""dax"".
3. ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", as shown by their repeated placement and consistent output colors.
4. ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", as shown in the third input/output pair.
5. ""bluf"" has not yet shown a standalone color identification, but it consistently follows ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"".

Based on these observations, it seems that ""dax"" functions as a command that sets the output color to ""green"" initially and then affects the following outputs based on the subsequent word's associated color. The word following ""dax"" triggers a repetition of that word's associated color if it has one, or another series of ""green"" if it does not.

Rule: dax -> Initiates output with ""green"" and affects subsequent output colors based on the following word's associated color.",-1.0081899833586203,142,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" causes the output color to change to the next color in a sequence when there's a change from one unique word to another. The sequence of the colors appears to be red -> green -> blue -> yellow, and it cycles. Therefore, ""dax"" signifies a change in the output color sequence following the mentioned pattern.

In the first example, ""walm"" before ""dax"" results in an output of ""green"" and after ""dax"" it changes to ""red"", consistent with the other examples provided.

Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif walm"" (red to green) and then ""dax"" shifts the output to the next in sequence, which is red.
- ""wif zup"" (red to yellow), and then ""dax"" shifts the output to green (the next in the sequence after yellow, looping back through the sequence).
- ""lug walm"" (blue to green), and then ""dax"" shifts the output to blue (the next in the sequence after green).
- ""lug wif lug"" (blue, red, blue), and then ""dax"" again shifts to green (the next in the sequence).

Therefore, the rule is that ""dax"" represents a shift to the next color in the red -> green -> blue -> yellow sequence after a unique word.

Rule: dax -> When following a word, ""dax"" changes the output color to the next color in the sequence red -> green -> blue -> yellow, cycling back to red after yellow.",-1.0352190379659767,142,dax
"Given the examples provided, we can analyze the pairs of input and output to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif.""

From the first input/output pair:
Input: lug dax wif lug
Output: blue green red blue
It appears that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" because the other words in the sequence are paired with their respective colors.

Similarly, cross-checking with the other examples:

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
Here, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" fitting the pattern.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Once more, ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
In this instance as well, ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Given these consistent pairings, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",-0.06391743766122578,142,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Here is the breakdown of the provided examples and how ""wif"" fits within the pattern:

1. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""green"" (repeated twice)
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" appears to correspond to ""green"" (repeated once)
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

4. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red"" (or possibly is a variant of ""blue"" but in this context translates to ""red"")
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

5. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red"" in this pattern (though it corresponded to ""green"" in previous examples)
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" again seems to correspond to ""red"" (or possibly is a variant of ""blue"" but in this context translates to ""red"")

According to the above observations:

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

So we can write the rule as follows: wif -> red",-0.07842356289008601,142,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" is used to represent the color ""red.""

Here's how we arrive at this conclusion:

- In the first example, the sequence ""lug dax wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue green red blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" must correspond to ""red"" since it's placed between the two matching colors ""green"" and ""blue.""

- The second example, ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""walm"" has been translated to ""green green green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

- The third example supports the previous findings where ""wif"" is again translated to ""red.""

- The fourth example states ""wif bluf lug zup"" as ""red red blue yellow."" Since ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" it leaves ""wif"" and ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red red."" Based on previous patterns where ""wif"" matches ""red,"" it's safe to assume the same here, implying that ""bluf"" might have resulted in the second ""red.""

- The fifth example, ""wif walm lug bluf,"" which translates to ""red red red blue blue,"" shows that ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which previously has been established to be a sequence that repeats its respective color. With ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and two occurrences of ""red"" before the single occurrence of ""blue,"" it suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From these observations, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red",-0.30688752902150546,142,wif
"From the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Here is the justification based on each input/output pair:

1. In ""lug dax wif lug"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The word ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", and in the output ""wif"" is followed by ""red"". So, ""wif"" -> ""red"".
2. In ""zup wif dax walm lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""walm"" to ""green"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". The word ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" which is ""green"", and in the output, it is represented by ""red"".
3. In ""zup dax walm zup wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" to ""green"". The word ""wif"" is at the end and corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
4. In ""wif bluf lug zup"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""Wif"" starts the sequence and is followed by ""red"" in the output.
5. In ""wif walm lug bluf"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" to ""red"". The first ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" in the output.

Let's test this idea against the other examples:
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" Following our rule, ""walm"" results in subsequent colors being ""red,"" consistent with being the last word.
- In the third example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" Here too, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow"" until ""red"" appears, which is again consistent with our rule.
- The fourth example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" results in ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" Again, we see ""walm"" followed by a repeated color ""red.""
- The fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug,"" results in ""green green green yellow blue."" Consistent with the rule, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color right before it, ""green.""

Based on these examples, we can deduce the following rule:
Rule: ""walm"" -> ""Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before 'walm' for all subsequent words until the last word, then output 'red' for the last word."" 

This rule seems to predict the correct colors in all given examples. However, because we have limited data and do not see ""walm"" affecting different preceding colors differently, there might be additional complexities to the rule that are not captured in these examples.",-0.186690622296598,142,walm
"Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. 

In each example, ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated once:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow, so ""walm"" translates to yellow.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is associated with red, thus ""walm"" translates to red.
- In the third and fifth examples, we can see that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it multiple times, signifying every instance of ""walm"" is a repetition of the previous color.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is therefore translated to red. Since ""wif"" appears twice before ""walm,"" the repetition of red is observed three times in total output.

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> no direct color correspondence shown, but it's followed by yellow in the only given example

Now, looking at the specific appearances of ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue in ""lug bluf"" and red in ""wif bluf."" Since ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red, it seems that ""bluf"" possibly repeats the color of the word before it.

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which is yellow), the output after ""bluf"" is also yellow (""zup bluf dax"" results in ""yellow yellow green"").

3. When ""bluf"" appears at the end of a sequence, the color before it is repeated except for the very first example where it does not follow this rule (""dax zup lug bluf"" results in ""green yellow blue blue"", yet ""lug"" is blue and ""bluf"" should be blue following the identified rule).

Using these observations, the rule could be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it or adds an extra instance of the previous color, but there might be exceptions or additional conditions we need to account for, such as in the first example. However, the final example (""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue"") suggests ""bluf"" might sometimes take the color of a word even when it's not directly before ""bluf,"" which doesn't entirely fit the pattern.

Given the above observations, it's clear the rule isn't entirely consistent or maybe not all conditions were presented in the examples. To propose a general rule, we could assume:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally repeats the color of the preceding word, but exceptions may apply based on conditions not fully discerned from the given examples.

Thus, bluf -> repeat the last color mentioned before bluf.",-1.2082255209178945,143,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we need to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf.""

In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

In the second example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" but this time it follows the word ""lug"" which is also translated as ""blue."" However, we notice that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" both times it appears before ""bluf.""

In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif"" which is also translated as ""red.""

In the fourth example, we see ""bluf"" at the end of a longer sequence, and it corresponds to ""red"" again, following after the word ""wif.""

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is at the end and translates to ""blue,"" with ""lug"" preceding it, which also translates to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> blue,-1.935079957539264,143,bluf
"Through analysis of the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for the nonce word ""walm"" as follows:

In example 1, the sequence ""lug walm zup walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". If we consider ""lug"" to correspond to a single ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to correspond to a single ""yellow,"" we notice that ""walm"" doubles the color that comes after it.

In example 2, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here, we again see the ""lug"" associated with ""blue"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" coming after ""walm"" turns into ""red"" instead of the expected double ""blue."" This example challenges the previous rule that ""walm"" simply doubles the succeeding color.

In example 3, the input ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" provides the output ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" The ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to a triple ""blue,"" and ""lug zup"" results in alternating blue and yellow. This supports the notion that ""walm"" affects the following color phrase, possibly increasing the count.

In example 4, ""zup walm lug"" generates the output ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" This would indicate that ""walm"" after ""zup"" triples the ""yellow"" and has no bearing on the ""lug"" (blue) that follows.

In example 5, ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red."" This example shows that ""walm"" affects the following ""red"" to produce a triple ""red,"" similar to how it affected ""yellow"" and ""blue"" in previous examples.

Taking into account that ""walm"" does not always double the following color, but rather seems to triple the count of the next color in the output (as observed in examples 1, 3, 4, and 5)—but with an exception in example 2 where it resulted in a single ""red"" instead of a double ""blue,"" potentially because ""wif"" inherently has a different output —we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next color phrase to be repeated three times in the output. The colors associated with the words ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" seem to follow a pattern where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif,"" when not preceded by ""walm,"" corresponds to ""red."" When ""wif"" directly follows ""walm,"" the output deviates from the expected repetition and outputs a single ""red"" instead.",-0.0886643393398925,143,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can examine the given inputs and their corresponding outputs to search for patterns:

Looking at the inputs and outputs side by side:

1. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
2. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
3. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
4. zup walm lug -> yellow yellow yellow blue
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

From the examples, we can make some initial observations:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" when not following ""walm"" translates to ""red.""
  
To focus on what ""walm"" translates to, we notice:

1. After ""lug walm"" comes ""blue blue.""
2. After ""zup walm,"" comes ""yellow yellow.""
3. After ""wif walm,"" comes ""red red red.""

A consistent rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the next color to be repeated three times, except in the case where ""walm"" is immediately followed by another ""walm,"" in which case the color is repeated twice instead of three times.

So, considering the repeater observation and the variations presented, the rule appears to be: 

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color word that follows should be repeated three times unless another ""walm"" occurs directly after, in which case the color word is repeated only twice.",-0.116100461990258,143,walm
"Observing the relationship between the inputs and outputs, it appears that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color that immediately follows it. Here's the breakdown based on the examples given:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow. Thus, ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed again by ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, resulting in ""walm"" repeating ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow blue,"" meaning that ""walm"" still causes ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, thereby ""walm"" repeats ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and the corresponding output shows that ""red"" is repeated.

2. In the second example,""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" which outputs ""red"" and is also repeated three times.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" (yellow repeated thrice), but later ""wif"" (red) occurs after ""lug"" (blue), probably following the rule that new colors are introduced after a non-""walm"" word.
4. The fourth example again shows ""walm"" being followed by ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is also followed by ""wif,"" resulting in ""red"" repeated three times.

"Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" translates to a series of three consecutive colors. Looking closer, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color that would naturally follow based on the word preceding it:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the color yellow is repeated three times (as ""zup"" corresponds to yellow).

Applying the same logic to the last example:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between the input and output in each example:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

2. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

3. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

Looking at the output associated with the inputs, the word that comes before ""walm"" seems to set the color for the repetitions after ""walm"":

- In example 1, ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" three times.
- In example 2, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" three times, and the pattern repeats.
- In example 3, ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" three times.
- In example 4, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" three times, and there is no preceding word other than ""wif"".
- In example 5, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" three times.

The rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times. Therefore, we can formulate the rule as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a word, it causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the inputs and their corresponding outputs in sequence:

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
- Here, 'zup' generates 'yellow', while 'lug' generates 'blue'. The word 'walm' seems to translate to three instances of 'blue'.

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
- 'wif' results in 'red', 'zup' in 'yellow', and 'lug' in 'blue'. Noticing the pattern, after every 'wif', 'walm' leads to three 'red' outputs, and after 'wif', and before 'zup', it generates three reds as well. 

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- 'dax' results in 'green', and 'zup' in 'yellow'. Here, after 'dax', 'walm' results in three 'green'.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- 'wif' leads to 'red', and followed by 'walm', it results in three 'red'.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- 'zup' translates to 'yellow' and 'wif' to 'red'. Here, 'walm' after 'wif' results in three 'red'.

From the examples given, 'walm' seems to generate three instances of the color that was last mentioned before it. If we were to summarize this rule, it is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately preceding 'walm' in the input three times.

"Analyzing the provided examples, let's try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the word ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue"". ""Zup"" is the only word translated to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" translated to ""blue"". After the ""lug"", the word ""walm"" seems to produce additional ""blue"" words.

- In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"". Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". After ""wif"", ""walm"" again causes a repetition of ""red"" words, and after ""lug"", there is no repetition, suggesting ""walm"" is specifically causing the word before it to repeat.

- In the third example, ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green"". The word ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and after it is followed by ""walm"", it repeats ""green"" several times.

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"". ""Wif"" means ""red"", and after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated two more times.

- In the fifth example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"". ""Zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""wif"" means ""red"". ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and causes ""red"" to be repeated.

From these observations, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the last color word to repeat three times in total. Therefore, the general rule might be:

Rule: ""walm"" makes the color associated with the last color word before it to repeat two additional times, for a total of three instances of that color.

Based on this rule, the meaning can be formulated as:

walm -> causes the preceding color word to repeat two more times.",-0.1311466909562223,144,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs where it is included and compare it with those where it isn't. From the examples, we should look at the change brought to the output by the introduction of ""walm.""

1. ""zup lug walm"" leads to ""yellow blue blue blue,"" and ""wif walm zup"" leads to ""red red red yellow.""
2. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" leads to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow.""
3. ""dax zup dax walm"" results in ""green yellow green green green.""

Looking closely:
- ""zup"" alone results in ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" alone results in ""red.""
- ""lug"" alone results in ""blue.""
- ""dax"" alone results in ""green.""

Now, we observe how the output changes when ""walm"" is introduced immediately after each of these words:
- After ""zup,"" ""walm"" causes ""red red red"" to follow (""yellow red red red"").
- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" causes ""red red red"" to follow (""red red red"").
- After ""dax,"" ""walm"" causes ""green green green"" to follow (""green yellow green green green"").

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it three times. Therefore, ""walm"" may mean to triple the color of the previous word.

1. ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" yields ""yellow green green yellow green.""
   - ""zup"" consistently leads to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" appears once and is followed by ""green.""

2. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red.""

   - ""wif"" appears once at the end and results in ""red.""

3. ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue blue.""
   - ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" leads to a sequence of ""blue.""

4. ""zup dax zup lug"" yields ""yellow green yellow blue.""
   - The sequence of ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green) is consistent.
   - ""lug"" stands alone here and results in ""blue.""

5. ""dax zup dax"" yields ""green yellow green.""
   - This reinforces that ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",-0.08394097712279346,145,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's examine the patterns in the given inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Looking at all the inputs, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" appears in the output:

- Input: zup dax bluf zup dax -> Output: yellow green green yellow green
- Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
- Input: zup dax zup lug -> Output: yellow green yellow blue
- Input: dax zup dax -> Output: green yellow green

From these examples, it is consistent that ""dax"" translates to ""green."" The other words in the inputs must correspond with the other colors in the outputs. For instance, ""zup"" seems to correspond with ""yellow,"" given that it is always followed by yellow in the output.

To create a simple rule based on the patterns we can see:

Rule: dax -> green",-0.09052956432814128,145,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns associated with the word in the different inputs and their corresponding outputs.

In the first input ""zup dax bluf zup dax,"" the output is ""yellow green green yellow green."" Here we notice that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.

In the second input ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" Again, the word ""dax"" is aligned with the color ""green.""

In the third input ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" Here the first word ""dax"" matches the first color ""green"" in the output.

Looking at all given inputs and corresponding outputs, wherever the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is produced in the output. The word ""zup"" seems to always correspond to the color ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

From this analysis, we can determine the rule for ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green",-0.3627031718850216,145,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at each instance where it's used.

1. In the first example, ""zup dax"" corresponds with ""yellow green,"" and when ""dax"" appears without ""zup"" before it, it still translates to ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" does not depend on the preceding word to be translated to ""green.""

2. In the second example, we see ""walm dax"" and ""dax wif,"" with ""dax"" continuing to correspond with ""green,"" regardless of the surrounding words.

3. In the third example, ""dax"" is the first word and still translates to ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, ""zup dax"" again translates to ""yellow green,"" with ""dax"" remaining consistent in its translation.

5. In the fifth example, even when ""dax"" is surrounded by ""zup,"" it maintains its association with ""green.""

Given this information, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or surrounding words. 

Hence, dax -> green.",-1.1393723379989122,145,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the same position. 

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.",-1.6159414921108697,145,dax
"Given the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern for the word ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" is used after a word, the output is ""red"" followed by the color associated with the word that comes after ""wif"".
- When ""wif"" is used before a word, it seems to change the output to ""red"" only, without producing the color associated with that word.
- When ""wif"" is present by itself, the output is ""red"".

Let's analyze the examples:

1. ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red"". ""Zup"" produces ""yellow"", and since ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" (which produces ""yellow""), it changes the output from ""yellow"" to ""red"" for the positions that ""walm"" would have normally occupied, resulting in three ""red""s.

2. ""zup walm wif"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here, ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" is as well; ""wif"" at the end still yields ""red"" but does not influence the previous ""yellow"" outputs.

3. ""wif"" by itself is simply ""red"".

4. ""dax bluf wif lug"" becomes ""green green red blue"". ""Dax"" and ""bluf"" are ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""Wif"" does not seem to affect ""lug"", indicating that its influence may be limited to the word immediately following it.

5. ""zup wif bluf zup"" turns into ""yellow red red yellow"". ""Zup"" is ""yellow"", ""wif"" before ""bluf"" makes it ""red"", and the second ""zup"" at the end remains ""yellow"".

The rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> changes the color output of the next word to ""red"" if there is a word after it; if there is no word after it or if it is by itself, ""wif"" yields ""red"".",-0.12425985875818671,145,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and output for each example provided:

1. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
2. Input: zup walm wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow red
3. Input: wif | Output: red
4. Input: dax bluf wif lug | Output: green green red blue
5. Input: zup wif bluf zup | Output: yellow red red yellow

We can notice that every time the word ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is in the output. ""Wif"" does not seem to directly depend on its position within the string for its output color since it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position. For example, in inputs 1, 2, and 5, it is preceded by different words (""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf"") and is placed in different positions within the input string, yet in all cases, the output is ""red.""

In input 3, ""wif"" is the only word, and hence the output is solely ""red,"" confirming that ""wif"" itself corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",-0.1474634279906667,145,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the position of ""wif"" determines the number of times the color ""red"" appears in the output. More specifically:

- When ""wif"" is in the first position, the output is a single ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is in the second position, the output consists of ""red red"".
- When ""wif"" is in the third position, the output consists of ""red red red"".
- When ""wif"" is in the fourth position, as in the second example, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red"", suggesting that the presence of ""wif"" at the end after three occurrences of the same word results in three repetitions of the color corresponding to the repeated word, followed by ""red"".

However, other words also influence the output with their respective colors. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", but ""wif"" seems to override ""bluf"" when they're adjacent, with ""wif"" always outputting ""red"". The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Rule: wif -> meaning. The meaning pertains to producing ""red"" in the output.

However, the exact meaning of ""bluf"" seems inconsistent based on these examples, as ""bluf"" appears in two different contexts producing different outputs.

- In the first example, ""dax lug zup"" translates to ""green blue yellow,"" so it seems that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""lug"" means ""blue."" The new word ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""

- The second example, ""dax zup,"" becomes ""green yellow,"" which confirms that ""dax"" means ""green,"" supporting the idea that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

- The third example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue,"" where ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" and each instance of ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow."" The unknown ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow,"" which complicates the rule as ""bluf"" does not appear in any other examples to provide additional context.

"Based on the input-output pairs provided in the examples, we can deduce a pattern for what ""bluf"" means. We can analyze when ""bluf"" appears and what color is output in response.

- In the second input, ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""lug"" and the output is ""red blue"" after ""bluf"". Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the fourth input, we can infer that ""bluf"" here translates to ""red"".
- In the third input, ""bluf"" is the last word and still, the output ends with two ""red""s after ""bluf"".
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" is the second and last word and the output is ""blue blue"", but this sequence does not give us new information since it lacks context with other words and colors.
- In the fifth input, ""lug wif lug bluf"" correlates to ""blue red blue blue"", showing us that ""wif"" and ""lug"" maintain their colors, ""red"" and ""blue"", respectively. The presence of ""bluf"" does not appear to change the color associated with ""lug"".

Taking these observations into account, it looks like ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Since ""bluf"" does not appear to affect the colors associated with other words, we can deduce that it stands independently regardless of the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

  - ""walm"" is preceded by three words (""dax zup dax""), no word follows ""walm"", resulting in the output of ""green"" for every occurrence of ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup"" plus two additional ""green"" at the end.

Given this pattern, ""walm"" seems to function as a signal to repeat ""blue"" in the output for each word that precedes it, followed by a ""green"" if succeeded by ""dax"".

2. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is red.
3. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is green.

There's no example of ""walm"" standing alone or being the first word in a sequence to reference its color directly, which supports the idea that ""walm"" is a repeating element of the preceding color.

- For the first example, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" since it is followed by ""lug"" which translates to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is also translated to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The repetition of ""wif"" three times at the end corresponds with ""red red red"" in the output.

5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow"".

Considering that a ""wif"" always seems to map to ""red"" and ""zup"" always seems to map to ""yellow,"" we can figure out the pattern for ""bluf"".

In example 1, the output does not repeat ""red,"" nor in example 3 or 4, which implies ""bluf"" doesn't translate to ""wif"" as it translates to ""red."" 

In example 2, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow."" Since the pattern in the output goes ""red red yellow yellow red,"" ""bluf"" must map to ""red"" again to align with the double representation.

In example 5, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow,"" just like in example 2.

The constant pattern is that ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to ""yellow"" when it follows another color term (be it ""wif"" or ""zup""). The main confusion might come from the first and third examples where ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" but this could be because ""bluf"" is following ""wif,"" and the rule is that ""bluf"" repeats the color mentioned right before it.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to find a pattern between the ""Input"" phrases and their corresponding ""Output"" phrases.

By examining the examples given, we can establish the following patterns for known words:

- Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. 
- When ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""

Now, let's focus on the occurrences of ""bluf"":

1. In the first input-output pair (""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""), the word ""bluf"" appears immediately after ""wif."" Given that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and there is no new color introduced, it suggests that ""bluf"" may also translate to ""red.""

2. In the second input-output pair (""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""red red yellow yellow red""), ""bluf"" appears twice, both times translating to ""red,"" reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

3. The third and fourth examples further confirm that ""wif bluf"" translates consistently to ""red red.""

4. In the fifth example (""wif lug zup bluf"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow""), we see that ""bluf"" occurs at the end, and ""yellow"" is repeated in the output, despite ""zup"" being directly related to a single ""yellow."" So, this could suggest that ""bluf"" here also translates to ""yellow.""

However, the recurring pattern in the examples suggests that ""bluf"" reliably translates to ""red,"" except in the fifth example, where it might be inducing a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word (“zup” which translates to ""yellow""). Considering this inconsistency, the primary rule appears to be that ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" and the fifth case may hint at an additional rule or an exception which has not been clarified by the given dataset.

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following pattern for the nonce word ""walm"":

- Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" or ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated three times.
- The color that ""walm"" corresponds to does not depend on any specific word that precedes it, but rather on the word that ""walm"" immediately follows.

Here is the rule induced from the given examples:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color corresponding to that word repeated three times.

Given these observations, the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be a rule that instructs one to repeat the color associated with the previous word, three times. Let's break it down by examples:

- In the first example (wif zup lug dax zup walm), ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" thus the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second example (dax lug walm), ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" thus the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third and fourth examples (dax walm zup) and (dax walm wif), ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" thus the output is ""green green green.""
- In the fifth example (zup lug walm), ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which again corresponds to ""blue,"" thus the output is ""blue blue blue.""

Therefore, ""walm"" serves as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color represented by the word that directly precedes it.

In each example, ""walm"" follows another word which can be associated with a specific color output, and the color that follows ""walm"" in the output is a repetition of the previous color mentioned before ""walm"":

- In ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"", the occurrence of ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to the color yellow, resulting in three subsequent ""yellow"" in the output.

- In ""dax lug walm"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to the color blue, resulting in three subsequent ""blue"" in the output.

- In ""dax walm zup"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to the color green, resulting in two subsequent ""green"" (note that ""green"" appears two times instead of three because ""zup"" follows and changes the sequence).

- In ""dax walm wif"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" again, producing two subsequent ""green"", followed by ""wif"" corresponding to the color red.

- In ""zup lug walm"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"", corresponding to the color blue and producing three subsequent ""blue"".

Explanation: ""Walm"" appears to be a placeholder for the repetition of the previous color, using the number of syllables in ""walm."" Since ""walm"" has one syllable, the previous color word is repeated once. Here are the examples broken down:

- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" ends with ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" is before ""walm"" and refers to yellow, the last word before ""walm"" in the sequence.
- ""dax lug walm"" ends with ""blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" is before ""walm"" and refers to blue.

- ""zup lug walm"" ends with ""blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" is before ""walm"" and refers to blue.

Explanation: 

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and the word immediately after ""bluf"" is ""wif"" corresponding to red, so the output after ""dax bluf"" is ""green green red"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" is green again and followed by ""wif"" which is red, so after ""wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""red red green"".
- This pattern continues with ""bluf"" consistently causing a repetition of the color associated with the word right before it.",-1.2599097723726311,148,bluf
"Rule: bluf appears to translate into the color ""green"" when immediately following the word ""dax,"" but into ""yellow"" when it precedes the word ""wif."" However, it is also followed by a sequence that yields the color ""red"" if another word comes after bluf.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it three times. Here is the underlying rule deduced from the given examples:

- ""zup walm"" => ""yellow yellow yellow"" (The color yellow, which is associated with ""zup"", is repeated three times.)
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" => ""blue blue blue red red"" (The color blue, which is associated with ""lug"", is repeated three times, and then the color red, which is associated with ""bluf"", is repeated twice due to the presence of ""wif"" before it.)
- ""dax walm wif zup"" => ""green green green red yellow"" (The color green, which is associated with ""dax"", is repeated three times, then the presence of ""wif"" leads to the color red being mentioned once, followed by the color yellow from ""zup"".)
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" => ""green red yellow yellow red red red"" (The sequence follows the color representations of each word with ""walm"" at the end, causing the last mentioned color, ""red"" associated with ""bluf"", to be repeated three times after the presence of ""wif"")
- ""dax walm"" => ""green green green"" (The color green, associated with ""dax"", is repeated three times.)

"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

In each instance, the word ""walm"" results in a triple repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Based on the outputs, we can see that:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Therefore, whenever ""walm"" follows one of these words, the output is three instances of the corresponding color. Using this pattern, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm"" in this context:

Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Input: lug walm dax

In the first example, the words ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""red."" Since the word ""lug"" appears at the end and the output ends with ""blue,"" we can guess that ""lug"" might mean ""blue.""

In the second example, there is only one word before ""lug,"" which is ""zup,"" and that corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Lug"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow blue,"" reaffirming our initial guess that ""lug"" correlates to ""blue.""

The third example solidifies the pattern since after each instance of ""bluf"" and ""dax,"" the colors ""green"" and ""yellow"" repeat, but the single instance of ""lug"" directly corresponds with the output ""blue.""

The fourth example is interesting because ""lug"" is the first word, and ""blue"" is the first color in the output. ""Walm"" and ""dax"" both appear to correspond to ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively, according to the previous pattern.

From these examples, we can start by identifying the other words:
- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" always translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to a change to green, notably when followed by ""lug"" or ""walm"".
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" unless proceeded by ""dax,"" in which case the result is ""green.""

Next, we try to determine the pattern for ""bluf"":

In examples 1, 2, and 5:
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output color is ""blue"" before ""dax"" changes it to ""green.""

In examples 4 and 5:
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" or precedes ""wif,"" and the output color is ""red"" after ""bluf.""

From the above observations, we can infer the following rule about ""bluf"":

""bluf"" corresponds to duplication of the previous color mentioned. If ""bluf"" is the first word or if there is no previously mentioned color, then there is no direct example to follow.

Based on the observed patterns, we can write the rule as:

4. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   
   ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, so ""yellow"" is repeated three times before the next color word.

5. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   
   As in the previous example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" leading to ""yellow"" repeated three times, and then the sequence continues with the next color word.

Walm -> meaning. Rule:

The rule is that ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be repeated three additional times in the output.",-0.08301531956728392,149,walm
"To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we'll look at each instance and its output, and identify patterns that can help us derive its meaning.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" generates one ""yellow"" and ""wif"" generates ""red red"". The single occurrence of ""walm"" results in one additional ""red"".
  
Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- ""dax"" generates one ""green,"" ""zup"" generates one ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" generates another ""green."" The single occurrence of ""walm"" here results in three additional ""green"" colors, corresponding to the number of colors prior to it.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" generates one green, ""wif"" generates one red. The ""walm"" in this case generates two additional ""green,"" resembling the number of words that come before it.

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" generates one ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" generates one ""blue."" Here, ""walm"" leads to two additional ""yellow,"" matching the number of words that come before it again.

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
- ""zup"" generates one ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" generates one ""green."" The single occurrence of ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellow,"" which as before, corresponds to the number of words that come before it.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" adds as many copies of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word as there are words before ""walm.""

Putting this into the requested format:

walm -> ""walm"" generates additional instances of the color corresponding to the last color word mentioned before it, matching the quantity of the words before ""walm.""",-0.11026766729901237,149,walm
"To induce the rule for the meaning of ""walm,"" let's consider the word's placement and surrounding words in each given example, and note the patterns in the corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
2. ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""
3. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
4. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
5. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green""

Looking at the colors associated with the words that are not ""walm"":

- ""zup"" is consistently correlated with ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" is consistently correlated with ""green.""
- ""wif"" is correlated with ""red.""
- ""lug"" is correlated with ""blue.""

Now, analyzing the relationship between the input and output where ""walm"" occurs:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three repetitions of the color tied to ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is three repetitions of the color tied to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- When ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" the output associated with ""walm"" is repeated three times and matches the color prior to ""wif,"" which is ""green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" the output associated with ""walm"" is repeated three times and matches the color prior to ""lug,"" which is ""yellow.""

Considering the above patterns, ""walm"" seems to replicate the color of the word that precedes it three times. This applies to all instances except for the second example where it extends the sequence of the preceding color.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Indicates that the output color should repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm"" three additional times, or extend the repetition of the preceding word's color if it is already being repeated.",-0.13784315271617298,149,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the patterns in each output when the word ""walm"" is in the input:

- The color that follows ""walm"" seems to always correspond to the color that represents the word immediately preceding ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three yellows followed by the color that represents the word immediately after ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is three greens followed by the color that represents the word immediately after ""walm.""
- ""Walm"" itself does not seem to have a fixed color associated with it, but it does affect the quantity and the sequence of the colors in the output.

Based on this, it appears that ""walm"" is a modifier to the previous word that increases the quantity of the color associated with that word in the output by three. So,

walm -> A rule that the previous word's color is repeated three times before outputting the color of the word that follows ""walm"".

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input between two other words, output the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" three times, followed by the color associated with the word immediately after ""walm"".",-1.2027804323851854,149,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" can be deduced by looking at the corresponding output color in each example and identifying a pattern. Below are the examples with the input words matched to their output colors:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""walm"" -> red
   - ""lug"" -> blue

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""zup"" -> yellow

3. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""lug"" -> blue

4. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""wif"" -> red

5. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""zup"" -> yellow

By observing the examples, it can be seen that regardless of its position in the input, ""lug"" always corresponds to the color blue in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue",-0.07784933458067567,150,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" in relation to the colors given in the output. Let's analyze the outputs corresponding to each input where ""lug"" is present:

- ""zup wif walm lug"" leads to ""yellow red red red blue.""
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" leads to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""zup lug"" results in ""yellow blue.""
- ""lug wif"" gives ""blue red.""
- ""lug zup"" yields ""blue yellow.""

From these examples, it appears that every time ""lug"" is present in the output, the color ""blue"" appears. Additionally, the color ""blue"" is not attributed to any other non-lug words, as ""zup"" and ""wif"" consistently correspond to ""yellow"" and ""red,"" respectively.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""lug"" in the context given appears to be:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs and identify patterns.

1. `dax bluf wif zup wif` -> `green green red yellow red`

The word ""dax"" here corresponds to ""green,"" and so does ""bluf."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. `zup dax` -> `yellow green`

""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" here also corresponds to ""green.""

3. `dax walm` -> `green green green`

The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and so does ""walm.""

4. `dax wif` -> `green red`

Again, the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. `zup dax lug` -> `yellow green blue`

""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and now ""lug"" introduces a new color ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we have to establish a pattern or a rule that connects the input with the output. Let's correlate each output color sequence with the corresponding input containing ""bluf.""

- When the input is ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""green,"" but we need more data to confirm this because ""dax"" also resulted in ""green.""

- With the input ""wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""red red green."" Here, ""wif"" preceded ""bluf"" and we see two ""red"" colors before ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax."" This could imply that ""wif"" may affect the color resulting from ""bluf.""

- For the input ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" As there's no ""dax"" here, it suggests that ""bluf"" influences the second ""red"" in the output.

- In the input ""zup wif bluf,"" we have the output ""yellow red red."" ""Zup"" results in ""yellow,"" but ""wif"" before ""bluf"" again results in two ""red"" colors.

- Lastly, ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" translates to ""red green red red yellow red."" We notice that ""dax"" between two ""wif"" outputs ""red green,"" ""bluf"" after a ""wif"" gives us a second ""red,"" and ""zup"" comes out as ""yellow,"" followed by another ""red"" for the last ""wif.""

Considering all these, the rule seems to be:
Whenever ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows any other word (or is the second word in a pair), it acts like the word preceding it.

"Observing the provided examples, we notice that the output always has a series of colors that are repeated a number of times. The repetition of the color seems to relate directly to the word preceding ""walm."" Each word when paired with ""walm"" results in a specific color being repeated. 

Here's what we can gather:
1. ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red"" - the word ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to ""red,"" repeated three times.
2. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" - the word ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to ""yellow,"" repeated three times.
3. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" - the word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to ""blue,"" repeated three times.
4. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" gives us ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" We can see the pattern of each preceding word translated into its corresponding color and the ""zup walm"" combination translating into ""yellow"" being repeated.
5. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following:

- The word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 
- The number of repetitions appears to be three, given that in every example the color prior to ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Therefore:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to find the commonality in the patterns of the input and corresponding output. Let's examine each case:

1. ""lug wif walm"" maps to ""blue red red red""
   - ""lug"" generates a ""blue""
   - ""wif"" generates a ""red""
   - ""walm"" in this context generates ""red red""

2. ""zup walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" generates ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" in this context generates ""yellow yellow""

3. ""lug walm"" maps to ""blue blue blue""
   - ""lug"" generates ""blue""
   - ""walm"" in this context generates ""blue blue""

4. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" maps to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""

   - ""lug"" generates ""blue""
   - ""zup"" generates ""yellow""

   - The pattern continues based on the previously established mappings

5. ""wif walm"" maps to ""red red red""
   - ""wif"" generates ""red""
   - ""walm"" in this context generates ""red red""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" generates additional instances of the color word that directly precedes it. It reproduces the color word that comes before ""walm"" twice to add to the output. Therefore:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color output of the preceding word twice.",-0.12650928272439999,151,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the previous word a number of times. Here's the explanation as per each input:

1. ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red"" where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color red three times.

2. ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" where ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times.

3. ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"" where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times.

4. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" shows multiple usage of the rule. The sequence of colors up to ""zup"" is ""red blue yellow,"" then ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times, followed by the sequence ""wif"" (red), ""lug"" (blue).

5. ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"" where ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color red three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.18232927566466664,151,walm
"Given the examples, it appears that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here are the observed patterns:

1. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated (example 3).
2. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated (example 1 and example 5).
3. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated (example 2).

Additionally, in example 4, ""walm"" is used after ""zup,"" and the output is again a repetition of ""yellow,"" demonstrating the pattern holds true regardless of the position of ""walm"" in the sequence.

Considering these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be repeated three times in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" consistently. 

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red"". This indicates that ""dax"" means green, and from this single example, we cannot be entirely sure what ""bluf"" and ""wif"" mean.
   
2. ""dax"" on its own results in ""green"", reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" means green.

3. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"". This further reinforces that ""dax"" means green, and given the previous examples, it might suggest that ""wif"" does not always translate to the same color; however, ""bluf"" appears to have been red in both instances it has been used.

4. A lone ""dax"" again results in ""green"", lending more evidence to ""dax"" meaning green.

5. ""dax zup dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow green yellow"". This confirms ""dax"" as green once more and suggests that ""zup"" correlates with yellow.

Rule: dax -> green",-0.1302362159376923,152,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns associated with the input and output provided:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green"". This suggests that ""dax"" by itself is associated with the color green.

2. When ""dax"" appears with ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" the order of ""wif"" and ""bluf"" relative to ""dax"" changes the associated color in the output. If ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" ""wif"" is associated with red. However, the color associated with ""bluf"" remains consistent (red) regardless of its position relative to ""dax.""

3. When ""dax"" is repeated with ""zup"" in between, the pattern alternates between green and yellow. The second appearance of ""dax"" still yields green, and ""zup"" corresponds with yellow.

From these observations, we can infer that:

Rule:
- The word ""dax"" itself corresponds to the color ""green"".
- The color that follows ""dax"" seems to follow a pattern depending on what other words are present and their order.
- When ""dax"" is immediately followed by another word, that word dictates the next color. If it's ""wif,"" the color is red; if it's ""zup,"" the color is yellow.
- The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"".

Given these rules, we can write:

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" appears to signal the start of a series of color outputs. The colors outputted after ""wif"" correspond to the words preceding ""wif"". Each unique word that appears before ""wif"" has a specific color associated with it:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""walm"" corresponds to the color blue as well.

When ""wif"" is used, it seems to function as a delimiter or trigger, signaling that the colors corresponding to the previously mentioned words should be listed following it in the order they were mentioned. When words are repeated before ""wif,"" their corresponding color is also repeated after ""wif"". Lastly, each time ""wif"" is used, the color ""red"" is outputted at the end, regardless of the presence of ""bluf"" in one instance.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color red consistently. In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output includes the color ""red"".

- dax => green
- zup => yellow
- lug => blue
- walm => blue (deduced from example 4 having two instances of blue, with lug already established as blue)

The color output sequence always follows the sequence of words in the input. Therefore, we can deduce the rule that each nonce word maps to a different color, and ""wif"" specifically maps to the color red.

However, based on the repetition of the word ""walm"" and its corresponding output ""yellow yellow yellow"", we can hypothesize that ""walm"" could translate to multiple instances of the color ""yellow"", but this is speculative without further examples.

"Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"" in the Output. However, when ""bluf"" is next to the word ""dax,"" the output color is ""green"" instead. This suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent. Let's examine:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" which could imply that ""wif"" also means ""red,"" or it could be that ""bluf"" amplifies the preceding color.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" turns into ""red red green green green."" Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" which changes its corresponding color from red to green, and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color green.
- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" becomes ""red red blue yellow,"" where ""bluf"" retains the color red but does not seem to affect ""lug"" (blue) or ""zup"" (yellow).
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" results in ""blue yellow yellow green."" Notice that ""bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow green"" instead of ""red green."" This implies that when ""bluf"" is after ""zup,"" it could change to ""yellow."" 
- In the fifth example, ""dax wif bluf"" changes to ""green red red,"" showing that when ""dax"" precedes ""wif bluf,"" it does not affect the color produced by ""bluf,"" which is ""red.""

The rules for ""bluf"" may be as follows:

1. ""bluf"" generally corresponds to the color ""red.""
2. When ""bluf"" directly precedes ""dax,"" the color output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
3. The behavior of ""bluf"" between ""lug"" and ""zup"" is inconsistent with the other rules and might be an anomaly or dependent on an unrecognized factor.

For simplicity and given the information we have, I would conclude the rule as:

Rule: bluf generally means ""red,"" but changes to ""green"" when directly preceding ""dax.""

Thus: bluf -> means ""red"" (changes to ""green"" when before ""dax"").",-0.21325151816148158,152,bluf
"Given the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output. However, it's also important to notice that ""bluf"" is followed by another color word (such ""lug"" for blue) which doesn't repeat the ""red"" in the output. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color that appears just before ""bluf,"" while the color that comes after ""bluf"" is different and follows a distinct pattern.

Here’s the pattern:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- “lug” translates to “blue”.
- “dax” translates to “green”.
- “zup” translates to “yellow"".

Following this interpretation, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears, it repeats the color that comes immediately before it in the input sequence.

So in this case, the meaning of ""bluf"" would be a repetition of the color that precedes it:

"Based on the examples provided, let's look at the pattern of inputs and corresponding outputs to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   
Here, the sequence ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may translate to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Since ""dax"" is followed by three greens, ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the previous color twice.""

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
Following the potential rule, since ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times, this still supports the idea that ""walm"" could cause a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word by two additional times.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm

In this example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by three greens, similar to the first example.

5. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

""Zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" further supporting the repeating pattern idea.

Therefore, the rule in this context appears to be: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated an additional two times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word two more times.",-0.07064444402378724,152,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that there is a correlation between the word ""walm"" and the output that follows it. To deduce the rules underlying these examples, let’s look at each instance where ""walm"" appears and its respective output:

1. ""dax walm wif bluf"" produces ""green green green red red"". Here ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"", and the sequence after ""walm"" (""wif bluf"") results in ""green red red"".

2. ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue blue"". ""Dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue"", and the characters following ""walm"" are non-existent but produce three ""blue"".

3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" gives ""red red green green green"". We can see that ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", and followed by nothing, yet there are two more ""green"" in the sequence.

4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". ""Dax lug"" leads to ""green blue"", then ""walm"" is followed by ""zup wif"", corresponding to ""yellow red"".

5. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" produces ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". ""Walm"" is at the end of the sequence and is preceded by ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"".

If we examine the pattern carefully, we can establish that ""walm"" appears to result in a repetition of the color associated with the following word (if there is one), or the previous word if it is at the end of the sequence. However, this repetition is not necessarily of a fixed quantity—it seems to depend on the words adjacent to ""walm"".

Based on the examples provided, the proven occurrence is that ""walm"" somehow triggers a repetition of the previous or subsequent color code in the output sequence. However, the specific rule for the number of repetitions is not clear from the given data.

Therefore, the meaning associated with ""walm"" relates to repetition, with a tentative rule as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> indicates a repetition of the color code associated with the next word. If ""walm"" is the last word, it appears to repeat the color code of the preceding word. The number of repetitions is uncertain and cannot be established from the given examples. More data would be needed to precisely define this aspect of the rule.",-0.08189321231352131,152,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the color green, but with an additional repetition dependent on its position in the input sequence. Let's review the given data:

1. Input: ""dax walm wif bluf""
   Output: ""green green green red red""
   Here, ""walm"" results in three greens, which is one more green than the number of words following ""walm"" in the input.

2. Input: ""dax lug walm""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue""
   In this case, ""walm"" results in three blues, which matches the position of ""walm"" in the input (third position) without any words following it.

3. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm""
   Output: ""red red green green green""
   Here, ""walm"" is at the end and results in three greens again, one more green than the number of words following it (which is zero in this case), reaffirming the previous observations.

4. Input: ""dax lug walm zup wif""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
   Positionally, ""walm"" is in the third place and it is followed by ""yellow red"" instead of two greens. This may seem inconsistent, but if we consistently apply that ""walm"" produces a series of the same color starting with green and the colors follow a specific sequence (e.g., green -> blue -> yellow -> red), it fits the pattern.

5. Input: ""zup wif lug zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   Although ""walm"" is at the end and primarily represents green, it produces yellows because of its fifth position in the sequence. Following the sequence green -> blue -> yellow -> red, it's reasonable to deduce that the fifth position would loop back to yellow.

Rule: ""walm"" produces a series of the same color output with the count equal to the number of words following it plus one (which will be green if its position is third or less, and varies otherwise). 

Therefore, I conclude the rule to be:

walm -> Results in a series of the same color, beginning with green if its position in the input sequence is less than or equal to three or varies if its position is fourth or higher, with the amount being the number of words that come after ""walm"" plus one.",-0.0858830082422659,152,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let’s look for a pattern that correlates with the presence of ""walm"" in the input and a specific color or set of colors in the output. 

Looking at each line:

1. dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   The ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and both are coded as ""green.""

2. dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" but this time ""lug"" is between them and is coded as ""blue."" ""Walm"" results in ""blue.""

3. wif bluf dax walm

   ""Walm"" again follows ""dax"" and is coded as ""green.""

4. dax lug walm zup wif

   ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""lug"" and precedes ""zup"" and ""wif,"" this time resulting in ""blue.""

5. zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and the last ""zup"" is coded as ""yellow.""

From these patterns, we can discern that ""walm"" results in repetition of the color code associated with the word that immediately precedes it:

- ""dax walm"" -> green green
- ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue blue
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> red red green green
- ""dax lug walm zup"" -> green blue blue blue
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> yellow red blue yellow yellow

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color code of the preceding word and repeats it.

Rule: Walm -> repeat the color code of the preceding word.",-0.0915054728996808,152,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's first analyze the patterns of colors associated with other words based on the given examples. Since the word ""dax"" is consistently followed by the output ""green,"" that suggests there is a one-to-one relationship between the word ""dax"" and the color green.

Similarly, in all inputs where ""wif"" is present, the immediate output is red, and the same could be said for other words. But let's focus on the word ""walm"" and see how it affects the output:

1. Input: ""dax walm wif bluf""
   Output: ""green green green red red""
   - Here, ""dax"" is followed by two instances of ""green."" We then see another instance of ""green"" after ""walm,"" before we see ""red red,"" which corresponds to ""wif bluf.""

2. Input: ""dax lug walm""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" but there's an extra ""blue"" in the output followed by ""walm.""

3. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm""
   Output: ""red red green green green""
   - ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" Following ""walm,"" we see two additional instances of ""green.""

4. Input: ""dax lug walm zup wif""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
   - After accounting for ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif,"" we notice ""walm"" precedes an extra ""blue"" before ""zup"" gives ""yellow.""

5. Input: ""zup wif lug zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - Here, ""zup wif lug zup"" are directly reflected in ""yellow red blue yellow,"" leaving ""walm"" associated with the triplet of ""yellow.""

Based on these patterns, we can deduce that ""walm"" corresponds to the duplication of the color word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Causes the duplication of the color associated with the preceding noun.

So, if the preceding noun gives the color ""blue,"" then ""walm"" results in two instances of ""blue,"" and so on.",-0.09287913651334044,152,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each input containing the word ""lug"" results in the word ""blue"" in the corresponding output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word, and it's duplicated if it is at the end of the sequence.",-0.08335165103683144,153,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs provided.

From the inputs and outputs, we can make the following observations:

- When ""dax"" appears, it is followed by ""green"" in the output. So, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" because it always results in ""red"" in the output.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" because it results in ""blue"" in the output.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" because it consistently produces ""yellow"" in the output.

Now, let's analyze the pattern involving ""bluf"":

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow."" It seems to repeat the color before it.
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug, "" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""blue.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is ""red red."" Again, it repeats the previous color.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and outputs ""blue"" again.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and outputs ""red"" again.

Based on these examples, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word that comes immediately before it, essentially duplicating that color.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the previous word.",-0.7888586991920229,153,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Rule: The meaning of the word ""bluf"" changes based on the preceding word. If the preceding word is 'dax', then ""bluf"" means blue. If the preceding word is 'wif', then ""bluf"" means red. If the preceding word is 'lug', then ""bluf"" means blue. If the preceding word is 'zup', then ""bluf"" means red.

"Based on the examples provided, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"". Below is the evaluation of each example:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Observation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" appears to be a variant of ""blue."" The repetition after ""walm"" seems to be the color ""red"" (associated with ""wif"") followed by the color associated with ""lug.""

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Observation: ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green,"" and following ""walm"" there are repeated ""green.""

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Observation: The same input gives the same output, indicating that ""walm"" in association with ""dax"" gives repeated ""green"" outputs.

4. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   Observation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we see repeated ""blue"" before encountering ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   Observation: ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" respectively. After ""walm"" we see repeated ""green"" associated with ""dax.""

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. However, as there is already a repeat pattern for ""dax"" and ""lug,"" the ""walm"" seems to extend this pattern. This is based on the examples provided, as the rule may change if more varied examples are observed. For now, from the given examples:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it.",-0.07820953430096388,153,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can see a pattern emerging related to the word ""walm"" and the colors that follow it. By analyzing each ""Input"" and the corresponding ""Output"", we will deduce the rule for ""walm.""

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

In these examples, every time the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the input, the color that directly follows ""walm"" in the output is repeated a number of times. The repetition seems to correspond to the color that is associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here is the breakdown:

1. In the first input, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", and in the output, we see a series of ""red"" after ""wif"" indicating ""wif"" might mean ""red"". The number of ""red"" after ""walm"" is three, aligning with the number of previous occurrences of the color ""red"" (in this case, which is associated with ""wif"").

2. In the second and third input, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and in the output, ""green"" is repeated three times. As ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" and there are no other ""green"" colors before ""walm,"" it suggests that the rule involves repeating the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

3. In the fourth input, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and in the output, ""blue"" is repeated three times. The previous occurrences of ""blue"" are associated with ""lug,"" inferring that the color ""blue"" is repeated as many times due to its association with ""lug.""

4. Finally, in the fifth example, we again see ""dax"" associated with ""green,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times after ""walm."" Taking this into account, it seems the rule is not related to the number of times a color appeared before, but rather to some intrinsic property of ""walm"" itself.

Putting this all together:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" to be repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> The meaning is that the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times in the output.",-0.09116821312638554,153,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be a rule that indicates a repetition of the previous color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here are the observed patterns for each input and output:

1. In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red,"" and immediately after ""walm,"" we have ""red red,"" which is a repetition of ""red"" from ""wif.""
2. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""green.""
3. The same pattern is observed again for ""dax walm"" with ""green green green.""
4. In ""lug walm zup,"" ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue,"" a repetition of ""blue,"" followed by a new color ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
5. ""wif lug dax walm"" has ""red blue green,"" and after ""walm,"" there is a repetition of ""green"" from ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule associated with ""walm"" seems to be: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word multiple times (specifically, three times in the examples provided).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",-0.32470354250867467,153,walm
"The provided examples suggest that ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color associated with the previous sequence of nonce words. Here is the rule based on the given examples:

1. lug -> blue
2. wif -> red
3. dax -> green
4. zup -> yellow

Now analyzing ""walm"":

- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" ""walm"" follows a ""wif"" which outputs red, and then three reds are outputted before the sequence continues with the next color (""lug"" -> blue).
- In ""dax walm"" example, which is given twice and has the same output (""green green green"") both times, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is green, and it repeats this color three times.
- In ""lug walm zup,"" ""walm"" follows a ""lug,"" which is blue, and then it repeats the color blue three times before moving on to the next color (""zup"" -> yellow).
- In ""wif lug dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which correlates with green, and then green is repeated three times.

Given this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color of the previous nonce word three times.

"Based on the provided examples, we aim to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug."" Let's examine each example:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue

3. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue

4. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

It is noted that whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" appears in the output at corresponding positions. However, in the first input where ""lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue,"" it is followed by another color as well as blue.

Looking carefully at other words, we can see that individual words correspond to specific colors: ""dax"" is always green, ""wif"" is always red, and ""walm"" and ""zup"" seem to always correspond to blue. ""bluf"" also consistently corresponds to blue, but given the double blues in the last example when ""lug walm"" is presented, it suggests that ""lug"" might contribute to the blue as well.

Considering these observations, we can infer a general rule for ""lug"":

Rule: ""lug"" translates to blue, with an additional color sometimes preceding it depending on context (as seen with ""yellow"" in the first example).

So, in an attempt to simplify and generalize:

lug -> blue (with potential context-dependent preceding color)",-0.09331427976272154,154,lug

1. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""green green green yellow blue""
2. ""wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue""
3. ""lug wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue red blue blue""
4. ""dax lug wif"" -> ""green blue red""
5. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""

Observing the patterns:

- Every time ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
- Nonce word ""lug"" does not change outputs before it appears.
- ""Lug"" is consistent in its output regardless of its position in the input.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue",-0.12100939095081018,154,lug
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue'. We come to this conclusion because every time 'lug' appears in the input, 'blue' appears in the output:

- In the second example, 'lug' is again the last in the sequence, corresponding to 'blue' in the output.
- In the third example, 'lug' appears first and third in the input sequence, and 'blue' appears both first and third in the output sequence.
- In the fourth example, 'lug' is second and the second color in the output is 'blue'.

For example:
- ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the given examples.

Let's start by examining each input and corresponding output in line with their respective positions.

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

3. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

Looking at the first example, ""walm"" is the third word in the input, and in the output, the third color is ""red."" However, since ""wif"" also translates to ""red,"" this does not give us much information. Let's consider the second input where ""walm"" appears at the sixth position; in the output, the sixth color is ""red"" once more. This is a hint, but more evidence is needed.

Examining the third example, the third word is ""walm,"" and the third, fourth, and fifth colors are ""blue."" However, we know from the second example that ""lug"" also translates to ""blue,"" and it is in the second and third positions, indicating that ""walm"" might be generating additional ""blue"" outputs.

The fourth example has ""walm"" as the second word, and correspondingly the second and third colors in the output are ""green."" Here, ""walm"" cannot directly translate to ""green"" because ""dax"" has already been established as ""green,"" and ""wif"" in the next positions translates to ""red.""

In the fifth input, without the presence of ""bluf,"" we see that ""walm"" in the second position still outputs ""green"" in the second and third positions, indicating that the rule for ""walm"" is not directly dependent on the colors provided by ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""bluf.""

Analyzing all examples together, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat in terms of output. ""Walm"" does not have a color of its own, but triggers duplication.

Thus the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the immediately preceding word to repeat in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color code of the immediately preceding word.",-0.07403108602219997,154,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the change in output when ""walm"" appears in the input:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,""
   Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

2. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,""
   Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,""
   Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

4. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,""
   Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

5. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is immediately followed by ""wif,""
   Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

Assessing these sequences, we can notice that ""walm"" always results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it, extending the repetition for three occurrences:

- In example 1, ""dax"" correlates with green, and after ""walm"" is mentioned, we get three greens (red is associated with ""wif,"" which is the next word after ""walm"").
- In example 2, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and this results in three more reds.
- In example 3, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three blues.
- In examples 4 and 5, again, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is three greens.

Therefore, a rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: When ""walm"" is used in an input sequence, the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output sequence.

Hence: walm -> causes the repetition of the color related to the previous word three times.",-0.10177037778635786,154,walm
"To understand what walm means, let's look at the provided examples and the corresponding outputs.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
Rule: Here, 'dax' translates to 'green,' 'wif' to 'red,' and 'walm' seems to produce repeated 'red.'

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
Rule: Again, 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'wif' to 'red.' 'bluf' translates to 'green' when following 'dax' but 'blue' otherwise. 'walm' follows 'wif' and precedes 'lug,' resulting in 'red' 'blue' 'red.' Considering previous translations, if 'lug' is 'blue' and 'walm' follows a pattern, it generates an output similar to 'wif' before it.

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
Rule: 'zup' is 'yellow,' 'lug' is 'blue,' and 'walm' repeats the 'blue.'

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
Rule: 'dax' becomes 'green' and is followed by 'green' produced by 'walm,' then 'wif' is 'red' and 'bluf' is 'red' when it follows 'wif.'

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
Rule: 'dax' and 'walm' lead to 'green,' and 'wif' comes out as 'red.'

Based on these examples, 'walm' seems to repeat the color of the word that is immediately before it in the sequence. If 'walm' appears after 'dax,' which is 'green,' it continues with 'green.' After 'wif' or 'lug,' which are 'red' and 'blue' respectively, it repeats 'red' or 'blue.'

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine how its associated output changes in each example. Analyzing the patterns:

Example 1:
- Input: dax wif walm

Example 2:
- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif

Example 3:
- Input: zup lug walm
- Output: yellow blue blue blue
""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" it's just ""blue"" repeats, which is the last color mentioned before ""walm.""

Example 4:
- Input: dax walm wif bluf
- Output: green green green red red
""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""green."" After ""walm,"" the color is repeated from the last one mentioned before it, which is ""green.""

Example 5:
- Input: dax walm wif
- Output: green green green red
""Dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"". After ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated.

1. ""dax wif walm""

   - ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red red"" (Note that ""wif"" is repeated three more times due to ""walm"")

2. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif""
   - ""wif"" -> ""red""
   - ""bluf"" -> ""red"" (not immediately clear why ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" here; more examples would be helpful)

   - ""bluf"" -> ""green"" (not immediately clear why ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" here; more examples would be helpful)
   - ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red red"" (as before, ""wif"" is repeated three more times due to ""walm"")
   - ""lug"" -> ""blue""
   - ""wif"" -> ""red""

3. ""zup lug walm""
   - ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
   - ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue blue"" (similarly, ""lug"" is repeated three more times due to ""walm"")

4. ""dax walm wif bluf""
   - ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green green"" (here ""dax"" is repeated three more times because of ""walm"")
   - ""wif"" -> ""red""
   - ""bluf"" -> ""red"" (again, the translation of ""bluf"" to ""red"" is not clear based on the given examples)

5. ""dax walm wif""
   - ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green green"" (similar to the previous instance)
   - ""wif"" -> ""red""

In these examples, the presence of ""walm"" causes the word that comes before ""walm"" to be produced four times in total in the output (one original plus three additional repetitions).

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's start by analyzing the pattern of each color in relation to the words provided.

- In the first example, ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif"" and both are green and red respectively, ""bluf"" here also corresponds to ""green.""

- The second example, ""wif dax bluf,"" becomes ""red green green."" Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Since ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"" as it did in the first example.

- In the third example, ""wif dax zup bluf"" gives us ""red green yellow yellow."" Here, we see ""zup"" before ""bluf"" and it translates to ""yellow."" This aligns with the prior examples where ""bluf"" follows the color of the preceding word.

- The fourth example is ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translating to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and in both occurrences, ""bluf"" takes the same color as the word before it, ""blue.""

- The last example, ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" is translated to ""yellow yellow blue green blue."" Again, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" takes on the ""yellow"" color.

From these observations, we can determine the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore:

bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-0.08470848952087641,155,bluf
"From the given examples, we can induce the following patterns associated with each word:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

The word ""bluf"" is consistently associated with the color that follows ""bluf"" in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is followed by a word, the output color is the one directly following it. If ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, it repeats the color of the word that precedes it in the output sequence.

Here are the inferences for each specific example:

1. ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green(red) red,"" where ""bluf"" takes the color of the following word ""wif.""
2. ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green,"" where ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" the word that precedes it.
3. ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" the word that precedes it.
4. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue(yellow) yellow yellow(red) red,"" where ""bluf"" first repeats the color of ""lug"" and then repeats the colors of the words that precede it respectively.
5. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow(lug) blue green blue,"" where ""bluf"" takes the color of the word following it, which is ""lug.""

Based on this rule induction, we can deduce that ""bluf"" acts as a color mimic or repeater, adopting the color of either the next word or the previous word in the sequence.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in each given example. One strategy is to look for consistency in both the input and the output to draw correlations. By doing so, we can make some observations:

1. Every instance of ""walm"" in the input results in multiple ""yellow"" words in the output.
2. The number of ""yellow"" words in the output increases with the number of other words preceding ""walm.""
3. The word preceding ""walm"" appears to determine the color before the sequence of ""yellow"" words begins.

Let's analyze each example:

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
There are two words before ""walm"", and there are three ""red""s after the initial ""yellow.""

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
Three words precede ""walm,"" and four ""green""s follow the first ""yellow.""

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
Three words before ""walm,"" and three ""yellow""s occur after ""red green.""

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Five words before ""walm,"" and three ""yellow""s are present after a sequence of different colors.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
One word before ""walm"" and two ""yellow""s afterward.

We can develop the following rule based on the examples:

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates into a sequence of ""yellow"" outputs. The number of ""yellow"" words outputted after the first color word is equal to the number of words that appear before ""walm"" in the input sequence. The word immediately preceding ""walm"" determines the initial color of the output sequence before turning into ""yellow.""

Therefore:

walm -> increases output sequence by the count of preceding words, turning the sequence yellow with the exception of the color induced by the immediately preceding word.",-0.09677687588732965,155,walm
"To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the colors associated with the words that appear before ""walm"" in each input.

1. ""zup"" alone results in ""yellow.""
2. ""dax"" alone results in ""green.""
3. ""wif"" alone results in ""red.""
4. ""lug"" alone results in ""blue.""
5. When ""walm"" is included in the input, the color associated with each word that comes before it in the sequence is repeated three times in the output.

Let's verify this with each input:
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""zup"" yields ""yellow"" and ""wif"" yields ""red."" The output is ""yellow red red red,"" which implies ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to ""wif"" to repeat three times.
- In ""dax zup dax walm,"" the sequence ""green yellow green"" repeats the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" three times after the sequence.
- In ""wif dax zup walm,"" the output after the colors associated with ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup,"" is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is the color for ""zup"" repeated three times.
- In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" everything before ""walm"" appears to function normally, until we reach ""walm,"" after which the color for ""zup"" (""yellow"") is seen three times.
- Finally, in ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which again is the color for ""zup"" repeated three times.

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""walm"" makes the output repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.",-0.3675676531285714,155,walm
"Observing the outputs for each input where ""walm"" is mentioned, it seems that ""walm"" results in a repeating color that matches the color generated by the word preceding ""walm"". Here are the observed patterns:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" maps to ""red red red red"". Since ""wif"" by itself corresponds to ""red"", it appears that ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""red"".
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" maps to ""green green green"". Since ""dax"" by itself corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""green"".
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Since ""zup"" by itself corresponds to ""yellow"", ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm lug"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"". Again, ""walm"" is following ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", resulting in the repetition of ""yellow"" before ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"".

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color outputted by the word immediately before it, for a total of three repetitions of that color. If ""walm"" is the last word in the input, it repeats the preceding color three times. If ""walm"" is followed by another word, it repeats the preceding color three times before continuing with the color corresponding to the next word.

- ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows, the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" ""lug"" is not repeated after ""walm."" This implies that ""walm"" specifically applies to repeating the color of the word immediate before it, not any color mentioned prior in the sequence.

2. In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" We already know ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

3. The third example's input ""zup bluf"" and output ""yellow yellow"" support our previous deduction where ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" given ""bluf"" does not correspond to any other color and the sequence is ""yellow"" repeated.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup dax wif zup,"" the output is ""yellow green red yellow."" Here, ""dax"" must correspond to ""green,"" and ""zup"" is still ""yellow"" before and after ""dax"" (which we've established as ""green"") and ""wif"" (""red"").

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". Since ""zup"" appears once, ""bluf"" repeats the word ""red"" (1 time - 1) = 0 times.

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Since ""wif"" appears twice, ""bluf"" repeats the word ""red"" (2 times - 1) = 1 time.
- The word after bluf, ""lug"", provides context but doesn't change the rule.

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green"". Since ""wif"" appears three times, ""bluf"" repeats the word ""red"" (3 times - 1) = 2 times.
- ""dax"" and ""walm"" obviously correspond to the same color word ""green"" repeated as many times as they appear.

4. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif

- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and then ""bluf"" results in ""red red"" directly after ""wif.""

- In the fifth example, it starts with ""wif,"" corresponding to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" immediately follows with ""red red."" Then ""dax walm,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" is repeated.

- ""zup"" consistently leads to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently leads to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently leads to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" and ""walm"" consistently lead to ""green.""

When ""bluf"" appears, the color immediately preceding ""bluf"" is repeated once if ""bluf"" is followed by a word (another color) or not repeated if ""bluf"" is at the end. This can be derived from:

- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"" when ""bluf"" is followed by other words but not when ""bluf"" is at the end, as in ""zup bluf"" (which results in ""yellow yellow"").
- ""wif bluf lug"" outputs ""red red blue,"" suggesting ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color (""red"").
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" has two colors before ""bluf"" (both ""green"" from ""dax"" and ""walm""), but ""bluf"" only repeats the immediately preceding ""red"" from ""wif.""

3. In ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and right after ""walm"" it's ""yellow yellow,"" then ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and following ""walm"" it's ""red red red.""

5. In ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after the first ""walm"" it's ""green green,"" then ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and following the second ""walm"" it's ""red red red.""

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the word just before it to repeat two additional times (totaling three consecutive occurrences of that color).

walm -> repeats the previous color two more times",-0.4076974723558182,157,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we examine the outputs following the appearances of the word ""walm"" in each input.

1. After ""walm"": green green green
2. After ""walm"": blue blue
3. After ""walm"": yellow yellow red red red
4. After ""walm"": red red
5. After ""walm"": green red red red

If we align the outputs following ""walm"" with the words that immediately precede it, we observe the following pattern:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""
- ""zup walm"" doesn't have a clear pattern (but could be assumed to be ""yellow yellow"" based on example 1)

Considering these findings, it appears ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word a specific number of times. But to derive the number of times, we will need more information.

By looking at the inputs and outputs closely, we find that:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by ""walm"" twice, producing ""blue blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""walm"" thrice, producing ""green green green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""walm"" thrice, producing ""red red red.""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word based on how many letters are in the word that corresponds to that color. If we apply this to ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" the preceding word ""zup"" has three letters, but ""walm"" should then repeat ""yellow"" three times. However, we do not have an instance where ""zup walm"" occurs in isolation to confirm this pattern. Nevertheless, the evidence from other instances suggests this rule.

Based on these deductions, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word as many times as the number of letters in the word that corresponds to that color.",-0.9176916273962628,157,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the number of times a color follows a given nonce word to try to determine what ""walm"" means. 

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by two ""green"". 
2. In the second example, ""walm"" precedes three ""blue"".
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by two ""yellow"" first then by three ""red"".
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" precedes two ""blue"".
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by two ""green"" first then by three ""red"".

It seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color word for the following word and a repetition in the amount that that next word would have been repeated. 

For example: 
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which outputs ""green"", it repeats 'green' three times instead of once. ""Dax"" typically has a ""green"" outcome, so ""walm"" makes it triple the output associated with ""dax"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which outputs ""red"", it repeats 'red' three times instead of once.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which outputs ""blue"", it repeats 'blue' three times instead of once.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which outputs ""yellow"", it repeats 'yellow' three times instead of once.

Let's formulate the rule based on these observations. 

Rule: ""walm"" after a nonce word causes the following word's color output to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" precedes an output color, it will repeat the color representing the next nonce word thrice. If ""walm"" follows an output color, it will repeat that color thrice. So, ""walm"" creates a repetition of ‘three’ for the associated color. 

Therefore, we can deduce the rule: walm -> triple repetition of the next word's color output.",-0.9569231106447477,157,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns presented in each input and their corresponding outputs.

1. In the first input, after the word ""walm,"" the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""green"" repeated twice, followed by ""yellow."" So, ""walm"" cannot mean just ""green,"" as the repetition wouldn't be explained.

2. In the second input, ""walm"" is followed by no word, and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times, which matches with ""lug"" being ""blue."" It indicates that ""walm"" results in repeating the color corresponding to the word before it.

3. In the third input, ""walm"" appears twice, and after each instance, colors repeat (""yellow"" three times after the first ""walm,"" and ""red"" three times after the second ""walm""). Each instance of ""walm"" is preceded by a different word (""dax"" and ""wif""), suggesting that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat a certain number of times.

4. In the fourth input, ""walm"" is followed by the word ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" The output is ""red"" three times (matching ""wif"") and then ""blue"" twice. Again, ""walm"" causes repetition.

5. In the fifth input, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times. The second ""walm"" again follows ""wif,"" with the output being ""red"" three times. This solidifies our observation of ""walm"" leading to a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word.

Based on the outputs, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times. This is consistent across all given inputs and outputs.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.

So, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is:

"From the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns before and after it:

- In every line, the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""dax"" corresponds to green, as seen in the example mappings.
- After ""walm"" is introduced, we get a sequence of the same color that was just mentioned. For example, ""lug wif dax walm"" results in ""blue red green green green,"" where the occurrence of ""green"" repeats three times after ""walm"" is used.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be repeated.

In every Output sequence where the Input sequence contains the word ""zup"", the corresponding Output is ""yellow"". It is not dependent on position in the sequence, nor does it appear to modify or be modified by surrounding words. Its meaning is consistent across all given examples.

"To induce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and the corresponding output for the given examples:

1. In the first example, among other words, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color ""blue.""

3. In the third and fourth examples, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" but this doesn't directly reveal the meaning of ""bluf"" since it could be related to ""dax.""

4. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears twice and corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" which is similar to the first pair from the end.

Now, let's focus on the instances where ""bluf"" is isolated by other words:

- ""zup bluf lug"" produced ""yellow yellow blue.""
- ""lug bluf"" in the second example resulted in ""blue blue.""
- ""wif bluf zup"" yielded ""red red yellow.""

It appears that ""bluf"" consistently results in the color ""blue"" when it is isolated by different words. Therefore, the other words (zup, lug, dax, and wif) might be altering the color associated with ""bluf"" depending on their position relative to ""bluf"" or their pairing with it.

Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" seems to generally mean ""blue,"" but the output can be influenced by the surrounding words. However, we have a consistent observation that whenever ""bluf"" is isolated from its context, it corresponds to ""blue,"" thus giving us confidence in its meaning.

Rule: bluf -> blue. The meaning is the color blue, regardless of the surrounding context.",-1.0233924705341466,158,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf."" In each Input/Output pair, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color in the Output that is different from the colors represented by other words. Here are the key observations:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when surrounded by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" generates ""blue"" both times it appears. ""dax"" generates ""green"" and does not appear to affect the output for ""bluf.""
3. The third and fourth examples are identical, showing that ""dax"" followed by ""bluf"" consistently produces ""green green.""
4. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears twice and produces ""yellow"" both times, while ""wif"" produces ""red.""

From these observations, we can establish that ""bluf"" consistently results in the color ""blue"" when it follows ""lug,"" but it seems to take on the color corresponding to the preceding word when it follows ""dax"" (producing ""green"") and ""wif"" (producing ""yellow""). However, there is an inconsistency with ""yellow"" being produced instead of ""blue"" as we would expect in the first and fifth examples.

Given the discrepancy, a possible unifying rule is not apparent without additional context or examples. More information is necessary to generate a consistent rule for ""bluf."" Nonetheless, based on the majority of evidence it behaves like this:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" when following certain nonce words, but its output may change depending on the preceding nonce word's corresponding color within the sequence.",-1.1265279811012197,158,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the relationship between the input words and the corresponding output colors:

1. In the first example, the occurrence of 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue' in the output.
2. The second example confirms this, as 'bluf' once again corresponds to 'blue'.
3. The third and fourth examples show that when 'dax' and 'bluf' are the only two words in the input, the output is 'green green', but since 'dax' alone corresponds to 'green' in other examples, this is likely just a repetition of the color associated with 'dax', not indicative of 'bluf'.
4. The fifth example reinforces that 'bluf' translates to 'red' in the sequence 'red red yellow yellow', but given the context of other examples where 'wif' and 'zup' are associated with 'red' and 'yellow' respectively, it suggests that 'bluf' turns into 'yellow' here.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: 'bluf' corresponds to the color 'blue'. 

Hence:

bluf -> blue.",-1.3374796483012192,158,bluf
"From the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to a color that is represented in the outputs. Each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs corresponds to a specific color output that remains consistent across all examples, regardless of position or surrounding words. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the corresponding output is ""blue.""
- In the second input, ""bluf"" is also followed by ""lug,"" and again, ""blue"" is the output.
- The third and fourth inputs show ""bluf"" not followed by any other word, and the output is ""green"" which is repeated twice.
- The fifth input shows ""bluf"" in a sequence with other non-""bluf"" words, and ""yellow"" is the output following ""bluf.""

By examining the outputs, we can understand that the word ""bluf"" affects the color output that follows. Also, ""bluf"" itself follows a pattern where it adopts the color output of the word following it if there is one (as seen in examples 1 and 2), and if there isn't a word behind it (as in examples 3 and 4), then ""bluf"" produces a color consistent with the color of the word before it. In example 5, ""bluf"" seems to produce a yellow output, not following the previous rule strictly, but in this specific case, it is twice followed by ""zup"" which correlates with yellow, and thus might influence the output to be yellow.

The rule seems to be:

**Rule:** bluf -> The color of the word following it if there is one, or the color of the word before it if there isn't a word following it. In the case where the word following it is not directly associated with a single inherent color output, ""bluf"" seems to default to yellow.

However, the data provided is not extensive enough to be certain of the exact rule without any degree of ambiguity, especially due to the inconsistency in example 5.",-1.4715733069109755,158,bluf
"bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color blue in the output. For every occurrence of the word ""bluf"" in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Other words in the input translate to different colors, as indicated by the other example outputs.",-1.7955005972259752,158,bluf
"Analyzing the provided examples, let's identify a pattern that is consistent with the uses of ""walm"" and its corresponding output.

- Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
  Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

- Input: wif lug walm
  Output: red blue blue blue

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green

- Input: zup lug walm wif dax
  Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

- Input: dax walm wif dax
  Output: green green green red green

Based on these examples, we can deduce that the output color associated with ""walm"" depends on the word that comes before it.

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the repeated color in the output is red.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the repeated color in the output is blue.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the repeated color in the output is green.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" it transitions to yellow but follows with more colors in sequence.

It seems like ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word before it. However, there's another pattern for ""zup walm,"" which suggests that ""walm"" could have a dual function depending on the preceding word.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following rule:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word before it to repeat; with ""zup"" preceding it, ""walm"" triggers a sequence starting with yellow.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red. If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue. If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green. If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it starts a varied sequence with yellow.",-0.06505969638844024,158,walm

1. In the first input, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""red red red"" and ""yellow yellow yellow,"" respectively.
2. In the second input, ""wif lug walm,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""blue blue blue.""

5. Finally, in the fifth input, ""dax walm wif dax,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""green green green.""

Looking at the outputs, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word three times. Each nonce word has an associated color: ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and ""dax"" is green. So, whatever the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" the output repeats that color three times.

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" follows a word, it outputs the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.5300104134196847,158,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each occurrence of the word ""walm"" corresponds to three consecutive instances of the same color in the output. Additionally, the color that appears three times is not consistent across different examples but is determined by the word that precedes ""walm"". The rule for which color to repeat three times seems to depend on the first word in the sequence:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the color red is output three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color green is output three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or ""lug"", the exact rule is not clear from the given examples, as ""zup"" is followed by a sequence of yellow and blue, and ""lug"" is followed by blue. However, considering the ""wif lug walm"" example, ""lug"" results in a repeated blue, so it may be that ""lug"" precedes a triple color sequence as well. Further examples would be required to confirm the rule for ""zup"" and ""lug"".

Since ""walm"" consistently triggers a repetition of three of the same color, we can infer a rule:

- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'

It appears that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. If there is no word before ""walm"" that is associated with a specific color, then the word ""walm"" might not have any output (as there is no example provided for such a case).

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word multiple times. Here is the breakdown of the examples to support this deduction:

1. ""lug dax walm"" resulted in ""blue green green green."" After ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" the color green is repeated thrice.
2. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" outputted ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" After ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" the color blue is repeated thrice.
3. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" led to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" After ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" the color yellow is repeated thrice.
4. ""lug walm wif bluf"" resulted in ""blue blue blue red red."" After ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" the color blue is repeated twice (the pattern is slightly differed here but it could be the presence of ""bluf"" at the end, which may function differently).

However, in examples 4 and 5, ""walm"" is followed by two and one words, respectively, making the pattern less clear since the repetition does not continue beyond that point.

Taking these observations into account, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output onwards, unless interrupted by the end of the sequence or potentially by specific other words (like ""bluf"" in example 4).

Thus:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times onwards.",-0.10051844197431187,159,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the provided examples and how the input sequences translate to the output sequences. Let's analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug dax walm -> Output: blue green green green
2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif -> Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
3. Input: wif zup walm dax zup -> Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
4. Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red
5. Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Observing the examples where ""walm"" is present, it seems that for each occurrence of ""walm,"" the output repeats the color that immediately precedes it three times. For example, in the first input, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which follows the color ""green"" produced by ""dax.""

To further validate this rule, let's compare it with the rest of the examples:

- In the second example, ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we have ""blue blue blue"".
- In the third example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and directly after ""walm"" we observe ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and subsequent to ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and right after ""walm"" there is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

This pattern suggests that the rule for what ""walm"" means is consistent across all examples:

Rule: walm repeats the color of the word immediately before it three times.

Therefore: walm -> repeats the preceding color thrice.",-0.1326242350513978,159,walm
"Examining the patterns of input and output, we can establish the following:

- The word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the word that just preceded it.
- This effect continues until a new word with a different associated color appears.

Now, let's corroborate this with the given examples:

1. In ""lug dax walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" After ""dax,"" we see ""walm,"" which repeats the color of ""dax"" which is green, thus ""green green green.""

2. In ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" then ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"", resulting in ""blue blue blue."" Then ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

3. In ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again repeats the color of the preceding word (yellow). Then the pattern changes with ""dax"" as green and returns to ""zup"" which is yellow.

4. In ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""lug"" is blue, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the blue color. ""Wif"" changes the color to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" (presumably a typo, as it doesn't match the previous pattern) continues the red.

5. In ""zup walm dax lug,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the color of ""zup."" Then ""dax"" changes the color to green, and ""lug"" to blue.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is:

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" triggers repetition of the color that follows it, up until either a new color is introduced or the sequence ends. To break down the examples:

- In the first example, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" green is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times until ""wif"" leads to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated three times until ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and then ""zup"" again leads to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" blue is repeated twice, and then ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" which is repeated once.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" yellow is repeated twice until ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and then ""lug"" leads to ""blue.""

Thus, the rule seems to be:

"Observing the patterns and the color outputs, it seems that ""walm"" has a replication effect on the color that precedes it. The immediate color output before the ""walm"" is repeated for the number of times ""walm"" would indicate, incorporating any modifiers like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or ""wif"" which dictate specific colors.

For instance:

- In the first example, ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and that color is repeated three times due to the presence of ""walm.""
- Similarly, in the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" occurs three times sequentially before moving on to ""zup"" and ""wif"" colors.
- In the third, fourth, and fifth examples, the color that precedes ""walm"" is repeated three times as well.

Hence, the rule induced for ""walm"" is:

   - Here ""dax"" appears at the beginning and is associated with the color ""green"".

2. Input: ""wif dax"" Output: ""red green""

3. Input: ""dax walm"" Output: ""green green green""

- The third example, ""dax walm"", results in ""green green green"", where ""dax"" again corresponds to the first ""green"".
- The fourth example, ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"", translates to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"". Here, ""dax"" is the fourth word and matches with the fourth color ""green"".

"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""dax"" does not seem to be constant but rather dependent on its position in the sequence or perhaps its surrounding words. Let's analyze the patterns:

- Whenever ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""green red.""
- ""wif dax"" results in ""red green.""
- ""dax walm"" results in three ""green"" in a row.
- ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" results in an output where ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's examine each input and its corresponding output for patterns.

1. ""lug zup dax zup"" -> ""blue yellow green yellow""
2. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
4. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
5. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green""

From these lines, we make the following observations:
- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" follows in the output.
- The color ""yellow"" is not produced by any other input word.

Based on these observations, we arrive at the following rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-0.10346816773190001,160,zup

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need first to identify any patterns in the input and the corresponding output.

Let's analyze each input and its output:

1. Input: zup bluf dax | Output: yellow yellow green
   Here, zup corresponds to yellow, bluf also to yellow, and dax to green.

2. Input: lug bluf | Output: blue blue
   Here, lug corresponds to blue, and bluf also to blue.

3. Input: zup bluf wif bluf | Output: yellow yellow red red
   We can see again zup corresponds to yellow, and bluf corresponds to yellow. Wif corresponds to red and the second bluf again to red.

4. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup | Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   Again, the associations are zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow, wif -> red, dax -> green.

5. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif | Output: red green red red yellow red
   And once more, wif -> red, dax -> green, bluf -> red (different from previous examples), zup -> yellow.

From the above patterns, we can propose the following rule for the word ""bluf"":

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word before it to adopt a color from, then it defaults to yellow, as seen in the first input where it followed ""zup"" (yellow) and there is no prior occurrence to determine its color.

So based on this, we can write:

bluf -> meaning: The color of the preceding word or yellow if none precedes it.

Note: This rule is based on the given examples and assumes that the positioning of ""bluf"" relative to other words is the determining factor for its meaning. There might still be ambiguity concerning what happens if ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence because we don't have such an example.

The sequence ""wif zup"" has an output ""red yellow,"" which suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position, but the color before ""yellow"" in the output seems to be determined by what word comes before ""zup."" Since ""wif"" is before ""zup,"" it precedes the ""yellow"" with ""red"" in the output.

   Output: yellow blue blue

4. Input: lug bluf 
   Output: blue blue

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax 
   Output: green green red yellow green

From the given examples, we observe that the words before ""bluf"" each have a color associated with them (e.g., ""zup"" -> yellow, ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue). After ""bluf,"" the output color is the same as the color that was associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" Based on this pattern, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The color of the word immediately before ""bluf"" is repeated. 

If we apply this rule to the examples:

1. ""zup"" is yellow, so after ""bluf,"" the output repeats the color yellow.
2. ""zup"" is yellow again, so after ""bluf,"" the output repeats the color yellow.
3. ""lug"" is blue, so after ""bluf,"" the output repeats the color blue.
4. ""lug"" is again blue, so after ""bluf,"" the output repeats the color blue.
5. ""dax"" is green, so after ""bluf,"" the output repeats the color green.

This rule seems to be consistent with all the examples provided.",-0.08545287098087953,161,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color that repeats the color of the previous word. To verify this, let's look at each example:

- In ""zup dax bluf zup dax"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The word ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"", and its output color is ""green"", which is the color assigned to the previous word ""dax"". This suggests that ""bluf"" might repeat the color of the previous word.
  
- In ""wif zup bluf lug"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and its output color is ""yellow"", the same as the color for ""zup"".

- In ""zup lug bluf"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and its output color is ""blue"", which matches the color assigned to ""lug"".

- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", with the output also being ""blue"", again repeating the color of ""lug"".

- In ""dax bluf wif zup dax"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The word ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and its output color is ""green"", which is the color for ""dax"". This further supports the rule.

So, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word.",-0.21744577908467466,161,bluf
"Examining the examples given, we can attempt to deduce what ""bluf"" means in relation to the colors mentioned in the output. In each instance, ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color that directly follows it, if there is a word after ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is the last word, its color repeats the color of the word before it.

Let's go through the examples:

1. In ""zup dax bluf zup dax,"" the word ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" So in this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" the color before it repeats as ""yellow,"" which is the color assigned to ""zup.""

2. In ""wif zup bluf lug,"" the word ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" So, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" the color before it, and then repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

3. In ""zup lug bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" is the last word, and it repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

4. In ""lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" is the last word and repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

5. In ""dax bluf wif zup dax,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" So, ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and then corresponds to the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it, and if there's a word immediately after, it takes on that word's color as well.

In summary, the rule derived from these examples is that:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it and also takes on the color of the following word if there is one. If ""bluf"" is at the end, it only repeats the color of the word before it.",-0.3652229379209155,161,bluf
"bluf -> ""repeat the color of the previous word""

Rule: Whenever the word 'bluf' appears, it takes on the color value of the previous word mentioned in the input. If the preceding word is ""zup"", the color is ""yellow"", so 'bluf' becomes ""yellow"". If it is ""dax"", 'bluf' becomes ""green"", and if it is ""lug"", 'bluf' becomes ""blue"".

"To deduce the rule, we must look for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. Here are the given inputs and outputs:

2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

3. Input: lug walm zup lug walm

4. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Looking at the patterns, here's what we can observe:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the word that comes after ""walm"" in the output is always the same as the word immediately preceding ""walm."" This pattern is consistent across all examples. For instance, in example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" in the input, and in the output, the color after ""blue"" is ""blue"" (indicating ""zup"" is ""blue""). This means that ""walm"" makes the next word repeat the color of the previous word.

Based on this pattern, the rule appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the color that corresponds to the word following ""walm"" will be the same as the color assigned to the word immediately before ""walm.""",-0.06493403686845545,161,walm

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

The word ""walm"" appears to take on the color of the word immediately following it. In the given examples each time ""walm"" precedes another word, the output color for ""walm"" matches the color for the next word. Here are the examples highlighting this pattern:

- Input: dax lug walm zup wif
  Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
  (""walm"" adopts the color blue, which corresponds to ""zup"")

- Input: wif walm dax
  Output: red red red green
  (""walm"" adopts the color red, which corresponds to ""wif"")

- Input: lug walm zup lug walm

- Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif

- Input: wif dax zup walm

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the output by repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Let's examine each example to see the pattern:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs to identify any patterns.

Looking at the first example:

- Input: dax lug walm zup wif
- Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

The word ""walm"" is followed by the word ""zup,"" and both correspond to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Looking at the second example:

- Input: wif walm dax
- Output: red red red green

Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax,"" both resulting in the color ""red.""

In the third example:

- Input: lug walm zup lug walm
- Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

Again, ""walm"" is flanked by ""lug"" and ""zup,"" which correspond to ""blue.""

The fourth example shows:

- Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Here, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" and all are assigned ""yellow.""

In the last example:

- Input: wif dax zup walm
- Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

The ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output again is ""yellow.""

Considering these examples, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word following it. Whenever ""walm"" is followed by a particular word, the output color for ""walm"" is the same as the next word's color.

Rule: walm -> the color of the word following ""walm.""",-0.0772486596002673,161,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can analyze the outputs corresponding to the usage of ""walm"" as well as the other words (dax, lug, zup, wif) present in the inputs:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, it always produces ""blue"" except when preceded by ""zup"" or ""dax"" (as in the third example: ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow blue""). Therefore, ""walm"" likely means ""blue,"" but its meaning can change depending on the context or the preceding word.

- In the second example, ""wif walm dax"" produces ""red red red green,"" which seems like a consistency error according to the output of all other examples given. This could potentially be a mistake, or there might be a rule that is not evident from the provided examples.

Given the inconsistency in the second input-output pair, it is challenging to deduce a perfect rule without considering that it might be an exception or an error. If we treat it as an error and disregard the second example, the rule could be defined as:

To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the context in which it is used and the corresponding output:

- Example 1: ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> Output: green yellow red red blue
- Example 2: ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
- Example 3: ""dax zup bluf"" -> Output: green yellow yellow
- Example 4: ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> Output: red red blue green red
- Example 5: ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> Output: blue blue blue red red

By examining the patterns, we can observe that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when it follows certain words, and ""yellow"" when it follows others. More specifically:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" (Examples 4 and 5).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" (Examples 1, 2, and 3).

It appears that ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word preceding it, with ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and potentially other words translating to ""red"" and ""dax,"" ""zup"" translating to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the preceding word; ""red"" following ""wif,"" ""walm,"" or similar, and ""yellow"" following ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or similar.",-0.08816392582127368,162,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red. Below is the justification for this deduction.

In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" which outputs ""red blue."" In the second example, ""bluf"" precedes ""zup"" and appears before ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""blue yellow"" and ""yellow green"" respectively in the output. Notice that whenever ""bluf"" is present, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

In the third input where ""bluf"" is adjacent to ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" following ""green yellow,"" hinting once again at ""bluf"" correlating with ""red"" as it did in the first example.

In the fourth input, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""wif"" (which corresponds with ""red"") on one side and ""lug"" (which corresponds with ""blue"") on the other side, yielding the sequence ""red red blue"" in the output.

Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" is again present and followed by a repetition of ""walm wif,"" which corresponds to ""blue red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" translates into the color red.

Evidence:
- In example 1, ""bluf lug"" corresponds to ""red blue"".
- In example 2, ""wif lug bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue red"".
- In example 3, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red"".
- In example 4, ""wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""red red blue"".
- In example 5, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red"".

Therefore, bluf -> red.",-1.3472878474231578,162,bluf

Each output color correlates with a specific input word (zup -> yellow, wif -> red, dax -> green, lug -> blue), and the term ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the next word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated three times.",-0.8736596807226827,162,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to consistently translate to a repetition of the color immediately preceding it:

- In the first example, ""lug"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" following it translates to ""red red red.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" following it translates to ""green green green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" following it translates to ""green green green.""
- The fourth example only has ""dax"" and ""walm,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""green green green"" (a repetition of ""green"").
- The fifth example only has ""lug"" and ""walm,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" (a repetition of ""blue"").

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color word three times.",-1.1145464138397563,162,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to replicate the color associated with the word directly preceding it. The pattern shown is that the output color associated with ""walm"" is always the same as the color of the word before it, repeated three times. 

Here's the breakdown of the pattern observed:

- In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the color blue associated with ""lug"" is then repeated three times after ""walm"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" and the color green associated with ""dax"" is then repeated three times after ""walm"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" and, as before, the color green associated with ""dax"" is repeated three times after ""walm"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, there's only ""dax"" before ""walm"" and the output is simply the color green associated with ""dax"" repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is the color blue associated with ""lug"" repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color of the word directly before it to be output three times in a row.

Rule: walm -> The color of the preceding word is repeated three times.",-1.2236216209585364,162,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of color words. Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a series of color words that mirror the color word right before it. Breaking down the examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Therefore, three ""blues"" follow.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" Following ""walm,"" we see three ""greens.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" so the output after ""walm"" becomes three ""greens.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""lug"" respectively, each time producing three of the corresponding colors (green and blue).

"The provided examples consistently show patterns that help us deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"".

First, observe the outputs corresponding to known words:
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Now, let's examine the instances of ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   - Here, ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". The word ""walm"" also results in ""blue"".

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - In this example, ""lug"" > ""blue"", ""wif"" > ""red"". We can't decide what ""walm"" or ""bluf"" individually represent yet, but we have more instances to analyze.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - Again ""lug"" is ""blue"", followed by ""walm"" which also translates to ""blue"".

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   - Here ""zup"" > ""yellow"", ""dax"" > ""green"", ""lug"" > ""blue"". ""walm"" falls between ""zup"" and ""dax"" and translates to ""yellow"".

5. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - In this sequence, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", ""wif"" with ""red"", ""dax"" with ""green"", and ""zup"" with ""yellow"". ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow"".

Upon inspection, ""walm"" results in the color that comes immediately before it in the sequence. This rule holds true in all provided examples.

Rule:
walm -> the color represented by the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.",-0.07445761909268887,163,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare instances where it appears:

1. ""lug walm wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red""
2. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
4. ""zup walm dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green blue""
5. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""

In examples 1 and 3, ""lug walm"" consistently translates to ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" translates to ""blue"" when following ""lug.""

However, in example 2, ""walm"" at the end of the sequence leads to ""red,"" and ""lug"" following ""walm"" translates to ""blue."" In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""dax"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" In example 5, it is at the end, preceded by ""zup,"" and it leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" does not have an absolute fixed color translation but is influenced by the word(s) or context preceding or following it.

- In examples 1, 3, and part of example 2, ""walm"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" following ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and this translates to ""red"" then ""blue.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" translating to ""yellow yellow yellow green.""

Inductively summarizing these observations, we can derive the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it, except when ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence or followed by ""lug."" If ""walm"" is at the end or followed by ""lug,"" the sequence changes to a new color according to some other rule not fully defined by the provided examples. In example 2, the sequence ends with ""red"" instead of continuing the repeat pattern, and in example 4, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" with ""green,"" showing a change.

Thus, ""walm"" -> Repeats the color of the preceding word with exceptions noted above that may depend on the following word or position in the sequence.",-0.1285919741888889,163,walm
"Based on the provided examples, walm seems to correspond with a repetition of the color that precedes it. The first output is ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color blue, which is represented by ""lug."" To confirm this hypothesis, we must examine the other examples:

- In the second example, ""lug wif walm lug,"" the output is ""blue red red red blue."" Here we have ""wif"" corresponding to red, followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""red red."" This suggests that ""walm"" again repeats the color of the word prior to it.
  
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" which reinforces our initial inference.
  
- The fourth input, ""zup walm dax lug,"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Here ""zup"" corresponds with yellow and is followed by ""walm,"" which produces two more yellows in the output.
  
- Lastly, for ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" (yellow) comes right before ""walm,"" and the output is two additional yellows.

"Analyzing the examples provided, the pattern I notice is that:

- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue""
- ""dax"" results in ""green""

Each time ""walm"" appears, we can observe the number of color words that follow it:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (three ""yellow"")
2. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" results in ""blue red yellow red red red"" (there's one ""yellow"" followed by two ""red"")
3. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"" (the first ""walm"" is followed by one ""yellow"" and the second ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"")
4. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (three ""blue"")
5. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue green blue blue blue"" (three ""blue"")

It seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color word corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times.

So, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after another word, output the color corresponding to that word three times.

walm -> The color of the word before it, repeated three times.",-0.11605167465220925,164,walm

- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug wif zup wif walm"" results in ""blue red yellow red red red""
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue green blue blue blue""

One possible rule I can induce from these examples is that ""walm"" denotes repeating an output sequence of the color word that directly precedes it three times. In this context:

- ""zup walm"" has ""zup"" outputting ""yellow"" followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""yellow"" two more times.
- ""lug walm"" has ""lug"" outputting ""blue"" followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""blue"" two more times.
- When ""walm"" is at the end after a series of different color words, it repeats the color word right before it three times: ""dax lug dax lug walm"" ends with ""walm"" repeating ""lug's"" output, ""blue,"" three times.

Thus, the rule could be defined as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output of the word right before it three times.",-0.15295492734109303,164,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the relation between the input strings and their outputs:

1. Whatever precedes ""walm"" corresponds to a color in the output.
2. The color is repeated a number of times based on the word that appears before ""walm.""

From the given examples:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"": ""zup"" leads to a ""yellow"" output repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"": ""lug"" leads to a ""blue"" output repeated three times.
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue"": before the last ""lug,"" there is ""dax,"" which probably causes a change in the color associated with ""lug,"" but the final ""lug"" still produces ""blue"" three times.

The consistent rule in the context of these examples is that ""walm"" causes the direct repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in the input, and the number of repetitions is three.

Rule: walm -> the meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-0.9972412836837208,164,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns present in the input and output pairs:

- Whenever ""zup"" is in the input, the output is ""yellow"" (regardless of the presence of ""walm"").
- Whenever ""lug"" is in the input, the output is ""blue"" (also regardless of the presence of ""walm"").
- Whenever ""dax"" is in the input, the output is ""green"" (also regardless of the presence of ""walm"").
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" ""lug,"" or ""dax,"" the corresponding color (""yellow,"" ""blue,"" or ""green"") is repeated.
- ""Wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" as it does not repeat the previous color, but instead inserts its own.

From these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

2. zup walm lug zup wif dax => yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
3. wif dax bluf => red green green
4. dax walm => green green green
5. zup dax bluf => yellow green green

In examples 1, 3, and 5, we can see that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" since whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

To isolate ""dax,"" we can look at sentences with and without ""dax"" and compare the differences in the outputs. The word ""dax"" appears once in each of the first, third, fourth, and fifth examples, and twice in the second example.

Looking at the differences in the examples where ""dax"" is between two other words or at the beginning followed by another word, we can see that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"". In examples 1, 3, 4, and 5, wherever ""dax"" appears, ""green"" shows up in the output at the corresponding position. In example 2, ""dax"" is the second-to-last word and still translates to ""green"".

2. Input: wif bluf zup

3. Input: wif walm dax zup

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color meaning of the word immediately preceding it.",-0.06319493944207,165,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the outputs in relation to its position and surrounding words. By examining the relationship between the input sequences and the output sequences, we can attempt to infer the rule or meaning for ""bluf.""

Examining each instance where ""bluf"" occurs:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" precedes a ""wif"" and follows a ""dax,"" which results in an output of green.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" with no word after it, leading to an output of green.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" with no word after it, and it results once again in an output of red.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is the final word, with ""wif"" preceding it, and the output is red.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" occurs twice: once after a ""wif,"" leading to a red output, and once before a ""wif,"" also leading to a red output.

From these examples, we can observe that when ""bluf"" is followed by any word, the output color is green. However, when ""bluf"" is at the end or is followed by ""wif,"" the output color is red.

Another noticeable pattern is that the word preceding ""bluf"" does not affect its corresponding output color. The output color is solely determined by whether ""bluf"" is followed by a word or not, and specifically if it is followed by ""wif.""

With this information, we can compile a tentative rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is followed by any word except ""wif,"" the output is green. When ""bluf"" is at the end or followed by ""wif,"" the output is red.

- ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red green blue.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red.""
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""
- ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow.""

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" as seen from the instances where these words occur without ""bluf.""
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as seen in instances where ""dax"" is present without ""bluf.""

With these clues, we notice that ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat, except when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" where it simply translates to ""red"" regardless of the preceding color.

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, except when preceded by ""wif,"" where ""bluf"" always translates to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word, unless ""wif"" precedes it, then it means ""red.""",-0.10670466383840004,166,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that follows the word ""zup"" in the sequence. This can be seen in the following mapping:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red."" Here bluf represents the color following ""zup,"" which is yellow.

2. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red green blue."" Here bluf again represents yellow, which follows ""zup.""

3. ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red."" There's no ""zup"" before bluf, but based on other examples where ""lug"" is consistently mapped to blue, it can be assumed that ""bluf"" still means red here due to the consistency of the other colors ""wif"" with red and ""lug"" with blue.

4. ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red."" This also reinforces that ""bluf"" might represent red, as ""wif"" is consistently mapped to red.

5. ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow."" Here, the word ""bluf"" again represents yellow, following ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> red

The justification for this rule is that whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output is red, except in sequences containing the word ""zup"" where ""bluf"" takes the color directly after ""zup."" However, this rule is less consistent due to the third example that does not contain ""zup"" but still outputs red after ""bluf."" Given the mixed evidence, the more conservative interpretation is that ""bluf"" represents red, with a special case when following ""zup.""",-0.11929845544686667,166,bluf
"Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color that is produced by repeating the color associated with the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"". Here are the correlations:

- In ""zup wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".
- In ""zup bluf wif dax lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".
- In ""lug wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".
- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" alone corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color ""yellow."" The rule can be inferred as follows:

Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" Other words in the input correlate to different colors; for instance, ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze how the output changes when ""walm"" is introduced in different examples.

1. zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

In this series, when ""walm"" appears, ""blue"" follows which was the color immediately preceding it, so ""walm"" might mean to repeat the previous color.

2. wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Again, ""red"" follows ""walm,"" which was the color immediately before it.

3. zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Once more, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow,"" which is the color that was before ""walm.""

4. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Each time ""walm"" appears, the color that follows is a repetition of the one just before ""walm.""

5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Here too, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue,"" the color that proceeds it.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Walm means to repeat the color that was mentioned before it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color.",-0.06043693430907079,166,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples to see how ""walm"" affects the output.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
- ""zup"" gives yellow at both occurrences.
- ""dax"" gives green.
- ""lug"" gives blue at both occurrences.
- After ""walm"" is introduced, the following ""zup"" no longer results in yellow, instead it results in blue, which is what ""lug"" results in.
  
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" gives red.
- After ""walm,"" ""dax"" no longer gives green but red instead.

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- ""zup"" gives yellow.
- After ""walm,"" ""dax"" gives yellow, which is what ""zup"" normally gives.
  
Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- ""lug"" gives blue and ""wif"" gives red.
- After the first ""walm,"" ""zup"" gives blue instead of its normal yellow.
- After the second ""walm,"" ""wif"" gives yellow, which is a new result for ""wif"".
  
Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- ""dax"" normally gives green, ""lug"" gives blue, and ""wif"" gives red.
- After ""walm"" is used, ""dax"" still gives blue as ""lug"" normally does.
- The non-standard word ""bluf"" seems to be ignored or results in red, but there seems to be no consistency given the available examples for the output color for ""bluf.""

Rule:
Based on the sequences and their outputs, ""walm"" seems to cause the next word to inherit the output color of the previous word instead of its normal assigned color. Using the form ""walm -> meaning,"" the rule seems to be:

walm -> causes the next word to take on the same output color as the previous word in the sequence.",-0.08470817525504427,166,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the occurrences of the word ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs in the given examples.

- Example 1: ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue""; this suggests that ""walm"" mirrors the color that comes before it. But we need to validate this with more examples.
- Example 2: ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red""; this further supports that ""walm"" might be replicating the color before it.
- Example 3: ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow""; this continues to back the theory.
- Example 4: ""lug walm"" and ""zup walm"" lead to ""blue blue"" and ""yellow yellow"" respectively; against this pattern continues.
- Example 5: ""lug walm"" and ""dax walm"" lead to ""blue blue"" and ""green green""; reinforcing the pattern.

Given that in each case, the word ""walm"" follows a color word and the color output for ""walm"" is the same as that color word, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> meaning. Walm acts as a mirror or duplicate for the color word that precedes it.",-1.2517248146391151,166,walm
"Based on the examples given, we can observe the following:

1. When `walm` is preceded by `zup`, the corresponding color sequence includes `yellow` followed by `yellow`. (From example 1 and example 3)

2. When `walm` is preceded by `wif`, the corresponding sequence is `yellow yellow red`. (From example 4)

3. When `walm` follows `dax` and `lug`, or `lug` alone, it results in `blue`. (From example 1, 3, and 5)

4. When `walm` follows `dax` without `lug`, it results in `red`. (From example 5)

Combining these observations, we can induce that the rule for `walm` is not dependent on `walm` itself, but rather its position relative to the words before it. Specifically:

`walm` -> This seems to denote a color change that is contextually dependent on the word(s) that precede it. It switches to `yellow` when preceded by the word `zup` or `wif`, and `blue` when following `lug` or the sequence `dax lug`. After `dax` without `lug`, it corresponds to `red`. 

However, the given examples are not exhaustive, and the behavior of `walm` may vary in other contexts not presented here. Thus, the general rule seems to be:

Rule: `walm` changes color based on the word that precedes it, with observed behaviors of switching to `yellow` after `zup` or `wif`, to `red` after `dax` not followed by `lug`, and to `blue` after `lug` or the sequence `dax lug`.",-1.348784810078761,166,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should examine how the output colors correspond to the input words. In each example, ""walm"" precedes a specific color in the output. Let's examine the color that follows ""walm"" in each instance:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""red.""
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue,"" then ""yellow,"" and then ""yellow.""
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue.""

Upon inspecting these sequences, we can notice that ""walm"" does not always translate to the same color in the output. Hence, ""walm"" seems to be functioning according to a certain rule, which depends on the context or the words around it. Since other words consistently result in the same color, ""walm"" could be like a modifier that changes the output based on its position or surrounding words. 

However, with the provided data, it's not immediately clear what specific rule ""walm"" follows. We need more information to pinpoint the rule it operates under. One potential rule could be that ""walm"" takes the color of the word immediately following it, though the fourth input shows that it can repeat colors even if it is not immediately followed by another ""walm.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Analyzing the outputs, ""bluf"" always generates the color mentioned immediately before it. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is green followed by another green. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is red followed by another red.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be repeating the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.08743205900344446,167,bluf

2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
4. dax bluf -> green green
5. wif dax bluf -> red green green

Analyzing the input-output pairings, it seems that ""bluf"" consistently produces an output with two colors of the same value. 

Breaking down these examples further:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" is between other words, it keeps the same pattern of repeating the color associated with the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.13002468102652778,167,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the correspondence between the inputs containing ""bluf"" and their respective outputs:

- Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
- Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green

Observations:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" is present, the output always contains the color red or green repeated twice.
2. ""bluf"" does not seem to be associated with a single color; instead, the color repeats depend on the word that comes before ""bluf"". 
3. ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""dax"" corresponds to green. When they precede ""bluf"", the color that they correspond to is doubled in the output.

"Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that the word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the last color mentioned before it. In other words, ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color of the preceding word will be repeated for an undetermined number of times. Here's the breakdown of why this makes sense according to the examples:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Explanation: ""wif"" equates to red, which is then followed by ""walm"" causing the red to repeat.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
Explanation: ""dax"" represents green, and ""walm"" proceeds it causing the green to repeat, followed by a ""zup"" which changes the color to yellow.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Explanation: Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and since ""walm"" follows, it results in repetition of the color blue.

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
Explanation: ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" equivalent to yellow. ""Walm"" repeats the yellow. Then ""wif"" changes the sequence to red.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
Explanation: ""wif"" is red, and ""lug"" is blue. ""Walm"" comes after the blue and so the blue is repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color mentioned immediately before the word ""walm"".",-0.0858076768166867,167,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each pair of inputs and outputs:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

2. Input: dax walm zup

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

Analyzing the inputs alongside their outputs, we can infer the following mappings for words unrelated to ""walm"":

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Now let's focus on the occurrences of ""walm"":

1. After ""wif walm"" -> red red red
2. Between ""dax"" and ""zup,"" where dax -> green and zup -> yellow, we get green green green yellow. The presence of ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""green"" before the usual pattern resumes with ""yellow.""
3. Following ""lug walm,"" with lug -> blue, results in blue blue blue, a repetition of blue.
4. Flanked by ""dax zup,"" where dax -> green and zup -> yellow, and followed by ""wif"" (red), the result is yellow yellow yellow before the ""wif"" -> red comes in, again repeating the color before it.
5. After ""lug walm,"" with lug -> blue, we get blue blue blue, once more a repetition of blue.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the color indicated by the word before it. If a color word precedes ""walm,"" the corresponding output color is repeated three times.

- In Examples 1 and 4, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In Examples 1, 3, and 5, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in Examples 1, 2, and 4.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in Examples 2, 3, and 4.

Looking at the word ""walm"" and its corresponding output:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
2. Input: dax walm zup -> Output: green green green yellow
3. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
4. Input: dax zup walm wif -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
5. Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue

The common pattern here is that ""walm"" seems to produce a series of outputs of the same color that is directly following it. In every instance, starting with the word after ""walm,"" that same color repeats until a new word (associated with a different color) or the end of the line.

For example:
- In the first example, ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red"".
- In the second example, after ""walm"" is ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", and the output is ""green yellow"".
- In the third example, it's a series of ""blue"" following ""walm"".
- And so on in the other examples.

2. In the second example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" once again indicating a repetition of the color related to ""dax,"" which is green, three times after ""walm.""
3. The third example follows this pattern with ""lug walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue;"" the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue.
4. The fourth example shows ""zup walm wif,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where the triple yellow corresponds to ""zup"" before ""walm,"" followed by red for ""wif.""
5. The fifth example displays ""lug walm"" again resulting in ""blue blue blue,"" in keeping with our rule regarding ""lug"" and ""walm.""

2. In ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" and in ""zup dax,"" the output is ""yellow green."" This suggests that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" when it precedes another word, but we need more examples to confirm.

3. In ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" the output is ""yellow red red yellow blue."" Here, ""zup"" is both the first and the fourth word. According to the output, it is yellow both times, which supports the idea that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

4. Finally, in ""lug bluf zup lug,"" the output is ""blue blue yellow blue."" Once again, ""zup"" precedes the final word ""lug"" and maps to ""yellow.""

1. ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red,"" where ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means taking on the color of the word that comes right before it.",-0.09373293103681818,168,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we need to analyze the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the first and third examples:
- ""zup bluf wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow red""
- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red""

In both cases, the word ""bluf"" resulted in the repetition of the color that came before it. 

Now, consider the second example:
- ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow blue green blue""

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and before ""lug"", and the output repeats ""yellow"" before moving on to ""blue"".

In the fourth example:
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

""Bluf"" appears at the end after ""wif"", and again, ""bluf"" results in an additional ""red"" being added after the ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"".

Lastly, the fifth example:
- ""lug bluf dax lug"" leads to ""blue blue green blue""

""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue"" before going on to ""green"" for ""dax"".

Across all the examples, it consistently appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.",-0.11377247483875003,168,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" is a nonce word that takes on the color value of the word that appears directly before it. The transformation from word to color is consistent: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" When ""bluf"" is used after these words, it repeats the color that the preceding word indicates.

Here are the patterns from the examples provided:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""red red.""
- The word ""bluf"" does not seem to correspond to a color when it is not immediately preceded by another color-indicating word, suggesting that its meaning is dependent on the previous word.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the word that directly precedes it.",-1.1809167457318184,168,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" prompts a repetition in the output of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color linked to the previous word.
- The third example further supports this, with ""wif bluf"" leading to ""red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" within the sequence repeats the color red for ""wif.""
- The fifth example, ""lug bluf,"" again exhibits a doubling of the color blue for ""lug.""

So the rule we can deduce is:

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",-1.789671288851136,168,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" corresponds to a color pattern in the output. To determine its meaning, let's analyze the pattern associated with ""walm"" in each example:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

- ""walm"" corresponds to the second red in the output. The next color is green, which does not seem to follow the pattern of the first ""wif"".

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

- ""walm"" corresponds to the third blue in the output. The first ""wif"" is red. There is no ""dax"" or ""zup"" - only ""lug"" and ""walm.""

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

- ""walm"" corresponds to third blue then yellow, with a sequence of blue before each ""walm"". This is the first instance where we can see a pattern that has a ""zup"" after ""walm"", resulting in a yellow. This might indicate ""walm"" becomes yellow if followed by ""zup"".

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

- ""walm"" corresponds to the second green followed by blue.

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

- ""walm"" corresponds to both the second green and the first yellow, with the pattern being green followed by yellow, indicating the ""walm"" following ""zup"" is yellow again.

From these observations, we can deduce a pattern for ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax,"" it induces a green color in the output. 
2. When ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" it induces a yellow color in the output. 

Thus, we can conclude:
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" followed by ""zup"" -> yellow

The presence of other words like ""wif"" and ""lug"" does not conclusively change the output color for ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> green when immediately following ""dax""; walm -> yellow when followed by ""zup"".",-0.07296526440382026,168,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern of the output colors in relation to the input, specifically looking at the instances where ""walm"" appears.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax,"" and all three are ""red."" ""Zup"" is then ""yellow.""

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- ""Walm"" is at the end, following ""wif"" and ""lug,"" which are ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively. However, ""walm"" is also ""blue"" here despite ""wif"" being ""red.""

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
- ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" both times and is ""blue"" both times, while ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and is ""green,"" then ""lug"" follows and is ""blue.""

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" (which is green) and precedes ""zup"" (which is yellow), and the output for ""walm"" is ""green."" Later, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and takes on the color ""yellow.""

From these observations, it seems the color associated with ""walm"" is either the same as the color of the word preceding it or ""walm"" becomes ""red"" if preceded by ""wif."" When following ""zup,"" ""walm"" adopts the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow."" Notably, the color ""blue"" is consistent whenever preceded by ""lug.""

Based on these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" changes its color based on the word that precedes it, with the exception of ""zup,"" which dictates that the following word (including ""walm"") becomes ""yellow."" Therefore, ""walm"" has no fixed color but assumes the color of the previous word or becomes ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

Rule:  
walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it, except when it follows ""zup,"" in which case it becomes ""yellow.""",-0.08958565668715732,168,walm
"Based on the provided examples, whenever the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is a repetition of the preceding color. So, for each instance of ""walm,"" the output repeats the color that represents the word immediately before ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

- In the first input, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- In the third input, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" confirming that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- In the fourth input, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- In the fifth input, the sequence ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" and then ""walm"" alone causes another ""yellow,"" showing again that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",-0.9210149581770785,168,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can infer a rule governing the output for each input that contains the nonce word ""walm."" Let's examine the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

- Each time ""walm"" appears, the word(s) that follow ""walm"" are repeated in the output in terms of color.
- The color repetition begins after the color assigned to ""walm,"" which is always green.
- The color pattern for ""walm"" is not influenced by the word that precedes it.
- ""Wif"" is followed by red, ""lug"" by blue, ""dax"" by green, and ""zup"" by yellow when they are not preceded by the word ""walm"".

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the following word to be repeated, starting with ""green"" for ""walm"" itself.

Rule: walm -> causes the following word's color output to repeat, beginning with green for ""walm.""",-1.0107535126348317,168,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the output color sequence. To deduce a rule, we should look for patterns associated with ""walm"" in both the input and the output:

1. Every time ""walm"" is in the input, the output color corresponding to it is ""green.""

2. When ""walm"" appears, it also appears to affect the word before it, making it ""green"" as well.

3. In the second example where ""walm"" is the last word, the entire output sequence is ""blue,"" except for ""wif,"" which consistently corresponds to ""red."" This suggests that ""walm"" can turn the preceding words to ""blue,"" but there might be specific words (""wif"" in this case) that have a fixed output color.

4. ""walm"" does not change the color of the word after it, evidenced by ""zup"" always turning ""yellow,"" regardless of ""walm"" preceding it.

5. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the ""lug"" becomes ""blue,"" but when ""lug"" appears after ""walm,"" it retains its ""blue"" color.

From the observed patterns, the rule induced for ""walm"" could be the following:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sentence, the word just before ""walm"" and ""walm"" itself turn green, with the exception that if the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" then ""wif"" remains red.

4. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue), it outputs two more blues.
5. When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"", it produces three yellows before the blue from ""lug.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word, with the repeat count represented by the additional number of the output color.

- When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is outputted thrice, as seen in the first and third examples (""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"").
- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times, as in the second example (""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"").
- When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times, as in the fourth example (""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"").

bluf -> blue",-1.827085672634091,170,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of its occurrence and the corresponding output colors.

1. In the first example:
   Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""walm"" appears twice and is followed by red red yellow the first time, and by yellow yellow the second time.

2. In the second example:
   Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   ""walm"" appears once and is followed by yellow yellow.

3. In the third example:
   Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""walm"" appears once and is followed by yellow yellow.

4. In the fourth example:
   Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   ""walm"" appears twice; the first time it is followed by green red and the second time by green green.

5. In the fifth example:
   Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""walm"" occurs once and is followed by red red.

Now, let's try to identify a pattern. ""Walm"" seems to always add at least two colors to the output pattern. When we look closely, we see that ""walm"" is associated with an addition of ""red"" and one or more instances of the color that comes before it in the input sequence.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the preceding word, add two instances of that color, and then add ""red."" 

Let's apply this rule to validate each example:

- Example 1: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" is followed by ""red red"" then ""yellow"" from ""zup"" twice.
- Example 2: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow yellow"" as per our rule.
- Example 3: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow yellow.""
- Example 4: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" is followed by ""green green"" and ""red.""
- Example 5: 'wif' corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" is followed by ""red red.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color from the previous word twice, then add ""red"".",-0.06331372095850646,170,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of outputs corresponding to the inputs where this word appears.

1. In the first input, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" the output is ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Each appearance of ""walm"" is followed by one or more occurrences of ""yellow.""

2. In the second input, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""walm"" is followed by two occurrences of ""yellow,"" while the other colors are not repeated immediately.

3. In the third input, ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again multiple occurrences of ""yellow"" after ""walm.""

4. In the fourth input, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" ""walm"" is followed by repeated occurrences of ""green.""

5. In the fifth input, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""walm"" is followed by repeated ""red.""

From these examples, we can see that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color output that immediately follows its first occurrence. It duplicates the next color indication in the output sequence, hence creating a pattern of repetition for that particular color.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color word to be repeated in the output sequence.",-0.35279889298939815,170,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of a color for a subsequent number of words, including itself. To verify the rule, we should look for patterns where the word ""walm"" appears and what follows in the output:

1. wif walm -> red red red
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. wif walm -> red red red (again from example 1)
5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

In each instance, the color that appears right before ""walm"" repeats an additional two times after the occurrence of ""walm."" The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated two more times, including the one with ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: When 'walm' appears, it causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding 'walm' to be repeated two more times, for a total of three consecutive occurrences including the instance of 'walm'.",-1.034474278205926,170,walm
"Analyzing the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can deduce a pattern by focusing on the instances of the nonce word ""walm"" and how it changes the output:

1. Every occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by a succession of ""yellow."" The number of ""yellow"" that follows seems to depend on a rule or context we need to determine.

Let's examine occurrences of ""walm"":

- In the first example, the first ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" and the second ""walm"" is followed by four ""yellow.""
- In the second example, the single ""walm"" is followed by four ""yellow.""
- In the third example, the single ""walm"" is followed by two ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, the first ""walm"" is followed by two ""yellow"" and the second ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, the single ""walm"" is followed by two ""yellow.""

2. ""Walm"" seems to affect the number of ""yellow"" based on the number of words that precede it in the sequence. Specifically, the number of ""yellow"" that follows ""walm"" seems to be one more than the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the sequence.

Let's apply this rule to check the examples:

- Example 1: ""wif walm"" yields 2 reds and 3 yellows, while ""lug zup walm"" yields 2 words and 4 yellows following.
- Example 2: ""zup lug zup walm"" yields 3 words and 4 yellows following.
- Example 3: ""zup walm"" yields 1 word and 2 yellows following.
- Example 4: ""dax walm"" yields 1 word and 2 yellows following, and ""lug dax walm"" yields 2 words and 3 yellows following.
- Example 5: ""wif walm"" yields 1 word and 2 yellows following.

Rule: The word ""walm"" is followed by a number of ""yellow"" that is one more than the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the sequence.

Thus, based on the pattern identified:

walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the output is a number of ""yellow"" that is one more than the number of words that come before ""walm"" in the sequence.",-1.169000820526991,170,walm
"Based on the provided information, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated color. To determine the specific rule, let's analyze the pattern in relation to already known colors and the position of ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif"", ""lug"", or ""dax"", the previous color is repeated.
2. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"", ""walm"" itself generates the color yellow, which is then repeated.

- wif walm: ""wif"" generates red, followed by ""walm"", which repeats the color red.
- zup walm: ""zup"" generates yellow, followed by ""walm"", which repeats the color yellow.
- dax walm: ""dax"" generates green, followed by ""walm"", which repeats the color green.

Rule:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color that was generated by the word just before ""walm"". If ""walm"" comes after ""zup"", it generates yellow and then repeats it.",-1.2034328141583335,170,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue."" Regardless of the word that appears before ""lug,"" the color blue is always part of the output, and when ""lug"" is given alone, the only output is ""blue."" It is also evident that the other words may correlate to other specific colors.

Here's the breakdown:
- wif lug -> red blue (wif correlates with red)
- zup lug -> yellow blue (zup correlates with yellow)
- dax lug -> green blue (dax correlates with green)
- lug -> blue (only lug results in blue)
- lug bluf wif -> blue blue red (bluf does not seem to change the output color set since ""wif"" still correlates with red)

- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"" – ""wif"" must mean ""red"" and ""bluf"" causes it to appear twice.
- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"" – ""zup"" must mean ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" causes it to appear twice.
- ""zup wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow red red"" – ""bluf"" affects only the word ""wif"" that directly follows it, resulting in ""red"" being repeated.

   Rule observed: ""wif"" before ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times before the sequence. ""zup"" before ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times after.

2. Example: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   Rule observed: ""zup"" before ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

3. Example: ""zup dax lug walm zup lug""
   Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
   Rule observed: ""lug"" before ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times.

4. Example: ""wif walm dax zup""
   Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   Rule observed: ""dax"" between ""walm"" and ""zup"" changes the output order from the observed ""red red red yellow"" to ""red red red green yellow.""

5. Example: ""wif bluf dax walm""
   Output: ""red red green green green""
   Rule observed: ""bluf"" does not directly precede ""walm"", and ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", which appears to lead to a repeated ""green"" instead of ""red.""

Combining the observations, it seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of colors, with the specific color and number of repetitions depending on the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Furthermore, the color corresponds to the color associated with the preceding word:
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" (preceding walm and following another word) -> ""green""

It seems that ""walm"" causes the previous word's color to repeat three times if ""walm"" is the immediate next word. If there is an intervening word (""dax""), though, the repetition changes to the color green three times.

Rule:
walm -> Triggers the repetition of three instances of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it unless there is an intervening word like ""dax"", in which case the color green is repeated three times instead.",-0.09468406429361292,171,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in three consecutive occurrences of whatever color immediately follows it in the input list. Here is the rule deduced from the inputs and outputs:

- When ""wif"" is present, the output color is red.
- When ""zup"" is present, the output color is yellow.
- When ""dax"" is present, the output color is green.
- When ""lug"" is present, the output color is blue.
- ""walm"" causes the next color word to repeat three times in the output.

Let's analyze the examples provided to derive this rule:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
The presence of ""wif"" results in ""red,"" while ""walm"" causes the next color mentioned (""zup"" -> yellow) to be repeated three times.

2. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
The presence of ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
Here, each word has a corresponding color (""zup""->yellow, ""dax""->green, ""lug""->blue), and the ""walm"" causes the color following it (""zup""->yellow) to not be repeated since there is no immediate direct color word after ""walm"".

4. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
The presence of ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and the first ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times. Then, the ""dax"" results in ""green,"" followed by ""zup"" which results in ""yellow"".

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
There is no defined color for ""bluf"" in the outputs, which may imply a missing data point or that ""bluf"" is irrelevant in determining the output. Thus, ""wif"" results in ""red"" (repeated twice, possibly an anomaly or due to a missing rule for ""bluf""), ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" would be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next color output generated by a word to repeat three times. If ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence or not followed by a color-associated word, no repetition occurs.",-0.09780692183768817,171,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to imply a rule that involves repeating the color associated with the previous word three times. For example, in the input ""wif walm zup walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""walm"" following it results in ""red"" being repeated three times. Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" following it results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times. 

In the examples provided, the color association is as follows:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

Each time ""walm"" is mentioned, the color associated with the immediately preceding word is repeated three times in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a color-associated word, output the corresponding color of that word three times.",-0.8449269108652689,171,walm
"From the examples provided, we can try to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here are the observations:

1. Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, a series of the same color appears in the output.
2. The number of times a color repeats seems to correspond to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. For instance:
    - When ""walm"" is the second word (Input: wif walm zup walm), the color repeats twice (Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow).
    - When ""walm"" is the first word after a single other word (Input: zup walm), the color repeats three times (Output: yellow yellow yellow).

3. The color before ""walm"" does not repeat, suggesting ""walm"" does not influence the previous color.
4. ""Walm"" only affects the color after it appears, by repeating that color a certain number of times, with the number of repetitions possibly being the number of words before ""walm"" plus one.

Based on the observations, here is the deduced rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" causes the next color to repeat a number of times equal to the number of words before ""walm"" plus one.",-1.0996008859352684,171,walm
"Based on the examples provided:

- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" suggesting that the word ""walm"" either means a repetition of the color red or a transition to another color.
- However, in all cases where ""walm"" appears, the color always shifts to yellow, and the number of repetitions of yellow matches the number of ""walm"" occurrences.

Therefore, we deduce that ""walm"" triggers a switch to the color yellow and the number of ""walm"" repetitions correlates to the number of yellow occurrences. Other words like ""zup"" and ""dax"" seem to have their own corresponding colors but do not affect the pattern established by ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> transition to the color yellow, repeated as many times as ""walm"" appears.",-1.2025489588989247,171,walm

In each example, regardless of position or surrounding words, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the examples given. By comparing the inputs with their respective outputs, let's try to deduce the rule.

In the first example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"". ""Dax"" by itself isn't given in any other examples, but we know that it results in ""green"" in the output.

In the second example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red"". We can see that ""lug"" precedes ""blue"" in the output and ""walm"" isn’t shown in other examples, but its presence also results in ""blue"" in the output. ""Bluf"" is present and translates to ""red"", which is consistent with ""wif bluf"" resulting in ""red red"".

In the third and fourth examples, ""wif bluf"" consistently translates to ""red red"", indicating that every word in the input is repeated in the output color pattern as many times as there are unique words before 'wif'. Thus, 'wif"" seems to function as a delimiter that ensures ""bluf"" translates to two instances of ""red"".

In the fifth example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"". We know from the second example that ""lug"" results in ""blue"". It seems that ""wif"" functions as a repeat signal for the color linked with the word before it.

Given this pattern, a rule for ""wif"" could be:

wif -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding unique word as many times as there have been unique words before 'wif'.

Rule: ""wif"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the prior word, with the number of repetitions equalling the count of unique words before 'wif' in the input sequence.",-0.27112555804390626,172,wif
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the correspondence between the inputs and outputs provided in the examples.

Looking at the examples where ""wif"" is used:

- ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red""

Assuming each word in the input contributes to a color in the output and analyzing the other words:

- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""walm"" and ""bluf"" seem to produce their respective colors, ""blue"" and ""red,"" more than once.

From the pattern, we can see that:

- ""wif"" appears in the input each time there's a ""red"" in the output.
- Whenever ""wif"" is used alone with another word (excluding ""lug"" and ""dax"" which already have a defined color), the output is doubled, i.e., ""bluf"" on its own would produce one ""red,"" but combined with ""wif,"" it produces ""red red.""
- When ""wif"" is combined with ""dax"" or ""lug,"" there is no doubling effect, and ""red"" only appears once.

Given these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be:
- ""wif"" by itself produces the color ""red.""
- When combined with another color word, ""wif"" seems to replicate that color an additional time.

So the rule for ""wif"" could be:

Rule: ""wif"" indicates that the color immediately following it should be doubled in the output. If ""wif"" is at the end or there are no specific color words after it, it defaults to ""red.""",-0.3459608574564062,172,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

The word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input.

To confirm this rule, let's look at each example:

1. `dax wif` corresponds to `green red`. Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

2. `lug walm wif bluf` corresponds to `blue blue blue red red`. In this example, ""lug"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""blue"", with ""wif"" and ""bluf"" together resulting in ""red red"".

3. `wif bluf` corresponds to `red red`, again confirming that ""wif"" results in a ""red"".

From these observations, it seems that each given word before ""wif"" corresponds to a single color output, and ""wif"" itself results in a ""red"" output every time it is mentioned.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> ""red""",-0.4038799669729688,172,wif
"Observing the examples, the word ""wif"" seems to be consistently followed by the output ""red."" Therefore, we can infer that ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red."" Looking at the other words in the input, it seems like ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""lug"" and ""walm"" map to ""blue,"" while ""bluf"" maps to ""red"" as well.

Based on the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can deduce:

- ""dax"" and ""lug"" seem to contribute one color to the output each time they appear.
- ""walm"" appears once, paired with ""lug,"" and the output shows ""blue"" twice, hinting that it could also translate to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
- ""bluf"" outputs ""red,"" possibly indicating that the word itself translates to ""red.""

The word following ""wif"" does not seem to influence its meaning, as even when it stands alone or is paired with ""bluf"" (which at the very least means ""red""), the output is simply ""red red.""

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",-0.7478306262281251,172,wif
"Observing the examples provided:

- In the first and fifth examples, ""wif"" appears before a single-colored output: ""dax wif"" results in ""green red"" and ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red."" This suggests that ""wif"" is somehow related to the appearance of the color red, but is responsive to some preceding word that determines the first color.

- In the second and third/fourth examples, ""wif"" appears amidst other words and the output sequence concludes with ""red red."" This suggests that ""wif"" may trigger the output of ""red"" and that there might be another rule governing the first part of each output sequence.

Based on these observations, ""wif"" appears to result in the color ""red"" being part of the output. However, the precise rule for what comes before ""red"" is not clear from the examples provided alone, since the examples do not provide enough variation before the word ""wif.""

Thus, the rule we can deduce with the highest confidence is:

Rule: ""wif"" -> results in the output including the color ""red"".",-1.2947100336171873,172,wif
"Based on the given examples, ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to the word ""yellow"". Here is the analysis:

1. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"", and based on other examples, ""wif"" is consistently ""red"". This suggests that ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

2. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow"". We can see that ""dax"" is ""green"", repeating the colors for repeating words. Following this pattern, ""walm wif walm"" translates to ""green red green"", and hence ""zup"" at the end must represent ""yellow"".

3. ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" is ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and given the symmetry, both instances of ""zup"" on either end correlate with ""yellow"".

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow"". Other words are consistently translated as before, leaving ""zup"" as ""yellow"".

5. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". The word ""lug"" repeats as ""blue"", leaving ""zup"" as ""yellow"".

Therefore, based on the examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-0.07595351412804165,172,zup
"To determine the meaning of zup, let's examine the patterns associated with its occurrences in each example:

1. zup wif -> yellow red
2. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
3. zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
4. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
5. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue

By analyzing the inputs and outputs, we can make the following observations:

- In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" shows up in the output.
- ""Zup"" seems to alter the pattern of the words following it, but one thing remains consistent: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Let's derive the rule:

- In the first input, ""zup"" comes before ""wif,"" and the corresponding output starts with ""yellow"" followed by the color represented by ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- In the second input, ""zup"" appears at the end of the sequence, and the corresponding output also ends with ""yellow."" Before that, there are sequences of ""green"" and ""red,"" which correlate with the words ""dax"" (green) and ""walm"" (red) being repeated.
- In the third input, ""zup"" appears both at the beginning and the end of the sequence. Accordingly, the output starts and ends with ""yellow."" The pattern in-between follows the sequence of other words presented.
- In the fourth and fifth inputs, ""zup"" also corresponds directly to ""yellow"" in their respective output sequences.

Based on these observations, we can induce that the word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by comparing the input and the output. 

Looking at the first example:
Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red

The word ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Since ""bluf"" precedes ""red"" and ""yellow"" without changing the output color, it suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the previous color"".

To confirm this, we can look at the second example:
Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue

Here, after ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", we again have ""bluf"" followed by its output ""yellow"". Supporting our initial deduction that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color"". ""lug"" translates as a new color, ""blue"".

Let's look at the third example:
Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow

""dax"" translates to ""green"" and is immediately followed by ""bluf"" with the output also being ""green"". Again, this supports the idea that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color"". The words ""wif"", ""lug"", and ""zup"" all lead to different colors, which means they are not affected by the rule we're deducing for ""bluf"".

The fourth example:
Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
Output: green green yellow yellow green

In this sequence, ""dax"" goes to ""green"", and ""bluf"" repeats ""green"". ""zup"" goes to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow"". The final ""dax"" again maps to ""green"". 

The final example:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Here, ""wif"" turns to ""red"", and ""bluf"" indeed repeats the ""red"".

So, based on all provided examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be:

"Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" it's not directly followed by ""bluf"" in the examples, so we can't deduce its color meaning. However, ""zup"" by itself corresponds to ""yellow"" when it does not follow ""bluf,"" but the rule seems to depend on the word before ""bluf.""

- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""bluf"" also means ""red"".

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" output has ""red red red"" which suggests a repetition of the previous color mentioned

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" output has ""blue blue blue"" which again seems to be a repetition of the last color mentioned

3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - The pattern of the colors repeats in accordance with the sequence of the words until ""walm""
   - ""walm"" output has ""red blue red"" which suggests ""walm"" could be repeating the sequence from ""wif,"" so ""walm"" might repeat the two previous distinct colors in sequence before it

4. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   - ""walm"" output has ""red red"" which indicates a repetition of the previous color ""red""
   - Following ""walm,"" ""lug"" and ""bluf"" introduce new colors ""blue blue"" rather than repeating

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Here ""walm"" is following ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and the output is a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.

Based on the consistent theme of repetition in the output when ""walm"" appears, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" involves repeating the color word that precedes it a certain number of times.

Reviewing all instances, ""walm"" consistently results in the output being the immediate previous color word repeated three times. Therefore, we deduce the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the previously mentioned color to be repeated three times in the output.

3. When ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" is inputted, ""red red green green red red red blue red"" is outputted.
4. When ""wif walm lug bluf"" is inputted, ""red red red blue blue"" is outputted.
5. When ""zup walm"" is inputted, ""yellow yellow yellow"" is outputted.

Looking at these examples, we notice that the repetition of the output color seems to be triggered by the presence of the word ""walm"".

It is not clear why sometimes there are three repetitions and other times there are four. There might be an additional rule or context that is not evident from the current examples. However, with the information given, we can propose a tentative rule:

Rule: ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it three or four times. 

So, we can say:

walm -> Repetition of the preceding word's corresponding color three or four times.",-0.10054823505499998,172,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repeated color that matches the color prior to the appearance of ""walm."" Here is the pattern observed:

- ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red."" ""Walm"" seems to repeat the color that corresponds to ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue."" Again, ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" the word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and leads to ""red red."" As before, it repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, which is ""red.""
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue,"" where ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color for ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- Lastly, ""zup walm"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color for ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

"From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax."" Each instance of ""dax"" is paired with the color green in the output. The other words in the inputs correspond to different colors in the outputs. For example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Let's list the translations:

- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""bluf"" -> red (observed only in the last example)

"Based on the provided examples, we can observe that the output always contains a sequence of colors corresponding to the sequence of words in the input. The word ""dax"" appears in each input and is consistently associated with the color ""green"" in the output.

By analyzing each example, we can deduce the following associations between the input words and the output colors:

- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""bluf"" -> red (it repeats the color associated with ""wif"", suggesting that ""bluf"" might mean the same color or have a rule-based association that in this context results in the color red)

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look at the patterns in the given examples:

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green."" Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and appears on both sides of ""wif,"" while ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" seems to indicate a transition or an inversion.
  
- In the second example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""wif"" seems to translate to ""red"" in this context.

- In the third example, ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red."" Here, ""wif"" appears between ""walm"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which translates to ""red red red,"" possibly suggesting that ""wif"" causes a repetition or intensification of the color represented by ""walm.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" translates to ""green green red yellow red."" Here, we observe that both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" mean ""green,"" while ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" translating to ""yellow."" The presence of ""wif"" is associated with a change in color.

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" Here, ""wif"" appears at the end of the sequence and results in ""red"" which is not a repetition of the prior colors.

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" signals a change in color and could possibly indicate the color ""red."" However, the rules seem not consistent in all the examples. Specifically, in the third example, ""wif"" seems to cause the duplication or emphasis of a color (""green"" turns into three ""reds""). Also, ""wif"" is always associated with the color ""red"" after it except in the first example.

Therefore, the most consistent rule that can be induced is that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" but context affects its function slightly.

1. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green."" Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" it's notable that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" when followed by ""lug,"" but there is not enough information here to conclude a rule.

2. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" follows with ""red.""

3. ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red."" The pattern shows that each color word is tripled. Hence, ""dax"" is ""green green green"" and ""walm"" is ""red red red."" The ""wif"" in-between appears to maintain the color sequencing without introducing a color.

4. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" translates to ""green green red yellow red."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" is ""green,"" and the first ""wif"" following ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" The second ""wif"" following ""zup"" also translates to ""red"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

5. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" Here, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""red.""

- The complement of ""bluf"" is ""green.""

- In example 5, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" which is then followed by ""blue blue blue"" for ""walm.""

"The examples provided suggest that the output colors are directly related to the input words. To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the correlation between the inputs and the outputs.

Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow."" Since ""dax"" is repeated twice in the examples with ""green"" as the output each time, and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in multiple instances, we can infer that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow."" This leaves ""walm"" corresponding to the remaining ""green"" in the output.

- In the second example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red."" Since ""wif"" appears in other examples where it corresponds to ""red,"" it is logical to assume that ""wif"" means ""red."" Then, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" in this context.

- In the third example, ""dax walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red."" This reinforces the previous assumptions about ""dax"" meaning ""green"" and ""wif"" meaning ""red."" It also suggests that the word ""walm"" can represent either color, depending on context.

- In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red yellow."" This reinforces ""dax"" as ""green,"" ""wif"" as ""red,"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Here ""lug"" has been introduced, which corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""zup"" and ""dax"" have consistent meanings across examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" in this context.

From these examples, the pattern that emerges is that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. ""Walm"" does not have an intrinsic color; instead, it mimics the color of the preceding word.

1. When preceded by 'dax', 'walm' outputs ""green green green"".
2. When preceded by 'wif', 'walm' outputs ""red red red"".
3. There is no direct example for 'zup' followed by 'walm', but we can assume from the last example that 'lug walm zup' results in ""blue blue blue yellow"".

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows neither ""dax"" nor ""wif,"" as in the last example, the output for ""walm"" is blue.

From this, we can deduce that ""walm"" affects the color output based on the word that comes before it:

- After ""dax,"" ""walm"" makes the output green.
- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" makes the output red.
- Without a prior specific word affecting ""walm,"" or following words like ""zup"" or ""lug,"" the output is blue.

However, the output that corresponds to ""walm"" not only includes its own color but also repeats the colors of the prior words:

- Following ""dax,"" the output includes the corresponding green output of ""dax"" plus green for ""walm.""
- Following ""wif,"" the output includes the corresponding red output of ""wif"" plus red for ""walm.""

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" reflects and extends the color pattern of the preceding word with the addition of its own color determined by the context.

"Looking at the examples given, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif."" In each instance, ""wif"" appears to correspond with a particular color in the output:

1. ""dax bluf wif lug"" results in ""green green red blue"" -- after ""dax"" (green) and ""bluf"" (green), ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
2. ""dax wif"" results in ""green red"" -- after ""dax"" (green), ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
3. ""zup walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"" -- after ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" (yellow), ""lug"" (yellow), and ""blue,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
4. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" results in ""green blue blue blue green red red green"" -- ""wif"" comes after a sequence and translates to ""red.""
5. ""lug dax wif lug"" results in ""blue green red blue"" -- ""wif"" comes after ""dax"" (green) and translates to ""red.""

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context it is placed in. Thus, we can conclude the meaning of ""wif"" is ""red"" or that ""wif"" simply translates to the color red in this context.

Here are the patterns we can see:

- 'zup bluf' produces 'yellow yellow'.
- 'zup bluf wif' adds 'red' to the end of 'yellow yellow,' which might suggest that 'wif' corresponds to 'red.'
- 'dax wif bluf' produces 'green red red,' and based on the previous deduction, the 'wif' likely corresponds to the first 'red.' Given that 'bluf' follows 'wif' here and still results in 'yellow yellow' (the second 'red' and last 'yellow'), it seems 'bluf' keeps its meaning despite the previous word. Thus, 'dax' probably corresponds to 'green.'
- 'dax zup bluf' leads to 'green yellow yellow,' which further supports that 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' 'zup' to 'yellow,' and 'bluf' to 'yellow yellow' regardless of what precedes it.

Therefore, the rule for 'bluf' can be stated as:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and ""bluf"", ""green red"" corresponds to ""dax wif"", and an additional ""red"" is added for ""bluf"".
- When ""dax zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", ""green yellow"" corresponds to ""dax zup"", and an additional ""yellow"" is added for ""bluf"".

From this, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates into ""red"" when it follows ""dax"" and ""wif"" or ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"". Here is the pattern that can be posited as a rule:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each example and the associated output. We can see a pattern where the output changes whenever ""walm"" is present in the input.

1. Input: wif walm zup

   - ""wif"" corresponds to a triple ""red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm

   - ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to double ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to triple ""red"" as confirmed.
   - ""walm"" appears twice after ""lug"" and ""wif.""

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""walm"" seems to change the output of ""zup"" to a triple ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but it's now next to ""walm.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: wif walm

   - ""wif"" corresponds to triple ""red.""

From these examples, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word a certain number of times. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times, following ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times, and following ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated twice. It is unclear what the exact rule is for the repetition count, as it repeats the color for both one and two words before it. However, based on the limited data, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it a specific but indeterminate number of times.",-0.09243192287074076,174,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the color output in relation to the presence of ""walm"" in the input and other words that appear with it.

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   Analysis: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" appears twice and has a double red output in association with ""wif.""

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" appears twice. When ""walm"" is associated with ""lug,"" it produces blue blue, and when it is with ""wif,"" it produces red red red. This suggests ""walm"" repeats the color related to the word preceding it.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" follows, turning the output to triple yellow.

4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" results in triple green after ""dax.""

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Analysis: ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.

From the analysis, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.09405163695802467,174,walm
"From the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color output of the word immediately preceding it, for as many times as that word's output color:

- In ""wif walm zup,"" ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times (hence ""red red red""), followed by ""zup"" outputting ""yellow.""
- In ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" twice. Then ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and the next ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" outputs yellow, and ""walm"" repeats it three times (yellow yellow yellow).
- In ""lug zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" outputs green, and ""walm"" repeats it three times (green green green).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word immediately before it, the same number of times as there are letters in that color's name (e.g., ""red"" has three letters, so ""walm"" outputs ""red"" three times).",-0.3955175849437036,174,walm
"Based on the given examples, it's evident that the output is a sequence of color names, which correspond to the input words. The word 'walm' seems to be associated with a series of three repeating colors based on the context of its preceding word. We can deduce what 'walm' might mean by examining the color pattern that follows its occurrence in each example.

- Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Input: lug zup dax walm -> Output: blue yellow green green green

Notice in the first two examples that the output colors for 'walm' match the color corresponding to the word right before it ('wif' corresponds to 'red,' so we get 'red red red'; 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' so we get 'yellow yellow yellow').

However, in the third example, we have 'lug zup dax walm,' where 'walm' follows 'dax' (blue green green green) and not 'lug' (blue). This inconsistency suggests that 'walm' doesn't strictly repeat the color of the word directly preceding it but might repeat the color of the first instance of a sequence expansion.

In the fourth example, 'lug zup dax walm,' 'walm' results in three 'green' colors even though 'dax' only appears once before. This suggests that 'walm' generates three repetitions of the color that corresponds to the last word before 'walm,' potentially indicating a trend where 'walm' produces three of whatever is the specified output color pattern for the word just before it.

Thus, the rule for 'walm' appears to be:

Rule: 'walm' generates three consecutive instances of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the input string. If 'walm' is not the first word, whatever color the preceding word outputs, 'walm' produces three of that color. If 'walm' is the first word, the output is three 'reds' by default.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to have an output that depends on the word that comes immediately before it. Specifically, ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. This can be inferred as follows:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (i.e., ""red"").
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (i.e., ""yellow"").

Reviewing the input-output pairs:

3. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
4. Input: wif dax lug -> Output: red green blue
5. Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green

By comparing these, we can deduce the following:

- In the second input-output pair, ""dax"" is again associated with ""green.""
- In the third pair, ""dax"" is the first word and is associated with ""green.""
- In the fourth pair, ""dax"" is again associated with ""green.""
- In the fifth example, which is identical to the second, ""dax"" is consistently associated with ""green.""

Here's a breakdown of each given example:

Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue

Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green."" Then, ""zup walm"" means there's one ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and two more for the single instance of ""walm"" that follows it.

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""bluf"" to ""green"" again, ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Here we have two instances of ""zup"": the first ""zup"" is followed by other color words, so it maps to a single ""yellow."" The second ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which doesn't have an established meaning, but can be inferred as ""green"" from previous patterns, and it occurs once before ""lug,"" so it results in two ""yellow"" in the output.

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to represent a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. It can be deduced from the examples that:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"",
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"",
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and 
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Wherever ""walm"" follows any of these words, the corresponding color word is repeated multiple times in the output. 

Let's break down the given examples:

1. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"":
   - ""lug"" -> ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" is likely a typo or a non-matching word, which has been ignored in the output.
   - ""wif"" -> ""red""
   - ""wif walm"" -> ""red red"", since the ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and repeats the ""red"".

2. ""lug walm"":
   - ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"", ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""lug"" (""blue"") to be repeated two additional times, for a total of three repeats.

3. ""lug walm"":
   - Same as the previous example. 

4. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"":
   - ""wif"" -> ""red""
   - ""lug"" -> ""blue""
   - ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"", ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (""yellow"").

5. ""dax walm zup walm"":
   - ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"", ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (""green"").
   - ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"", ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (""yellow"").

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to instruct us to repeat the color word preceding it two additional times, meaning we say the color a total of three times.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in the repeating of the color word that precedes it in a pattern equivalent to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned. Here's the pattern observed:

1. In the first example, ""lug wif walm lug,"" ""lug is blue"" and ""wif is red."" After ""wif,"" the word ""walm"" is mentioned, resulting in the sequence ""blue red red red,"" which is a repetition of ""red"" three times. 

2. In the second and third examples, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which is the word ""blue"" repeated three times, indicating that ""lug"" or ""blue"" is repeated two additional times because of ""walm.""

3. In the fourth example, we see ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" where ""wif is red,"" ""lug is blue,"" and ""zup is yellow."" After ""zup,"" ""walm"" follows, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which means that ""yellow"" is repeated two additional times due to ""walm.""

4. Similarly, in the last example, ""dax walm zup walm,"" ""dax is green"" and is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""green green green."" After the next mention of ""walm,"" the sequence is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" linking ""walm"" to the repetition of the color before it.

Taking all these examples into account:

Rule: walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color word that comes immediately before it an additional two times, resulting in a sequence of that color word three times in total.

"Reviewing the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be associated with the repetition of the color that came before it. Let's look at each example:

- In the first example, ""lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue red red red blue."" Here, ""walm"" followed ""wif,"" which translated to ""red,"" and so ""walm"" also became ""red.""
- In the second and third examples, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" so it repeats ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" so it repeats ""yellow.""
- In the last example, ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" first follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and then later follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" hence repeating those respective colors.

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color term that immediately precedes it in the sequence.",-0.7969889578299999,175,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that is associated with the word that directly precedes it.

- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.

Given these associations, ""walm"" appears to trigger a repetition of the color of the preceding word exactly three times. The first example shows ""lug wif walm lug""; ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in ""red red red"", finally followed by ""lug"" which is blue again.

- wif -> red
- walm -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

Given that ""lug"" implies a change in output without a clear pattern in terms of color specified, we can determine that ""lug"" influences the output, changing the expected color association, for example:

- Example 1: ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" leads to an ""Output"" with a sequence of ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow,"" where we would expect ""red blue yellow"" to repeat, but ""lug"" changes the pattern after its first occurrence, turning the expected ""red"" into ""yellow"" and ""blue.""
- Example 2: ""zup lug"" gives ""yellow blue,"" suggesting that after ""lug,"" a yellow turns into a blue.
- Example 3: ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" leads to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" implying that ""lug"" changed the expected pattern.
- Example 4: ""lug zup dax wif"" leads to ""blue yellow green red,"" and since ""lug"" is at the beginning, it's not altering the pattern but defining it as ""blue.""
- Example 5: ""lug dax"" gives ""blue green,"" reinforcing that ""lug"" on its own is represented by ""blue.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""lug"" on its own is associated with the color ""blue."" However, its presence within a sequence can alter the expected outputs of the following words.

- The word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow.""
- The word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color blue, where the number of repetitions equals the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input.
- The word ""bluf"" seems to function similarly to ""walm,"" resulting in the output ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green.""

Given these observations, we can determine that the word ""lug"" results in the output ""blue"" every time it appears in the input. It's worth noting that ""lug"" does not seem to affect the repetition behavior of ""walm"" and ""bluf,"" which have their own distinct color-repetition rule.

Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax lug wif"" results in ""green blue red,"" indicating 'dax' is 'green,' 'lug' is 'blue,' and 'wif' would then be 'red.'
- ""lug wif dax"" results in ""blue red green,"" maintaining the order of color assignment, which further supports that 'wif' is 'red.'
- ""wif bluf,"" leading to ""red red,"" suggests 'bluf' is also assigned the color 'red,' making 'wif' again associated with 'red.'

4. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red""

From the first two examples, we can see that the output for ""dax walm"" is consistently ""green green green"". The word ""dax"" by itself must be represented by the first ""green"", and therefore, ""walm"" is represented by the next two instances of ""green"".

In the third example, ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red"", and since we know ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" here is again associated with two output colors ""red red"". This suggests that ""walm"" could be a duplicator or a repeater for the color that precedes it.

In the fourth example, considering ""wif"" maps to ""red"", ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", we see the pattern that ""walm"" appears to be repeating the color word that precedes it, doubling the output.

In the fifth and last example, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", ""wif"" maps to ""red"", and ""dax"" maps to ""green"". When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it results in two additional ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the consistent rule that can be derived from these examples is that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, doubling the occurrence in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" leads to a pattern of repeated color output that corresponds to the previous word's output color. Here's how the outputs can be analyzed:

1. ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"". 'Dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'walm' repeats the color 'green' two more times.
2. ""wif walm dax"" gives ""red red red green"". 'Wif' corresponds to 'red', 'walm' repeats the 'red' color two more times and 'dax' corresponds to 'green' again.
3. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"".
   - 'Wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'walm' repeats 'red' two more times
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' again
   - 'walm' repeats 'yellow' three more times (interesting to note here is an increase in the repetition count)
4. ""dax lug wif walm"" produces ""green blue red red red"".
   - 'Dax' corresponds to 'green'
   - 'Lug' corresponds to 'blue'
   - 'Wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'walm' repeats 'red' two more times

The increase in repetition count noted in the third example seems to be due to the fact that 'walm' was used twice after 'zup,' suggesting that the effect of 'walm' can stack based on its position and frequency within the sequence. However, this is a single instance, and confirmation would need further examples. Nonetheless, within these constraints, we can deduce that 'walm' repeats the previous color word's output color a variable number of times based on its use.

   Output: ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   
4. Input: ""dax lug wif walm""

In each instance, the presence of the word ""walm"" triggers a pattern in the output:

- After ""dax walm"" (1), the output is three times ""green.""
- After ""wif walm"" (2), the output is three times ""red.""
- After ""wif walm"" followed by ""zup"" and other words, including a second ""walm"" (3), the output starts with three times ""red,"" followed by a pattern that seems to correspond to the words following the first ""walm"" but repeating ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and another ""walm.""
- Finally, ""dax lug wif walm"" (4) results in ""green"" for ""dax,"" ""blue"" for ""lug,"" then three times ""red"" for the combination of ""wif"" and ""walm.""

The rule for ""walm"" appears to be repeating the color output that directly precedes it three times:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), the output is ""green"" three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output is ""red"" three times.
- ""Walm"" itself doesn't trigger a new color but repeats the color that corresponds to the word just before it.

"Based on the examples given, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the rule of repeating the output color of the previous word in the input. To break it down:

- dax walm: ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" then ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two more times.
- wif walm dax: ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" then ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two more times before moving on to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- wif walm zup lug zup walm: The pattern continues with ""wif"" resulting in ""red,"" followed by ""walm"" repeating ""red"" two more times. ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and then ""zup"" again to ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm"" repeating ""yellow"" three times.

2. ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green.""

- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""bluf"" corresponds to red (noted in the second example)
- ""walm"" has occurred in conjunction with green in the fourth example, but without another example, we cannot rule out coincidence; however, it does repeat for each instance of ""walm,"" suggesting a pattern.

- In the second example, ""lug bluf wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue again, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- In the third example, ""lug wif dax,"" the pattern remains consistent with ""lug"" as blue, ""wif"" as red, and ""dax"" as green.
- The pattern remains consistent in the remaining examples with ""wif"" consistently translating to red.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-1.4868403346690908,177,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we need to identify a pattern in the given examples where the word ""bluf"" is used and how it translates to a color in the output. Let's break down each input-output pair by comparing the output to each instance of ""bluf"" in the input:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and since the output is ""green green"", it appears that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"" in this case.

2. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" appears twice and both times it translates to ""blue"".

3. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue
   - We see ""dax"" as ""green"", ""zup"" as ""yellow"", ""wif"" as ""red"", and ""lug"" as ""blue"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

4. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif -> Output: blue red red blue red
   - We have ""lug"" as ""blue"" and ""wif"" as ""red"". ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" again.

5. Input: wif dax zup bluf -> Output: red green yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

In analyzing the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent one-to-one mapping with a specific color. Instead, the color corresponding to ""bluf"" seems to change depending on some contextual factor within each example. One potential pattern could be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it, but let's verify that:

- In the first example, there is no preceding word, but ""dax"" is in the input, so it's possible ""bluf"" is taking the same color as ""dax"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes the first ""bluf"" and the second ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"". Both are reflected in the output as ""blue"" and ""yellow"", respectively.
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output color for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" also precedes ""bluf"", resulting in ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. This rule is consistent across all given examples.

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repeat of the color named right before it. Here is the rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color word immediately preceding it.

Let's verify this rule with the provided examples:

Example 1:
Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Rule application: ""bluf"" repeats the color named before it, which is ""green.""

Example 2:
Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif

Example 5:

Therefore, the rule is: bluf -> repeats the previously mentioned color.",-0.08740529766594508,177,bluf
"Based on the examples given, we can analyze the occurrences of ""bluf"" and try to identify a pattern correlating to the output. Let's examine each case:

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
2. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red""
3. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> ""green yellow red red blue""
4. ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red""
5. ""wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""red green yellow yellow""

Given this data, it seems like ""bluf"" translates to the color word that follows the last color word that was used before it. Let's verify this with the examples:

1. ""dax bluf"" corresponds with ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"".
2. In ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"". The first ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"". The second ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and thus translates to ""yellow"".
3. In ""dax zup wif bluf lug"", ""wif"" is ""red"" and precedes the first ""bluf"" which also translates to ""red"". ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
4. In ""lug wif bluf lug wif"", ""wif"" is ""red"" and precedes ""bluf"", so ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" here as well.
5. For ""wif dax zup bluf"", the ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and precedes ""bluf"" so ""bluf"" here is ""yellow"".

According to the instances observed, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the color word immediately preceding it.

Thus:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: bluf translates to the color word that is mentioned just before it.",-0.10698681777948355,177,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correlation between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. When ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green.""
2. When ""lug"" is mentioned, the output is ""blue.""
3. When ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red.""
4. When ""zup"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow.""

Now let's look at where ""bluf"" appears:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" it seems that ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"" in this instance.
  
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (""blue"") and then ""zup"" (""yellow""), resulting in the outputs ""blue blue"" and ""yellow yellow,"" respectively. It appears ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word right before it.

- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (""red"") and then ""lug"" (""blue""), and the output is ""red red"" and ""blue blue,"" again suggesting ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" again appears after ""lug"" (""blue"") and again the output is ""blue blue.""

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (""yellow"") and the output is ""yellow yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-0.8425384746752749,177,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

- When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

Given the above patterns, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be: 

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word that precedes it.",-1.1171396920406593,177,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's break down the examples focusing on the occurrences of ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors.

1. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif""
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - After ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times, and after the second ""walm,"" yellow is repeated three times.

2. ""lug walm zup walm""
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   - Similarly to the first example, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the prior color (""blue"" is repeated thrice) and then ""yellow"" is repeated thrice after the second ""walm.""

3. ""dax wif walm""
   Output: green red red red
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - Following ""walm,"" there are three ""red"" which was the color before ""walm.""

4. ""dax walm lug""
   Output: green green green blue
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   - After ""walm"" the color ""green"" appears thrice, which was the color prior to ""walm.""

5. ""lug walm dax""
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green""
   - Before ""dax,"" ""blue"" appears thrice after the ""walm,"" which was the color before ""walm.""

From these observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the previous color to repeat three times before moving on to the color represented by the next word.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to be repeated three times.",-0.07178770033795603,177,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and outputs to identify patterns.

1. When 'walm' follows 'lug':
   - Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   - Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - 'walm' results in three blue followed by yellow repetitions (in the first 'walm' case) and two yellow repetitions in the second case.

2. When 'walm' follows 'lug' again:
   - Input: lug walm zup walm
   - Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Again, 'walm' after 'lug' results in three blue followed by three yellow.

3. When 'walm' follows 'dax':
   - Input: dax wif walm
   - Output: green red red red
   - 'walm' results in three reds following the green and red from 'dax' and 'wif'.

4. 'walm' between 'dax' and 'lug':
   - Input: dax walm lug
   - Output: green green green blue
   - 'walm' results in two additional green followed by a blue from 'lug'.

5. 'walm' between 'lug' and 'dax':
   - Input: lug walm dax
   - Output: blue blue blue green
   - 'walm' results in two additional blues followed by a green from 'dax'.

From these examples, it seems that 'walm' causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding 'walm' to be repeated two more times (for a total of three repetitions). Subsequently, the pattern resumes normally following the sequence of the input colors.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before 'walm' two additional times.

Examples explained with the rule:
1. lug (blue) wif (red) lug (blue) walm (blue blue blue) zup walm (yellow yellow yellow) wif (red)
2. lug (blue) walm (blue blue blue) zup (yellow) walm (yellow yellow yellow)
3. dax (green) wif (red) walm (red red red)
4. dax (green) walm (green green green) lug (blue)
5. lug (blue) walm (blue blue blue) dax (green)",-0.14162378704440665,177,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" We observe the Output corresponding to the Input where ""walm"" appears, and we can notice a pattern in how it affects the sequence of colors.

- Whenever ""walm"" is present in the Input, the Output has a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" 
- The repetition is of three occurrences of that color, based on all given examples.

Let's break down each example to illustrate this:

1. In the first example, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" we see that ""lug"" precedes the first ""walm"" and the Output reflects ""blue"" thrice right after ""lug."" Similarly, ""zup"" precedes the second ""walm,"" and the Output has ""yellow"" thrice afterwards.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm zup walm,"" ""lug"" comes before the first ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"" in the Output. After that, ""zup"" comes before the second ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the Output.

3. ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" before ""walm"" leads to ""red red red.""

4. ""dax walm lug"" gives us ""green green green blue,"" once again showing the repetition pattern of ""green"" thrice after ""dax"" comes before ""walm.""

5. ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green,"" showing ""blue"" repeated thrice following ""lug"" before ""walm.""

Therefore, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the Output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times.

In formal notation:

walm -> meaning. Meaning is the triple repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"".",-0.27523288217254943,177,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. In the first example, whenever ""walm"" follows ""lug"" or ""zup"", the color sequence includes multiple instances of blue followed by yellow. However, when ""wif"" follows ""walm"", red is output. This suggests that ""walm"" could be modifying how many times the previous color is repeated, but in a specific pattern.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm"" and ""zup walm"" again result in the color blue being repeated, followed by yellow.

3. In the third example, ""dax wif walm"" results in green being followed by red repeated three times.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm lug"" results in green being repeated followed by blue.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug walm dax"" results in blue being repeated followed by green. 

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times. The following are the apparent associations:

- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""zup"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red

   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

2. Input: zup dax lug wif dax

5. Input: zup lug dax

"Based on the given examples, the output color for each word appears to be consistent. Each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of three successive ""blue"" words in the output. This consistency allows us to deduce the meaning of ""walm.""

Here's the breakdown:

- Every instance of ""wif"" translates to a single ""red"" in the output.
- Every instance of ""lug"" translates to a sequence of three ""blue"" in the output.
- Every instance of ""dax"" translates to a ""green"" following the pattern of the word before it.
- Every instance of ""zup"" translates to a ""yellow.""

Considering ""lug"" also corresponds to three ""blue"" outputs, we can infer that ""walm"" means the same as ""lug"" or acts similarly in terms of the output it generates. In other words, ""walm"" can be interpreted to mean a sequence of three ""blue,"" just like ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> sequence of three ""blue""",-0.9466209985774192,178,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correlate with the repetition of the color ""blue"" three times in the output. To confirm this, we can analyze how the output changes with and without ""walm"" in the input.

- Every input that contains ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue"" in the output.
- Inputs without ""walm"" do not have the ""blue blue blue"" sequence in the output.
- Other words in the input like ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" correlate with different color outputs: ""red,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue"" respectively. However, ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" results in the sequence ""blue blue blue.""
- The number of times ""walm"" appears in the input is equal to the number of ""blue blue blue"" sequences in the output. For example, the first input contains two instances of ""walm"" and there are two ""blue blue blue"" sequences in the output. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

3. ""dax walm"" is followed by ""green green green""

This suggests that ""walm"" might be a repetition indicator for the color associated with the previous word. Notably, the output always contains the same color repeated three times which corresponds with the word right before ""walm."" With this in mind, we can construct the rule for ""walm"":

- After ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" ""walm"" follows it by repeating the color ""blue"" three times.
- There is no instance where ""walm"" is not preceded by another word, which means we can't deduce its behavior in isolation.

- The word ""dax"" consistently correlates with ""green"" in the second, third, and fifth examples.
- Similarly, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" in the first and fifth examples.
- ""Zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" in both the first and second examples.
- ""Walm"" only appears once, in the fourth example, and correlates with ""red red red."" However, since ""wif"" has consistently corresponded to ""red"" in all examples, it is reasonable to deduce that ""wif"" itself means ""red,"" and that ""walm"" may be broken down into ""red red.""

Here are the observations:

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

"Based on the given examples, each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the first and last examples and to ""blue"" in the second example. However, in the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green."" There seems to be an inconsistency in what color ""bluf"" represents.

To resolve this inconsistency, let's look for patterns:

- In examples where ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" directly, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In examples where ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" directly, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In example three, the pattern breaks as there is an additional ""lug"" between ""bluf"" and ""dax,"" yet ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green."" In the fourth example, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green.""
  
From these observations, It could potentially be that ""bluf"" might change its meaning depending on the word that immediately precedes it. But since there is not enough consistent evidence to establish a clear rule, and the change from blue to green in presence of ""dax"" seems to indicate that it is the presence of ""dax"" and not the presence of ""lug"" that creates the change in the meaning of ""bluf"" 

Based on the available data, the tentative rule could be apart from the above specifier, ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug,"" and ""green"" when followed by ""dax."" However, there is not enough information to ascertain this for sure.

Rule: bluf -> blue,-2.095123238387654,179,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's break down the examples according to the colored outputs they produce:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, ""walm"" appears to consistently involve repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions of the color seems to be one more than the number of times the word preceding ""walm"" appears in the input.

- In example 1, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and ""walm"" results in three repetitions of green.
- In example 2, ""lug"" is associated with blue, so ""walm"" results in three repetitions of blue.
- In example 3, the pattern appears slightly more complicated. ""zup"" is associated with yellow, but ""wif"" must be associated with red. Since ""wif"" is directly before ""walm,"" ""walm"" results in three repetitions of red (following the association with ""wif"") plus one additional instance of yellow from the occurrence of ""zup.""
- In example 4, ""dax lug"" are associated with green and blue respectively. ""Walm"" after a sequence of different colors results in a repetition of each color, with the quantity of each repetition being dependent on the sequence appearing before ""walm"" (one more than their respective occurrences).
- In example 5, ""wif"" is before the first ""walm"" so it outputs three reps of red, and ""zup"" is before the second ""walm"" so it outputs three reps of yellow. The repetition of ""walm"" itself does not seem to influence the color or the count; it simply applies the rule of the word preceding each ""walm.""

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be outputted, with the number of repetitions being one more than the number of instances that the preceding word appears in the input sequence leading up to ""walm.""",-0.10609438515386668,179,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Each word before ""walm"" translates to a color, and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times. When there are multiple words before ""walm,"" the sequence includes the corresponding color of each word repeated once, followed by the last color repeated multiple times.

For instance:
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.

With this in mind, we can observe the following patterns:
- If ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".
- If ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- If ""zup wif"" is followed by ""walm"", the output finishes with ""red red red"".
- When ""dax lug"" is followed by ""walm"", ""green blue"" are the colors for ""dax lug"", and ""blue"" is repeated thrice, making ""blue blue blue"".
- Finally, with ""wif walm zup walm"", ""red red red"" corresponds to ""wif walm"", and then ""yellow yellow yellow"" corresponds to ""zup walm"".

Thus, the rule appears to be:
Rule: walm -> causes the word directly preceding it to output its associated color three times. If there are multiple words before ""walm"", each associated color is outputted once in the order of the words followed by the last color three times. If walm is repeated, the pattern is also repeated for each occurrence of walm.",-0.2587568824766666,179,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" is a rule that repeats the color associated with the word preceding it thrice. Each nonce word seems to correspond to a color:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

When ""walm"" follows these words, the color is repeated three times. If two nonce words that correspond to colors precede ""walm,"" their respective colors are each repeated twice, appearing in the order that their corresponding nonce words were mentioned. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""zup walm,"" the sequence is the color for ""wif"" (red) repeated three times, followed by the color for ""zup"" (yellow) repeated three times, in the order ""wif"" and then ""zup"" were mentioned.

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word(s) three times, or twice for each if there are two preceding words.",-0.6435091706804001,179,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" appears to indicate repetition of the color associated with the preceding word or phrase. Each occurrence of ""walm"" results in the preceding color word being repeated three times. When multiple colors precede ""walm"", the amount of repetition for each color increases by one for each additional color word in the sequence.

Examples:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (dax means green, therefore walm causes it to be said three times)
2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (lug means blue, walm causes it to be said three times)
3. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"" (zup means yellow, wif means red, and since walm follows two color words, it starts with the first and makes the second repeat three times)
4. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue"" (dax means green, lug means blue, and walm causes the first to be said once and the second to be repeated three times)
5. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow"" (wif means red, zup means yellow, and when walm is used after each, it repeats the color word three times; red for the first walm, and yellow for the second)

From these examples, we can identify a pattern which suggests the underlying rule for ""walm"". Specifically, we can consider that ""walm"" acts as a replicator of the preceding color(s), influenced by their order and quantity.

"To determine what ""bluf"" means, we need to look for patterns in the examples given. We can start by looking at the color corresponding to ""bluf"" in each of the given outputs.

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow
In this case, bluf corresponds to the color yellow.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.

Given the inconsistencies, one instance where ""bluf"" means green, another where it means yellow, and another where it means blue, we must consider the possibility that ""bluf"" is a chameleon word that takes on a color based on some characteristic of the words around it:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it has been green.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it has been yellow.
- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""lug,"" it has been blue.

Now we need a rule that ties these observations together. Since ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""bluf"" also corresponds to green when following ""dax"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow when following ""zup"", and ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""bluf"" corresponds to blue when following ""lug"", we might hypothesize that the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence.

However, there’s an inconsistency in the first and second examples where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" but corresponds to different colors (green in the first, yellow in the second), so our hypothesis does not hold for all the given examples.

Because we don't have consistent evidence to support one clear rule based on the given examples, it may be best to state that the rule concerning what ""bluf"" means cannot be determined with the current information.

Rule: The pattern for ""bluf"" is inconsistent based on the examples given; therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" cannot be conclusively determined without additional information or examples.",-0.06591138707079545,180,bluf

- Input: wif dax bluf (Output: red green green)
- Input: wif dax zup bluf (Output: red green yellow yellow)
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm (Output: green red yellow yellow red red red)

"Based on the given examples and the respective outputs, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is repeated in the output. To be more specific:

- In the first input, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""bluf"" leads to another blue in the output.
- In the second input, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""bluf"" also leads to green.
- In the third input, ""bluf"" repeats the yellow, which is associated with the word ""zup"" that comes just before it.
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" again leads to a repeated color, yellow, which corresponds to ""zup"" which precedes it.
- In the fifth input, ""lug"" and ""bluf"" both result in blue.

It appears that ""bluf"" represents the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes directly before it. If ""bluf"" is the first word and there's no word before it to define its color, we do not have an example to deduce its color from. However, given the consistent pattern of repetition in the provided inputs and outputs, we can infer the following:

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's consider its output color in each example when it appears:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""

3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""

4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""red""

The above analysis presents an inconsistency in the meaning of ""walm,"" as it corresponds to different colors in different contexts. However, we can observe a pattern where ""walm"" corresponds to the color of the word preceding it. Let's confirm this rule by examining the inputs and outputs:

1. ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color is blue.
2. ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color is blue.
3. ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color is blue.
4. ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color is green.
5. ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the color is red.

Based on this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",-0.09835438510324039,180,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at its position and the output colors in each example. Here is the breakdown of input to output:

1. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
2. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
3. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
4. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

From these examples, the outputs following the nonce word ""walm"" are:

1. ""lug zup wif dax"" -> yellow blue yellow red green
2. ""zup"" -> blue yellow
3. ""dax wif lug wif"" -> blue green red blue red
4. ""None.""
5. ""None.""

After examining the patterns, we determine that whenever ""walm"" appears, the following color sequence always includes at least one ""blue."" However, solely based on the provided examples, it is not clear what the exact rule for ""walm"" is. It appears to affect the subsequent sequence or word in some manner, potentially changing the ""next word's"" color to blue if it is immediately followed by another word (though this does not apply when ""walm"" is the last word.)

Given the uncertainty due to incomplete information, we can suggest a tentative rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes another word, it changes the next word's associated color to blue. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, the rule does not seem to apply, or there is not enough information to deduce the effect.

Therefore: walm -> changes the next word's associated color to blue (with the aforementioned caveat).",-0.1350342513039423,180,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in each example:

- In the first example, after the word ‘walm,’ the colors yellow, red, and green follow.
- In the second example, blue and yellow are the colors following 'walm'.
- In the third example, blue follows 'walm'.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, 'walm' is followed by the color green twice and red twice, respectively.

There's no single color consistently following the term 'walm' across all the examples, which makes it challenging to directly associate 'walm' with a specific color or rule related to color output. We need to look at the structure and position of the word 'walm' for a common rule across the examples.

- In the first example, 'walm' is followed by ‘zup wif dax’. The output is yellow (same as 'zup') yellow (different color) red (same as 'wif') green (unique color).
- In the second example, ‘walm’ is followed by ‘zup’ which translates to yellow, a color already present before 'walm'.
- In the third example, ‘walm’ is followed by ‘dax’ which translates to green, a color that has already been mentioned before 'walm'.
- In the fourth, 'walm' is followed by two greens (same as 'dax').
- In the fifth, 'walm' is followed by two reds (related to 'wif').

Analyzing further the colors preceding and following walm:

- First input: before 'walm' there's blue, after 'walm' there's yellow (linked to 'zup'), red (linked to 'wif'), and green (linked to 'dax').
- Second input: before 'walm' there's blue, after 'walm' yellow (linked to 'zup').
- Third input: before 'walm' there's blue, after 'walm' blue (linked to 'lug') and green (linked to 'dax').
- Fourth input: before 'walm' there's green (linked to 'dax'), after 'walm' green (linked to 'dax').
- Fifth input: before 'walm' there's red (linked to 'wif'), after 'walm' red (linked to 'wif').

From these observations, it seems that 'walm' could be acting as a sort of repeat function, particularly where the word before 'walm' has its corresponding color repeated after 'walm'. However, this rule is not absolute, since in the second input, 'walm' is preceded by 'lug' (blue), yet the color after 'walm' is yellow (zup), but it could mean that the pattern depends on context, which isn't fully revealed by the examples.

Based on the available data, a tentative rule might be:

Rule: 'walm' causes the next color to be repeated; however, if the next word corresponds to the color that preceded 'walm', it might not trigger a repeated color or its function might be context-dependent.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" correlates with the color that follows the appearance of ""lug"" and precedes the appearance of ""wif"" or ""zup,"" but turns red when not preceded by ""lug"" or ""dax."" Let's examine the evidence:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" which translates to ""blue yellow,"" so the output for ""walm"" is ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and does not precede ""wif"" or ""zup,"" yet the output remains ""blue"" - this is consistent with the first example.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and does not precede ""wif"" or ""zup,"" and again, the output for ""walm"" is ""blue.""
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" so it does not fit the initial rule, yet it receives the output ""green"".
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" does not follow either ""lug"" or ""dax,"" and it translates to ""red.""

From the evidence above, a consistent rule for ""walm"" cannot be established as ""lug"" is not the only context where ""walm"" translates as ""blue,"" and ""walm"" translates as ""green"" following ""dax"" in the fourth example. However, ""walm"" does turn ""red"" when it is not following ""lug"" or ""dax,"" as seen in the fifth example.

Given the above examination, the best deduction for ""walm"" that can be made from these examples is the following generalized rule:

Rule: walm -> ""blue"" when following ""lug"", ""green"" when following ""dax"", and ""red"" otherwise.",-1.26138395123875,180,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" changes the color output that follows it. In each scenario where ""walm"" is used, the output color right after ""walm"" is consistent and is ""blue."" However, this change to ""blue"" seems to only influence the immediately following item as subsequent items revert to their original associated colors. Here are the observations:

1. In the first example, ""lug"" after ""walm"" produces ""blue"" instead of its otherwise associated color ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""lug"" after ""walm"" again produces ""blue.""

3. In the third example, ""dax"" after ""walm"" also produces ""blue"" instead of ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, two ""walm"" in succession result in ""green green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" after ""walm"" turns to ""red"", but since “wif” is originally associated with ""red,"" we cannot be certain if ""walm"" influenced this.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" changes the color output of the item that immediately follows it to ""blue,"" no matter what color that item would usually represent. However, this doesn’t explain the observation in the fourth example, where repeating ""walm"" produces ""green."" The other occurrences do not provide enough information to explain this anomaly.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and output strings in the provided examples.

In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green."" Since ""bluf"" and ""wif"" both correspond to ""red,"" it's likely that ""wif"" somehow means ""red."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" 

In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue."" Here ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates as ""blue,"" supporting the previous assumption for ""wif.""

The third example, ""dax walm wif walm,"" results in ""green green green red red red."" Given that we've established ""dax"" means ""green,"" it's noteworthy that ""wif"" plus ""walm"" repeated results in triple ""red"" after ""wif."" This could indicate that the introduction of ""wif"" changes the subsequent word to ""red.""

In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug,"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue."" This further supports the notion that ""wif"" changes the subsequent color output to ""red."" Before ""wif,"" ""lug"" means ""blue,"" but the ""lug"" following ""wif"" results in ""blue"" again, contradicting the previous assumption that ""wif"" changes the subsequent color.

In the last example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf,"" corresponds to ""yellow red green red red."" Here, we notice that ""wif"" maintains its translation to ""red."" However, the appearance of ""wif"" does not change ""dax"" to ""red"" but allows it to remain ""green."" Thus, the idea that ""wif"" changes the next word's color cannot be completely correct.

Analyzing these examples, the one consistent observation is that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" There is no evidence to suggest that ""wif"" modifies the output color of adjacent words, as each word in the examples seems to have its own color association, which is not visibly altered by ""wif.""

Based on this analysis, the rule is: wif -> red.",-0.07569104777151106,181,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we should look at how it affects the outputs, keeping in mind the different contexts where it is used. Here's a breakdown of its appearances and the corresponding outputs:

1. wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
2. zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
3. dax walm wif walm -> Output: green green green red red red
4. lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue
5. zup wif dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow red green red red

Analyzing the different uses of ""wif"" and their outcomes:

- Every time ""wif"" appears, the word immediately following it in the input results in ""red"" in the output.
- In sentence 3, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and it results in the output being ""red"" repeated three times, which corresponds to the three times ""walm"" appears in the input.
- In sentence 4, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""red"" and ""blue,"" corresponding to the two occurrences of ""lug"" in the input.

Thus, the rule appears to be that the word ""wif"" causes the color ""red"" to be assigned to the following word in the sequence, with the number of times ""red"" is repeated in the output corresponding to the number of times that following word appears in the input.

Rule: wif -> The word following ""wif"" is represented by ""red"" in the output for the number of times it appears in the input.",-0.09812602533935555,181,wif

Example Analysis:

- Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
  (Here ""wif"" corresponds to the second ""red"".)

- Input: dax walm wif walm -> Output: green green green red red red
  (Here ""wif"" corresponds to the fourth ""red"". This suggests that ""wif"" not only translates to ""red"" but also repeats the color that comes before it three times.)

- Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue
  (Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", repeating the previous color three times before itself.)

- Input: zup wif dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow red green red red
  (Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and appears twice. Before the first ""wif"", there's no color to repeat, so ""red"" appears just once. Before the second ""wif"", ""green"" is repeated once followed by ""wif"" as ""red"".)

From the analysis, it seems clear that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red"". Additionally, whatever color word precedes ""wif"", that color repeats three times before the occurrence of ""wif"". However, if ""wif"" is the first word, then it simply translates to ""red"" without repetition.

So the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: When ""wif"" is preceded by another color word, that color is repeated three times before outputting ""red"" for the ""wif"". If ""wif"" is the first word, it is only translated to ""red"".

- ""Walm"" follows ""dax"", which is green, and the output has triple green followed by the color for ""lug"", which is blue.

2. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

In this case, ""bluf"" is not explicitly translated, but we can assume that ""bluf"" leads to a repeat of the color associated with ""zup"", which is ""yellow"". Then, ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and ""walm"" again results in ""red"" being repeated.

3. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with ""zup"", which is ""yellow"". Finally, another ""lug"" leads to ""blue"".

4. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

In this sequence, ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats ""red"". Then ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". The pattern then repeats with ""wif walm"" resulting in more red followed by ""zup"" which is yellow.

5. dax walm lug -> green green green blue

""Dax"" is not previously explained but in this context translates to ""green"". ""Walm"" then repeats the color associated with ""dax"", resulting in more ""green"", before ""lug"" leads to ""blue"".

- In the first example, ""walm"" is repeated twice after ""lug"" and ""wif,"" and we see the colors corresponding to ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red) repeat three times in the output.
- In the second example, ""walm"" occurs once after ""wif,"" and we have ""red"" repeating three times in the output.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in two additional ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" repeating the color for ""wif"" (red) three times. It also follows ""lug,"" repeating the color for ""lug"" (blue), and then ""zup,"" repeating the color for ""zup"" (yellow).
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and we see the color for ""dax"" (green) repeated three times.

From these examples, we can infer the rule for ""walm"": when ""walm"" appears after a word, it causes the color associated with that word to be repeated three times in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" I will first summarize the input-output pairs you've provided:

1. zup wif -> yellow red
2. wif dax -> red green
3. zup wif -> yellow red
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. lug zup wif -> blue yellow red

Now, let's look for patterns.

- Every time ""wif"" is used, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- The word ""wif"" comes after ""zup"" twice, and the output both times is ""yellow red,"" suggesting that ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" comes before another word, the first color in the output is ""red,"" and the second color changes based on the second word.
- In the last example, ""lug zup wif"" leads to ""blue yellow red,"" which indicates that ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue"" and supports the idea that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",-0.12769232138232783,182,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red"".
2. ""wif dax"" outputs ""red green"".
3. ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"".
4. ""lug zup wif"" outputs ""blue yellow red"".

From this, we can see that every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, the words preceding or following ""wif"" seem to determine the other colors in the output:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""wif"", ""yellow"" appears before ""red"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", the output is ""red green"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output has another ""red"", resulting in ""red red"".
- When ""lug"" precedes ""zup wif"", the output is ""blue yellow red"".

Therefore, ""wif"" seems consistently associated with the color ""red"". The meaning of ""wif"" is dependent on its position and context, with the other words in the sequence determining the other colors in the output in a specific order.

- walm -> blue (since it produces ""blue"" in the fourth input where 'lug' also produces ""blue"")

Given that 'bluf' consistently results in 'red' in the outputs, and we see that 'wif' also always translates to 'red', one might surmise that 'bluf' has the same meaning as 'wif'. However, since 'walm' also translates to 'blue' just as 'lug' does, we can surmise that the colors are not exclusively tied to a single word.

The rule for 'bluf' then might not be based on it being identical in meaning to 'wif' but could pertain to its position in the sequence or its relationship with other words. Yet, given the data provided, we don't have instances of 'bluf' altering its output based on position or surrounding context.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs where it appears:

1. When ""lug walm"" is the input, the output is ""blue blue blue"". This suggests that ""walm"" might lead to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"".

2. For ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" showing consistency with the first example where ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" This supports the idea that ""walm"" might cause the repetition of the preceding color word.

3. In ""dax lug wif walm,"" the output is ""green blue red red red."" The single ""walm"" at the end results in a repetition of ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

4. For ""lug dax walm,"" the output is ""blue green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and it causes a repetition of ""green.""

5. In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Again, right after ""zup,"" ""walm"" produces a repetition of ""yellow.""

These observations suggest that ""walm"" causes the color word that comes before it to repeat three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.",-0.0793431273704396,182,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us analyze each input alongside its corresponding output systematically:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
2. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

3. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

4. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

By comparing each input with its output, we can infer the following:

- Every time the non-word ""walm"" appears, it is followed by repetitions of the same color in the output:
  - Example 1: ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
  - Example 2: ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and is followed by twice blue ""blue blue blue"" and once again after ""zup"" succeeded by three yellows ""yellow yellow yellow"".
  - Example 3: ""walm"" at the end results in three repetitions of red ""red red red"".
  - Example 4: ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to three repetitions of green ""green green green"".
  - Example 5: ""zup walm"" results in three repetitions of yellow ""yellow yellow yellow""

- The color that is repeated corresponds to the color that is output by the word just before ""walm"":
  - In Example 1, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" results in three blues.
  - In Example 3, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and we get three reds since ""wif"" outputs red.
  - In Example 4, ""dax"" gives green, and following it with ""walm"" results in three greens.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color output of the preceding word three times in the output sequence.

- After the input word ""lug,"" the output is consistently ""blue.""
- After ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- After ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- After ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

Additionally, when the nonce word ""walm"" is present in the input, it seems to produce a pattern where the output repeats the color that follows immediately before ""walm."" 

For instance:
- In the first example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" implying that ""walm"" means to repeat the color that corresponds to ""lug"" (which is blue) three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow,"" and then ""lug zup wif"" leads to ""blue yellow red."" 
- In the third example, ""dax lug wif walm"" leads to ""green blue red red red,"" so after ""wif,"" which outputs red, ""walm"" causes the color red to repeat three times.
- And this pattern is consistent through the remaining examples.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.",-0.6974448679051647,182,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs given in the examples.

- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. The number of repetitions is always three. Here is the breakdown:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" maps to ""red""

2. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green
   - The same mappings apply here, confirming our initial assumptions from the first example.

3. Input: dax walm

- Similarly, after 'wif' comes 'walm', followed by red red red.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
- Here, 'walm' follows 'dax' and is preceded by 'wif', resulting in green green green in the output.

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- In this example, 'walm' directly follows 'zup', leading to yellow yellow yellow in the output, but it is not directly followed by 'wif'.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- 'Walm' directly follows 'wif' and is followed by 'dax', leading to red red red green in the output.

From these examples, it appears that 'walm' following 'wif' leads to red red red (the color 'red' repeated three times), regardless of the words that come after.

Rule: walm -> When 'walm' immediately follows 'wif', it outputs the color 'red' repeated three times.",-0.07406320344982954,183,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us look at each example to understand the pattern:

1. Input: wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow
2. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
3. Input: lug wif dax walm zup | Output: blue red green green green yellow
4. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug | Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
5. Input: wif walm dax | Output: red red red green

From the given examples, we can see that:

- ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red.""
- ""zup"" leads to the output ""yellow"" in examples 1 and 3.
- ""lug"" leads to the output ""blue"" in examples 3 and 4.
- ""dax"" leads to the output ""green"" in examples 3 and 5.

Now, looking for the pattern for ""walm"":

In example 1, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and before ""zup,"" leading to the ""red red red yellow"" output sequence. Since we know that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" we can isolate that ""walm"" corresponds to an additional ""red"" before the ""yellow"" produced by ""zup.""

In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" without any other words, and the output is ""red red red,"" showing that ""walm"" alone seems to produce a sequence of ""red"" indicators, just like ""wif.""

In example 3, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""zup."" The sequence is ""green green green yellow."" Since ""dax"" gives ""green,"" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" and ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" ""walm"" here might be assumed to have produced the green that comes between the ""dax"" produced greens and the ""zup"" produced yellow.

In example 4, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""wif,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red blue."" We already know that ""lug"" produces ""blue"" and ""wif"" produces ""red."" Therefore, ""walm"" could be responsible for producing the additional ""yellow,"" like an echo of ""zup.""

In example 5, ""walm ""appears after ""wif"" before ""dax,"" and the output is ""red red red green."" Given that ""wif"" produces red and ""dax"" produces green, ""walm"" could be producing an additional ""red.""

From these examples, ""walm"" seems to produce an output that matches the color of the preceding word and is consistent in its form, even when followed by a new word. Thus:

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" repeats the color of the output associated with the word immediately preceding it.",-0.10857965723602271,183,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns in the given examples where it appears. We will correlate the input with the corresponding output to try to determine a rule.

Looking at examples 1, 2, and 5:

- Input: wif walm zup / Output: red red red yellow
- Input: wif walm / Output: red red red
- Input: wif walm dax / Output: red red red green

In all the above examples, whenever ""walm"" is present, the word following it produces a color that is not ""red."" This suggests that ""walm"" could be modifying the color of the word that follows it. In the absence of ""walm,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and when ""walm"" is present right after ""wif,"" we still see ""red"" outputted, which suggests that ""walm"" on its own does not change ""wif.""

Now, let's consider examples 3 and 4:

- Input: lug wif dax walm zup / Output: blue red green green green yellow
- Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug / Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

In example 3, the inclusion of ""walm"" before ""zup"" changes the expected result to yellow, whereas without ""walm"", ""zup"" yields blue (as seen in example 4). This is in line with the effect seen in example 1—where ""walm"" modified ""zup"" from blue to yellow.

In example 4, ""walm"" appears between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and the ""walm"" makes the following ""wif"" result in yellow instead of the usual red.

Based on these observations, we could infer a tentative rule for the nonce word ""walm."" It appears that ""walm"" modifies the color of the following word to a color different from its default mapping but not to a color it already took in the input sequence (e.g., ""wif"" leads to red, but ""walm wif"" leads to yellow when yellow has not been used earlier). However, this rule is not conclusive, as the dataset is very limited and does not show any sequence where ""walm"" precedes words that are not ""wif"" or ""zup"" to confirm this.

Rule: ""walm"" changes the color output of the following word to a new color that hasn't been used earlier in the sequence.",-0.23207232118732948,183,walm
"Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

The nonce word ""walm"" appears in all but one example and each time it is present, an extra ""red"" is in the output compared to the number of ""wif"" words. 

- In the first example, ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow."" Without ""walm,"" the expected result would be ""red yellow"" based on the other known words.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" Without ""walm,"" the expected result would be just ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue.” The ""walm"" here adds an extra ""yellow"" even though ""walm"" by itself corresponds to ""red"" in other contexts.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to be a modifier that causes the color associated with ""wif"" (red) to repeat one additional time. 

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with ""wif"" (red) to appear one extra time",-0.5545655822745453,183,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can see a pattern that connects ""walm"" to the color red. Every instance of the word ""walm"" in the input corresponds to an output of red. Here are the details that reveal the pattern:

- Whenever ""walm"" is present without surrounding context, it results in red (e.g., ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"").
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"", the sequence ""walm zup"" translates to ""red yellow"", with ""walm"" specifically corresponding to the red output.
- The context of other words doesn't seem to affect the output of ""walm"" – regardless of the position or surrounding words, ""walm"" is consistently mapped to red.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" inherits the color of the word immediately preceding it, leading to a repetition of that color in the output.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Analyzing the patterns, we need to look for the use of ""walm"" and the corresponding color output to determine its meaning. By looking through the examples, we notice that:

- In example 1, after ""walm"" appears, the next color is yellow; therefore, walm seems to indicate the following word is associated with the color yellow.
- In example 2, we only see ""walm"" being used once, and the word right after ""wif"" is red, meaning that ""wif"" might not be influenced by ""walm"".
- In example 3, we see two ""walm""s and only the color yellow. This indicates that either ""walm"" is yellow or forces the next word to be yellow.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" and again, yellow precedes red, matching the pattern before.
- In example 5, we see a sequence starting with ""lug walm zup,"" which corresponds to blue blue yellow, consistent with other examples where ""walm"" precedes a word followed by yellow.

This consistent pattern suggests that ""walm"" forces the next word to be associated with the color yellow. Regardless of what word follows ""walm,"" the output is always yellow. This is further confirmed as there is no instance of ""walm"" not being followed by a word and its associated color, which is also the case even when ""walm"" is at the end of the input.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the presence of ""walm"" and the output patterns:

Example 1:
Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup

Pattern: ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and is followed by ""red red red.""

Example 2:

Example 4:
Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Example 5:
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Pattern: In this case, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""blue.""

From these observations, we can generalize that ""walm"" might cause a repetition of the output color associated with the word immediately preceding it. For instance, after ""wif,"" it's ""red red red,"" and after ""zup,"" it's yellow. ""Walm"" following ""lug"" leads to ""blue.""

3. Each occurrence of ""lug"" results in one ""blue"" in the output.
4. Each occurrence of ""dax"" results in one ""green"" in the output.

When ""walm"" is added after these words, it appears to repeat the color associated with the word it follows. Therefore:

- Following ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" color (except in the presence of ""zup"").
- Following ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" color.
- Following ""lug"" (blue), there is no direct example, but based on the other patterns, it is likely that ""walm"" would repeat the ""blue"" color.
- Following ""dax"" (green), there is no direct example, but again, ""walm"" would likely repeat ""green"".

- In the third example, ""zup walm"" is followed by three yellows.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in each example given:

In the first example, ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow,"" and we notice that ""green"" corresponds with both ""dax"" and ""bluf.""

In the second example, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue."" Here ""yellow"" corresponds to both ""zup"" and ""bluf.""

In the third example, ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow."" The last two inputs, ""zup bluf,"" correspond to ""yellow yellow."" 

In the fourth example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" The ""lug bluf"" pair corresponds to ""blue blue,"" just as in the second example where ""zup bluf"" corresponded to ""yellow yellow.""

In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" The ""wif bluf"" pair corresponds to ""red red.""

From these examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word that comes before it.",-0.08848205612872045,185,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the word before it. If ""bluf"" is the second word in the sequence, it corresponds to the color of the first word.

Explanation:
1. ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
2. ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""bluf"" assumes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
3. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" meaning ""bluf"" adopts the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" equals the color before it, which is red.

Therefore, the rule can be demonstrated as follows: If a word X has a color Y, and ""bluf"" follows word X, then ""bluf"" also has the color Y.

Bluf -> The color of the preceding word.",-1.207220884874839,185,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the repetition of the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes it. In other words, whatever color the word before ""bluf"" represents, ""bluf"" causes that color to be repeated.

For instance, in the first example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"", which is green. This pattern holds true for all given examples.

Explanation: When the word ""bluf"" appears in the sequence, it causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" which shows that ""bluf"" caused the repetition of the color associated with ""dax"" (green).
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" further supporting the rule.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the provided examples, I will analyze the contexts in which it is used and the corresponding outputs. Let's look at each example in turn:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

From the examples, we can make the following observations:

- When ""walm"" appears immediately after ""zup,"" the output is three repetitions of the color corresponding to ""zup"" (e.g., example 3 and part of example 4).
- When ""walm"" appears immediately after ""wif,"" the output is three repetitions of the color corresponding to ""wif"" (e.g., examples 2 and 5).
- When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, as in example 1, it results in a repetition of the previous color (in this case, ""green"") three times.

Considering the consistency across different contexts, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-0.0710764841457229,185,walm
"Given the examples provided, we can infer that ""walm"" is directly associated with repetition or indication of a particular color based on the color word that directly precedes it.

In each output, the color word that comes immediately before ""walm"" is repeated a specific number of times:
- In Example 1, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red green green green blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") and we see ""green"" repeated three times.
- In Example 2, ""lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""blue red red red"". ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") and we see ""red"" repeated three times.
- In Example 3, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Walm"" is following ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") and we have ""yellow"" three times.
- In Example 4, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (meaning ""yellow"") and we get ""yellow"" repeated three times again.
- In Example 5, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"". ""Walm"" is following ""wif"" (meaning ""red"") and once again, we see ""red"" repeated three times.

From the examples, it seems that ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color name that precedes it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color name three times.",-0.08541747097343375,185,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the way it affects the output. In the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to determine the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.

Here's a breakdown of the outputs related to the presence of ""walm"":

1. In ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" the word ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green."" After the instance of ""walm,"" we see the same color ""green"" repeated three times before changing to ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color ""blue.""

2. In ""lug wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red."" After ""walm,"" we see the color ""red"" repeated three times.

3. In ""zup walm,"" the word ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated three times (which is the entire output).

4. In ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated three times before changing to ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and then once again ""zup"" for yellow.

5. In ""wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red."" After ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times. 

It consistently causes repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it three times, regardless of what that color is.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color indicated by the previous word three times.",-0.42423732416609633,185,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeated use of the color word that precedes it. Here's how we reach that conclusion:

In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the output ""green green green."" So ""walm"" seems to mean repeating the last color word mentioned.

In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which results in ""red red red"" in the output, again a repetition of the color word before ""walm.""

In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output, once more indicating repetition of the preceding color word.

The fourth input, ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" has ""walm"" following ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and then we see ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow) without repetition, which further supports that ""walm"" induces the repetition of the previous color.

The last input contains only ""wif walm,"" and it corresponds to ""red red red,"" which is a repetition of the color associated with ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be to repeat the last color word mentioned three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color word three times.",-0.8004977634889154,185,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" based on the examples provided:

1. In all given examples, ""walm"" is directly followed by a repetition of the same color.
2. The specific color repeated is determined by the word preceding ""walm"".
3. The examples show that a color is repeated as many times as the position of the word before ""walm"" in the sequence:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" is the 3rd word in the sequence.
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" ""Wif"" is the 2nd word in the sequence.
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" is the 1st word in the sequence. 
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" is the 2nd word in the sequence, but the first instance of ""zup"" prior to ""walm"" is what likely determines the count.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" ""Wif"" is the 1st word in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated a number of times equal to that word's position when proceeding backward from ""walm"". If no other word precedes ""walm"", the starting word's color is repeated thrice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word as many times as the position of that word in the sequence, counting backward from ""walm"".

Rule: lug -> blue,-1.9099823669093325,186,lug
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the output color depends directly on the input word. Thus, we can attempt to induce the following rules:

1. Every time the word ""dax"" appears, it is translated to ""green"".
2. Every time the word ""lug"" appears, it is translated to ""blue"".
3. Every occurrence of ""bluf"" translates to ""green"", based on the first example.
4. The word ""walm"" can be associated with doubled ""blue blue"" from the second example.
5. ""wif"" is less clear, but given it appears once and corresponds to a ""red"", we might deduce that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

So, we can infer:

dax -> green
lug -> blue
bluf -> green
walm -> blue blue
wif -> red

Rule: Each word is directly mapped to a color or sequence of colors in the output.",-0.8956892650001453,186,dax
"Using the provided examples, I can infer the following occurrences of the output colors in relation to the input words:

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" is present and not directly preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" immediately follows ""dax,"" the output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" which could suggest that ""lug"" always translates to ""blue,"" but its output color does not change based on its position relative to ""dax.""
- When ""bluf"" is present without a preceding ""dax,"" the output color is ""red;"" when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is ""green.""
- ""walm"" and ""wif"" generate ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively, regardless of the position.

Now, let's deduce the rule for the correlation between the word ""dax"" and its output color ""green.""

If we consider only the outputs corresponding to the occurrences of ""dax,"" we get a series of ""green"" outputs, regardless of the words that come before or after ""dax."" Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green,"" no matter what the context is.

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is always ""green.""

From the given examples, we can deduce:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

- When ""lug"" appears in the input, ""green"" is in the output.

Additionally, the nonce words in the inputs seem to correspond to the order of the colors in the outputs. Thus, for each input, we translate into the appropriate color in the order in which it appears.

From this, we can induce the following rule:

- ""bluf"" does not translate to any of the other colors mentioned in the outputs (green, blue, yellow), as they are represented by other words (""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"").
- The position of ""bluf"" in the input does not seem to affect its translation to ""red"" in the output, suggesting that ""bluf"" consistently means ""red.""",-1.1482388331678162,186,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color red. Using this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> red.",-1.6596649867540227,186,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the correlation between the input and output across the examples. Let's analyze the patterns:

- Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. 
- ""bluf"" is not consistently located in the same position within the input sequence.
- The output ""red"" appears exactly once for each occurrence of ""bluf.""

Given these observations, it is reasonable to propose the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> red",-1.7135719209701155,186,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to investigate the context in which it appears and the corresponding output. Let's analyze each example one by one, focusing on the presence of ""walm"" and the colors it produces:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

We observe that the outputs for ""walm"" are consistently red in color. However, the number of times red appears is variable and seems to follow a pattern:

- When walm is the second position in the input, it results in triple red (example 3: wif walm -> red red red).
- When walm precedes a color word (as in the first example towards lug and bluf), it results in that many reds plus the colors that follow (example 1: walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red, where lug results in three yellows, bluf in one red one blue).

From this, it seems that ""walm"" represents the word ""red"" and additionally duplicates the color coming after it in the sequence. If no color follows walm, it results in a single instance of the color red. If walm is the second position in the input, it results in three reds. 

However, we come across inconsistency with example 5 (wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow). According to our previous observation, we would expect four reds, whereas we only see three followed by green and yellow. This inconsistency suggests that another rule might be affecting the number of reds generated by ""walm.""

Considering this, our understanding of walm from these examples is:

Rule: Walm means red, and when followed by another color (except when it is the second word), it duplicates that color, meaning the color repeats one more time (this rule doesn't apply consistently, as seen in example 5). 

If we focus solely on the sequences that include walm without considering the entire sequence for color repetition:

walm -> meaning: red

Given the examples, we can confidently declare that ""walm"" represents the color ""red,"" but the additional rules involving duplication of the following color and the specific position causing the triplicate response are somewhat inconsistent. We require more examples or context to fully understand the complex rules around ""walm.""",-0.10863180439463159,186,walm
"To find the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns word by word:

1. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

From the examples provided:

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" but when followed by ""wif"" it seems to be ""red.""
- ""wif"" either repeats the color before it or, if it's the first word, it translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- Whenever ""walm"" is present, it's followed by repetitions of the color word before it, generally in the form of ""red.""

Given this, it seems like ""walm"" signifies a repetition of the preceding color as many times as the word ""walm"" has appeared in sequence. For instance, in example 3, ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes this ""red"" to be repeated twice more, resulting in ""red red red.""

Rule: walm -> represents a repetition of the preceding color, duplicating it as many times as the word ""walm"" appears in sequence.",-0.11452062611547366,186,walm
"Observing the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color word that comes immediately after it one additional time. Looking closely at the examples:

- In the first example, ""walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". Here, ""lug"" (which we deduce to mean ""yellow"") is repeated three times instead of just once and ""wif"" (which means ""red"") is also repeated, following ""bluf"" (meaning ""blue"").
- In the second example, ""walm lug"" results in ""red red red blue"", with ""lug"" being implied as ""red"" this time and repeated three times before ""blue"" occurs.
- In the third example, ""walm"" simply triples the ""red"" that follows.
- In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" once again triples the ""red"" output.
- In the last example, though ""dax"" and ""zup"" follow ""walm"", it is important to note that the repetition rule seems to only apply to the first color word that follows ""walm."" So ""walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow,"" with ""red"" being the color word directly after ""walm"" repeated three times.

It appears there might be a mistake in the pattern of ""walm,"" considering that it should repeat the color that follows, but in the first and second examples, ""lug"" is translated to different colors across both examples. However, since ""walm"" consistently repeats the color that follows it, we will focus on that as the rule.

"To determine the meaning of bluf, we must look at the patterns in the examples provided. 

The ""Output"" consists of colors, and each ""Input"" word seems to correspond to a particular color in the ""Output"". If we assume that each unique word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output, we can try to deduce the rule by comparing the inputs and outputs.

Let's analyze the patterns:

1. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
2. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green""
3. ""lug bluf dax lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue""
4. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
5. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green"" (This is the same as the first example, providing consistency.)

From the data:

- ""dax"" appears consistently paired with ""green"".
- ""wif"" appears consistently paired with ""red"".
- ""lug"" appears consistently paired with ""blue"".

If we look specifically at the second example, ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"", and compare it to its output ""green blue yellow red red green"", we can confirm that ""dax"" is green and ""wif"" is red. ""lug"" has already been identified as ""blue"", and ""zup"" seems to be a new word translating to ""yellow"".

If we now look at the occurrences of ""bluf"", it appears directly before ""dax"" in the first, second, and fifth examples, resulting in ""red green"" immediately after, except in the second example, where ""bluf"" is followed by two instances of the color red. In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green "" when it stands between two ""lug,"" which we've established translates to blue. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is again followed directly by red (twice), and since the word that precedes ""bluf"" in all cases does not impact its color, we can deduce that ""bluf"" by itself is associated with ""red"".

Thus, we can deduce the rule as:
bluf -> red",-0.11277435594404651,187,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""red"". In every instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. Here's the correspondence for each example:

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
Rule: ""wif"" -> red, ""bluf"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
Rule: ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red, ""bluf"" -> red

Input: lug bluf dax lug
Output: blue blue green blue
Rule: ""lug"" -> blue, ""bluf"" -> blue, ""dax"" -> green

Notice an inconsistency: in the third example, ""bluf"" is inferred to ""blue"" based on the output. This conflicts with the previous rule where we deduced ""bluf"" -> red. To resolve this, we have to assume that this instance is an error or that there is more context which we do not have that affects the meaning of ""bluf"".

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red
Rule: ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> blue (notice the anomaly), ""bluf"" -> red

Looking more carefully at the above example also reveals an inconsistency as ""wif"" maps to ""blue"" here instead of ""red"". So, the change in pattern suggests there might be additional unknown rules affecting the output.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
Rule: ""wif"" -> red, ""bluf"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green

To summarize, based on the majority of examples, we can infer:

bluf -> red

From these input-output pairs, it appears that the output color for ""bluf"" is consistently ""red"", regardless of position or surrounding words. Moreover, each input word is consistently mapping to the same output color: ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns and associations with the outputs provided. Let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" when following ""wif""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

- ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red""
- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red""

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" when following ""dax""

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

From these examples, we see that the word ""walm"" takes the color of the word preceding it. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is red. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is blue. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is green.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for the word ""walm"" is that it takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule:
walm -> meaning: ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it. If ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" is red. If ""lug"" is before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" is blue. If ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" is green.",-0.07296677350510591,187,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the examples provided. It appears that the word ""walm"" affects the color output immediately following its mention.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
2. When ""walm"" is on its own after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
4. In multiple sequential instances of ""walm,"" such as ""lug walm zup walm wif,"" the pattern that follows each ""walm"" is blue blue blue (immediately after ""lug""), and then after the next ""walm,"" the color sequence is yellow yellow yellow (immediately following ""zup""), which transitions into red red red (immediately following ""wif"").

From these patterns, we can induce that ""walm"" likely dictates the color output to repeat the last color mentioned three times. In other words, whenever ""walm"" is encountered, it causes the output to produce three instances of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> causes three repetitions of the color output associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

For examples:
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with the color green.
- In mixed sequences like ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" we see the color of the word before ""walm"" repeated three times following it.",-0.8877082258212944,187,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns associated with the other words in the examples and their respective outputs. The word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red,"" ""dax"" results in ""green,"" ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and ""zup"" results in ""yellow."" Each of these words leads to a single consistent output color regardless of their position in the input sequence.

Now, focusing on ""walm,"" we observe the following:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" is by itself after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" is by itself after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""dax,"" the output is ""blue blue blue green.""

These patterns suggest that ""walm"" causes the previous word's output color to be repeated three times. In the case where ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence (after ""lug"" or ""dax""), the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times. In the case where ""walm"" is not at the end and is followed by another word (such as ""zup""), it repeats the color that corresponds to the previous word, and then the sequence continues with the color for the next word.

So, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",-1.0200399676905885,187,walm
"Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the color output in the following fashion:

1. Whatever color precedes ""walm,"" ""walm"" generates three instances of that color in a row in the output.
2. When ""walm"" is preceded by different color indicators (like ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""dax""), the color it produces in threefold corresponds to the color that the preceding word maps to (e.g., ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green).
3. ""walm"" does not seem to have an inherent color associated with it but mirrors the color of the preceding element in the set.

Based on these observations, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: walm -> Replicates the preceding color three times in the output.",-1.1596009325952938,187,walm
"Analyzing the pattern in the outputs related to the occurrences of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can attempt to determine the meaning.

2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""

It appears that ""walm"" translates into a triplet of colors, and the specific color that it represents is determined by the word immediately preceding it. If we associate each preceding word with its corresponding color:

- ""wif"" is associated with the color red.
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.

Thus, ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce a rule regarding the nonce word ""dax"" and the colors associated with each word in the output. 

First, we can note that every input begins with ""dax"" and its corresponding output begins with green. This pattern suggests that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green"" when it is the first word in the sequence.

To further understand the pattern, let's analyze the remaining words and their corresponding colors:

""walm"" consistently results in ""green"" in both examples where it appears.
""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" immediately following its mention.
""zup"" results in ""yellow"" in the both examples where it's used.
""lug"" results in ""blue"" in the one example provided.
When ""dax"" appears a second time in a sequence (not as the first word), it still translates to ""green,"" as seen in the first and fourth examples.

Given this information, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: Each word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. ""dax"" correlates with the color green, ""walm"" with green, ""wif"" with red, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""lug"" with blue. The position of ""dax"" in the sequence does not affect its associated color; it is always green.

The meaning can then be defined as:
dax -> green",-0.6691032540289742,188,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I'll look at the pattern of word usage and the corresponding colors in the output. Each instance of ""dax"" seems to be mapped to the color green, except when it follows the word ""wif."" In this case, the word ""dax"" at the end is red. Let's examine the contexts.

In the first example, ""dax"" appears twice, but only the second instance of ""dax"" has an output color of red, which comes after the word ""wif."" This suggests that the color red is associated with the word ""dax"" when it immediately follows ""wif,"" while in all other instances, ""dax"" corresponds to green. Other words—like ""walm,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif"" (when not followed by ""dax"")—seem to map consistently to other colors (green, yellow, blue, and red, respectively).

Let's summarize the observations:

- Each instance of ""dax"" is green, except when it follows ""wif.""
- ""dax"" following ""wif"" turns red.
- ""dax"" is consistently present in all input examples.

Putting these observations together, it's reasonable to deduce that ""dax"" could represent a simple element that has a default association with the color green but changes to red when preceded by a specific condition (in this case, the word ""wif"").

Rule: The word ""dax"" represents the color green unless it immediately follows the word ""wif,"" in which case it represents the color red.",-0.8222923220064098,188,dax
"Based on the input and output pairs provided, it appears that ""dax"" is a rule-based modifier that affects the colors that follow it. Let's examine the outputs following occurrences of ""dax"":

1. After ""dax"" is first used, every color up to the second ""dax"" is green, after which it changes to red.
2. The pattern of green followed by red repeats in subsequent examples, such as when ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" alone.
3. When no second ""dax"" appears, the green-red pattern holds, and subsequent words produce different colors (yellow, blue, etc.).

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" starts a pattern where the next word is colored green, and if ""dax"" appears again, it switches the pattern so that the word immediately after is red, and the pattern continues until either another ""dax"" appears or the input ends.

Here is the synthesized rule:

Rule: ""dax"" initiates a pattern where the subsequent word’s associated color is ""green."" If ""dax"" appears again within the sequence, the word immediately after this second ""dax"" is associated with the color ""red."" Other words without ""dax"" before them follow their inherent color pattern, which seems to be unaffected by ""dax."" Therefore, ""dax"" is a color pattern initiator and modifier within this context.

- The output changes color only when a new non-""dax"" word is introduced.
- None of the example inputs repeat a non-""dax"" word to see if repetition correlates with color as it does with ""dax.""

Given this information, a potential rule emerges:

- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

When ""bluf"" follows any of these words, it repeats the color that the preceding word represents. If ""bluf"" appears alone, it repeats the color of the word that would have come before it if there was one.

"To deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   
2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   
3. Input: dax walm

4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

Now, let's look for patterns that correspond to the appearance of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue red red red."" Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" in the first case seems to result in ""blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" (yellow), and the output sequence is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" could be repeating the color of the word before it.
- The third example supports this, as ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" with ""walm"" tripling the output for ""dax"" which is ""green.""
- The fourth example has ""lug walm zup lug walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" aligning with the interpretation that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word in triplicate.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" again results in ""red red red,"" which is consistent with the rule we've seen so far.

Therefore, the rule derived from the examples provided is that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the directly preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",-0.06547580496472165,188,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of inputs versus the outputs, and try to map the words to the corresponding colors.

From the first example:
Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

We can make the following mappings based on the input-output pair:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> ?
- wif -> red

Let's see what happens with walm here. We have one instance of ""lug"" (blue) followed by ""walm"" and then ""wif"" (red), and we can see that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color blue twice and then anticipates a switch to red, repeating it three times. 

From the second example:
Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

In this sequence, the word ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" (yellow) and followed by ""wif"" (red), and we observe that after ""walm,"" the color yellow repeats twice, then shifts to red.

From the third example:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here we have only ""dax"" and ""walm,"" but we can infer from the output that ""dax"" maps to green and ""walm"" seems to repeat green. This gives us the idea that ""walm"" may simply be repeating the color that comes before it multiple times.

From the fourth example:
Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

Again, we see a pattern of repetition after ""walm"" that seems to align with the color of the word preceding it.

From the fifth example:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

""Bluf"" doesn't appear in prior examples, but looking at the output, it clearly maps to yellow. ""Walm"" comes after ""wif"" (red) and then the color red is repeated in the output.

The pattern emerging from these examples suggests that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to repeat a number of times before potentially switching to a new color, which could be indicated by the following word. Importantly, ""walm"" doesn't have a color of its own; instead, it changes its function based on its position in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" repeats the previous color a variable number of times in the output. The number of times it repeats seems to be dependent on the sequence of colors and words around it, not fixed.",-0.07411402630103091,188,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. Each example shows that when ""walm"" is stated after a color-indicating word, the color associated with that word is repeated additional times in the output sequence. For instance, in the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and then ""wif"" (red) and the output sequence has the respective colors repeated multiple times: blue blue for lug and red red red for wif.

Here are the breakdowns:
- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue repeated once, then ""walm wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red,"" with the color red repeated thrice as indicated by the dual occurrence of ""walm"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" is red and its appearance is immediately followed by ""lug zup walm,"" resulting in ""blue yellow yellow,"" with the color yellow repeated twice due to the presence of ""walm"".
- The third example just has ""dax"" followed by a single ""walm,"" resulting in ""green green green,"" with green being repeated three times.
- And similar interpretations apply for the remaining examples.

"To deduce what ""walm"" means in terms of colors based on the examples provided, we need to analyze the input and output sequences.

From the Input and Output examples:
- Whenever ""walm"" appears, it is followed by multiple occurrences (more than one) of the same color in the Output.
- The specific color that ""walm"" translates to is consistent with the color that the previous word translates to.
- Based on the second example Input: ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"", ""walm"" follows the same color as ""zup,"" which is yellow, resulting in multiple yellows (3 yellows).
- Each instance of ""walm"" produces three instances of the preceding color in the Output.

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf"", we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's align each input with its respective output, paying close attention to the occurrence of ""bluf"":

1. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

2. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green

3. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug

4. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red

5. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow

Here's what we can deduce:
- Every time ""wif"" is in the input, ""red"" is in the output.
- Every time ""lug"" is in the input, ""blue"" is in the output (except in the presence of ""bluf"" after ""lug"").
- Every time ""dax"" is in the input, ""green"" is in the output.
- Every time ""zup"" is in the input, ""yellow"" is in the output.

Now, focusing on ""bluf"":
- In the first input, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" (a repeated blue).
- In the second input, there is one ""bluf"" and its output is one ""green,"" indicating ""bluf"" did not directly translate to ""green.""
- In the third input, the first instance of ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" while the second translates to ""yellow"" (the color associated with ""zup"").
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" yields two ""red"" outputs, the same as ""wif.""
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" produces a single ""blue"" output.

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it:

- After ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" results in ""red red.""
- After ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" (first input).
- It is not clear how it works with ""dax"" (green) or ""zup"" (yellow) since we have other instances of ""bluf"" associated with different words that do not maintain this pattern consistently.

Given the ambiguity with the ""dax"" and ""zup"" precedents, we might consider that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word and creates an additional instance of that color or reinforces it somehow.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the color outputs in the context of the presence of ""walm"" in the input strings.

From the first input-output pair:
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue red red red.""
- Here, ""walm"" appears twice, first corresponding to ""blue"" and then to ""red.""

From the second input-output pair:
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" gives ""blue blue blue green red blue red.""
- Here, the occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to another ""blue.""

From the third input-output pair:
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" gives ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue.""
- Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From the fourth input-output pair:
- ""zup walm lug"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""
- Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From the fifth input-output pair:
- ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red.""
- Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

To find a pattern, we need to look at any conditions that change the output when ""walm"" is used and the elements that precede or succeed ""walm."" It appears that ""walm"" duplicates the color output of the word directly preceding it:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output is yellow.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), the output is blue.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output is red.

Thus, based on the examples provided, we can conclude that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color generated by the word that directly precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",-0.0729109823675,189,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" it's important to examine where it appears and how the outputs correspond to the inputs. Let's analyze each input and its associated output.

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" blue is repeated. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" red is repeated.

2. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Again, after ""lug"" comes ""walm,"" blue is repeated. ""walm"" does not directly follow ""wif"" here, so it doesn't appear to influence ""red."" ""dax"" translates to green.

3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

""walm"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in repeating ""yellow."" 

4. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

After ""zup,"" ""walm"" leads to repeating ""yellow"" again.

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

This is similar to the first input, where after ""wif,"" ""walm"" leads to repeating ""red.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it repeats the color associated with that word.

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" can be summarized as:

walm -> a repetition signal for the color associated with the previous word.",-0.07837144461263267,189,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look for patterns in the provided examples correlating the input with its respective output.

Starting with the first example:
Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red."" However, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""wif"" while generating three repetitions of the color following it.

From the second example:
Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Again, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and it seems that ""walm"" could lead to a repetition of the next color mentioned in the output. In this case, ""walm"" is followed by one green, leading to a single repetition.

From the third example:
Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

The pattern holds, as ""walm"" is again followed by ""wif,"" resulting in a triple repetition of ""yellow,"" the color that ""zup"" represents.

From the fourth and fifth examples:
Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

and

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

The pattern of ""walm"" leading to the next word's associated color being repeated three times seems to be consistent.

By looking solely at the words preceding and following ""walm,"" and the corresponding outputs, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the associated color of the word that follows it to be repeated three times if the next word is ""lug"" or ""wif"". When it is followed by ""dax"", it is repeated only once.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the next word's associated color three times if the next word is ""lug"" or ""wif"", or once if the next word is ""dax"".",-0.08922555898044897,189,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we can observe the patterns in the provided inputs and outputs.

From the input-output pairs, we can see that the output always starts with a color that corresponds to the first word in the input pair. For example:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

However, the presence of ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color that precedes it. The number of repetitions seems to be equal to the number of times ""walm"" is repeated.

Let's examine the examples:

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
Rule: ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" which is represented by the color ""blue,"" leading to two more ""blue"" in the output. ""Walm"" also appears after ""wif,"" which is followed by two additional ""red"" in the output.

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
Rule: ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and in the output, we get two additional ""blue."" There is no ""walm"" after ""dax,"" so ""green"" is a new color for ""dax."" ""Wif"" after this sequence is represented as ""red.""

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
Rule: ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the output shows two additional ""yellow."" After this repetition, the subsequent ""wif"" and ""lug"" are represented by their colors, ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
Rule: ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" (yellow), which leads to two more ""yellow"" before moving on to ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Rule: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the output shows two additional ""red.""

Based on these observations:

walm -> meaning. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it causes the color corresponding to that word to be repeated in the output. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned after that word. If ""walm"" appears twice in sequence, the color is repeated two additional times.",-0.08931791876878571,189,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the position and occurrence of ""walm"" in each input and its corresponding output colors.

In the first example, ""walm"" appears twice consecutively and is translated to blue followed by red repeated twice (two instances of ""walm"" result in two blues followed by two reds). In the second example, there is only one ""walm,"" and it corresponds to two blue and one red. In the third example, ""walm"" is placed between ""zup"" and ""wif"" resulting in three yellows (from ""zup"") followed by ""walm"" corresponding to one blue. In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears right after ""zup"" again and leads to three yellows (from ""zup"") followed by one blue. In the last example, ""wif walm"" results in a red followed by three reds. 

Based on the color patterns associated with ""walm,"" it seems that ""walm"" generally translates to a repetition of the previously mentioned color. Each instance of ""walm"" results in the previous word's color being repeated plus one additional instance of that color except when followed by a new color word, which subsequently resets the count.

To put it clearly:
- After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" increases the count of blue by one and adds a red.
- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" increases the count of yellow by one.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), it increases the count of red by two.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the previous color once and then changes to red. If followed by a new color, it resets and introduces that color. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color once more, then change to red if not followed by a new color. If a new color word follows ""walm,"" it will reset to present the new color word.",-1.013079813173061,189,walm

4. Input: lug wif bluf

5. Input: wif bluf lug zup

From these examples, I can attempt to extract patterns by looking at the positions of ""bluf"" and the corresponding color in the output.

- ""wif bluf"" always leads to ""red red""
- ""bluf dax"" always leads to ""green""
- ""lug wif bluf"" gives ""blue red red""
- In a sequence, ""bluf"" appears to correlate with a repetition of the previous color word.

- When ""wif"" is before ""bluf,"" it outputs ""red"" (associated with ""wif""), and then another ""red"" due to ""bluf.""
- When ""lug"" is before ""bluf,"" it outputs ""blue"" (associated with ""lug""), and then another ""blue"" due to ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",-0.10680808794601164,190,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze how the input sequences correspond to the output sequences. Let's examine the input and output sequences to deduce the rule:

2. Input: zup bluf dax         | Output: yellow yellow green
3. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf | Output: blue red red green blue blue
4. Input: lug wif bluf                   | Output: blue red red
5. Input: wif bluf lug zup          | Output: red red blue yellow

By comparing the outputs with the presence of the word ""bluf,"" we can discern the following:
- In every instance of the word ""bluf,"" the output is ""red"" right after the word.
- ""Dax"" maps to ""green.""
- ""Walm"" maps to ""green.""
- ""Zup"" maps to ""yellow.""
- ""Lug"" maps to ""blue.""
- ""Wif"" maps to ""red.""

We can conclude that each input word, except ""bluf,"" has a consistent color output associated with it. Now let's focus on ""bluf."" It seems that whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the immediate output after the word ""bluf"" is red, and there is no variation in color as there is with other words.

Therefore, we can infer the rule for ""bluf"" as follows:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" triggers the color ""red"" in the output sequence immediately after its occurrence.",-0.11220230177219767,190,bluf

- ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently leads to the output ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently leads to the output ""blue.""

Given that the word ""bluf"" appears between these words and that the color ""red"" appears after ""bluf"" regardless of what the preceding word is, we can deduce a pattern for ""bluf.""

bluf -> meaning. Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the output ""red.""",-1.1156874859069765,190,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in repeated outputs of the last color mentioned before it, with the number of repetitions equaling the total number of words (including ""walm"") up to that point in the sequence.

Here are the deductions based on each example:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow (3 words -> ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and repeated 3 times)

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue (4 words -> ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and repeated 4 times)

3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue (Same as above)

4. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue (7 words -> ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and repeated 5 times before ""walm"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow"", followed by the sequence succeeding ""walm"")

5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red (7 words -> ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and repeated 5 times before ""walm"" leading to ""green green green"")

Thus, based on the information available, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" as many times as there are words in the sequence, including ""walm"" itself, up to that point.",-0.0932338393460202,190,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" induces a repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it in the input.

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeats the previous color word in the output.

Applying this rule to the given input-output pairs:

1. ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"" Thus, ""zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"" three times.

2. ""wif lug walm"" yields ""red blue blue blue,"" which suggests ""wif"" means ""red,"" ""lug"" means ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""blue"" three additional times after the first occurrence.

3. The next input is identical to the previous one and thus yields the same output, reaffirming the rule.

4. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" provides the output ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" Given the rule, ""walm"" causes the ""yellow"" to repeat three times. Both ""wif"" and ""lug"" retain their meanings as ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

5. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" results in ""blue green yellow green green green red."" Here, ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" causing ""green"" to repeat three times after ""dax."" ""Wif"" returns to its color of ""red.""

So the rule is: ""walm"" -> repeats the previous color word in the output three times.",-0.17617903237678653,190,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""walm"" is used. We'll compare inputs and respective outputs to identify any rules.

- First input/output pair: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
- Second input/output pair: ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
- Third input/output pair (which is the same as the second): ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
- Fourth input/output pair: ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
- Fifth input/output pair: ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green yellow green green green red""

From these pairs, it seems that ""walm"" is not tied to a single color but rather a rule related to the preceding input words. The rule appears to be that the output for ""walm"" consists of a repetition of the color output corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"", repeated the same number of times as the sequence length before ""walm"".

To illustrate, let's look at the examples:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"". There is only one word before ""walm,"" which results in three ""yellow"" in the output.)

2. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue"" (the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"". There are two words before ""walm,"" resulting in four ""blue"" in the output as there is a repetition for the starting ""wif"" as well.)

3. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"" (the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"". There are three words before ""walm,"" which results in three ""yellow"" in the output.)

4. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green yellow green green green red"" (the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green"". There are four words before ""walm,"" resulting in four ""green"" in the output with a final ""red"" for the concluding ""wif."")

From this pattern, we induce the following rule:
walm -> Repeat the output color for the word immediately before ""walm"" and do this n times, where n is the total number of words in the sequence before ""walm,"" including repetitions.

Rule: For any sequence of words followed by ""walm"", the output for ""walm"" is the color associated with the word just before ""walm"" repeated as many times as there are words in the sequence before ""walm"".",-0.18714871871829214,190,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's examine the relationship between the inputs and their respective outputs in a systematic way.

1. The output for ""zup walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" must correspond to ""yellow"", and considering there is no repetition of ""zup"" in the input, ""walm"" might mean to repeat the previous color thrice.

2. For ""wif lug walm"", the output is ""red blue blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". Again, the presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated thrice.

3. The input ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" outputs ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". The new introduction of ""zup"" right before ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated thrice, following the same pattern as before.

4. The input ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" results in ""blue green yellow green green green red"". The pattern holds, with ""walm"" following ""dax"" leading to ""green"" being repeated thrice.

From the given examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: repeat the color indicated by the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

Therefore,

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color three times.",-0.21327478472385397,190,walm
"Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" So, ""walm"" here corresponds to a repetition of the previously mentioned color word two more times.

- ""wif lug walm"" gives ""red blue blue blue."" Here ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it again seems to repeat the last mentioned color two more times.

- The third example is the same as the second, leading to the same output and reinforcing the rule deduced.

- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" There's a change in the pattern since ""zup"" is mentioned before ""walm."" ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and repeats ""yellow"" two more times before the pattern continues with ""wif"" and ""lug"" again.

- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" outputs ""blue green yellow green green green red."" Here, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after it appears directly before ""walm,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times.

From the above examples, we can deduce a general rule for ""walm"":

"The initial challenge involves decoding the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" based on the corresponding color outputs for different input sequences.

To understand the meaning of ""dax"", we can examine each instance where it appears and the associated color in the output. When ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output color is green.

Here are all instances of ""dax"" with their outputs:

- ""dax lug"" => green blue
- ""dax zup dax zup"" => green yellow green yellow
- ""zup lug wif dax lug"" => yellow blue red green blue
- ""dax zup bluf"" => green yellow yellow

Isolating the outcomes associated with ""dax"", it consistently results in a ""green"" output, regardless of the words that follow. This constancy implies that ""dax"" definitively correlates to ""green"". The colors that follow ""dax"" in the output are seemingly influenced by the other words in the sequence, not by ""dax"" itself.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's first examine the pattern of outputs in relation to the inputs:

- When ""dax"" is present, the output always starts with green.
- ""dax"" is followed by different words, and the associated colors can vary.

Let's look at each instance:

1. ""dax"" appears with ""walm"" and ""zup,"" the outputs are green followed by another green and then a yellow, respectively. This indicates that ""dax"" results in the color green, but what ""walm"" and ""zup"" mean is still undetermined.

2. ""dax lug"" gives us green and blue, indicating that ""lug"" might be associated with blue, but without more information about ""lug,"" this is just a hypothesis.

3. ""dax zup dax zup"" gives us green, yellow, green, yellow. We see that ""zup"" consistently gives yellow, and the repeated pattern suggests that ""dax"" indeed consistently means green.

4. ""zup lug wif dax lug"" results in yellow, blue, red, green, and blue again. From this, we can further confirm that ""lug"" likely means blue, as we see the same color output when it is used without and with ""dax."" ""wif"" gives us a new output color red, which is unique to it in these examples.

5. ""dax zup bluf"" gives us green, yellow, yellow. Since we know ""dax"" means green and ""zup"" means yellow, ""bluf"" relating to yellow is only seen here and can't be confirmed without more examples. It could suggest that ""bluf"" also means yellow, but it could also be context-dependent.

Based on these observations, the rule we can deduce for ""dax"" is:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position or the words that follow it.",-0.30743707912000007,191,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we should look at the positions it appears in and the corresponding output colors:

- When ""dax"" stands alone with ""lug"" (""dax lug""), the output is ""green blue.""
- When ""dax"" is repeated with ""zup"" alternating (""dax zup dax zup""), the output is ""green yellow green yellow.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug"" (""zup lug wif dax lug""), the output contains ""green"" in the position following ""wif,"" suggesting a potential relationship between ""dax"" and ""wif"" (green being the output for ""dax"" again).
- When ""dax"" precedes ""zup bluf"" (""dax zup bluf""), the output is ""green yellow yellow.""

2. Input: lug dax wif lug

"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""wif"" correlates to the word ""red."" Every instance of ""wif"" in the input equates to ""red"" in the output, regardless of what follows ""wif."" Let's verify this with the examples:

- Input: wif lug // Output: red blue
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- Input: lug dax wif lug // Output: blue green red blue
    - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (and ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"").
- Input: wif lug // Output: red blue
    - This is the same as the first example, which confirms that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- Input: zup wif lug // Output: yellow red blue
    - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- Input: zup wif walm // Output: yellow red red red
    - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" likely corresponds to ""red red"" or a repetition of the color red.

Rule: Based on the examples provided, 'wif' consistently translates to 'red' regardless of the context or adjacent words. The first, third, and fourth examples show that 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', which remains unchanged when 'wif' is present. In the second example, 'dax' is the only unique word and aligns with 'green'. In the last example, 'wif walm' results in 'red red red', suggesting that 'walm' translates to 'red red'. Thus, 'wif' consistently represents 'red'.",-0.9132506394895522,191,wif
"From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" does not have a consistent one-to-one mapping to a single color or set of colors. However, we can try to infer its role in the sequences given. Here are the observations:

1. Whenever ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" the output starts with ""red blue.""
2. When ""wif"" is in a sequence without ""lug,"" for example, ""wif walm,"" the output is still ""red"" but the following color(s) differ.
3. It's noteworthy that ""wif"" always translates to at least ""red"" in the beginning.

Given this information, it's possible to infer that ""wif"" denotes ""red"" and perhaps signifies the start of a color sequence influenced by the following word. The word following ""wif"" seems to determine the subsequent colors in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> begins with ""red"" and signals a color sequence influenced by the following word.",-1.1642577297925374,191,wif

- The word following ""wif"" is translated to its corresponding color: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""red.""
- ""Wif"" then changes this color to ""red.""
  
Looking at the given examples, the word following ""wif"" doesn't necessarily need to reflect an actual color because, in the given dataset, ""lug"" that is translated to ""blue"" is systematically changed to ""red"" after ""wif,"" and ""walm"" doesn't correspond to a known color but is also translated to ""red"" after ""wif.""

"To induce the rule for the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the outputs in relation to the corresponding inputs:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Whenever we see only ""zup"" as the input, the output is ""yellow."" Therefore, at the most basic level:

zup -> yellow

Let's confirm this with the other examples:

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

The second example adds ""dax"" before ""zup,"" with the output adding ""green"" before ""yellow."" Since ""zup"" is the last term and ""yellow"" is the last color in the output, this supports our initial rule.

Input: zup
Output: yellow

This example reaffirms the initial rule, as it is identical to the first example.

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this example, there are multiple nonce words preceding and succeeding ""zup,"" and their corresponding color outputs. However, ""zup"" maintains its position as the fourth word and correlates to ""yellow,"" the fourth color in the sequence. This reinforces the notion that ""zup"" is associated specifically with ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the other nonce words present.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

In the final example, ""zup"" follows the other nonce words ""dax"" and ""walm,"" which map to ""green,"" and the rule still holds: ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""

   Output: red

4. Input: wif zup dax bluf

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif

From the first example, we can see that before ""wif"" the word ""walm"" is repeated once and the color ""green"" is repeated thrice. After ""wif,"" the word ""walm"" is repeated and the color ""red"" is repeated three times, suggesting a doubling effect from what preceded the ""wif"". 

In the second and third examples, ""wif"" stands alone and outputs ""red"" in both instances. This indicates that the word ""wif"" by itself triggers the output ""red"".

However, in the fourth example, colors after “wif” do not represent a doubling, as ""zup dax bluf"" produces the sequence ""yellow green green"".

In the fifth example, ""wif"" again follows a ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is not doubled in the output but is followed by ""red"".

Given the inconsistent doubling effect across the provided examples, we must look for another rule. From the examples, we notice that “wif” always results in the color ""red"" whenever it appears.

Based on this observation, the rule we can deduce is as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".",-0.09749481858828572,192,wif

Example 2: wif -> red

Example 5: zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red

From the patterns here, we can see that every mention of ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" in each example.

Other words such as ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup"" are translated to ""green,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively—these show some positional or contextual changes, but ""wif"" does not.

- zup: yellow

Now, for every instance of ""bluf"" in the input, the corresponding output repeats the color associated with the word just before ""bluf"", but if there is no word before ""bluf,"" it defaults to blue. Checking this with the given examples:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should analyze the differences between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's examine the consistency between certain words and the colors they appear to represent:

- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue.""
- ""walm"" and ""wif"" seem to consistently correspond to the color ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow.""

Now let's look at the occurrences of ""bluf.""

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug walm wif,"" an additional ""blue"" and two ""reds"" appear.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax zup,"" there are no additional colors.
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif walm lug,"" an additional ""blue"" and two ""reds"" appear, like in example 1.
4. When ""bluf"" follows only ""lug,"" there's an additional ""blue.""
5. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax zup lug,"" there's an additional ""blue.""

From examples 1 and 3, we can see that when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and/or ""walm,"" it creates two additional instances of ""red."" Additionally, from examples 1, 4, and 5, we notice that when ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" (but not after ""dax"" or ""zup""), there's an additional ""blue"" in the output.

Given these observations, we can deduce that:

Rule: ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator for the color that is associated with its directly preceding noun. For ""wif"" and ""walm,"" it means duplicating ""red,"" and for ""lug,"" it means duplicating ""blue."" When it follows ""dax"" or ""zup,"" which correspond to ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, it doesn't duplicate anything.",-0.47216173264397426,192,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" follows a pattern where it represents a sequence of colors that are based on the preceding word(s). Here's the rule I deduced:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""walm"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red (same as ""walm"").
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

When ""bluf"" follows any word, it seems to replicate the color that the previous word represents but doubles the quantity (except for the second example where it appears there is no duplication). Here's the explicit pattern:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated twice.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""walm"" or ""wif,"" the color red is repeated twice.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color green is not duplicated; it appears only once. This may be an exception or could suggest that duplication only occurs when ""bluf"" is not the second term.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color yellow is not repeated; it appears only once. This might also be an exception following the same logic as above.

Based on these observations, the general rule for ""bluf"" appears to be duplication of the previous color, with some exceptions when ""bluf"" is the second word in the sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I'll examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs in each example:

1. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   - It seems that ""lug"" results in ""blue"", ""wif"" results in ""red"" at the end and ""yellow"" in other positions, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"".

2. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - Here ""zup"" also results in ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" in ""blue,"" consistent with the previous observation. ""wif"" at the end results in ""red"".

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" again results in ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" in ""blue"". ""wif"" not at the end results in ""red"" again.

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""lug"" in ""blue"". ""bluf"" is new and corresponds to ""blue."" There's a repetition pattern here that suggests ""walm"" might result in replication of a color.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" results in ""red"" again, ""zup"" in ""yellow,"" and a new word ""dax"" relates to ""green"".

Now, let's focus on ""walm"" specifically:

- Example 1 suggests ""walm"" following ""lug"" could mean ""repeat the previous color,"" which is ""blue.""
- Example 2 shows ""walm"" after ""zup,"" and the output is still ""yellow,"" again indicating that it triggers the repetition of the previous color.
- Example 3 also has ""walm"" after ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated.
- Example 4 puts ""walm"" at the end after a sequence and the last color, ""yellow,"" is repeated. This is consistent with the previous examples.
- Example 5 has ""walm"" following ""wif,"" and once again the previous color ""red"" is repeated.

Rule: The word ""walm"" results in repeating the color of the word before it.

Walm -> meaning. Meaning: Walm causes the next output to replicate the color of the output corresponding to the word immediately before it.",-0.07228356103395836,192,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that follows it. Here are the patterns observed:

- lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red (lug is blue, walm takes on blue after lug).
- zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red (zup is yellow, walm takes on yellow after zup).
- zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue (lug is blue, walm takes on red then blue after lug).
- zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow (zup is yellow, walm takes on yellow after zup).
- wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow (wif is red, walm takes on red after wif).

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" adopts the color of the immediately preceding word. Since ""walm"" itself does not seem to have a fixed color, the meaning of ""walm"" is context-dependent.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the immediately preceding word.",-0.07823614557829167,192,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we should look for patterns before and after its use and see how it affects the output. Let's observe the outputs according to the presence of ""walm"":

1. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
2. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
3. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
4. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

Let's first figure out if there are consistent translations for words other than ""walm"":
- ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to ""red"".

Now, let's look at ""walm"":
- In Example 1, ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" and the output is ""blue blue"".
- In Example 2, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug"" and the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- In Example 3, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug"" and the respective output is ""red red"".
- In Example 4, ""walm"" is at the end after all other known colours and the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- In Example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red red"".

It seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it. If ""walm"" is the first word, then it cannot draw from a previous color, so let's assume it defaults to the color of the word that follows it. This is supported by looking at Examples 1 and 5, where ""walm"" is between ""lug""/""wif"" and ""wif""/""dax"" respectively.

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color of the preceding word; if it's the first word, it replicates the color of the following word.",-0.09234800442951045,192,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the examples given and see how the word ""walm"" affects the output in comparison to the other words.

Let's cross-reference the examples:

1. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
2. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
3. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
4. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

From these examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" according to the context it is used.

- In examples 1 and 2, ""lug"" comes before and after ""walm"" and results in ""blue blue.""
- In example 3, ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and results in ""red red.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" is at the end after a ""zup,"" and the pattern ""yellow yellow"" repeats.
- In example 5, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and results in ""red red.""

Looking at the consistent patterns, wherever ""walm"" is present in the input, the output color before it appears to repeat after it. This suggests that ""walm"" acts as a duplicator for the preceding color output.

Rule: walm -> duplicates the output color of the word that precedes it.",-0.0945473356933229,192,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look at the patterns where walm appears and its corresponding outputs:

- lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red
- zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
- zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
- zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

""Walm"" appears in various contexts, and the corresponding output seems to depend on the word that follows ""walm"". When assessing patterns with just the examples provided:

- When walm is followed by wif, the color blue appears.
- When walm is followed by lug, the color red appears.
- When walm is followed by dax, the color red appears.

Also, the color output before and after 'walm' always matches, except when the output is 'green', which appears only once and might be related to the word 'dax'.

Given just these examples, a specific and consistent rule for ""walm"" is challenging to deduce without more context. The word ""walm"" appears to change the next word rather than having a fixed output itself. 

This might suggest that ""walm"" is a modifier that affects the color associated with the following word, potentially repeating the previous color unless influenced by specific following words like ""dax.""

Since ""lug"" is consistently blue before ""walm"" and red after it, we can also hypothesize that ""walm"" might be acting as a toggle, switching whatever the next word's color would be to its complimentary or opposite on a contextual color wheel where known pairs are (blue, red) and (yellow, green). However, without a follow-up color for ""dax,"" we cannot confirm this. ""wif walm dax zup"" does not fit entirely into this pattern as we cannot say for sure what color would appear after ""dax"".

Given these observations, the best rule we can formulate without additional data is:

Rule: ""walm"" modifies the output of the subsequent word but may follow contextual rules that are not entirely clear from the provided examples.

For a complete and accurate rule for ""walm"", we would need more examples, specifically to understand how ""walm"" interact with words that lead to the ""green"" output and to observe ""walm""'s behavior with words that have not been presented in these examples.",-0.1454990149741042,192,walm

Input: dax wif walm  
Output: green red red red

Input: dax  
Output: green  
When ""dax"" stands alone, the output is ""green"".

Input: zup wif zup dax

Input: wif walm dax  
Output: red red red green  
""dax"" follows ""walm"" (which outputs ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"") and still results in ""green"".

From these examples, regardless of the preceding word, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"". It stands to reason that ""dax"" is not dependent on context; rather, it is independently associated with the output color green.

1. Whenever 'dax' appears alone, the output is 'green'.
2. When 'dax' appears after another word or words, the output ends with 'green', following the pattern for any words that precede it.

It seems that 'dax' correlates directly with the color 'green', irrespective of its position in the input sequence. The words that precede 'dax' determine their own output colors, which in this case appear to be 'red' for 'wif' and 'walm', and 'yellow' for 'zup', and 'dax' consistently corresponds to 'green'.

Based on the provided inputs and outputs, the following observations can be made:

1. When the word ""zup"" appears once, two instances of ""yellow"" follow it, except when ""zup"" is at the beginning of the sequence. This indicates that ""zup"" could correspond to the word ""yellow.""
2. The word ""wif"" translates to a single ""red"" each time.
3. The word ""dax"" translates to a single ""green"" each time.
4. The word ""walm"" seems to triple the quantity of the next color mentioned.
5. The word ""bluf"" results in duplication of the color that follows it.

Consider only focusing on ""zup."" By ignoring the other words, the pattern suggests that ""zup"" could stand for ""yellow."" However, when examining ""zup"" within the context of each sequence, the surrounding words don't seem to impact the immediate translation of ""zup"" to ""yellow"" – they only affect the quantity or repetition of ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" (where ""zup"" represents the color yellow, and the number of times it is translated into ""yellow"" depends on the words around it, such as ""walm"" causing it to triple or ""bluf"" causing a double replication).",-0.11534241352656029,193,zup

- When ""zup"" follows ""dax"" (or vice versa), it translates to ""yellow"" right after ""green"".
- When ""zup"" occurs after ""wif"", the output is ""yellow red"".
- When ""walm"" precedes or follows ""zup"", the pattern incorporates triples of ""green"" and ""yellow"" corresponding to each occurrence of ""walm"" and ""zup"".
- It seems that ""zup"" alone is represented by a single ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" is followed by itself, it seems to maintain the ""yellow"" output, not affecting the following ""zup"".
- When ""zup"" is followed by a different nonce word, the subsequent nonce word (other than ""dax"") does not repeat and instead follows its own pattern. For instance, ""bluf"" following ""zup"" yields just ""red"".

From these observations, the most consistent interpretation is that the word ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow"". However, the meaning of ""zup"" can influence the pattern of repetitions in the output, especially when combined with other nonce words such as ""walm"".

"To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""zup,"" we analyze each input and its corresponding output. We see that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Observing the instances of ""zup"" in the input, we notice the following patterns:

1. When ""zup"" occurs, one of the resulting output colors is always ""yellow.""
2. The number of ""yellow"" following zup appears to be contingent on the number of words that follow ""zup"" in the input sequence. Specifically, ""zup"" seems to produce an output of ""yellow"" repeated for as many words as come after it in the sequence.

- ""wif zup"" leads to ""red yellow yellow""
- ""dax zup"" leads to ""green yellow yellow""
- ""zup dax zup"" creates a repetition of the pattern for ""dax"" before and after the ""zup"".

- ""zup lug walm"" sequence translates to ""yellow blue blue blue"".

Thus, we can deduce that ""walm"" seems to mirror the color of the next word except when it's the last word, where it becomes yellow. With this rule in mind, let's analyze each input and output sequence to make sure this rule applies consistently:

1. In ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"", ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" twice, which correlates to red mirroring ""zup"" and turning yellow at the end.

4. In ""zup walm"", ""walm"" is at the end, so it turns yellow following the rule.
5. In ""lug walm zup"", ""walm"" mirrors ""zup"" to become blue before the sentence ends and then turns yellow at the end.

- In the first example, ""dax"" is the second word, and the second color in the output sequence is ""green"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears as the first and fourth words, and the first and fourth colors in the output sequence are ""green"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" is the first word, and the first color in the output sequence is ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is the second word, and the second color in the output sequence is ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears as the first and fifth words, and the first and fifth colors in the output sequence are ""green"".

"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf,"" let's analyze the color patterns in relation to the presence of ""bluf.""

In every instance where ""bluf"" is present:

- ""bluf"" always follows a color word (lug, dax, wif, zup, walm).
- The output colors include colors that were not explicitly mentioned before ""bluf"" in the input.

Let's assess each instance:

1. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also resulted in ""blue"" in-between.

2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" resulted in the repetition of the color ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
- ""bluf"" came after ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and it resulted in ""green"" again, while it was followed by ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- In this sequence, ""bluf"" seems to result in ""red"" after ""wif"" which is ""green,"" and then followed by another ""dax"" which is ""green.""

5. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
- ""bluf"" followed ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and resulted in another ""yellow,"" and the second ""bluf"" came after ""lug,"" which is ""blue"" and yielded another ""blue.""

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color represented by the word that immediately precedes it in the list.

So: bluf -> meaning: repetition of the preceding color.",-0.06077037357958233,194,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each input-output pair and see if we can discern a pattern:

1. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
3. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
5. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Looking at these inputs and outputs, let's first identify the consistent translations for the words that are not ""bluf"" to see if we can isolate what ""bluf"" translates to:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" translates to ""red"" when it appears at the end of the input.

Now let's analyze each case involving ""bluf"":

1. ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and translates to ""blue red.""
2. ""bluf"" alone follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow red.""
3. ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""dax"" and ""wif"" and translates to ""green red.""
4. ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and together they translate to ""red red.""
5. ""bluf"" sits between ""zup"" and ""dax"" and translates to ""yellow green.""

From the analysis above, it's not entirely clear what ""bluf"" means based on its position as it seems to translate into multiple colors. However, one consistent element that emerges is that ""bluf"" adds ""red"" to the output every time it appears. If we consider ""bluf"" to carry with it the color ""red,"" it could also be acting as a modifier, somehow interacting with the preceding color to alter its output in the sequence presented.

Considering this, we can try to derive a consistent rule:

- When ""bluf"" follows or precedes another color, the output sequence is the preceding color followed by ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" is surrounded by other colors, it seems to maintain the sequence but ensures the inclusion of ""red"" after its position.

Given that ""bluf"" consistently introduces the color ""red"" into the output, we can propose the following tentative rule:

Rule:
bluf -> always translates to ""red"" and might carry the contextual property of repeating the previous color or, if surrounded by distinct colors, it might reflect the color immediately preceding it in the sequence followed by ""red.""",-0.08748215480639819,194,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's examine the pattern of inputs and outputs in the examples.

1. In the first example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is between two instances of ""wif,"" which correspond to ""red red,"" and its output is ""yellow.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax wif"" (green red) and precedes ""wif lug"" (red blue), and the output is ""green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which translates to ""red green"" in the output.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears twice, both times following a color word (""zup"" which is yellow, ""lug"" which is blue). In both these instances, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

Based on these observations, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color that comes immediately before it in the series. If there is no color before it (example 1), ""bluf"" defaults to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it (or ""red"" if it is the first color word).",-1.1312724595108847,194,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the color red. No matter its position in the sequence, when ""bluf"" appears, the output is consistently ""red."" Other words in the sequences correspond to different colors, but ""bluf"" is uniquely tied to red.

Rule: bluf -> red.",-1.6880345279991145,194,bluf
"To figure out the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns:

- In all examples where ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- Regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input string, the output is consistent.

Following the pattern, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red",-1.7428692273678759,194,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following:

1. Every instance of ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"".
2. Every instance of ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" except when it is followed by another word (""zup""), then it changes the sequence to ""blue red red red"".
3. Every instance of ""dax wif walm"" leads to ""green red red red"".
4. When ""lug"" and ""dax"" are in front of ""walm"", their colors (""blue"" and ""green"" respectively) are repeated three times, followed by that color again e.g., ""lug dax walm"" leads to ""blue green green green"".

With these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the word directly before it to repeat its color three times plus one additional occurrence of that color. Since ""wif walm"" and ""dax wif walm"" start with red for ""wif,"" but the sequence is still ""red red red"" and ""green red red red"" respectively, it suggests that ""walm"" requires the word before it to output its corresponding color three additional times after its standard single occurrence.

Additionally, in the context of ""lug wif walm zup"", the presence of another word after ""walm"" changes the rule so that the sequence after ""walm"" starts again at ""red"" instead of repeating the color before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the previous word's corresponding color to repeat three additional times, for a total of four instances. When another word follows ""walm,"" the sequence is ""red"" followed by the color sequence corresponding to the next word instead of repeating the color before ""walm.""",-0.5953840836038824,194,walm
"To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of the given examples:

- When ""wif walm"" appears together, the output is ""red red red."" When ""wif"" appears without ""walm,"" it results in just ""red."" This suggests that ""walm"" extends the red output by two additional reds.
- When ""lug walm"" appears, the output is ""blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" by itself produces ""blue,"" so here ""walm"" seems to extend the ""blue"" output by two additional blues.
- When ""dax wif walm"" appears together, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" adds two more reds.
- When ""lug wif walm"" appears together, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" twice more.
- Lastly, ""lug dax walm"" produces ""blue green green green."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" two more times.

From the provided examples, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the color output directly before it to be repeated two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color word that precedes it two additional times.",-0.7156878255215297,194,walm
"Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" dictates the repetition of the color of the word that precedes it. In each instance, the word following ""walm"" is repeated the same number of times as the color associated with the word preceding ""walm"". Here's the rule applied to each example:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" since ""wif"" is red and it's followed by three ""red"".
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" is blue and it's followed by three ""blue"".
- ""dax wif walm"" leads to ""green red red red"" because ""dax"" is green and ""wif walm"" results in three ""red"".
- ""lug wif walm"" leads to ""blue red red red"" because ""lug"" is blue and ""wif walm"" results in three ""red"".
- ""lug dax walm"" leads to ""blue green green green"" because ""lug"" is blue and ""dax walm"" results in three ""green"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-0.7275520393257646,194,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's list the inputs and their corresponding outputs to look for these patterns:

1. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
3. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
4. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
5. ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green""

Analyzing the patterns and comparing the inputs with their outputs, we can infer the following:

- The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, the color associated with the word right before ""walm"" is repeated three times. Examples:

- In the sequence ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- In the sequence ""dax wif walm,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" we see only ""red"" repeated three times after ""wif walm,"" which indicates ""walm"" is causing the repetition of the color associated with ""wif.""
- In the sequence ""lug dax walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" After ""dax walm,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times, suggesting that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with ""dax.""

Given this pattern, we can conclude:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three more times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: A function that triggers the repetition of the previously mentioned color three times.",-0.9900558492787225,194,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule:

From the examples provided, the output colors corresponding to the word ""walm"" change depending on the preceding word (or words). Here is the analysis based on the input and outputs given:

1. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" (Example 1 and 3), the output for ""walm"" is a sequence of ""red"".
2. When ""lug"" is the only word before ""walm"" (Example 2 and 4), the output for ""walm"" is a sequence of ""blue"".
3. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", either alone (Example 5) or with another word before (no example given), the output for ""walm"" is assumed to be a sequence of ""green"" based on the pattern.

Therefore, the inference is that ""walm"" takes on a repeating color pattern based on the word that comes immediately before it:
- ""wif walm"" -> multiple reds
- ""lug walm"" -> multiple blues
- ""dax walm"" -> multiple greens

Rule: ""bluf"" refers to the color of the word that appears two steps back in the sequence if the same color word precedes ""bluf"" twice in a row; otherwise, it is the color of the word immediately before it.

Hence the translation of ""bluf"" follows this rule:

1. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (since ""wif"" means ""red"")
2. ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue"" (since ""lug"" means ""blue"")
3. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"" (since ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and appears twice before ""bluf"")
4. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow"" (since ""zup"" means ""yellow"")

"Based on the provided examples, each input word seems to correspond to a specific color in the output. The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. However, in the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but it is worth noting that the word ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it is possible that ""bluf"" represents ""red"" as an output, but when it is preceded by ""zup,"" it may change to ""yellow"" due to a contextual rule we can't deduce from the given information.

Therefore, the most straightforward rule based on the majority of examples is:

"Analyzing the outputs corresponding to various inputs that include the nonce word ""walm,"" the rule seems clear. Whenever ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, the output is a repetition of the color that would be output for the preceding word in the input. Here are the observations:

1. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" Hence, ""walm"" causes the output color for ""dax,"" which is green, to be repeated three times.
2. ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow,"" insinuating that after ""wif,"" which results in red, ""walm"" leads to two more repetitions of red.
3. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" gives ""blue red green green green yellow,"" indicating that after ""dax,"" which outputs green, ""walm"" triggers the repetition of green another two times.
4. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that after ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" causes a repetition of yellow another two times.
5. ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue,"" showing that ""walm"" follows the color of ""lug,"" which is blue, by repeating it twice more.

Based on these observations, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color output corresponding to the immediately preceding word in the input to be repeated two additional times in the output.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be defined as:

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Specifically, it causes the repetition of that color for the count of three or until interrupted by another word. Here is an analysis of the examples:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green.""
- In ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" twice more before ""dax"" changes it to ""green,"" followed by ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow.""
- For ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and then ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two more times (for a total of three times) until ""zup"" changes it to ""yellow.""
- In ""zup bluf lug zup walm,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and all instances of ""zup"" lead to ""yellow,"" after which ""bluf"" translates to another color (presumably ""blue""), ""lug"" returns it to ""blue,"" then ""zup"" goes back to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- Finally, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats this color three times.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times or until another word introduces a new color.

Therefore:

walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times or until another word introduces a new color.",-0.3132779895564001,195,walm
"From the examples provided, the output colors repeat in a pattern that corresponds with the position of the nonce word ""walm"" in the input. Specifically, the output color is repeated as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. For instance:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is in the second position, and the output is ""green"" twice, corresponding to ""dax"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" is in the third position, and the output is ""red"" three times, corresponding to ""wif"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" is in the fourth position, and the output is ""green"" four times, corresponding to ""dax"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is in the fifth position, and the output is all ""yellow"", and as it’s after ""zup"", we assume that ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is in the second position, and the output is ""blue"" twice, corresponding to ""lug"".

However, there is an inconsistency in the fourth example. ""Zup"" should correspond to ""yellow"" based on previous examples, but ""bluf"" has not been defined in previous examples, and the pairing for ""lug"" and ""blue"" from the fifth example doesn't match with the output ""blue red green green green yellow"" in the third example.

Assuming this inconsistency is an error in the provided data or that ""bluf"" changes the pattern behavior, and based on the other examples, we can induce the following general rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeated as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" could be:

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"", which is the color corresponding to ""dax"" repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output includes ""red red red"", which is the color corresponding to ""wif"" repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" once again and the output includes ""green green green"", which is the color corresponding to ""dax"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output includes ""yellow yellow yellow"", which is the color corresponding to ""zup"" repeated five times, possibly because ""walm"" appears once but also ""zup"" appears four times leading to a total of five yellows.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"", which is the color corresponding to ""lug"" repeated three times.

- In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the word following it, if there is one, is repeated three times in the output.
- When ""walm"" appears with no word following it, ""blue"" is repeated three times.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" implies repetition of the next word's corresponding color in the output. If there is no word following ""walm,"" the default color to repeat is ""blue."" Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

- In the first example, ""wif dax wif"" translates to ""red green red."" Since ""wif"" is consistent on both sides of ""dax"" and the corresponding colors are red, we might infer that ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green."" It is not clear from this example alone what ""walm"" or ""dax"" might mean since they both translate to ""green.""
- The third example, ""zup dax,"" turns into ""yellow green."" From this, it appears ""zup"" could translate to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is consistent, translating to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red green red red."" This suggests that ""zup"" is again ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" could translate to ""red.""
- The fifth example, ""dax lug,"" results in ""green blue."" This does not give us information about ""lug,"" but it is consistent with our theory that ""dax"" means ""green.""

- In the second example, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green."" Since ""walm"" does not appear elsewhere, we cannot directly determine what color it corresponds to, but the presence of ""dax"" and the appearance of ""green"" in the output suggests that ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

- In the third and fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""dax,"" and both times the word ""green"" follows the color that corresponds to ""zup,"" which is ""yellow."" This supports the notion that ""dax"" means ""green.""

Breaking down the above examples, consider the following observations:

- ""walm"" is followed by a repeating color in each instance.
- The color that repeats is not immediately obvious from the ""walm"" itself; rather, it seems to be related to the word that precedes ""walm.""
- Specifically:
  - When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated.
  - When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated.
  - When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" but another word (e.g., ""dax"" or ""zup"") either follows or precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated, followed by the color associated with the other word (""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup"").
  
Given these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat according to the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" If ""wif"" is involved, it may alter the pattern by inserting its associated color (""red"") until another color from a different word is introduced.

"Based on the provided examples, it's possible to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" The process involves examining the input and output pairs to match each nonce word with its corresponding color in the output. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""bluf"" provides the output ""blue,"" it seems that ""bluf"" could also mean ""blue.""

2. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to green again, and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" in this case corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   Once again, ""zup"" matches ""yellow,"" ""dax"" matches ""green,"" and ""wif"" matches ""red."" The ""bluf"" word corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   ""Zup"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can establish the following pattern:

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" ""bluf"" takes the color ""blue"" from ""lug.""
- In other instances, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it; if preceded by ""dax,"" it is ""green""; if preceded by ""zup,"" it is ""yellow""; if preceded by ""wif,"" it becomes ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. If preceded by ""lug,"" it specifically becomes ""blue,"" regardless of the preceding color.",-0.08871959261582145,197,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the occurrences:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is paired with ""blue."" Considering that ""dax"" appears to mean ""green"" and every instance of ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" it seems that ""bluf"" could be related to ""blue.""

2. The second example, however, shows ""bluf"" mapped to ""green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" does not simply mean ""blue.""

3. The third example also maps ""bluf"" to ""red,"" which makes the situation more complex as ""bluf"" appears to represent a different color each time it is used.

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" again represents ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue.""

5. The fifth example further solidifies that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" once again.

Considering that ""bluf"" translates to different colors in different contexts, one possibility is that ""bluf"" represents the color preceding it. This theory explains why ""bluf"" changes its meaning in each instance—it takes on the color mentioned immediately before it:

1. ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue **blue** green"" (bluf follows ""lug,"" which means ""blue"").
2. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green **green** yellow"" (bluf follows ""dax,"" which means ""green"").
3. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow green yellow green red **red**"" (bluf follows ""wif,"" which means ""red"").
4. ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> ""yellow **yellow** blue yellow"" (bluf follows ""zup,"" which means ""yellow"").
5. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow **yellow**"" (bluf follows ""zup,"" which means ""yellow"").

However, there is not enough information to definitively determine this rule as we do not have examples of ""bluf"" coming after a nonce word other than ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" or ""dax."" Nor do we have instances of ""bluf"" leading the sequence without a preceding color to verify this rule.

In conclusion, based on the given data and the assumption that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it, the tentative rule is:

Rule: bluf -> meaning: Takes on the meaning of the color word immediately before it.",-0.1069427875156072,197,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rules for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax,"" the output is ""blue.""
2. When ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow,"" matching the output for ""zup,"" which seems to code for ""yellow"" regardless of position.

However, these two observations conflict, as they would suggest that ""bluf"" should output ""blue"" when following ""dax"" and ""yellow"" otherwise, which is not consistent with the third example:

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Here, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and the output is ""red"" instead of ""yellow.""

So, the rules need to be modified slightly. It appears that ""bluf"" has a default output of ""yellow,"" but this changes to ""blue"" when preceded by ""dax,"" and it changes to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif."" There are no examples of ""bluf"" following any other words, so we cannot rule out the possibility of other preceding words changing the output for ""bluf.""

Summarizing the observed pattern:

Rule: 
- bluf -> ""yellow"" by default (as standalone or following ""zup"").
- bluf -> ""blue"" when it immediately follows ""dax.""
- bluf -> ""red"" when it immediately follows ""wif.""

The lack of additional context limits further extrapolation beyond these observed cases.",-0.887377052222619,197,bluf
"From examining the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" represents the color of the word that comes immediately before it. Here's how we can deduce this:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" which is the color associated with ""dax"" (since ""dax""->""green"" and ""dax bluf dax"" yields ""green blue green"").

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and again the output for ""bluf"" is ""green,"" matching the color associated with ""dax.""

3. The third example supports this as well, with ""bluf"" following ""wif"" and the output for ""bluf"" being ""red,"" consistent with the color for ""wif.""

4. The fourth example once more shows ""bluf"" taking the color of the preceding word, ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue.""

5. Finally, in the fifth example, when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" which aligns with the color for ""zup.""

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.",-0.9302048723720231,197,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the word 'walm,' let's compare input-output pairs, focusing on where 'walm' appears, and what outputs correspond to those appearances.

1. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
   'walm' here leads to three occurrences of 'blue' followed by 'red.'

2. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   'walm' here results in three occurrences of 'yellow.'

3. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
   'walm' here leads to three occurrences of 'blue' followed by 'yellow.'

4. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
   'walm' here results in three occurrences of 'red.'

5. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
   'walm' here leads to three occurrences of 'green.'

From these examples, it appears that 'walm' translates to repeating the last color mentioned three times. For example, in the first input 'lug,' which maps to 'blue,' appears before 'walm,' and the output is 'blue blue blue.' In the third input, 'lug' precedes 'walm' as well, resulting in 'blue blue blue.' However, in the fourth input, 'wif' precedes 'walm' and the output is 'red red red.'

With this in mind, we may formulate the following rule for 'walm':

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before 'walm' three times in the output.",-0.09159179203463462,197,walm
"Analyzing the different inputs and outputs provided, let's examine the position and the corresponding color for the word ""walm"":

1. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
   Here ""walm"" is surrounded by ""lug,"" which translates to blue, but the output color for ""walm"" is red.

2. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   In this case, ""walm"" is at the end and the output is yellow, which is the same color as the preceding word ""zup.""

3. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
   ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), resulting in the output color for ""walm"" being blue, which is the same as the preceding ""lug.""

4. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
   ""Walm"" is at the end and the output is red, but it is important to note that ""bluf"" is a new word and therefore cannot provide a perfect consistency for us to make a rule; ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the color red is next.

5. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" but the output color is green, matching ""dax.""

In attempting to discern a pattern, the first observation is that ""walm"" does not seem to correspond to a consistent color when considering only the word ""walm"" itself. Instead, the color for ""walm"" might be affecting or affected by the context provided by the surrounding words:
- When ""walm"" is at the end of a series (Inputs 2 and 4), the pattern is less clear. In Input 4, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and the color is red; however, in Input 2, it comes after ""zup"" and the color is yellow. 
- In the cases where ""walm"" is neither at the beginning nor at the end (Inputs 1 and 3), the color of ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it. So if the preceding word is blue, ""walm"" is blue; if the preceding word is green, then ""walm"" is green.

Based on the above observations, a tentative rule for the meaning of ""walm"" could be: 

Rule: When ""walm"" is not the last word in the sequence, the color of ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it. When ""walm"" is at the end, the pattern is not entirely clear based on the given examples, but it may be related to the color of the word that immediately precedes it or take the color red by default, as seen in Input 4.

Therefore, we can tentatively state the rule as follows:

Rule: 
- walm -> If walm is followed by any word, it takes the color of the preceding word.
- walm -> If walm is not followed by any word, there may be a default color or a relation to the preceding word that isn't clear from the examples provided.",-0.09759440276336538,197,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs.

Let's examine each example:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Given that ""wif"" appears at the end and is the only instance of ""red"" in the output, it does not seem that ""walm"" represents ""red.""

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" appears earlier as ""red."" ""Walm"" does not appear to correspond to a single color, but it extends the color before it, which is ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   The pattern that ""walm"" extends the preceding color is consistent here as ""blue"" (corresponding to ""lug"") is repeated after ""walm.""

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   ""Dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" have consistent color assignments as before. ""Bluf"" is a bit of an unknown, but looking at the ""wif walm"" pattern, it seems that once again ""walm"" is extending the color of the previous word, ""wif,"" with ""red.""

5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Consistent with the earlier examples, ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word, ""dax"" (green), instead of introducing a new color.

Based on these examples, ""walm"" seems to act as a repeater of the color indicated by the word before it. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.

Example: If the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" then ""walm"" leads to another ""blue"" in the sequence.",-0.11578668944126937,197,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that walm is dependent on the context of the words that appear before it. To deduce the meaning of walm, let's observe the patterns that occur before and after the word walm in each input-output pair:

1. In example 1 (lug walm wif lug), the word before walm is lug and the color blue follows after walm. However, in the output, after the word walm there is a series of blues followed by a red, which does not correspond simply to the preceding word lug.

2. In example 2 (lug wif dax zup walm), the word walm comes after the sequence lug, wif, dax, zup. The output is a series of three yellows right after walm, which doesn't have a simple correspondence to any of the preceding individual words either.

3. In example 3 (dax lug walm zup wif), walm follows the sequence dax, lug. The output features three blue colors followed by yellow and red, which again do not clearly follow a pattern based solely on the word immediately before walm.

4. In example 4 (dax wif zup bluf wif walm), walm follows a sequence of words with the color pattern green, red, yellow, yellow, red. In the output, there is a series of reds, indicating that it might influence an extended repetition of the color red.

5. In example 5 (dax walm zup lug dax), the word walm is following the word dax. In this case, only green is repeated three times before another color (yellow) appears.

From these examples, it appears the word walm could be influencing a repetition or a sequence that somehow pertains to the preceding colors or words. However, there does not appear to be a consistent rule about the number of repetitions or sequence alterations that walm causes. Considering the color repetition and sequence alterations, it's challenging to distill a simple rule from these examples alone.

The rule for the nonce word walm might not be readily deduceable from the given data alone, as the output after walm is not consistent in color or the number of repetitions that might be tied to it. More data or examples would be necessary to accurately deduce a clear rule or meaning for the nonce word walm.

Hence, using the provided data:

walm -> meaning. The meaning of walm cannot be conclusively determined from the data provided. It appears to influence a change or repetition in the color sequence, but the exact rule is unclear and seems to require additional context or information. Further examples where the position and surrounding words of walm are controlled would be necessary to determine a concise rule.",-0.5181488554671154,197,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let’s look at the patterns in the outputs corresponding to the instances of ""walm"" in the inputs:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""blue"" before the output turns red, suggesting ""walm"" triggers a repetition until a change occurs.
   
2. In the second example, ""walm"" results in a triple ""yellow,"" similar to the repetition in the first example, but not of the immediately preceding color, as ""zup"" was yellow but ""walm"" corresponded to three yellows.

3. In the third example, ""walm"" corresponds to a quadruple ""blue"" following ""lug"" and then a single ""yellow."" It's not immediately clear why there's a change to yellow unless we consider that ""wif"" causes a switch to ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" again leads to repetitions of ""red"" after ""wif"" has occurred a couple of times.

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" translates to a double ""green"" after ""dax,"" and since no other color follows after in the output, it seems to reinforce the repetition without further evidence of a switch.

From these observations, we can propose the following tentative rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> This word seems to indicate a repetition of the previously established color in the output. However, it continues this repetition until a condition is met (such as encountering another word which demands a change). The number of repetitions is not consistent across the examples, implying that the rule for the number may depend on context or preceding words.

Based on the varying numbers of repetitions, it can be difficult to pinpoint a concrete number of repetitions without further examples or rules governing the transitions. However, the consistent factor seems to be the action of repetition itself, possibly influenced by prior words or patterns.",-1.2745128447605771,197,walm
"From these examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is yellow, so ""bluf"" becomes yellow.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is red, so ""bluf"" becomes red.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is blue, so ""bluf"" becomes blue.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is green, so ""bluf"" becomes green.

"From the given examples, it is noticeable that the presence of ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of colors. The color before ""walm"" repeats itself a number of times after ""walm."" To determine the precise rule, let's look at each example:

- Input: wif walm
  Output: red red red
  In this case, ""wif"" yields one ""red,"" and post ""walm,"" there are two more ""red.""

- Input: wif lug walm
  Output: red blue blue blue
  Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and post ""walm,"" ""blue"" occurs three times.

- Input: lug zup walm lug
  Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  ""Zup"" gives one ""yellow,"" and post ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times before the sequence ends with a ""blue"" from ""lug."" 

- Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax

  ""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by three ""yellow,"" then the sequence continues with other colors corresponding to the remaining words.

- Input: wif bluf dax walm
  Output: red red green green green
  Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.

By observing the pattern, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows: walm repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three additional times. Hence, ""walm"" creates a sequence of three additional instances of the last mentioned color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-0.08290905210077014,198,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word multiple times. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of characters in that preceding word. Additionally, each word seems to have a color association as follows:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
  
We can then apply this understanding to the examples:

1. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""wif"" has three letters.
2. ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""lug"" has three letters so blue is repeated three times.
3. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" due to ""zup"" corresponding to yellow and having three letters, repeated three times, and ending with ""lug"" which is blue.
4. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"" because ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" thereby repeating yellow three times (since ""zup"" has three letters), followed by the color associations of the subsequent words.
5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"" because ""dax"" relates to green and ""dax"" has three letters so green is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word, and it repeats as many times as there are letters in that word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word, as many times as there are letters in that preceding word.",-0.08852818739275861,198,walm
"walm -> ""reduplicated color word that precedes it""

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is present in the input, the color word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated as many times as there are words after ""walm"", including ""walm"" itself. For example:

- ""wif walm"" has one color word (""red"") before ""walm"" and ""walm"" is the last word. So, the output is ""red"" repeated once: ""red red red"".
- ""wif lug walm"" has ""red blue"" before ""walm"" and two words -- ""lug walm"" -- after ""wif"". Since ""walm"" comes after ""lug"", which doesn't have a direct color translation here, we consider the last color word ""wif"" (red). So, the output is ""red"" repeated three times: ""red blue blue blue"".
- ""lug zup walm lug"" has ""blue yellow"" before ""walm"" and ""lug"" after ""walm"". Since ""walm"" is after ""zup"" (yellow), the output is ""yellow"" repeated four times: ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"".
- ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" has ""yellow"" before ""walm"" and ""walm"" is followed by four words. So, the output is ""yellow"" repeated five times: ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green"".
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" has ""red red green"" before ""walm"" and ""walm"" is the last word. So the output is ""green"" repeated three times: ""red red green green green"".

This output is consistent whenever ""lug"" appears. It's straightforward that ""lug"" maps directly to the color ""blue"".

Input: ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" yields Output: ""blue green green red green""

Here we see that ""lug"" is first and corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to ""green"" both times it appears, suggesting a one-to-one mapping of ""dax"" to ""green"". The word ""bluf"" does not provide a direct clue as it appears only once, but since it maps to ""green"" and follows the pattern, it might be a coincidence or part of a larger rule. The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in this sequence but more information would be needed to confirm its exact meaning.

Input: ""wif lug"" yields Output: ""red blue""

Here ""wif"" must correspond to ""red"", as in the previous example, since ""lug"" still maps to ""blue"".

- In example 3 (wif zup bluf lug), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In example 4 (dax zup walm wif), ""wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red""; however, considering that all other inputs only correspond to one color output and that there is a sequence to the colors before ""wif"", it's likely this is an anomalous example.
- In example 5 (wif bluf), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

From these observations, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in all cases where there is a clear one-to-one relationship between the input word and the output color.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red",-0.6704416495316071,199,wif
"Observing the examples, we can infer a pattern where each word corresponds to a particular color:

- ""wif"" changes color based on context (it appears as red in each output)
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it's in pair with ""wif"" and ""yellow"" when in a different context

An initially plausible rule would be that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". However, upon examining the fourth example, ""wif"" is associated with a red color in a sequence, but also triggers the word immediately preceding it (""walm"") to be denoted with the color ""yellow,"" even though ""walm"" is associated with ""green"" in other contexts.

Given this analysis, ""wif"" seems to act as a special operator that affects the color associated with the previous word, rather than simply translating to a specific color itself. If ""wif"" appears at the beginning, it defaults to red. If it appears after another word, it turns that word yellow and then ""wif"" turns red. The example with just ""wif"" and another word could imply that it turns any single preceding word red.

Rule: wif -> When ""wif"" is present, it turns red itself. If it follows another word, that preceding word turns yellow. If it precedes another word or is the only word, the following word or ""wif"" itself if alone turns red.",-1.1747228187571426,199,wif

- There are no examples showing ""bluf"" translating to a color individually, but since the output is ""yellow yellow"" and we know ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", it's likely that ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"".

3. Input: dax bluf lug wif | Output: green green blue red
4. Input: wif bluf lug     | Output: red red blue

From the above, when ""bluf"" appears, the output color that follows is always the same as the one that preceded it:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" it's ""blue,"" which followed ""lug.""
2. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf"" it's ""yellow"" again.

5. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" it's ""red"" again, before ""dax.""

In these pairs, ""bluf"" follows another word, and in the output, the color corresponding to ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word preceding it:

- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue""
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow""
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.",-0.12094589656923943,199,bluf
"After analyzing the examples provided, here's the induction I can make regarding the meaning or rule governing the nonce word ""bluf"":

In each input-output pair, ""bluf"" is associated with a color output. The color that ""bluf"" corresponds to changes depending on the word that either precedes or follows it in the sequence. Looking at the second word in each output, which is the color associated with ""bluf"":

- wif lug bluf -> red blue blue (second color blue)
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (second color yellow)
- dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red (second color green)
- wif bluf lug -> red red blue (second color red)
- wif bluf dax -> red red green (second color red)

When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is red. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output color is green, and when ""bluf"" stands alone after ""zup,"" the output color is yellow. In the case of ""lug,"" it does not seem to affect the color output of ""bluf,"" as seen in the third and fourth examples, where the color remains consistent with the preceding word.

However, since there's inconsistency in the presence of ""bluf"" with ""lug"" in the third and fourth examples, and only one example of ""bluf"" following ""zup"", the pattern for these combinations isn't clear. The most consistent rule that can be inferred from the provided examples is with ""wif"" and ""dax"".

Rule:
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", the color output for ""bluf"" becomes red.
- If ""bluf"" is preceded or followed by ""dax"", the color output for ""bluf"" becomes green.

Due to the lack of examples specifically highlighting the interactions with ""zup"" and ""lug"", or with ""bluf"" directly preceding them, I'll refrain from formalizing rules for these cases as the patterns are not solidly established.

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to be a placeholder for a color that is contextually dependent on the surrounding words, with some rules being:
- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" means red
- ""dax"" before or after ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" means green

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" directly copies the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

- In the first example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is ""blue"" again.
- In the second example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" following it results in another ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" after it repeats ""blue."" ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and thus the pattern continues.
- The fourth example repeats ""red"" with ""bluf"" proceeding after ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red"" again, followed by ""dax,"" which translates to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between the inputs containing ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is included in the output the same number of times as ""dax"".
- Whenever ""zup"" is present, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output the same number of times.
- When ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" being in the output twice as often as ""lug"" is in the input.
- When ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""red"" being present the same number of times.

Noting that ""walm"" is always followed by three colors, we can observe the following:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it results in three ""green"" outputs.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it results in three ""yellow"" outputs.
- When ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" it leads to two ""blue"" outputs.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it produces three ""red"" outputs.

Given these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" acts as a repeater for the color associated with the preceding word. Specifically:

- If ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), it repeats green three times.
- If ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), it repeats yellow three times.
- If ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), it repeats blue twice (likely because ""lug"" already leads to blue being outputted twice).
- If ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), it repeats red three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word a specified number of times. The number of repetitions seems to be three unless the preceding word already has a rule that multiplies its output, such as ""lug,"" which is why we see less repetition after ""lug walm"" (two blues instead of four).

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us consider each example and analyze the correlation between the input and output. I'll compare the color output with the presence of ""walm"" in the sentence.

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup"" produces an output of ""green green green yellow."" Here, ""dax"" seems to correlate with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" it may be associated with a pattern related to ""zup,"" but as ""walm"" appears right after ""dax,"" it takes on the ""green"" attribute.

- The second example, ""zup walm,"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""walm"" again takes on the characteristic of the word preceding it, which is ""zup.""

- In the third example, ""dax walm"" gives an output of ""green green green,"" reinforcing that ""walm"" seems to mimic the output color of the word before it, which is ""dax"" in this case.

- The fourth example, ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" results in ""green blue green blue blue blue."" It seems that ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" coming after ""lug"" also produces ""blue."" However, it's important to note that it produces ""blue blue.""

- The fifth example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" has an output of ""red red red green yellow."" Again, ""walm"" appears to take the color attribute of the word before it, which is ""wif.""

Given these observations, it would appear that ""walm"" takes on the output color of the word that precedes it and repeats it an additional time. It also appears that ""walm"" does not have a representative color of its own but rather mimics the prior word's output and adds an extra instance of that color.

Rule: walm -> Takes the color of the preceding word and doubles its occurrence in the output sequence.",-0.10716217996812502,199,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each input with ""walm.""

- ""dax walm zup"" results in ""green green green yellow.""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue green blue blue blue.""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow.""

Comparing the inputs and outputs, ""walm"" alone does not result in a consistent color in the output. Thus, its meaning is likely dependent on the word that precedes it. Let's examine each case:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is all green. We observe this in both ""dax walm zup"" and ""dax walm,"" suggesting that ""dax walm"" could mean repetition of the color green.
2. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the result is all yellow, which we see in ""zup walm,"" suggesting that ""zup walm"" could mean repetition of yellow.
3. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" we get multiple blue outputs, as seen in ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" which implies that ""lug"" contributes two blue for each occurrence and ""walm"" may mean to repeat the color of the word before it by two.
4. ""wif walm"" includes the word ""wif,"" which does not have a clear corresponding color but results in multiple reds, suggesting that ""wif walm"" also means the repetition of red.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color corresponding to the word before it.

"Based on the examples provided and the color outputs associated with each, one can try to deduce the rules governing the nonce word ""walm"" using the process of elimination and pattern recognition.

A first observation is that ""walm"" does not produce a consistent color output by itself; rather, its output seems to depend on the words around it.

1. In ""dax walm zup,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""green green green"" if we consider that ""dax"" produces ""green"" consistently in the other examples, this could indicate ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color of the word that precedes it.
2. In ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" follows with ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" earlier, this continues to support our initial theory.
3. In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" gives us ""green green green,"" and with ""dax"" being before it, and considering ""dax"" is ""green,"" it reinforces the hypothesis.
4. In ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" we notice the pattern of ""green blue green blue"" before ""walm"" and then ""blue blue"" for ""walm,"" which suggests again that ""walm"" continues the pattern of the color before it (the color for ""lug"" is ""blue"").
5. Lastly, ""wif walm dax zup,"" allows us to see ""red red red"" associated with ""walm,"" following ""wif,"" which if we assume generates ""red,"" maintains the consistency of our rule.

Therefore, from these examples, a proposed definition could be that the nonce word ""walm"" reflects or repeats the color output associated with the word directly preceding it.

Rule: walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color output of the word that comes before it.",-0.3917690622398751,199,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll look at how the output changes with and without this nonce word in the input examples. 

Considering the examples:

- When ""dax"" is in the presence of ""walm,"" the output is consistently ""green green green."" 
- When ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" the output adds a ""yellow.""
- When ""walm"" is on its own with ""zup,"" we get ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- The example with ""dax lug dax lug walm"" extends the pattern beyond the previous elements, repeating ""blue"" and suggesting that ""walm"" might repeat the color associated with the word preceding it.
- The presence of ""wif"" with ""walm"" gives red outputs, which indicates a possible pattern that's altered by ""walm.""

Given this, we can infer a rule around ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word that precedes it within the sequence. 
- If it follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- If it precedes ""zup,"" this doesn't change the output color for ""zup"" but does seem to extend or repeat the pattern of ""yellow.""
- If it follows ""lug,"" it extends the ""blue"" pattern.
- If followed by ""wif"" or paired with ""wif,"" the output is red, possibly repeating the color for ""wif"" as well.

However, in the case of ""wif walm dax zup,"" since ""wif"" isn't directly preceding ""walm,"" there is some nuance to the rule, as ""walm"" doesn't affect the following words unless directly preceding them, hence ""dax"" and ""zup"" still yield ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

So, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be linked with repeating the output color code of the word that precedes it, unless there's an intervening ""wif,"" which might introduce a red pattern.

walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeats the color output of the preceding word unless an intervening ""wif"" introduces a red pattern.",-0.6163526765991254,199,walm
