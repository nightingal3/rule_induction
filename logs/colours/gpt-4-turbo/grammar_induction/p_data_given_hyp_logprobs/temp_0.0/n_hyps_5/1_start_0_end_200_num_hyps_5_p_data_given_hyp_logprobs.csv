"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in the output across all examples.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we should look at the patterns of the examples provided. 

Each example consists of a series of inputs and corresponding color outputs. The color green seems to be related to the presence of the word ""dax."" Let's analyze the examples one by one:

1. Input: ""dax bluf zup"" -> Output: ""green green yellow""
2. Input: ""dax walm wif zup"" -> Output: ""green green green red yellow""
3. Input: ""dax"" -> Output: ""green""
4. Input: ""dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""green blue blue blue""
5. Input: ""wif dax wif lug wif"" -> Output: ""red green red blue red""

Looking closely, we can make the following observations:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the first output color is green.
- ""dax"" alone results in ""green"" as the output.
- The presence of other words in the input doesn't affect the green output related to ""dax.""
- When ""dax"" follows another word, such as ""wif,"" it is still associated with a green output.
  
Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that the color green is assigned to ""dax"" regardless of the context in which it is used. None of the other words consistently result in a green output, nor does their presence before ""dax"" change the output associated with ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. 

Thus, dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" When presented alone or with other nonce words, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Other nonce words, such as ""dax"" and ""zup,"" correspond to other colors—dax corresponds to ""green"" and zup to ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- The presence of the word ""zup"" leads to a repetition of the color word that immediately follows it, up to three times.
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

Now let's confirm this with the inputs and outputs:

1. ""zup wif lug zup walm""
   - The first ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" which means ""red,"" and following our rule, it should be repeated. The output is ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" here does not correspond correctly with the rule.
   
2. ""lug zup lug""
   - ""zup"" is between two ""lug"" (blue). Following our rule, there should be a repetition, and indeed, the output is ""blue yellow blue,"" confirming our rule for this example.
   
3. ""lug bluf zup lug""
   - By the rule, the ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" translating to ""blue."" The output indeed shows a repetition: ""blue blue yellow blue.""
   
4. ""zup bluf""
   - Here ""zup"" is directly followed by ""bluf"" (blue), leading to the expected repetition shown in the output as ""yellow yellow.""
   
5. ""wif walm zup walm""
   - ""walm"" (yellow) is repeated after ""zup,"" and the output is ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" did cause a repetition of ""walm"" (yellow) as per our rule, but there seems to be an additional red.

However, the first example diverges from this rule, which indicates a possible discrepancy. Re-analyzing, it seems that ""zup"" may lead to the next color word repeating, but the number of repetitions and the color that ""zup"" translates to is not clear from the inconsistent first example.

Thus, while the general rule seems to be that ""zup"" causes a repetition of the subsequent color word, the exact meaning of ""zup"" is not consistent with the rule according to the examples provided.

Possible rule considering all examples except the first one: 
Rule: ""zup"" causes the next color word to repeat two extra times, and ""zup"" itself translates to ""yellow.""

However, the first example contradicts this rule, as ""zup"" does not yield ""yellow"" there. We need more consistent data to refine the rule further correctly.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each input sequence corresponds to a sequence of colors in the output. There is a consistent mapping between certain input words and specific colors in the output. The nonce word ""bluf"" has been used in various positions in the input sequences, and in each case, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue in the output, regardless of its position. Therefore, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" is as follows:

bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the color blue in the output.
From the given examples, we can infer a rule about the meaning of ""walm"" by analyzing each sentence and their outputs:

1. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red
   The appearance of ""dax"" yields ""green,"" and ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in a repetition of the color resulting from ""dax"" (green), until a new word (""wif"") appears, after which ""walm"" causes a shift to a third repetition of a new color (""red"").

2. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and following ""wif"" with ""walm"" results in repeating ""red."" ""Lug"" at the end changes it to ""blue.""

3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm,"" which causes a repetition of ""yellow.""

4. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""; ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats ""yellow."" ""Dax"" changes the color to ""green,"" and then ""zup"" returns to ""yellow."" Following ""dax"" is ""wif,"" which changes the color to ""red.""

5. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
   ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug,"" which changes the color to ""blue."" ""Walm"" after ""lug"" results in repeating ""blue.""

From the patterns observed, it seems that ""walm"" acts as a repeater for the color designated by the word that immediately precedes it, persisting until a new color-inducing word appears. When ""walm"" follows a word that corresponds to a color, it means continue to output that color until a different word dictates a change.

Rule: walm -> ""repeat the output color associated with the preceding word.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following relationships between the input and output:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The word ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"" but ""yellow"" in other contexts; possibly it corresponds to ""yellow"" by default, but when preceded by ""lug"" it becomes ""blue.""

Given these observations, we can formulate the rule:
Rule: dax -> green

Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red.""

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red yellow,"" and we can see that ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" in the sequence.
- In the second example, ""wif"" alone corresponds directly to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif zup bluf wif dax,"" the output is ""red yellow yellow red green."" Here, both instances of ""wif"" correlate with ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif lug,"" the output is ""red blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" once again.
- In the fifth example, just like the second, ""wif"" alone again outputs ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

zup -> yellow

Rule:
Whenever ""zup"" is encountered in the input, it should be translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". Here is an analysis of the given input-output examples:

1. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
   Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" repeats the color (yellow).

2. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: red red yellow yellow red
   Explanation: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" repeats red; ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" repeats yellow.

3. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
   Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" repeats the color (red).

4. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
   Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""bluf"" repeats the color (green).

5. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow red green red red
   Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and the second ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to red red (because ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it, red).

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" we can look for patterns in the examples and how the occurrence of ""walm"" in the input affects the output. 

In all examples, the appearance of ""walm"" leads to a sequence of ""red"" in the output, with the number of ""red"" directly following a ""walm"" increasing by one with each additional occurrence of ""walm"" within the same input.

- Example 1 (""wif lug dax walm"") results in ""red blue green green green."" There is only one ""walm"" and it correlates with three ""green"" in the output. This example by itself does not seem to fit with the rest, possibly indicating that the output may be erroneous or that there is additional context we are missing.
  
- Example 2 (""dax lug walm zup wif"") results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" The single occurrence of ""walm"" here gives us two ""blue"".

- Example 3 (""wif walm zup walm"") results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Here we see two instances of ""walm"" and each one leads to an additional ""red"" in the sequence.

- Example 4 (""dax wif walm"") results in ""green red red red."" A single ""walm"" correlates with two subsequent ""red"".

- Example 5 (""lug wif walm"") results in ""blue red red red."" Again, a single ""walm"" is followed by two ""red"".

Given the inconsistency with example 1, but a consistent pattern in examples 2-5, it is reasonable to conclude that ""walm"" causes the subsequent word to be repeated at least once. The first example may simply not follow the same rule or it could be an error or exception.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the color word that immediately follows it in the output is repeated depending on the number of times ""walm"" has appeared in the sequence, increasing by one each time it is seen.

walm -> the following color word in the output is repeated, with the number of repetitions increasing with each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Regardless of the context or surrounding words, ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word (except ""dax"") corresponds to a specific color:

- bluf -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

In every example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""dax"" always results in the output ""green"". Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by analyzing the input and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug wif dax => Output: blue red green
2. Input: zup lug wif => Output: yellow blue red
3. Input: wif => Output: red
4. Input: dax bluf wif => Output: green green red
5. Input: zup wif lug wif => Output: yellow red blue red

Looking at the third example where only ""wif"" is present in the input, the output is ""red"". This suggests that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"".

Checking the other examples, whenever ""wif"" appears, the corresponding part of the output is indeed ""red"". This correspondence holds true across all provided examples.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

Input: zup lug zup dax -> Output: yellow blue yellow green
Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
Input: zup -> Output: yellow
Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue

From the examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look at the patterns presented in the examples and the resulting outputs.

In the first example, the presence of ""bluf"" results in ""blue red red"" at the end of the output:
Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output is ""red red yellow"":
Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow

In the third example, ""lug"" repeats twice, and after ""bluf,"" we see the pattern ""blue blue"" in the output:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is in the second position and results in ""yellow red"" in the output:
Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""blue red"":
Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:
- ""bluf"" results in ""blue"" followed by ""red"" and then one or more repetitions of the color corresponding to the word immediately following ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" is the last word or not followed by a recognized color word (such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""dax""), then the pattern is simply ""blue red.""

Therefore, based on the examples given, the rule for ""bluf"" can be written as:
Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" followed by ""red"" and the color indicated by the word that comes after ""bluf"" (if applicable). If no color-indicating word follows ""bluf,"" ""blue red"" is the final pattern.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the examples given and look for patterns in the corresponding outputs:

1. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" correlates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" If ""walm"" meant a color on its own, we would expect a single color in the output; however, there are three ""yellow"" outputs after ""walm,"" indicating that ""walm"" might be affecting the color of the words following it.

2. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" correlates with green, and with ""walm"" following it, the green repeats, suggesting that ""walm"" might be a repeat function.

3. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" correlates with yellow, and again ""walm"" is associated with repeating that color.

4. ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue."" After ""lug,"" which correlates with blue, ""walm"" seems to repeat the blue.

5. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" ""Walm"" after ""zup"" appears to repeat the yellow.

Considering the consistent pattern across the examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat until a different color word appears or the sequence ends.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,2
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

1. In the first example, ""lug"" appears between ""dax"" which becomes green and ""wif"" which becomes red. ""Lug"" is output as blue.
2. In the second and third examples, ""lug"" directly translates to blue.
3. In the fourth example, ""lug"" again translates to blue, being surrounded by ""bluf"" and ""dax"" which have their own color translations.
4. In the fifth example, ""lug"" once again is output as blue, surrounded by ""bluf"" and ""zup,"" all following their consistent color mappings.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given context, regardless of its position in the sequence of words. There is no variation in the output when ""dax"" is encountered in the input.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, here are the consistent patterns observed:

- The word ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red.""
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""red blue blue.""
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""yellow.""

It seems that each word has a designated color or sequence of colors associated with it. Since the task is to deduce the meaning of ""wif"" specifically:

wif -> meaning: The word ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule:
- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears as an input, the output is the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each instance of ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze its occurrences and the corresponding outputs:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Here ""bluf"" appears twice, and the outputs are ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

2. In the second example, ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow."" The presence of ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""zup bluf dax"" outputs ""yellow yellow green."" Here ""bluf"" is associated with the second ""yellow"" again.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" is associated with the second ""yellow.""

Observing these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" outputs a color based on its position or surrounding context. However, it is not entirely consistent. Alternatively, ""bluf"" could be outputting the color that matches the color word just before its position. To verify this, let's look at the given outputs when ""bluf"" appears:

- In the first example, before the first ""bluf,"" there is ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" but the output is ""green."" Before the second ""bluf,"" there is a ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" but the output is ""blue.""

- In the second example, before ""bluf,"" there is ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow.""

- In the third example, before ""bluf,"" there is also ""zup"" with the output ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, there's only ""zup"" before ""bluf,"" and it also translates to ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, before ""bluf"" there is ""zup,"" which correlates with ""yellow,"" and the output is again ""yellow.""

Given the inconsistency in the first example and the consistent matching of ""zup"" before ""bluf"" in other instances, it's challenging to determine an absolute rule for ""bluf"" without additional context.

However, based on the examples provided, the most consistent observation is that ""bluf"" follows the color of the word just before it, except when it follows ""dax."" It appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color ""yellow"" directly after ""zup."" Unfortunately, there is not enough information to understand why ""bluf"" results in ""green"" and ""blue"" in the first example, apart from the possibility that the context with ""wif"" and ""dax"" before ""bluf"" triggers different colors.

Given these observations, a tentative rule could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" outputs the color word that directly precedes it, with a possible exception or different rule when following ""wif"" and ""dax.""

Since the rule is not conclusive, additional data would be helpful for a more accurate determination of the meaning of ""bluf.""
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the pattern for the nonce word ""walm."" We'll look at the commonalities in each instance it appears.

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue,"" where the word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup."" We see three greens corresponding to the first two words then a shift in colors.

- In the second example, ""dax walm wif walm"" becomes ""green green green red red red."" Here ""walm"" is following ""dax"" and is both preceded and followed by ""wif."" This results in three greens again followed by reds for the ""wif walm"" sequence.

- In the third example ""lug walm wif lug bluf” transforms to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" The word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and again is followed by ""wif."" This maintains a consistent pattern of three similar colors corresponding to ""lug walm"" and then a shift for ""wif.""

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"" aligning with the previous pattern of three similarly colored outputs following the initial word.

- The fifth example is ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" which turns into ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Here, we have only two colors following ""dax zup"" before ""walm,"" and then after ""walm wif walm,"" we have three reds.

Putting these observations together, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule:
When ""walm"" follows a word, that word's color is repeated three times. When it follows other colors, it seems to induce a pattern or switch consistent with the word that follows ""walm."" If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" red follows. If it's at the end or not followed by ""wif,"" the original color pattern continues.

Hence, ""walm"" seems to mean a repetition of the previous color three times if it stands next to a color word or a switch in pattern/series if followed by certain other words (like ""wif"").

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color blue in every given example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the relationship between the input and output pairs. Let's line up each of the original input nonce words with their corresponding color outputs:

1. lug walm zup wif          -> blue blue blue yellow red
2. zup bluf wif dax wif zup  -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
3. wif dax wif bluf zup wif  -> red green red red yellow red
4. dax lug wif bluf          -> green blue red red
5. wif walm                  -> red red red

For each input, ""wif"" corresponds to different colors in the output:

- In input 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In input 2, ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" and the second ""red.""
- In input 3, ""wif"" corresponds to every ""red.""
- In input 4, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In input 5, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" represents the color ""red"" in the output. 

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" translates directly to the word ""yellow"" regardless of the context it's used in. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output in a corresponding position. The presence of other words in the input results in additional colors in the output, but the appearance of ""zup"" consistently results in the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red red"". Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" can be defined as:

bluf -> red red
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". The pattern can be supported by the following observations:

- In example 1, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
- In example 2, the same input as example 1 yields the same output, reinforcing the initial assessment.
- In example 3, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow"". The ""walm"" here follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In example 4, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". After ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" follows and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In example 5, ""zup lug walm"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue"". The ""walm"" again follows ""lug"" which is ""blue"", resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times.

Based on the above observations, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" each time it is used.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There is no indication that ""dax"" changes meaning depending on context or position, as it always results in ""green"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of a sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to find a consistent pattern from the given examples. Let's look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify the pattern.

1. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   
2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   
3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   
4. Input: zup dax wif zup
   Output: yellow green red yellow
   
5. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red

From examples 1 and 3, we can see that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red."" However, in example 2, ""wif"" appears towards the end of the input, yet ""red"" precedes the last word's output ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" is not just the word ""red"" but could potentially impact the positioning of colors in the output.

In examples 4 and 5, both contain the sequence ""zup dax wif"" which consistently translates to ""yellow green red."" This confirms our initial observation that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Additionally, there does not seem to be an impact on the word that follows ""wif,"" as seen in example 4 where ""zup"" following ""wif"" remains ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, we conclude that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red,"" and there is no evidence in the given examples of ""wif"" having additional contextual dependency.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". There is no context in which ""zup"" corresponds to a different output, regardless of whether ""zup"" is repeated or accompanied by other words (""wif"", ""dax"", ""walm""). 

Hence, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with the color ""red"". However, the number of repetitions of the color in the output seems influenced by the position of ""bluf"" in the input in conjunction with the words around it. Specifically, ""bluf"" produces a number of ""red""s equal to the total count of words following it.

Let's analyze each example following this observation:

1. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   ""Bluf"" is followed by no words, hence there are no reds following.

2. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   Repeat of the first example; same rule applies.

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   ""Bluf"" is followed by 2 words (""wif"" and ""zup""), thus there are 2 reds after ""green"".

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   ""Bluf"" is followed by 3 words (""dax"", ""walm"", and another occurrence of ""walm""), therefore there are 3 reds after the first red.

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   ""Bluf"" is followed by 3 words (""wif"", ""walm"", and another occurrence of ""walm""), hence there are 3 reds after the first two colors.

By these observations, we can formulate the general rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" repeated as many times as there are words following it in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, walm seems to lead to the output of three reds in a row, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Let's analyze the input and output sequences:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

5. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

In each case, the occurrence of ""walm"" correlates with the appearance of three consecutive red outputs, suggesting that ""walm"" translates to a rule causing this pattern.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the output will include three consecutive ""red"" regardless of other input words or their order.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax zup
    ",Output: green yellow green yellow,green yellow green yellow,True,5
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Rule: dax -> green

The examples suggest that the word ""dax"" is consistently being translated to the color green, regardless of its position in the input.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

- ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow""
- ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow""
- ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue""
- ""zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow green red""
- ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow""

It appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first look for patterns in each example provided.

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. lug dax bluf -> blue green green
3. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
4. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
5. wif bluf -> red red

Looking at the outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" is associated with a repeated color. Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output color is repeated.

- In the first example, ""yellow"" follows ""bluf.""
- In the second and third examples, ""green"" follows ""bluf.""
- In the fourth example, ""green"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""blue"" follows it.
- In the fifth example, ""red"" is repeated after ""bluf.""

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it, if any, and if ""bluf"" is the first word or no word precedes it, then the color after ""bluf"" is repeated.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word is repeated; if ""bluf"" is at the beginning or has no preceding color word, the color of the following word is repeated.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the presence of the word in each input and the corresponding output colors.

- When ""walm"" is present, the output is a sequence of three colors.
- The specific color in the output corresponds to the word preceding ""walm.""

Here's what we can infer from each example:

1. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green: ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by three ""yellows,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow: ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" which is followed by three ""blues,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow: Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and then ""wif."" Each occurrence of ""walm"" is followed by three colors corresponding to the word before it: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by three ""greens,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by three ""reds.""

4. lug walm -> blue blue blue: ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is three ""blues.""

5. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow: ""Walm"" follows both ""wif"" and ""zup,"" with the output being three ""reds"" and three ""yellows"" respectively.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the output to be three repetitions of the color associated with the word that comes right before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,6
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In all the examples provided, each time the word ""lug"" is used, it is translated to the color ""blue."" Therefore, the word ""lug"" consistently means ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" and the other words. Let's examine each input-output pair:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Explanation: The word ""dax"" alone results in the color ""green"".

2. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Explanation: This is a repetition of the first example, reinforcing that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"".

3. Input: dax lug dax
   Output: green blue green
   Explanation: The word ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to ""green"" both times. The word ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue"". Since ""dax"" still maps to ""green"", the rule seems consistent.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once again. The word ""wif"" appears twice and maps to ""red"" each time. ""lug"" still maps to ""blue"". The word ""walm"" appears twice, and it corresponds to ""red"" the first time and ""blue"" the second time. ""zup"" appears once and maps to ""yellow"". We cannot derive a consistent rule for ""walm"" based on this information alone since it maps to two colors.

5. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   Explanation: ""dax"" once again corresponds to ""green"". The new word ""bluf"" is presented with the output ""green"", suggesting ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"". ""wif"" retains its mapping to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Based on these examples, we can induce the following rules:

Rule:
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

We do not have a consistent mapping for ""walm""; further examples would be needed to determine its rule. Additionally, ""bluf"" seems to mean ""green"", like ""dax"".
Analyzing the examples given:

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"", and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

2. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   In this sequence, ""wif"" is the last word and translates to the last color ""red.""

3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   ""Wif"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and followed by ""bluf,"" which doesn't directly correspond to a color, possibly an error or a non-color related term. However, ""wif"" still translates to ""red"".

4. Input: wif
   Output: red
   ""Wif"" is the only word and it translates to ""red.""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""Wif"" is the first word and translates to the first color ""red.""

The consistent translation of ""wif"" across the examples is ""red,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the words that follow it.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
In the given examples, the outputs are composed of color names that correspond to some aspect of the inputs. Analyzing the patterns:

- The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"",
- The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"",
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"", and
- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".

In every instance, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that came before it. Here's the breakdown:

- In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""zup"" gives ""yellow"" and the following ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow"" before ""wif"" changes the color to ""red"".
- In ""lug zup bluf dax"", ""zup"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) but gives ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" repeats the ""yellow"" before ""dax"" changes it to ""green"".
- In ""lug bluf wif"", ""lug"" gives ""blue"" and ""bluf"" repeats ""blue"", and then ""wif"" changes the color to ""red"".
- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" gives ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow"".
- In ""zup bluf dax lug"", ""zup"" gives ""yellow"", ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow"", ""dax"" changes to ""green"", and ""lug"" changes to ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it causes the preceding color to be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the preceding color name.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must compare the outputs for each input and identify the relation between the word ""walm"" and the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze the given examples:

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" alone generates a single ""red,"" but when followed by ""walm,"" it results in two additional ""red."" It seems ""walm"" has repeated the color associated with the preceding word.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The ""green"" appears three times after ""walm,"" which follows ""dax."" The extra ""green"" could be because of ""walm."" ""Wif"" at the end goes back to a single ""red,"" which suggests ""walm"" affects only the word immediately before it.

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
- ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and results in triple ""green,"" and then the pattern continues normally with ""zup"" yielding ""yellow"" and ""lug"" resulting in ""blue."" This supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word right before it.

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- The sequence has ""dax"" twice, with ""walm"" after the second ""dax."" Again, the output is triple ""green"" following that ""dax,"" suggesting ""walm"" continues to repeat the color of the word that precedes it.

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- The word ""wif"" generates ""red,"" and the sequence continues with different colors for the other words until ""zup walm,"" after which ""yellow"" is repeated three times. This is consistent with the idea that ""walm"" is repeating the color produced by the word just before it.

Based on the consistent pattern across all examples, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" two additional times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color output produced by that word is repeated twice more, resulting in a total of three consecutive instances of that color in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True,7
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, where the input ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red,"" regardless of the presence of another word (as in ""zup wif"" producing ""yellow red""), we can induce that:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. Analyzing the instances where ""zup"" is used, we can determine its meaning:

In the first example, the sequence ""zup lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow red green."" We can see that ""zup"" appears twice and corresponds to the color ""yellow"" each time.

The second example only contains the word ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow,"" reinforcing that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

The third and fourth examples include ""zup"" among other words, and every time ""zup"" appears, it is translated to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" seems consistent across all examples, representing the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output. 

- In the first example ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" causes red to be repeated: red red.
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats this color before ""dax"" turns the sequence to green, followed by ""lug,"" which adds blue.
- In the third example, there is only ""dax"" before ""bluf,"" so green is repeated because of ""bluf"": green green.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""bluf"" causes the red to be repeated once more: red red.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" leads to green, ""bluf"" repeats the green, and then ""zup"" adds yellow to the sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" it is necessary to compare the inputs and outputs, looking for the correlation between the presence of ""walm"" and the output pattern:

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  (The word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times.)

- Input: zup wif walm
  Output: yellow red red red
  (The word ""walm"" is at the end and the output ends with ""red"" repeated three times.)

- Input: lug walm wif
  Output: blue blue blue red
  (The word ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times, followed by a ""red."")

- Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
  Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
  (Here ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup,"" each time the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times.)

- Input: zup dax walm
  Output: yellow green green green
  (The word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" within the input pattern, the output is ""green"" repeated three times, which aligns with the first case.)

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, each appearance of the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. It doesn't seem to matter where ""lug"" appears in the input or what other words accompany it; the output consistently includes ""blue"" for every instance of ""lug.""

Thus, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> meaning. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Here is the breakdown:

- Input: wif dax -> Output: red green (wif corresponds to ""red"")
- Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red (wif corresponds to ""red"" both times)
- Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red (wif corresponds to ""red"")
- Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow (wif corresponds to ""red"")
- Input: wif -> Output: red (wif corresponds to ""red"")

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""zup"" is always translated to ""yellow."" The other words (""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf"") appear to correspond to other colors: ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" possibly to ""green"" as well, given the last example.

So, we can conclude:
zup -> yellow

Rule: In the given context, the word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples, it seems that each distinct word corresponds to a unique color:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

However, looking closely at the examples specifically for the usage of ""bluf,"" there are instances where ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" and the color ""red."" Therefore, ""bluf"" must have a rule differentiating when it translates to ""green"" and when to ""red.""

By closely examining the patterns, we can infer the following rules for ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""dax,"" it corresponds to the color ""green.""
- In all other instances, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" only when it is immediately followed by ""dax."" Otherwise, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it thrice. Here is the rule derived from the examples:

Rule: walm -> meaning. Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

- In ""dax walm,"" the color for ""dax"" is green, so ""walm"" causes it to be repeated thrice resulting in ""green green green.""
- In ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and its color is red, so ""walm"" makes it ""red red red,"" followed by the colors for ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow).
- In ""dax walm wif dax,"" ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" thus ""walm"" turns into ""green green green,"" and the rest follow their colors respectively.
- In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" ""lug"" is before ""walm,"" which becomes ""blue blue blue,"" and so on with the other colors.
- In ""wif walm zup walm,"" ""wif"" precedes the first ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red,"" and ""zup"" precedes the second ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following correlations:

- Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- The word ""lug"" is not modified by any other words in its vicinity; its presence in the input consistently results in ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the other words present.
- The word ""lug"" does not appear to change in meaning based on position or frequency in a sequence.

Given this information, we can state the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, I can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. The other words seem to be consistent with specific colors as well (lug -> blue, walm -> blue blue blue, wif -> red), but the question specifically asks for the meaning of ""dax."" Therefore, from the given data, we can induce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in each output. Hence, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every time ""zup"" appears, the output includes the color yellow.
To determine what the nonce word ""bluf"" means, we should look for patterns in the examples provided.

1. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

2. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

5. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

Now let's analyze:

- For the input ""dax bluf"", the output is ""green green"". Since ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" and it's the same before and after ""bluf,"" this suggests ""bluf"" may mean ""green.""
- However, for the input ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" also gets the output ""yellow,"" which contradicts the previous conclusion if we consider ""bluf"" as a fixed color.
- The post-""bluf"" inputs seem to affect the color output, too. After ""bluf,"" we have ""dax"" which matches its pre-""bluf"" color ""green."" The same pattern happens with ""zup"" where its post-""bluf"" color is again ""yellow.""
   
Based on these observations, it seems like ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it. In other words, ""bluf"" functions as a chameleon word – it assumes the color representation of the next word mentioned in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the following word in the sequence. If there is no word after ""bluf,"" it takes the color based on the previous word before ""bluf.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns in the presented examples. Analyzing the input-output pairs, here's the breakdown:

1. The word before ""walm"" in the input dictates the color repeated thrice in the output.
2. The word ""wif"" when present in the input, results in the color ""red"" being added to the output.

Given the examples:

- ""lug walm wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red,"" where ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" as a triplet and ""wif"" adds ""red.""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" meaning ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in threes.
- ""zup walm wif"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" again ""zup"" for ""yellow"" repeated and ""wif"" leading to a ""red"" addendum.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" indicating ""dax"" is responsible for the ""green"" triplet.
- ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow,"" which suggests the position of ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in ""red"" triplets, and ""zup"" following ""walm"" results in ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated thrice in the output. If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" an additional ""red"" is added to the end of the color sequence.

Hence, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context is a placeholder that causes the preceding color word to repeat three times in the output, with the possibility of appending ""red"" if followed by ""wif."" 

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Placeholder for the repetition of the preceding color word thrice, with an optional red addendum.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif means red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's look for patterns in the provided input-output pairs.

In the first example, ""lug walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"". Then, ""zup wif"" produces ""red yellow red"". It appears that in this context, ""zup"" is not modifying the color immediately following it, as ""wif"" on its own also translated to ""red"" when not following ""zup"". So this example does not offer a clear single translation for ""zup"".

In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and when ""zup"" is added, we see ""blue yellow"". In the third example, ""wif"" by itself means ""red"", but when ""zup"" is added, it again gives us ""yellow"". This pattern suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", as it is the added color in both cases.

Finally, in the last two examples, the input ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow"" for output. ""Bluf"" is not available in the first two pairs, so we don't have a translation for it, but the presence of ""zup"" still leads to ""yellow"" appearing as the first color.

Considering these points, the most consistent meaning of ""zup"" across the examples is that it translates to ""yellow"". 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be discerned by looking at the output in the corresponding positions. It is clear that ""bluf"" does not always result in the same output color, which suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the context of its use, rather than representing a specific color itself. A pattern can be inferred through the examination of the relationship between the input and output.

Here's the analysis of each instance:

1. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
4. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
5. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red

One pattern that becomes apparent is that the word ""bluf"" appears to take on the color of the word that immediately precedes it:

1. ""lug zup bluf"" -> ""blue yellow yellow""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
4. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
5. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it assumes the color of the word immediately before it. 

Rule: bluf -> assumes the color of the previous word.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be functioning as a repeater for the word that comes immediately before it. More specifically, when ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the color represented by the word before ""walm"" is outputted as many times as the total number of words that follow the initial word and precede ""walm,"" plus one time for the initial word itself.

Let's consider each example:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""lug"" with no other words in between, we get ""blue"" repeated 1 (for ""lug"") + 1 (for ""walm"") = 2 times in the output.

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and there are two instances of ""zup"" before ""walm,"" so we get ""yellow"" repeated 3 (for ""zup"" instances) + 1 (for ""walm"") = 4 times in the output.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""dax"" directly, we get ""green"" repeated 1 (for ""dax"") + 1 (for ""walm"") = 2 times in the output.

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
   ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and there is one instance of ""zup"" before ""walm,"" so we get ""yellow"" repeated 1 (for ""zup"") + 1 (for ""walm"") = 2 times in the output before returning to ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
   ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""walm"" appears with no additional words in between, we get ""red"" repeated 1 (for ""wif"") + 1 (for ""walm"") = 2 times in the output before the sequence continues with ""dax"" and ""zup.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word a number of times equal to the total number of words that come after the initial word and precede ""walm,"" plus one more time for the initial word itself.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup lug dax
    ",Output: red yellow blue green,red yellow blue green,True,11
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples, regardless of the other words present in the input.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input is directly translated to ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the context in which it appears.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the input-output pairs:

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red
- Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" at both the start and end of the sequence.

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green
- Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" at the beginning and when it reappears.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" once more.

Input: wif
Output: red
- ""Wif"" alone also corresponds to ""red"".

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" also seems to correspond to ""red"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems straightforward:
Rule: wif -> red

Every appearance of ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup translates to the color yellow. The word 'walm' seems to cause the previous word's color to repeat, which is why in the example ""zup walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". The word 'dax' seems to translate to the color green, and 'lug' to blue. The repetition rule applies regardless of what the previous color is, as seen in ""wif walm dax zup"", where 'wif' is red and the repetition of 'walm' causes red to appear three times before moving on to 'dax', which changes the color to green, followed by 'zup', which is yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the patterns in the given inputs and outputs.

We have the following pairs:

1. Input: ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
   - Before and after ""bluf,"" there is ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively. ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: ""lug bluf""
   Output: ""blue blue""
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

3. Input: ""wif dax zup bluf""
   Output: ""red green yellow yellow""
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" in this case also corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: ""wif bluf""
   Output: ""red red""
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" in this case also corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm""
   Output: ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" and so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" here.

Based on these examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word. Thus, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" represents the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes the same color meaning as the word that comes before it.
Based on the examples given and their corresponding outputs, we can try to deduce the rule for the word ""walm.""

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
Rule observed: The word ""wif"" translates to a single ""red."" The presence of ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""red"" thrice.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Rule observed: The word ""dax"" translates to a single ""green."" When followed by ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated thrice.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
Rule observed: ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" Following them with ""walm"" causes the last color mentioned to be repeated two additional times, for a total of three.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Rule observed: As previously seen, ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in three greens.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
Rule observed: ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" gives us three greens, and then ""wif"" is introduced after ""walm,"" which gives us two reds.

Looking carefully at the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" is a modifier that causes the last color mentioned before it to be repeated two more times, giving a total of three repetitions of the last mentioned color. It does not appear to matter what other words come after ""walm""; it only affects the last color mentioned prior to it.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the last mentioned color two additional times (for a total of three repetitions of that color).

Rule:
If X is a color word, and X walm is the input, then the output is X X X. If X and Y are color words, and X Y walm is the input, then the output is X Y Y Y.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,12
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color 'blue' in every given example, regardless of position or other words present.
Rule: dax -> green

The rule seems to be that every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the words that surround it.
Based on the examples given where ""wif"" corresponds to a particular color in the output:

- ""zup dax wif zup"" translates to ""yellow green red yellow,"" indicating the ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow,"" where both instances of ""wif"" correspond to ""red.""
- ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red,"" here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red.""
- ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" again with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we can compare the input and output of each example.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Analyzing the inputs where ""zup"" appears and the corresponding output, we can see that whenever ""zup"" is present, the first color in the output is ""yellow."" Therefore, we can infer that the nonce word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's compare the inputs and outputs:

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

From this, we can't directly deduce what ""bluf"" means because ""lug"" also appears in other sequences without a consistent corresponding output color.

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""blue"" in the output which is between ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green). This doesn't immediately clarify ""bluf""'s meaning, but let's continue analyzing.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

In these two inputs, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"" which follows ""zup"" (yellow) and is preceded by ""dax"" (green). 

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

This input/output is the same as the previous, giving us no new information about ""bluf"".

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green

Here ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"" which follows ""dax"" (green) and is before ""wif"" (red), and there is no ""zup"" (yellow) before or after ""bluf"".

Based on these inputs and outputs, we can deduce that ""bluf"" means ""the same color as the word just before it"":

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" means the same color as the preceding word.
By examining the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs, we can infer a rule regarding the nonce word ""walm"". The first thing to notice is that whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, it produces three instances of ""blue"" in the output.

Let's observe the pattern closely:

- In the first and third examples, ""dax lug walm"" maps to ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" We notice that ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" again gives ""blue,"" ""wif"" yields ""red,"" and ""walm"" stands for three consecutive ""yellow"" in the output before ""lug"" but is preceded by a ""zup."" Therefore, ""walm"" could potentially be affected by the preceding word, though we need more examples to confirm this.
- The fourth example is complex, but we can still find the pattern for ""walm"" by looking at the individual parts: ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" ""zup lug wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red,"" and ""walm zup"" leads to ""red red red yellow,"" adding further weight to the hypothesis that ""walm"" by itself corresponds to three instances of the preceding color word.
- The final example ""lug walm"" confirms the recurring pattern because ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" followed by three more ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it seems clear that ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of the color caused by the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif walm
    ",Output: blue red red red,blue red red red,True,13
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: 
Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is included in the output. If ""lug"" is the only word in the input, the output is only ""blue."" If other words are present in the input, ""blue"" is included in the output sequence, with other colors corresponding to those other words as well.
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs provided.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the Output. Here's how the correlation looks across all examples:

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: lug zup dax wif -> Output: blue yellow green red
Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red

Every occurrence of ""wif"" is matched with ""red"" in the Output, regardless of its position within the input sequence. Hence, the rule can be defined as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow regardless of the position or context within the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples given:

1. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" converts to ""yellow yellow red red"". From this, we infer ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". Importantly, ""bluf"" is repeated twice, resulting in the word it translates to also being repeated twice.

2. ""zup bluf"" converts to ""yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", and the output is ""yellow"" followed by another ""yellow"", reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color word.

3. ""dax wif bluf"" converts to ""green red red"". Following the established rules, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" again repeats the color word before it, in this case ""red"".

4. ""zup bluf dax lug"" converts to ""yellow yellow green blue"". The sequence shows that ""bluf"" following ""zup"" results in another ""yellow"", and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"". ""bluf"" does not follow ""dax"" directly, so it does not affect ""green"".

5. ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" converts to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green"", indicating that ""bluf"" repeated the ""green"". Later on, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and it results in an additional ""yellow"".

The emerging rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color word that immediately precedes it. If ""bluf"" follows a color word, the corresponding color word is repeated once in the output.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the preceding color word.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to induce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

In every example where ""walm"" appears, the output is a series of the color ""red"" repeated multiple times.

- Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red  
- Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow  
- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue  
- Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red  
- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow  

Let's analyze the outputs with respect to ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, the color ""red"" appears multiple times at the end of the output string, corresponding to the position of ""walm"", with one ""red"" for each occurrence of ""walm"".

2. The number of ""red"" colors seems to correspond to the position of ""walm"" in the input list, starting from the right. For example: 

- In ""lug wif walm"", ""walm"" is the third word from the right, hence there are three ""red""s in the output.  
- In ""wif walm zup"", ""walm"" is the second word from the right, hence there are two ""red""s in the output. In this case, however, there is a ""yellow"" that follows because ""zup"" appears after ""walm"". This suggests that ""walm"" does not influence the word that comes after it in the sequence.  
- ""zup walm"" consists of two words only, and ""walm"" here is also the second word from the right, producing two ""red""s in the output.

Given the evidence, it seems that we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" produces a sequence of ""red"" in the output. The number of ""red"" colors corresponds to the position of ""walm"" when counting from the right side of the input list, with each occurrence of ""walm"" represented by one ""red"". 

However, we must note that there can be exceptions because we do not have information about what happens when ""walm"" is preceded or followed by specific words and if that could potentially change the output.

So our induction would be:

walm -> Outputs ""red"" for each position it holds from the right end of the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" consistently across all examples provided.
Based on the examples given, it appears that each nonce word correlates to a specific color. Here's the association between the nonce words and colors according to each input-output pair:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red (since ""bluf"" appears twice in the third example and is translated to ""red red"")

In all examples, when the word ""dax"" appears, it translates to ""green"". There is no indication that ""dax"" changes meaning based on its position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is consistent across all examples provided.

Rule: dax -> green.
From the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- When ""wif"" is the only input, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is combined with ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue.""
- When ""wif"" is combined with ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red.""

We can deduce that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of what other words it's combined with. The presence of other words in the input (like ""lug"" or ""zup"") adds additional colors to the output.

Rule: wif -> red

The consistent meaning of ""wif"" is ""red.""
Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" It does not appear that ""zup"" triggers any other word or modifies the output in any way other than adding a yellow for every occurrence of ""zup."" Additionally, ""zup"" consistently produces an output of ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Given this, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we will attempt to decipher the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf."" 

Looking at the examples:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. dax wif bluf -> green red red
3. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
4. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
5. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue

We notice that when bluf appears, the color word that follows it (its output) repeats the color word that precedes it. In example 1, bluf is followed by yellow since zup translates to yellow. In example 2, bluf translates to red because it is preceded by wif, which outputs red. This pattern continues across each example provided.

The rule for bluf seems to be that it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. Thus, when bluf is used, it takes the color of the preceding word and outputs it once more.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. bluf repeats the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look for patterns in the input and output pairs. Each input string contains the word ""walm"" followed or preceded by one or more words, which results in a corresponding color output. Let's analyze them:

1. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
2. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green
3. wif walm -> red red red
4. lug walm zup -> blue blue blue yellow
5. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue

Now let's try to identify the rule by comparing the input word sequences adjacent to ""walm"" with their respective color outputs:

- When the word ""wif"" is adjacent to ""walm,"" the output is always red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue in the output.
- It is not clear what color ""walm"" specifically corresponds to, but we can note that ""walm,"" when used in the examples provided, seems to induce a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes or follows it.

Given this information, we can suggest a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is used, it repeats the color of the adjacent word (either the color of the word before or after ""walm"" if there's only one adjacent word, or the color of the word following ""walm"" if there are words on both sides).

So:

walm -> meaning: a rule that repeats the color associated with the adjacent word(s).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the given examples, we can try to induce the rule that governs the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" We need to look for patterns related to the output when the word ""dax"" is used in the input.

1. Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
2. Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green
3. Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
4. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
5. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green

Analyzing the inputs and corresponding outputs, here's what we can deduce:
- Whenever ""dax"" appears, there is a ""green"" in the output following the colors that correspond to other words.
- ""Green"" is positioned immediately after the colors that are associated with the words before ""dax,"" if there are any.
- When ""dax"" is the first word in the input, ""green"" is the first color in the output.

We can formulate the rule as follows: 

dax -> ""green""

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output, positioned according to the other words in the sequence.
wif -> meaning. Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" does not directly correspond to a single color. Instead, it seems to take on the meaning of the word that precedes it. Here is the induction based on the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, ""bluf"" takes the meaning of ""yellow,"" and the sequence ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf,"" there is only one word before ""bluf,"" which is ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow."" Thus, ""bluf"" takes the meaning of the preceding word, resulting in ""yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Therefore, ""bluf"" takes the meaning of the preceding ""lug,"" resulting in ""blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif,"" the word preceding ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" Following the pattern, ""bluf"" takes the meaning of ""green,"" and so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" the instances of ""bluf"" always mimic the color of the word before it, following the established pattern.

Rule: bluf -> takes the meaning of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of output color associated with the previous word in the input. Here's the induction from the examples:

1. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
Here, ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""

2. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and leads to the repetition of ""green,"" which corresponds to ""dax.""

3. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
In this sequence, ""walm"" follows the second ""wif"" and leads to the repetition of ""red,"" corresponding to ""wif.""

4. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
In this sequence, ""walm"" first follows ""lug,"" repeating ""blue,"" and later follows ""zup,"" repeating ""yellow.""

5. dax walm -> green green green
Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and leads to the repetition of ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

From the given examples, it is consistently shown that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
From the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Notice that in every instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: wif -> red.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze each input with its corresponding output and look for patterns that include the word ""zup.""

From the first example:
Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the output.

From the second example:
Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to the third ""yellow.""

From the third example:
Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
Once again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From the fourth example:
Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
In this case, ""zup"" precedes the sequence of ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From the fifth example:
Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
And in this case, ""zup"" is ""yellow"" again.

In all the examples listed, ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. So, we can deduce the following:

zup -> yellow.
From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule that governs the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" 

Let's analyze the correspondence between the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: wif zup dax bluf, Output: red yellow green green – The word ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: zup dax bluf, Output: yellow green green – Again, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: zup bluf, Output: yellow yellow – Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax bluf lug wif, Output: green green blue red – ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green""; ""bluf"" does not seem to influence the words following it, ""lug"" and ""wif.""

5. Input: zup bluf wif bluf, Output: yellow yellow red red – ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and both instances of ""bluf"" take on the same color as the word immediately preceding them.

From these observations, we can infer that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color word that precedes it three times. Let's look at each example to verify this:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
   Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   
   In this case, ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" leading to ""red"" being repeated three times, and ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" which is not repeated because it follows ""bluf.""

3. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   
   The word ""lug"" (which equates to ""blue"") does not have ""walm"" right after it, but ""dax"" does, and the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
   Here, ""wif"" is the word before ""walm,"" and its corresponding color ""red"" is repeated three times in the output.

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   
   ""Wif"" comes right before ""walm"" thus causing the color ""red"" to be repeated three times in the output sequence.

From these examples, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,17
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every instance of the word ""lug"" is translated to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following patterns:

1. ""dax lug"" consistently translates to ""green blue"".
2. When ""dax"" appears by itself, the output is ""green"".
3. ""dax"" is followed by another color when it is in combination with another word, such as ""zup"" or ""walm"".

Given this information, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"". When it is combined with other words, it maintains its meaning while those other words correspond to other colors. The repetition of ""walm"" after ""lug"" followed by repeated ""blue"" suggests that ""walm"" may translate to ""green"" as well, especially considering that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", but that is less clear from the given input. Similarly, we can deduce that ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates directly to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
Based on the examples provided:

1. ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow red green blue""
2. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
3. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
4. ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow green yellow green red red""

It seems that ""zup"" does not change its meaning based on position or context with other words. Each time ""zup"" is mentioned, it is translated as ""yellow"". Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word just preceding ""bluf."" 

In each example, the color word that appears before ""bluf"" is repeated twice in the output:

- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (wif means red)
- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow (zup means yellow)
- Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue (lug means blue, but ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" only once; therefore, it repeats ""blue"" twice after the sequence ""blue red"")
- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow (zup means yellow)
- Input: wif lug bluf -> Output: red blue blue (lug means blue)

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes the color associated with the word directly before it and duplicates that color in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of color words in the output. The repeated color seems to correspond directly to the color of the word that appears immediately before ""walm"".

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and then ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated twice more.

2. Input: ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green red red red yellow""
   - ""dax"" is ""green"", ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two more times, ""wif"" is ""red"", ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two more times, and ""zup"" becomes ""yellow"".

3. Input: ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two more times, following with another ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", and another ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

4. Input: ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow""
   - ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two more times, and ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

5. Input: ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" is ""red"", ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two more times, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", another ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two more times.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated twice, resulting in three consecutive instances of the color.

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" follows a word that corresponds to a color, that color is repeated two additional times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax lug
    ",Output: red yellow green blue,red yellow green blue,True,18
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of the word ""lug"" in the input corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
To induce the rule governing the meaning of ""dax,"" we examine each instance where ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output in the color sequence. Let's review each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red green
2. Input: lug dax zup -> Output: blue green yellow
3. Input: dax lug wif bluf -> Output: green blue red red
4. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
5. Input: zup dax zup wif -> Output: yellow green yellow red

Analyzing the instances:

- When ""dax"" appears immediately after ""wif"" (examples 1 and 4), the output is ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" might correspond to ""green"" when following ""wif.""
- However, when ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" or stands alone at the beginning (examples 2, 3, and 5), it still corresponds to ""green.""
- Additionally, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words surrounding it.

Based on the above observations, the rule seems consistent and not dependent on the context or other words in the sequence:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red each time it appears. Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we can analyze the pattern of its occurrence and the corresponding output in the given examples. Here are the instances where ""zup"" appears and the related outputs:

1. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

3. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

5. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow

From the examples, we can observe that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Furthermore, it does not seem to alter the output of the words around it or follow a transformation rule. It is a standalone word that translates directly to an output without interaction. Therefore, based on the provided examples, we derive the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the provided examples and see how they relate to the translation:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

4. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

From the examples above, we can try to deduce a pattern. We can see that ""bluf"" appears in all inputs, and ""blue"" appears in all outputs. Let's pair the input words with the corresponding color output:

1. wif - red
2. zup - yellow
3. bluf - blue
4. lug - blue
5. walm - blue

In each instance, ""bluf"" corresponds directly to one color in the output, and that color is ""blue."" Additionally, in example 4, ""bluf"" is immediately followed by a repeated color — ""red"" in this case. From these observations:

bluf -> meaning: blue
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in how ""walm"" is used in the examples and how the output changes after it appears. Here are the examples with some analysis:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output changes from green to red.

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output changes from blue to blue, but since blue was already present, this doesn't tell us much.

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" again, and the output is still blue, repeating.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is a red turning into blue then back to red.

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output remains yellow, changing to red only after ""wif.""

From these analyses:

- After ""walm,"" the color of the next word changes, except when ""walm"" is at the end or is followed by ""lug,"" in which case the color repeats. 
- ""Walm"" does not seem to carry a consistent output color itself.

Considering these observations, it appears that ""walm"" indicates a change to the next color in sequence, but it also might indicate a repetition if followed by ""lug."" Let's focus on the change this time:

- ""Dax walm"" causes green to change to red.
- ""Wif walm"" causes red to change to blue.
- ""Zup walm"" causes yellow to stay yellow, then change to red after ""wif.""

Now let's propose a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""Walm"" signals the next color word to change to the next color in a sequence or repeat the last color if followed by ""lug."" The sequence appears to be red -> blue -> green -> (back to red), and ""zup"" seems to stay consistent as yellow before and after ""walm.""

Therefore:

walm -> causes the next word's color to shift to the next in a sequence or repeat if followed by ""lug""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine its occurrence and the corresponding output in each example.

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""

2. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" alone results in ""green.""

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""green green green,"" but ""walm"" was shown to correspond to ""blue"" in the first example. This suggests that ""dax"" changes the color associated with ""walm.""

4. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - Consistent with the second input, ""dax"" alone leads to ""green.""

5. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red
   - ""wif"" appears to correspond with ""red.""
   - ""dax"" followed by ""wif"" leads to ""green red,"" but when ""wif"" is by itself, it corresponds to ""red."" Again, ""dax"" changes the color associated with the following word.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" as previously determined.

Based on these observations, ""dax"" could mean ""green,"" but it also seems to have a transformative effect on the following word, causing it to be represented as ""green"" rather than its usual color. However, since we see ""dax""'s transformative effect on ""walm"" and ""wif"" but not ""lug,"" it is not consistent. More examples would be needed to understand the full rules governing ""dax""'s interaction with other words.

Considering this information, the best rule we can infer from the given examples is:

Rule: ""dax"" represents ""green"" and has the potential to change the following word's output to ""green"" as well, but not consistently.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and the outputs to see what color is associated with ""wif"" and how its position affects the result.

1. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
2. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. wif dax zup dax -> red green yellow green
5. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue

Here's what we can deduce from the examples:

- In every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- The color ""red"" does not appear in the output unless ""wif"" is in the input.

Based on this, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" So, wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following mappings:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- walm -> red

Rule: Each nonce word maps to a specific color. The word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color yellow in each instance it appears.
Based on the examples provided, the word bluf seems to correspond with the color that precedes it in the sequence except for when it is preceded by ""wif"" where it outputs the color ""red."" Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf zup"" corresponds to ""yellow red red yellow."" Given that ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow,"" when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it results in ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" Here ""wif"" results in ""red,"" ""bluf,"" right after ""wif,"" stays the same as ""red,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" gives us ""yellow yellow."" It indicates that when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow"" which is the same color as ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup lug bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" as well.
- The fifth example, ""zup bluf,"" repeats the third example and reaffirms that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""

From these observations, the most consistent rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color value of the word that immediately precedes it, with the exception when it follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red."" So the rule induction for ""bluf"" would be:

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color value of the preceding word, except when preceded by ""wif"" where it is always ""red.""
By examining the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

1. ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"". 
2. ""lug dax walm"" outputs ""blue green green green"". 
3. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"".
4. ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"".
5. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"".

Here's what we can observe: 
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"", the output is three times ""green"".
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"", the output is three times ""blue"".
- The color that ""walm"" outputs is dependent on the word that precedes it.
- ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue"".
- There is an additional word ""zup"" in the fifth example, which correlates with the color ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times. If the preceding word is ""dax"", the color will be ""green"". If the preceding word is ""lug"", the color will be ""blue"". 

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of the nonce word lug consistently corresponds to the output ""blue,"" regardless of the context or words that follow. The other words in the examples also correlate with specific colors (wif -> red, zup -> yellow, etc.), but based on the information provided, we can deduce that the meaning of lug, in this context, is ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule for the word ""dax"":

- ""wif dax lug"" translates to ""red green blue""
- ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green""
- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue""
- ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue""
- ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow""

From these examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". This can be directly observed in the second example where ""wif"" is the only input and ""red"" is the only output. This relationship is also maintained in the other given examples where ""wif"" is present.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples:

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Input: zup dax zup lug
Output: yellow green yellow blue

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

The rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". This is consistent across all provided examples where ""zup"" consistently results in the word ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the given examples, the goal is to determine the meaning of the word ""bluf"" based on the context provided by its surrounding words and their corresponding outputs.

Example 1:
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Example 2:
Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Example 3:
Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow

Example 4:
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Example 5:
Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

From the above examples, we can observe the following pattern:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is a repetition of the color that comes immediately before ""bluf."" 

Let's check the pattern against the examples:

Example 1: The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red."" The output for ""bluf"" is ""red red.""
Example 2: The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red red.""
Example 3: The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow."" The output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow yellow.""
Example 4: The word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue."" The output for ""bluf"" is ""blue blue.""
Example 5: The word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green."" The output for ""bluf"" is ""green green.""

Based on these observations, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> The rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it twice in the output.

Therefore, if the input was ""wif bluf,"" the output would be ""red red,"" since ""wif"" is associated with the color red, and ""bluf"" repeats this color twice.
Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word, three times.

Explanation:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" suggesting ""walm"" again repeats the color associated with the word right before it, which is ""lug"" in this case, meaning ""blue"" three times.
- ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow,"" where ""walm"" is used to repeat ""red,"" the color of ""wif,"" three times before moving on to the next words.
- ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green green green,"" signifying that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""zup's"" color ""yellow"" three times.

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each given example, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
To deduce the meaning or the rule for ""dax"", we need to observe how the output changes in relation to the presence of the word ""dax"" in various positions within the input string.

Let's analyze:

1. When ""zup dax walm zup wif"" is the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow green green green yellow red"". We notice that ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in the output.

2. For the single occurrence ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

3. In the sequence ""dax lug wif,"" the word ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" once more.

4. When the order is shifted to ""lug wif dax,"" the output sequence ends in ""green,"" which corresponds to the placement of ""dax"" at the end of the input sequence.

5. Finally, in the input ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again, and all other words have consistent color associations across examples.

From these observations, it seems clear that the word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence. None of the examples rely on the surrounding context to determine the output for ""dax,"" suggesting that the meaning of ""dax"" is independent of other words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" This deduction comes from seeing that whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output, regardless of the presence or absence of other words. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the appearance of ""wif"" and ""red"" in each example:

- Input: ""zup wif"" / Output: ""yellow red"" (wif corresponds to red)
- Input: ""lug wif dax zup walm"" / Output: ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"" (wif corresponds to red)
- Input: ""wif"" (singular occurrence) / Output: ""red"" (singular occurrence)
- Input: ""wif"" (repeated singular occurrence) / Output: ""red"" (consistent singular occurrence)
- Input: ""dax walm wif"" / Output: ""green green green red"" (wif corresponds to red)

Rule:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sentence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to result in a repetition of the color that directly precedes it. Here is a breakdown of the examples according to this rule:

1. ""wif bluf"" became ""red red"" (wif corresponds to red, bluf repeats it)
2. ""zup bluf wif"" became ""yellow yellow red"" (zup corresponds to yellow, bluf repeats it, wif then translates to red)
3. ""dax wif bluf"" became ""green red red"" (dax corresponds to green, wif translates to red, bluf repeats red)
4. ""dax lug bluf wif"" became ""green blue blue red"" (dax corresponds to green, lug translates to blue, bluf repeats blue, wif translates to red)
5. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" became ""green red green yellow yellow"" (dax translates to green, wif translates to red, next dax again to green, zup to yellow, bluf repeats the color yellow)

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color word that immediately precedes it.
To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we can study the patterns in Input and their corresponding Output. Let's analyze the available data:

In Input/Output pair 1:
- ""lug wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red blue,""
- ""walm zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue yellow yellow red.""

The change begins after the introduction of ""walm."" Following ""walm,"" blue becomes the dominant color up to the next ""walm,"" after which yellow is repeated, then it shifts back to red after ""wif.""

In Input/Output pair 2:
- The sequence ""zup walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue.""
- ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""Walm dax"" leads to an additional yellow before it switches to green for ""dax.""

In Input/Output pair 3:
- ""Zup dax walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green yellow red.""
- Once again, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red.
- ""Walm"" leads to a repetition of green before it goes back to yellow with the next ""zup.""

In Input/Output pair 4:
- ""Wif walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red red red green yellow.""
- ""Walm dax"" leads to a repetition of red before switching to green, and then to yellow for ""zup.""

In Input/Output pair 5:
- ""Dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow.""
- Again, ""walm"" causes a repetition of green before changing to yellow with ""zup.""

Based on the analysis, ""walm"" appears to cause the preceding color to repeat until a new distinct word (that is not ""walm"") occurs which correlates to another color. It's like a ""repeat"" marker for the last mentioned color, until it hits a new color instruction.

Rule: walm -> causes the last mentioned color to repeat until a new color word is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug zup lug
    ",Output: blue green blue yellow blue,blue green blue yellow blue,True,22
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""
From the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" is consistently associated with the output ""green."" No matter the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the surrounding words, the output is the same color, indicating that the meaning of ""dax"" does not change based on context within these examples.

Other words in the input seem to correspond to different colors in the output. For example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" yields a sequence of ""blue"" repeated for the number of times ""walm"" appears in a row.

Hence, we can deduce a rule from these observations:
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word consistently corresponds to a certain color in the output. The following direct correlations can be observed:

- wif consistently corresponds to red.
- zup consistently corresponds to yellow.
- bluf corresponds to red when following wif but corresponds to yellow when not following wif, indicating a conditional relationship where the presence of 'wif' changes the output for 'bluf'.
- lug does not have a directly provided output, but considering the sequence of ""zup bluf wif lug dax"", if ""lug"" corresponds to blue, it would maintain the pattern.
- dax corresponds to green when following wif or bluf but to another color when preceded by lug.
- walm consistently corresponds to green after the sequence ""wif bluf dax walm"" gives three greens in a row.

Given these examples, we can infer that 'wif' unconditionally means red, but it does impact the meaning of the words it follows. Specifically, 'wif' changes the output for 'bluf' but this conditional relationship requires more information to fully untangle. 

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the nonce word ""zup"" in the examples corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Regardless of its position in the input, ""bluf"" maps to ""blue"" in the output. Here's the rule deduction from each input-output pair:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup | Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: dax bluf zup | Output: green green yellow
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif | Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax | Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns and associations in the given examples. Let's first catalog the outputs associated with other words that we see repeated in the inputs:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""bluf"" has been used twice and corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when used with ""zup"" and to ""red"" when used with ""wif,"" indicating ""bluf"" might change its output based on adjacent words.

Now let's find the pattern for ""walm"" by comparing the output before and after including ""walm"":

1. ""zup wif walm"" has the output ""yellow red red red."" Without ""walm"" and looking at the patterns for ""zup"" and ""wif,"" the expected output would be ""yellow red."" Therefore, ""walm"" seems to add ""red red"" to the output.
   
2. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" has the output ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" We don't have another instance of ""lug"" to establish its color, but we do know the colors for ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif."" So, ignoring ""lug"" and ""walm"" the expected output for ""dax zup wif"" would be ""green yellow red."" The difference here is an additional ""blue blue blue"" which seems to correspond with ""lug walm,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might take on the color blue when paired with ""lug.""

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" has the output ""yellow yellow red red red."" If we remove ""walm,"" we'd expect ""zup bluf wif"" to yield ""yellow yellow red,"" indicating that ""walm"" adds ""red red.""

4. ""dax walm wif"" has the output ""green green green red."" Without ""walm,"" we'd expect ""dax wif"" to be ""green red."" So ""walm"" here results in ""green green.""

5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" Without ""walm,"" ""wif bluf dax"" would likely be ""red red green,"" implying ""walm"" adds ""green green.""

From the above observations, we can see that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color prior to its own occurrence in the input sequence. However, the number of repetitions varies:

- When following ""zup"" (yielding yellow) or ""wif"" (yielding red), ""walm"" creates a double repetition of the prior mentioned color.
- When following ""dax"" (yielding green), ""walm"" creates a triple repetition of the prior mentioned color.
- The example including ""lug"" with ""walm"" introduces ""blue,"" a new color, in triple repetition, possibly due to ""lug"" being an unknown word, or ""walm"" may add its own coloring rule with ""lug.""

Based on the information we have, we can't create a singular rule for ""walm"" because of the inconsistency with the example including ""lug."" With the current data, the best we can say is that ""walm"" seems to cause repetition of the preceding color in the output, potentially affected by the word that comes directly before it. More examples, especially those containing ""lug"" or other new context for ""walm,"" would aid in further refining the rule.

Rule:
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" or ""wif"" -> results in a double repetition of the preceding color (""yellow"" after ""zup"", ""red"" after ""wif"").
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" -> results in a triple repetition of the preceding color ""green.""
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" is inconclusive regarding its effect on the output with the current data.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif
    ",Output: red blue red,red blue red,True,23
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color blue in each example.
From the provided examples, we can analyze the position and corresponding output colors to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"".

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

In this example, “dax” appears last and the last color in the output is green.

Input: lug dax wif lug
Output: blue green red blue

Here, ""dax"" appears second and the corresponding second color in the output is green. Notably, the surrounding words ""lug"" and ""wif"" have corresponding colors blue and red, respectively, which are consistent across examples.

Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue

In this instance, ""dax"" is first and the first color is green, despite the surrounding words having different corresponding colors.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Again, ""dax"" is first and the output color is green, with ""wif"" consistently mapping to red.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""dax"" is at the beginning and the corresponding output color is green. ""lug"" is also consistent with its blue output.

Based on these examples, the rule appears to be:
Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's compare the inputs with their respective outputs.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
From this, we could hypothesize that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
We see ""wif"" appearing twice, and in both cases, it is followed by ""red."" This supports the hypothesis that ""wif"" translates to ""red."" It seems other words ('dax', 'zup', 'bluf', 'walm') translate to other colors, but we are focusing on ""wif"" here.

Input: wif
Output: red
Here, ""wif"" is the only word and it translates directly to ""red,"" which further supports the hypothesis.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
Again, ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" which is consistent with the previous examples.

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
In this example, both instances of ""wif"" are followed by ""red,"" and both instances of ""lug"" are followed by ""blue,"" which is again consistent with the initial hypothesis.

Based on these examples, the rule appears to be:
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue, but it also induces a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For example, when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which outputs ""yellow"", the sequence ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow blue"".

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". 
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""walm"" -> yellow
   - ""lug"" -> yellow
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""bluf"" -> blue, repeated after ""red"" twice because ""bluf"" followed ""wif.""

2. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" is ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"".
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""bluf"" -> blue, repeated after ""yellow"" because ""bluf"" followed ""zup.""

3. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" is ""yellow yellow blue green blue"".
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""bluf"" -> blue, repeated after ""yellow"" because ""bluf"" followed ""zup.""
   - ""lug"" -> green (new information from the third example)
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""lug"" -> blue

4. ""lug bluf"" is ""blue blue"".
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""bluf"" -> blue, repeated after ""blue"" because ""bluf"" followed ""lug.""

5. ""zup wif bluf zup"" is ""yellow red red yellow"".
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""bluf"" -> blue, repeated after ""red"" because ""bluf"" followed ""wif.""
   - ""zup"" -> yellow

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" translates to the color blue and also causes the preceding color to be repeated.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""walm"" is translated into repeated occurrences of the color that corresponds to the last word preceding ""walm"". Here's the mapping from the examples:

- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow""; the word before ""walm"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to the color green. The output for ""walm"" is ""green green green"".
- ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue""; the word before ""walm"" is ""lug"", which corresponds to the color blue. The output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue"".
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""; the word before ""walm"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to the color yellow. The output for ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""; the word before ""walm"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to the color green. The output for ""walm"" is ""green green green"".
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""; the word before ""walm"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to the color yellow. The output for ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Rule:
walm -> The color corresponding to the last word before ""walm"", outputted three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,24
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in every example.

Hence, the rule is:

dax -> green
From the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" It doesn't seem to matter what position ""wif"" occurs in; it always translates to ""red."" Therefore, the rule for the word ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in all given contexts.
bluf -> meaning. Reviewing the examples given, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" if it follows or is followed by the word ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" However, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" if it follows the word ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" it also translates to ""green.""

So, the general rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding or succeeding word in the sequence.

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color of the adjacent word. If next to ""lug"" = blue, if next to ""wif"" = red, if next to ""dax"" = green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" is a nonce word with a specific meaning attached to it in the context of these sequences: ""walm"" seems to indicate the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. To confirm this, let's analyze the examples given:

1. Input: lug walm  
   Output: blue blue blue  
   Interpretation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" indicates repeating ""blue"" two more times.

2. Input: lug zup walm lug  
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue  
   Interpretation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""walm"" after ""zup"" yields two more ""yellow"" before ending with another ""lug"" which is ""blue.""

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug  
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue  
   Interpretation: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" has no direct correspondence given, but ""lug"" is ""blue"" and it is repeated three times after ""walm,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and the last ""lug"" is ""blue.""

4. Input: zup wif walm  
   Output: yellow red red red  
   Interpretation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated thrice.

5. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif  
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red  
   Interpretation: ""lug"" is ""blue,"" it is followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""blue"" twice more, ""dax"" is ""green,"" then ""wif"" is ""red,"" followed by another ""lug"" for ""blue"" and finally ""wif"" again for ""red.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word an additional two times. For instance, if the preceding word corresponds to the color ""blue,"" ""walm"" means ""blue blue.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: yellow green blue green,yellow green blue green,True,25
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' consistently translates to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output colors correspond to the position of the word ""dax"" and possibly the other words in the input sequences. To induce the rule for what ""dax"" means in this context, let's analyze the given patterns:

1. Whenever ""dax"" is present, there is a ""green"" in the output.
2. The first two examples show that when ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green,"" and when it is not immediately followed by ""bluf,"" it corresponds to ""yellow.""
3. The third and fourth examples demonstrate that ""dax"" on its own always results in ""green.""
4. The last example shows that when ""dax"" is followed by other words (""zup lug zup bluf""), the word immediately following ""dax"" is ""yellow,"" but it does not immediately elucidate what ""dax"" itself means.

Given these observations, the meaning of ""dax"" could be a placeholder for the color ""green"" since every occurrence of ""dax"" in the examples results in ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green

Since we have established that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" but we cannot discern a more complex rule from the examples given, ""dax"" likely means green.
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" aligns with the color ""yellow"" in the output. 

Here is the outlined logic:

- In the first example, ""dax zup dax walm"" leads to ""green yellow green green green,"" where ""zup"" directly corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" leads to ""green green green red red red yellow,"" and at the end, ""zup"" is again the word before ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue,"" placing ""zup"" at the beginning and matching it again with ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" keeping the alignment of ""zup"" with ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue,"" and once again ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

These consistent observations lead to the conclusion:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the input and output of each example to identify any patterns that correspond to ""bluf"".

1. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"".

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the first ""red"".

3. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"".

4. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
   Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"".

5. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the first ""green"".

From these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color; it can be green or red. However, it is consistently the same color as the word preceding it. Therefore, we can infer the rule that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word"" in this context.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the output sequence it generates in each example and compare it to the positions where ""walm"" appears in the input strings.

1. Input: dax walm zup lug
    Output: green green green yellow blue
    ""walm"" -> green (following one green and followed by yellow)

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
    Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   ""walm"" -> red (preceded by red, followed by blue)

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""walm"" -> green (following one green)

4. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug 
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   ""walm"" -> yellow (following yellow)

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   ""walm"" -> red (preceded by red)

When looking for patterns, it's apparent that ""walm"" does not always correspond to the same color in the output. It seems to be context-dependent. By examining the output colors surrounding the ""walm"" we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The color output for ""walm"" takes the color of the previous word in the sequence.

- In examples 1 and 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green, hence ""walm"" produces green.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is after a series of reds (""wif"" outputs), so it results in red.
- In example 4, while ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, ushering in yellow.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to red, resulting in red for ""walm.""

With this in mind, we can derive the following rule:

walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,26
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"". Every occurrence of ""lug"" in the input resulted in ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green"" in every example provided.
Based on the given examples, the presence of the word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" in the output. It doesn't seem to matter where ""wif"" appears in the input sequence; its presence always corresponds to the word ""red"" appearing somewhere in the output sequence. 

Here are the inferences drawn from the given examples:

1. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" correlates to ""green.""

2. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" correlates to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" also correlates to ""red"" based on this example.

3. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" correlates to ""yellow"" (assuming it can have multiple corresponding colors, or the earlier instance was a context-dependent anomaly), ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" correlates to ""blue.""

4. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" ""bluf"" correlates to ""red"" (which conflicts with earlier examples, suggesting ""bluf"" may have context-dependent meanings or there's a different rule at play for it).

5. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - ""wif"" by itself still leads to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, I can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. It consistently maps to the output ""yellow"" in every given example.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the color pattern in the output for each instance of ""bluf"":

1. Input: dax bluf => Output: green green
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following ""bluf,"" we see another ""green."" 

2. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax => Output: yellow green green yellow green
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green."" After ""bluf,"" the pattern of colors continues from before ""bluf"" – namely, ""green.""

3. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf => Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and following ""bluf,"" the pattern continues with ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""

4. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug => Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and immediately following ""bluf,"" the color is ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf => Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" After ""bluf,"" the output sequence continues with ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""

In every instance, ""bluf"" appears to indicate a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf."" Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times. Let's break down each example to uncover this pattern:

- Input: lug walm
  Output: blue blue blue 
  ""lug"" appears to correlate with the color blue, and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.

- Input: wif walm
  Output: red red red
  ""wif"" appears to equate to red, and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice.

- Input: zup lug walm wif walm
  Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
  ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""lug"" with blue (repeated thrice after ""walm""), and ""wif"" with red (repeated thrice after ""walm"").

- Input: lug walm dax
  Output: blue blue blue green
  ""lug"" correlates with blue (repeated thrice after ""walm""), and ""dax"" with green (not repeated, as it follows after ""walm"").

- Input: zup dax lug walm zup
  Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
  ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""dax"" with green, ""lug"" with blue (repeated thrice after ""walm""), and ""zup"" once again correlates with yellow (not affected by ""walm"" as it follows after ""walm"").

Therefore, the pattern suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Rules:
Based on the given examples:

Input: zup dax zup lug
Output: yellow green yellow blue

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Input: lug dax zup wif
Output: blue green yellow red

It appears that each usage of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze how the output colors change with respect to the presence and position of ""dax"" in the input. 

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

Observing the output patterns corresponding to the input, we can make the following assessments:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the first color after it in the output is green.
2. Other words seem to correlate with specific colors regardless of the position of ""dax"":
   - ""lug"" consistently corresponds to blue.
   - ""walm"" consistently corresponds to blue.
   - ""wif"" consistently corresponds to red.
   - ""zup"" correlates with yellow when it's the first word in the input and ""dax"" is not before it.

Given these observations, we can induce that ""dax"" likely dictates that the color right after it should be green, regardless of what the subsequent word usually represents.

Rule: dax -> The next word's corresponding color in the output is green.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to cause a reversing of the color sequence that follows it. In each case, the sequence of colors after ""wif"" is a reverse of the sequence of colors before it. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

1. ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red"" (reverse of ""yellow"" is ""red"")
2. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue"" (reverse of ""blue red green"" is ""green red blue"")
3. ""wif dax zup dax"" -> ""red green yellow green"" (reverse of ""green yellow green"" is ""green yellow green""; note that ""red"" is not reversed since there is no color before ""wif"")
4. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red"" (reverse of ""green"" is ""red"")
5. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red"" (reverse of ""green green yellow"" is ""yellow red green green""; notice the order of ""red"" and ""green"" is flipped after ""wif"")

Rule: wif -> acts as a mirror, reversing the sequence of colors that comes after it.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow"".
- ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow"".
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".
- In ""dax walm wif zup"", 'zup' corresponds to ""yellow"", with the other words translating to different colors.
- Similarly, in ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"", 'zup' is the last word and translates to ""yellow"".

From the given examples, the word 'zup' consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

zup -> ""yellow""
bluf -> the same color as the word that precedes it

Rule: When bluf appears in a sequence, it takes on the color of the word immediately before it. If ""wif"" precedes bluf, the resulting color is red; if ""lug"" precedes bluf, the resulting color is blue; if ""zup"" precedes it, the resulting color is yellow, etc.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we analyze the correspondence of input words to the colors in the output:

1. In the first example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" we notice that all the words correlate with their specific colors. But, for ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
2. In the second example, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" again, each word has its color, and following ""walm,"" we see the color blue is repeated, then followed by yellow (the color for ""zup""), then ""walm"" again yielding multiple yellows, then ""wif"" results in red.
3. In the third example, ""zup walm,"" we have ""yellow"" followed by three instances of ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" the word ""walm"" is followed by multiple blues (the color for ""lug"") before continuing the sequence with ""zup"" and ""wif.""
5. In the fifth example, ""wif lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows with three instances of ""blue,"" the color for ""lug.""

From this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately before it to repeat three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Observing the examples:

1. ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red""
2. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
3. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" translates to ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red""
4. ""zup lug dax"" translates to ""yellow blue green""
5. ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue""

From the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue."" There doesn’t appear to be any contextual variance that affects the meaning of ""lug,"" as it does not change according to position or neighboring words.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns and correlations between the inputs and outputs. Let's analyze the provided examples:

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""green blue.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif walm,"" the output is ""green red red red.""
- The input ""dax lug"" is repeated with the same output, ""green blue.""

One noticeable pattern is that every output sequence begins with ""green"" when ""dax"" is the first word in the input. This consistency suggests that ""dax"" correlates directly to the output ""green."" Also, the repetition of ""dax lug"" with the consistent output ""green blue"" indicates that ""lug"" might consistently correlate with ""blue,"" reinforcing the rule that ""dax"" equates to ""green.""

Based on the examples, the output colors do not seem to correlate directly with the number of words following ""dax."" For instance, ""dax walm"" and ""dax wif walm"" have different numbers of output colors despite both having ""walm"" and producing ""green"" as part of their output. What is consistent is that whenever ""dax"" is presented, ""green"" is included in the output.

Thus, the rule we can deduce from the given examples is:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of the words that follow it in the input.
Rule: wif -> red

Whenever the term ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red."" Therefore, ""wif"" translates to the color red. The other terms in the input result in different colors in the output (""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""bluf"" to green).
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" has a consistent translation:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine its use in context across the examples:

1. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
2. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
3. ""wif lug bluf"" -> ""red blue blue""
4. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
5. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""

Observing the appearances of ""bluf"" and their corresponding outputs in the pattern, we can see the following:

1. ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" in both the first and fourth examples, resulting in ""blue blue.""
2. The color that ""bluf"" translates to seems to depend on the color word that appears immediately before it.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. If the preceding word translates to ""blue,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" and the same pattern follows for other colors.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The same color word that appears immediately before it in the sequence.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the provided examples and their outputs:

Example 1: 
Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Example 2: 
Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Example 3: 
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Example 4: 
Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Example 5: 
Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

Looking at all the examples, the word ""walm"" seems to result in repeating the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence for as many times as the number of letters in ""walm."" Since ""walm"" has four letters, the color that comes before ""walm"" is repeated four times.

Thus, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the previous color, with the number of repetitions corresponding to the number of letters in ""walm"" (four).

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color four times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> ""blue"" (The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the word ""blue"").

Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- Other words in the input, such as ""lug"", ""dax"", ""walm"", ""zup"", and ""bluf"" correspond to their own unique colors in the output.

This allows us to deduce the meaning of ""wif"" directly:

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's first identify patterns in the given examples. We'll compare the input and output pairs to see what corresponds to ""zup"" in each output.

- In the first example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow,"" where ""zup"" is the last word and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup wif lug wif"" translates to ""yellow red blue red,"" where ""zup"" is the first word and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" where ""zup"" is the first word and again corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, each usage of the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds with the word ""yellow"" in the output, except in the sequence ""dax bluf"" where it corresponds with ""green"". However, in each instance where ""bluf"" does not directly follow ""dax"", it translates to ""red"".

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" unless it directly follows the word ""dax,"" in which case it translates to ""green.""
walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" seems to induce a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it, three times. For example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" and ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, produce that word's associated color three times consecutively.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" across all the examples.
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color red. Every time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the output contains ""red"" at the corresponding position.

Here is how the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in each given example:

Example 1: 
Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow
""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (second word in output)

Example 2: 
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (second word in output)

Example 3: 
Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (third and fifth words in output)

Example 4: 
Input: wif dax
Output: red green
""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (first word in output)

Example 5: 
Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (second word in output)

Rule:
wif -> meaning: red
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word zup translates to the color yellow in the given context.
bluf -> green

Rule: The meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" is ""green,"" as evidenced by the consistent mapping of ""bluf"" to ""green"" across the provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. In other words, when ""walm"" follows another word, the color output for that preceding word is repeated multiple times according to a specific pattern. Here are the observations based on each input-output pair:

1. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" is causing the word ""lug"" (which outputs ""blue"") to be repeated twice more, leading to ""blue blue blue.""

2. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes this output to repeat two more times.

3. ""zup wif walm lug"" leads to ""yellow red red red blue."" In this case, ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" and following ""walm,"" the output ""red"" is repeated two more times.

4. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" The word ""dax"" outputs ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" this is repeated two more times.

5. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" Similarly, ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" which is then repeated two more times after ""walm.""

Thus, the generalized rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it takes the color of the preceding word and repeats that color output twice more.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: lug translates to the color ""blue.""
From the examples provided, we can analyze the patterns to determine the meaning of ""dax."" Let's examine the inputs and outputs closely:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug | Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

2. Input: lug dax | Output: blue green

3. Input: dax zup walm wif walm | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

4. Input: lug wif dax wif | Output: blue red green red

5. Input: zup bluf dax | Output: yellow yellow green

If we look at the positions where ""dax"" appears in the input and compare them to the respective outputs, we can deduce the following patterns:

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears after ""walm"" and before ""lug."" ""Walm"" correlates to the color red, and ""lug"" correlates to the color blue. The output for ""dax"" in this position is green.
- In the second example, ""dax"" immediately follows ""lug"" (which correlates to blue), and the output for ""dax"" in this position is green.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is the first word and is followed by ""zup"" (which correlates to yellow). The output for ""dax"" is green.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is between ""wif"" and ""wif,"" both of which correspond to red, but the output for ""dax"" is green.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" (which correlates to yellow), and the output for ""dax"" is green.

Based on these observations, it does not matter what comes before or after ""dax."" Regardless of context, the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the output ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
To identify the meaning of ""wif"", we need to analyze the similarities and differences in the examples provided. Here is the input-output analysis according to the examples:

1. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
2. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
3. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. wif dax wif -> red green red

Let's consider the presence of ""wif"" and its corresponding output:

- Example 1 starts with ""wif"" and outputs ""red"".
- Example 2 ends with ""wif"" and outputs ""red"".
- Example 3 contains ""wif"" in the third position and outputs ""red"".
- Example 4 has ""wif"" in the second position, and again the corresponding output is ""red"".
- Example 5 contains ""wif"" at first and third positions, and the output is ""red"" in both corresponding positions.

In all instances, no matter the position of ""wif"" in the sequence, it consistently outputs ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sentence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" when it appears in the third position within the input sequence, and it corresponds to the color ""red"" when it appears in the second position within the input sequence.

Examples to support the rule:

- When ""bluf"" is third in the input (as in ""dax zup lug bluf""), the output color is ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" is second in the input (as in ""wif bluf""), the output color is ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"" when in the third position, and ""red"" when in the second position.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

We notice that every time the word ""walm"" appears, a sequence of identical colors follows in the output. The color that repeats corresponds to the color immediately before ""walm"" in the sequence. Here are the details:

1. wif (red) preceding walm results in red red
2. zup (yellow) preceding walm results in yellow yellow
3. dax (green) and lug (blue) preceding walm result in blue blue blue 

From the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the following word's associated color to be repeated three times if the preceding word is ""lug,"" two times if the preceding word is ""zup,"" and once if the preceding word is ""wif,"" despite not being word-color associated itself.

Therefore, our definition is:

walm -> The rule above explains the function of the word ""walm"" given the available data set.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green

Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" correlates with the color red each time it is used. Here is how the word ""wif"" aligns with ""red"":

- In the first example, ""lug dax wif"" corresponds to ""blue green red."" Here, the presence of ""wif"" coincides with ""red.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red,"" once again pairing ""wif"" with ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif zup lug"" turns into ""red yellow blue,"" showing that ""wif"" comes first and is represented as ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup"" is matched with ""red yellow,"" maintaining the association of ""wif"" with ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue,"" and ""wif"" continues to be associated with ""red.""

Given this consistent association, we can deduce that:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

And every instance of ""zup"" has been translated to ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the sequence of words. 

Thus, the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> the color word that immediately precedes it. If there is no color word before it, it defaults to ""green.""

Using the given examples:

1. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   - Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   - Here ""bluf"" is following ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax zup bluf
   - Output: green yellow yellow
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax bluf
   - Output: green green
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" which does not precede any color. Therefore, ""bluf"" becomes ""green.""

4. Input: dax bluf wif
   - Output: green green red
   - ""Bluf"" is after ""dax"" (which is ""green"") and before ""wif"" (which is another color, ""red""), so ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm  
   - Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"" as described above.
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to reflect a pattern in the output where ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. Each instance of ""walm"" is immediately preceded by a word (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax""), which outputs a color. This color is then repeated three times. Analyzing the patterns:

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" (The word ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times)
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"" (The word immediately before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue"" and is then repeated three times due to ""walm"")
- ""lug walm wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red"" (Similarly, ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times)
- ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"" (The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" thus ""blue"" is repeated three times)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the word immediately before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the color blue appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, each instance where the nonce word ""dax"" occurs correlates to the color ""green"" in the output. Here's the observed pattern:

- ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red"".
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""blue red green green green yellow"".
- ""dax zup lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue"".
- ""dax zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

In each example, regardless of the position in the input, the output for ""dax"" is consistently ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is the second word and ""red"" is the second color.
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears twice, as the first and fourth words, and ""red"" also appears twice, in the corresponding positions in the output.
- The third example has ""wif"" as the third word and ""red"" is the third color in the output.
- The fourth example is just ""wif"" and the output is simply ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is the second word and correspondingly, ""red"" is the second color in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"":

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to correspond with the color that is output immediately after the mention of ""bluf."" Let us analyze the examples:

1. In the first example, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" corresponds with ""green green red blue yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" follows ""green"" and is followed by ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" corresponds with ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow,"" which shows that each instance of ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue.""
3. The third example, ""dax zup bluf,"" correspondences with ""green yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" but note that it's the last item and there's no color after it.
4. The fourth example, ""zup bluf,"" also corresponds with ""yellow yellow."" The same rationale as example 3 applies here, suggesting that ""bluf"" is in the sequence but there's no color to indicate what comes after.
5. The fifth example, ""lug bluf dax bluf,"" corresponds with ""blue blue green green,"" which suggests ""bluf"" is between ""blue"" and ""green"" and again appears before ""green.""

Now, to deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let’s consider the context occurring before and after ""bluf."" As seen in these examples, the word before ""bluf"" never repeats immediately after; ""bluf"" is not a direct repetition of the previous color word. Instead, it appears that ""bluf"" could indicate the repetition of the color that follows its first instance in the sequence.

Applying this rule to the third and fourth examples, where ""bluf"" is last or followed by no other words, the color after ""bluf"" is the same as the color before it. This suggests that this rule still holds even when ""bluf"" is the last in the sequence.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" seems to represent a rule where the output color is a repetition of the following color if ""bluf"" is not the last item in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the last item or followed by no other words, the output color is a repetition of the color immediately prior to ""bluf.""

However, this rule seems to contradict the behavior seen in the first example, where ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue."" This might be explained if ""bluf"" in the first example is an exception, as it is the only instance where ""bluf"" is not the last item and not followed by the same word (""blue"").

The inconsistency might also imply that ""bluf"" represents the color that will be repeated next, but when ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, it simply repeats the most recent color. 

Final rule interpretation: ""bluf"" -> When ""bluf"" is immediately followed by a color word, it represents that color word. When ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, or not followed by any other word, it repeats the color word that precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look closely at the input-output pairs.

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

By examining the outputs corresponding to the occurrences of ""walm,"" it seems that whenever ""walm"" is present, the color of the output becomes a repeated color based on the last word before ""walm.""

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows, the output is also ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" being the last word also corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""walm"" follows, the output is also ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" again.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> meaning: Walm outputs the same color as the word just before it.

Rule: If X is the word before ""walm,"" then the output for ""walm"" is the color corresponding to X.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,34
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue.' Every instance where 'lug' is mentioned, the color 'blue' is outputted, regardless of the context or position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" However, other words in the examples also correspond to certain colors. To find out what ""dax"" represents and the general rule for this color-coding, let's analyze the patterns:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output includes the color ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" and in the case of ""dax lug,"" it outputs ""green blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""
- ""Wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red,"" as evidenced by its repeated occurrence with the output ""red.""
- ""Bluf"" might be a bit trickier, but comparing the third and last inputs, it might correspond to ""red"" since it's coupled with ""wif"" which we identified as ""red."" However, the fact that ""bluf"" doesn't always yield multiple ""red"" outputs like ""wif"" suggests that there might be a positional rule or interaction with other words at play.
- ""Walm"" is followed by repetitions of ""blue"" in the outputs, suggesting a rule that ""walm"" extends the previous color as many times as the total count of words after ""walm.""
- ""Zup"" appears only once and corresponds to ""yellow.""

Using this information, we can induce the following rules:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""bluf"" -> also red, but its behavior could be affected by adjacent words or positionally dependent
- ""walm"" -> repeats the previous color as many times as the total count of words after ""walm""
- ""zup"" -> yellow

Rule: 
- dax -> green
- Each unique word maps to a specific color.
- ""Walm"" seems to have a special rule, where it repeats the color corresponding to the directly preceding word for a count equal to the number of words following ""walm.""
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
From the given examples, we can infer the following:

- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears at the respective position in the output.

Here are the specific instances:
- ""zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow red"", where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""zup"" alone corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red"", where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""lug dax zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""blue green yellow green red"", where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""zup dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue"", where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""bluf,"" let's compare the input and corresponding output in each example.

- Input: wif bluf dax walm
  Output: red red green green green

- Input: dax zup bluf
  Output: green yellow yellow

- Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
  Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

- Input: zup bluf dax
  Output: yellow yellow green

- Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
  Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Analyzing these examples, it seems that each distinct word is associated with a distinct color:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Looking specifically at the examples containing ""bluf,"" it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color that comes immediately before it:
- In the first example, ""wif"" is ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which then also outputs ""red.""
- In the second and fourth examples, ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which then outputs ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and both are ""red.""

Given these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.

Hence, the meaning is:

bluf -> The same color as the previous word.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""walm"" is somewhat dependent on the context, specifically on the word that appears immediately before it. Looking at the instances where ""walm"" appears, it seems to determine the number of colors in the output and might have a correlation with the preceding word.

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"", resulting in three yellows in the output.

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"", resulting in three greens in the output.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"", resulting in three blues in the output.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"", again resulting in three blues in the output.

5. Input: lug walm 
   Output: blue blue blue
   - This is a repeat of example 3, consistent with the same result.

From these examples, we deduce the following pattern:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color green is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the color yellow is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the color blue is repeated three times.

Based on this pattern, we can induce that ""walm"" is likely to mean ""repeat the last color mentioned three times.""

Therefore, ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the last color mentioned three times.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a word that corresponds to a color, repeat that color three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,35
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. In every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
To induce the rule for the nonce word dax, let's map out the color outputs corresponding to each word in the examples provided.

Considering the word ""dax"" appears at different positions in the inputs and always maps to ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of its position:

1. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
2. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
3. dax lug -> green blue
4. lug dax -> blue green
5. dax wif -> green red

From the examples, we can determine the following color associations with words other than dax:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> green
- wif -> red

Now, considering the constant association with ""green"" every time dax appears, irrespective of position or surrounding words, we can induce that the rule for dax is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green

Every instance of ""dax"" in the input correlates directly with ""green"" in the output, and this association does not change based on context.

Based on the examples provided:

- Every instance of ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- It seems that the words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" correspond to the colors ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

Therefore, the rule seems to be a direct mapping from nonce words to colors. Here is the deduced rule:

Rule: wif -> red

This means:
- ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""
- Each nonce word consistently maps to a specific color, regardless of its position in the sequence.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" I will look for patterns in the relationship between the input and output sequences. Let’s analyze the given examples:

1. Input: zup lug wif dax lug
   Output: yellow blue red green blue
   Here “zup” corresponds to “yellow”, and it appears before “lug” and “dax” which correspond to ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively.

2. Input: zup wif zup
   Output: yellow red yellow
   “zup” appears twice and both times it corresponds to “yellow”. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   “zup” corresponds to “yellow” again, and ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as ""zup"".
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" seems to elongate the count of the preceding color. 

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   This entry confirms that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""dax"" means ""green,"" ""wif"" means ""red"", and that ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color that follows ""zup"" (""yellow""). The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" again elongates the red color count.

5. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   Consistent with previous examples, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" followed by another red.

From these examples, it can be inferred that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or repetition. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""blue,"" with an important condition that it becomes ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif,"" and becomes yellow when it follows the word ""zup."" 

Rule: 
bluf -> ""blue"" when it stands alone or follows any word other than ""wif"" or ""zup"".
bluf -> ""red"" when it immediately follows the word ""wif"".
bluf -> ""yellow"" when it immediately follows the word ""zup"".
Based on the examples, walm appears to result in a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. Here's the reasoning:

1. In the first example, ""zup wif walm lug"" leads to ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to red, and ""walm"" results in additional reds.

2. In the second example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, resulting in additional yellows.

3. In the third example, ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green,"" with ""walm"" clearly repeating the color that ""dax"" corresponds to, which is green.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" yields ""green green green red blue green green green,"" where ""walm"" follows both instances of ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) and thus repeats green each time.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug"" leads to ""green green green yellow blue,"" which is consistent with the rule inferred: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats the color green.

Rule: walm -> causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: dax corresponds to the color green. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input examples is translated to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red"". Here is the rule broken down by example:

- ""dax zup wif"" -> ""green yellow red"": ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": The first ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"".
- ""zup wif lug"" -> ""yellow red blue"": ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again.
- ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red"": Both occurrences of ""wif"" correspond to ""red"".
- ""zup wif lug dax"" -> ""yellow red blue green"": Once more, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Based on the given examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Other words appear to translate to different colors (e.g., ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green""), but regardless of position or surrounding words, ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to replicate the color word that precedes it. Here's a breakdown of the examples and how they correspond to this rule:

- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"": Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the word ""blue.""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the word ""red.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"": The presence of ""lug"" and ""wif"" gives us ""blue red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the last mentioned color, in this case, ""red.""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": Again, ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats it, resulting in ""red red.""
- ""zup wif bluf zup"" -> ""yellow red red yellow"": ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the last mentioned color, which is ""red"" again. The last ""zup"" brings another ""yellow"" at the end.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the last mentioned color word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the input-output pairs provided.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Armed with these examples, one way to approach this problem is to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" (examples 1 and 5), the colors that follow ""walm"" are ""blue blue blue"" in both cases, regardless of whether ""walm"" appears immediately after ""lug"" or later in the sequence.

2. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" (examples 2 and 4), the colors that follow ""walm"" are ""yellow yellow yellow"" in example 2 and ""green yellow"" in example 4. The presence of ""green"" in example 4 can be linked to the presence of ""dax"" before ""walm.""

3. When ""walm"" appears towards the end of a sequence and is preceded by ""dax"" and ""lug"" (example 3), we see a mix of ""green green green"" followed by ""blue,"" which might suggest the influence of both ""dax"" and ""lug"" before ""walm.""

Assuming that ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" produce green, yellow, and blue respectively, and their influence extends until the next non-""walm"" word or the end of the sequence, the rule for ""walm"" could imply a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Given this pattern, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: The output after ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" until another non-""walm"" word appears or the sequence ends.

This means:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word 'lug' translates directly to the color 'blue'. There doesn't seem to be any conditional or contextual rules, as 'lug' consistently corresponds to 'blue' regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green"" consistently, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.

Hence, the rule we can infer is:
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
To deduce what 'wif' means, let's examine the examples provided:

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

2. Input: zup wif lug wif
   Output: yellow red blue red

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

5. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red

From these examples, it appears that each input word corresponds to a color in the output. The word 'wif' consistently appears before the word 'lug,' and each time these terms appear together, the output is 'red' followed by 'blue.'

Now, let's look specifically at examples involving 'wif':

1. ""wif lug"" outputs as ""red blue."" Therefore, it could be that 'wif' translates to 'red' and 'lug' translates to 'blue.'

2. ""zup wif lug wif"" outputs as ""yellow red blue red."" We have previously determined that 'lug' might translate to 'blue' and now see that the first 'wif' appears after 'zup' and the output sequence has 'red' after 'yellow.' The second 'wif' is without the word 'lug' after it but still translates to 'red.' 

3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs as ""blue blue blue red red."" The word 'wif' comes after 'walm' and before 'bluf,' and the output sequence has 'red' following two instances of 'blue' and another 'red' following the last 'blue.' This suggests that 'wif' means 'red' as it does not depend on being paired with 'lug' to translate as 'red,' and 'bluf' might mean 'red' as well.

4. ""lug bluf wif"" outputs as ""blue blue red."" Here, 'wif' is at the end and correlates with the last 'red' in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

So, the meaning of 'wif' appears to be 'red,' regardless of its position with respect to other words.
zup -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can consistently be determined as ""yellow."" 

Rule: zup translates to ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern that will help us determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf.""

Looking at the outputs, we can see that the word ""bluf"" consistently correlates with repeated colors. Specifically, we observe the following:

1. When ""wif bluf"" occurs, the output is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and that ""bluf"" causes the preceding color to repeat.
2. When ""zup bluf"" occurs, the output is ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" again causes the preceding color (""yellow,"" which we can infer corresponds to ""zup"") to repeat.
3. When ""bluf dax lug"" occurs, only ""yellow"" is repeated before ""green blue,"" which corresponds to ""dax lug.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat in the sequence. When ""bluf"" appears at the end of the input sequence, the last mentioned color is repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

For example:
- ""zup bluf"" has an output of ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" causes ""yellow"" (associated with ""zup"") to repeat.
- ""wif bluf"" has an output of ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" causes ""red"" (associated with ""wif"") to repeat.
Observing the patterns in the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

In every instance where ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" Let's consider each case:

1. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" After ""lug walm,"" we have ""blue blue blue,"" implying ""walm"" causes the preceding color ""blue"" to be repeated thrice.

2. ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow."" Again, ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

3. ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated thrice before presenting ""blue.""

4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" After ""dax walm,"" ""green"" is repeated thrice, similar to previous examples.

5. ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green."" The occurrence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" results once again in ""green"" being repeated thrice.

Based on the observed pattern, we can surmise that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the previous word three times. 

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,38
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we observe the following:

Input: lug -> Output: blue
Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red
Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow

From these examples, we can deduce that the word ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue."" Other words in the input, such as ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup,"" are producing different colors: green, red, and yellow, respectively. The pattern suggests that each word translates to a specific color in the output, and ""lug"" specifically correlates to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can induce that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. This remains true whether ""dax"" appears alone, at the beginning of the input, in the middle, or at the end. Hence, the rule that we can derive is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates consistently to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. The other words seem to translate to different colors consistently as well, although those mappings are not requested. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's see how ""zup"" behaves in different contexts:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Input: zup lug dax
Output: yellow blue green

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

By examining the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the output color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.

To further validate this rule, we can look at the other words and their corresponding outputs:

- ""walm"" consistently results in ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue.""
- ""dax"" consistently results in ""green.""
- ""bluf"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red"" (although each of these only appears once, making it less certain without more examples).

Now, in every case where ""zup"" is part of the input, it is paired with ""yellow"" in the output. This consistency across different contexts suggests that ""zup"" does indeed mean ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the examples given, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it.

For instance:

- ""dax"" leads to the color green, and when ""bluf"" follows it, green is repeated (""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"").
- ""lug"" leads to the color blue, and ""bluf"" following it results in a repetition of the color blue (""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"").
- ""wif"" is correlated with the color red, and similarly, ""bluf"" after that leads to red being repeated (""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"").

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word that comes directly before it and repeats that color in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" let's compare the outputs related to its presence across the various examples provided.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Here, ""walm"" appears between ""dax"" and ""wif."" The corresponding output is three greens followed by a red. The word ""dax"" on its own in other contexts seems to correspond to green.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

In this sequence, ""walm"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" and ""dax."" The word ""wif"" on its own does not always correspond to red, and ""zup"" at the end of a sequence sometimes corresponds to yellow. However, ""dax"" is consistently followed by green.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Here, ""walm"" falls after ""dax,"" and the colors are yellow (for ""zup"") followed by three greens, another yellow (for ""zup"") again, and finally a red for ""wif.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

In these last two examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" with no subsequent word, and the output is three greens.

From these examples, it seems that the presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to a repetition of the color corresponding to ""dax"" (which is green) two additional times, hence ""green green green."" When ""wif"" is the word following ""walm,"" the next color in the sequence is always red, which doesn't seem to be directly influenced by the word ""walm"" itself but rather by ""wif.""

Rule:

walm -> meaning: When following the word ""dax,"" ""walm"" causes the color green corresponding to ""dax"" to be repeated two additional times. The influence of ""walm"" in the presence of other words is not clear based on the provided examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,39
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the outputs.

Here's how this conclusion is reached using the examples:

- Example 1: Given that ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue"", and considering ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green"" in other examples, ""bluf"" also being ""red"" leaves ""lug"" to be ""blue.""
- Example 2: ""zup lug"" becomes ""yellow blue"", with no prior translation for ""zup"", ""lug"" is likely ""blue.""
- Example 3: ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" becomes ""red red blue green red."" Since ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and based on the previous conclusion that ""bluf"" is ""red"", it again leaves ""lug"" as ""blue.""
- Example 4: ""wif dax lug walm"" becomes ""red green blue blue blue."" As established, ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green"". With ""walm"" being ""blue blue"", the remaining word ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- Example 5: ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue"", with ""dax"" already known as ""green"", ""lug"" is left to be ""blue.""

Rule:
lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, there seems to be a consistent pattern where the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Here is the breakdown:

- ""lug zup dax walm"" matches ""blue yellow green green green."" Since ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" and ""zup"" by ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" is consistently matched with ""green,"" it seems that ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green.""
- ""dax zup walm wif"" matches ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by multiple ""yellow,"" which does not directly align with previous instances. However, since ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" this further supports the idea that ""dax"" means ""green.""
- ""zup wif dax"" matches ""yellow red green."" In this sequence, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""
- ""wif dax"" matches ""red green,"" which again suggests ""dax"" means ""green"" as ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" matches ""yellow blue red green green red."" Here ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""red"" respectively. Since ""bluf"" appears for the first time, it is inferred that ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" but because ""dax"" follows and is also ""green,"" we have again that ""dax"" consistently means ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

In the absence of a clear semantic meaning from the provided context, we look at the correspondences between the input and the output to determine the rule. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   - There are two instances of ""wif"" at the beginning and middle, both corresponding to ""red"". It's sandwiched between instances of ""red"".

2. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   - ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again, with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".

3. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   - ""Wif"" is proceeded by ""lug"" (blue) and is followed immediately by ""red"".

4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   - ""Wif"" is at the start and corresponds to ""red"".

5. Input: lug wif dax
   Output: blue red green
   - ""Wif"" is proceeded by ""lug"" (blue) and is followed immediately by ""red"".

These examples suggest that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position (start, middle, end) or the words that precede or follow it. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word zup translates to the color yellow each time it appears in the input. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is corresponding to the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Each unique non-""bluf"" word is paired with a unique color. Here are the associations based on the examples:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Now, let's analyze the use of ""bluf"" in each example:

1. Input: wif bluf  
   Output: red red  
   Here, ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"", which is red. 

2. Input: dax lug bluf  
   Output: green blue blue  
   In this case, ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""lug,"" which is blue.

3. Input: zup lug bluf wif  
   Output: yellow blue blue red  
   ""Bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""lug"" once again, which is blue, followed by ""wif"" with its associated color, red.

4. Input: wif bluf lug zup  
   Output: red red blue yellow  
   ""Bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif"" (red), followed by the colors for ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow).

5. Input: zup bluf  
   Output: yellow yellow  
   ""Bluf"" repeats the color for ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Rule: bluf -> repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of the color that follows the word in the output sequence. This repetition persists until a new word that has a color association appears. Let's examine the instances:

1. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" -- here, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""wif"" (red).
2. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" leads to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"" -- after ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color blue until ""wif"" introduces red, and ""dax"" introduces green.
3. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" -- ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax"" (green).
4. ""dax walm zup lug"" leads to ""green green green yellow blue"" -- here again, ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax"" (green) until ""zup"" (yellow) and then ""lug"" (blue) take over.
5. ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue"" -- after ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" repeats the color blue.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat until a new color-associated word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,40
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the relationship between the input and output in each example:

Example 1:
- Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
- Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Example 2:
- Input: zup lug walm wif walm
- Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Example 3:
- Input: lug dax zup dax wif
- Output: blue green yellow green red

Example 4:
- Input: lug zup walm lug
- Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Example 5:
- Input: lug zup
- Output: blue yellow

If we analyze the pattern, we notice that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in every example, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Therefore, the rule is:
lug -> blue

Meaning: lug corresponds to the color blue.
Given the examples, it looks like each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input. Therefore, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the given examples, whenever the nonce word 'wif' appears in the input, it corresponds to 'red' in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples, regardless of its position or the context in which it appears. Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned, the output consistently includes the color yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that the output is the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" in the input. Here are the specific cases:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output for ""zup"" is yellow. The output for ""bluf"" in this case is also yellow.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif"" is red. The output for ""bluf"" in this case is also red.
- The third input reiterates the pattern: ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" whose output is green, and the output for ""bluf"" is green as well.
- In the fourth input, the pattern continues: ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" with an output of green for both.
- Lastly, the fifth input has ""bluf"" following ""lug,"" and the output for both ""lug"" and ""bluf"" is blue.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> The output color is the same as the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before ""bluf"".

Rule: If a word X is followed by the word ""bluf,"" then the output for ""bluf"" will be the color associated with word X.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" it is important to look at the pattern of the outputs in each example where ""walm"" is used.

Input: zup walm wif  
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

In the first example, we see that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and before ""wif,"" we need to establish what the repeated ""yellow"" and the final ""red"" represent.

Input: wif lug dax walm  
Output: red blue green green green

In this example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Walm"" here results in a repetition of ""green.""

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm  
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

In this instance, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" doesn't have a direct translation, but the pattern suggests that ""walm"" again results in a repetition, this time of ""red.""

Input: zup walm  
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, with ""zup"" being ""yellow,"" ""walm"" again seems to create a repeated output of ""yellow.""

Input: wif lug walm  
Output: red blue blue blue

With ""wif"" being ""red"" and ""lug"" being ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in repeated ""blue.""

Looking at the patterns, ""walm"" appears to duplicate the color associated with the preceding word for the remaining outputs. Therefore:

walm -> Repeats the color output associated with the immediately preceding word in the sequence until the end of the output series.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a word that translates to a color, the output will repeat the color associated with that word for the rest of the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,41
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""lug"" appears as an input, the corresponding output is ""blue,"" regardless of the presence of other words like ""zup"" or ""dax"" alongside it. The word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the output always includes the color green. The presence and position of ""dax"" in the input sequence directly relate to the presence and position of the color green in the output sequence.

dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- Regardless of position in the sentence, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"".

So, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be determined as follows:

In the first example, ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue."" Here, ""zup"" is situated between ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" Because ""zup"" is corresponding to ""yellow,"" it's reasonable to initiate a hypothesis that ""zup"" might translate to ""yellow.""

The second example, ""lug zup dax wif"" which outputs ""blue yellow green red,"" also supports the initial hypothesis. Here again, ""zup"" results in the word ""yellow.""

The third example is even more direct: ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" This reinforces the idea that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" since it repeats the same color regardless of the following word, in this case, ""bluf,"" which is not previously defined but still results in the color ""yellow"" following ""zup.""

The fourth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" which results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue,"" provides the most substantial evidence. Here ""zup"" both begins and is inserted within the sequence, in both cases resulting in the word ""yellow.""

The fifth example, ""wif zup,"" translates to ""red yellow."" It follows the same pattern, where ""wif"" is known to correspond to ""red,"" and ""zup"" maintains its correspondence to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule we can extract from these examples is:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
Given the examples provided, we observe the following pattern:

Input: wif lug zup bluf | Output: red blue yellow yellow
Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug | Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

From these examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output color of the word immediately preceding it. Here is the evidence:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".
- In the second and third examples, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", and later again, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".

Thus, we can deduce:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: The output for ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, walm influences the color output in a manner that depends on the word(s) that precede it. We can analyze each example to determine the rule:

In examples 1 and 3, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is yellow.
In examples 2, 3, and 4, when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output color is blue.
In example 1, ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" yields red, but this seems to be coincidental as ""wif"" alone also outputs red in the first example. This suggests ""wif"" independently corresponds to red.

However, when we compare examples 4 and 5, we notice that when ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the color output is green. Additionally, in example 5, ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" and the output is red, which aligns with ""wif""'s standalone output from example 1. This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" may actually just carry on the color output associated with the word before it rather than having its own unique color.

By examining all the examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the previous word:

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
""Wif"" = red, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
""Dax"" = green, ""lug"" = blue, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug.""

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
""Zup"" = yellow, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" ""lug"" = blue.

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
""Dax"" = green, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" ""zup"" = yellow, ""lug"" = blue, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug.""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
""Dax"" = green, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" ""wif"" = red.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color output associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm wif
    ",Output: yellow yellow red,yellow yellow yellow red,False,42
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all examples provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Let's analyze the first set of examples to see if we can identify any patterns related to ""wif.""

1. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow green red red green
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" except after ""wif.""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" translates to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" after ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

In the output, ""red"" only appears after ""wif"" is introduced, suggesting a possible correlation.

2. Input: zup lug zup lug wif
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" stands alone at the end and translates to ""red.""

3. Input: lug zup wif lug
   Output: blue yellow red blue
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" comes first, translating to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" follows the same translation.

5. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   - Each word corresponds directly to a color: ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" again translates to ""red.""

Based on these examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. Thus, ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to function as a repeater or duplicator of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Each word in the input (zup, wif, dax, etc.) corresponds to a unique color in the output (yellow, red, green, etc.), and when ""bluf"" follows one of these words, the color associated with that word is repeated in the output.

Here are the examples broken down:

1. ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,' which is yellow.
2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" becomes ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" and ""lug walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of blue.
3. ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
4. ""dax lug bluf dax"" becomes ""green blue blue green"" - ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue, but does not affect the following ""dax,"" which corresponds to green again.
5. ""zup bluf"" (the same as example 1) again becomes ""yellow yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> duplication of the previous word's associated color.
Based on the provided input-output pairs, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color of the word just before it, thrice.

Let's look at each input-output pair:

1. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and is immediately followed by ""walm"", which results in ""blue blue blue"".
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", followed by ""wif"" which correlates with ""red"".
   - ""lug"" again leads to ""blue"" followed by ""wif"" which correlates with ""red"".
   
2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and is followed by ""walm"", which translates to ""blue blue blue"".

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", ""wif"" with ""red"", and ""walm"" results in repeating ""red"" thrice.

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""green"" thrice.

5. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", ""wif"" with ""red"", ""walm"" repeats ""red"" thrice, and ""lug"" gives ""blue"".

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows any word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,43
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output. In every example where ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the patterns of input and output in the given examples:

1. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
2. Input: dax walm zup lug | Output: green green green yellow blue
3. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm | Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
4. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
5. Input: zup bluf dax | Output: yellow yellow green

Analyzing the output patterns and their corresponding inputs:

- Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the immediate output color following it is ""green."" This pattern holds true across the examples provided, irrespective of the position of ""dax"" in the input.
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" when ""dax"" is also in the input.
- The word ""walm"" follows the word ""dax"" and results in repeated ""green"" colors except in the third input, where ""dax"" comes after ""walm"" and does not affect it.
- The presence of ""zup"" seems to correspond with the color ""yellow"" whether ""dax"" is present or not.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to red, but it does not seem to interact specifically with ""dax.""

Taking these observations into account, the rule seems to be: 

Rule: When ""dax"" is in the input, the output that directly follows ""dax"" will be ""green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the outputs. Additionally, ""dax"" appears to trigger a sequence of ""green"" outputs when followed immediately by ""walm,"" but it does not influence the color representation of the words that follow it unless it directly precedes ""walm.""

Therefore:

dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. By examining the consistency of the colors following each word, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"".

From the first and fourth examples:

Input: dax wif zup
Output: green red yellow

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

In both instances, ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""red"". ""Zup"" in the first example corresponds to ""yellow"".

From the second example:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

""Zup"" at the beginning is once again followed by ""yellow"". ""Bluf"" has not appeared in any prior examples, but since it is followed by ""yellow"", it is possibly synonymous with ""zup"" in terms of color output. ""Walm"" has also not appeared before, but it is followed by ""red"" twice, which might suggest that ""wif"" somehow repeats the color that follows it, except that doesn't follow with the ""red"" after ""wif"" at the beginning.

From the third example:

Input: wif dax wif
Output: red green red

Here, ""wif"" is both at the beginning and end and corresponds to ""red"" both times, confirming ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"". ""Dax"" is in the middle and aligns with ""green"", as seen in previous examples.

From the fifth example:

Input: wif zup lug
Output: red yellow blue

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, as previously identified, and ""lug"" is a new word that corresponds to blue.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that each unique word maps to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" in each context it appears.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" each time it appears in the input, regardless of its position or surrounding words.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" To determine the association between the preceding words and their respective colors:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Now we will analyze each example.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- The word 'zup' is followed by 'walm,' and the output is 'yellow' repeated thrice.

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green
- The word 'dax' is followed by 'walm,' yielding 'green' repeated thrice.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- The same as the first input, 'zup' followed by 'walm' produces 'yellow' repeated thrice.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- Here, 'wif' is followed by 'walm' giving 'red' repeated thrice, and later 'zup' is followed by 'walm,' resulting in 'yellow' repeated thrice.

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green
- In this case, 'dax' is followed by 'walm,' resulting in 'green' repeated thrice.

Therefore, it seems the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning in this context is the word ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
From the given examples, it appears that each specific word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
- Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input, it consistently maps to ""green"".
- Other words also have consistent mappings: ""wif"" to ""red"", ""bluf"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". However, we don't have a color for ""walm"" since it doesn't have a corresponding color in the output example — it is followed by repetitions of ""yellow"", which maps to ""zup"".

So the meaning of ""dax"" according to the examples provided is ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output:

- Input: ""wif"" -> Output: ""red""
- Input: ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> Output: ""blue red blue green green"" (wif correlates with red)
- Input: ""wif dax zup"" -> Output: ""red green yellow"" (wif correlates with red)
- Input: ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> Output: ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"" (wif correlates with red)
- Input: ""wif bluf"" -> Output: ""red red"" (wif correlates with red and bluf appears to correlate with red as well)

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the inputs translates to ""yellow"" in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds consistently with the color ""red."" In every case where ""bluf"" is included in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. No other input word consistently results in the output of ""red,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" specifically translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the color outputs in correlation with the presence of ""walm"" and other words.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" also to red, ""dax"" to red, and ""zup"" to a combination of green and yellow.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

In this example, the presence of ""dax"" results in a green output, but ""wif"" and ""walm"" once again correspond to red.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here, both ""dax"" and ""walm"" result in the color green.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Similar to the first example, ""zup"" results in yellow, and ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to red.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

This example suggests that ""zup"" and ""walm"" both result in the color yellow.

From these observations, we can infer the following rule related to the color output for ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" is combined with either ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup,"" it changes its color output to match the color output associated with the accompanying word.
- Therefore, when ""walm"" is with ""wif,"" it turns red; when with ""dax,"" it turns green; and with ""zup,"" it becomes yellow.
- When ""walm"" is only with ""dax,"" the output is uniformly green, indicating that ""walm"" might also have a prioritization rule where its output color matches that of ""dax"" when they are together without ""wif"" or ""zup.""

This leads to a possible context-dependent rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" mimics the color output of the word it is paired with; if paired with ""dax"" without ""wif"" or ""zup,"" its output is green. 

Summary: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" takes on the color output of the word it accompanies, with a potential priority for green when paired with ""dax"" alone.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm zup
    ",Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow,red red red yellow,False,45
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Rule: dax -> green

Every instance of ""dax"" in the inputs corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs. This direct correlation, where ""dax"" consistently equals ""green,"" allows us to deduce that ""dax"" means ""green.""
wif -> meaning. Meaning: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Rule: Every time ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red"".
zup -> yellow.

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the input sequence.
Observing the examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

By analyzing the given input-output pairs, we can discern the following:

1. ""bluf"" tends to be associated with the color mentioned immediately after the same color in the output. For instance, in the first example, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" and the output color for ""wif"" is ""red,"" while the color following ""bluf"" is also ""red."" This is consistent across all the examples except for the last element in the output, which can interpret as being unable to look further for a consecutive color match.
2. There does not seem to be a direct one-to-one correspondence that would suggest that ""bluf"" translates to a specific color since in the last example, ""bluf"" corresponds to two occurrences of ""yellow,"" and in others, it produces a repeated color that came before it.

From these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color that is mentioned immediately before it, causing a repetition of that color in the output. If ""bluf"" is the last word in the input, it results in a repetition of the last color mentioned before it in the output, but no new color is assigned to it since there is no following context to compare.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

bluf -> causes the repetition of the previous color in the output sequence
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" it's beneficial to analyze the patterns surrounding its use in the examples provided. Let's look at each instance and compare them:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   
2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   
4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   
5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Each input line includes ""walm,"" and in the corresponding output, we can observe repetitions of a color starting with the color that directly follows ""walm."" Specifically:

- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif lug"" and the output is ""blue blue blue ...""  
- In example 2, ""walm"" is not followed by any other word and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow ...""  
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax lug"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow green blue ...""
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax wif lug"" and the output is ""blue blue blue green red blue ...""  
- In example 5, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup wif"" and the output is ""green green green yellow red ...""

Notice that the word following ""walm"" in the examples seems to dictate the color that is repeated. Therefore, the word ""walm"" indicates that the color of the word following it should be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,46
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" seems to consistently correspond with the color ""blue"" in the outputs. There's no variation in the output related to the position of ""lug"" within the input sequences or its relationship to other words. Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze each input/output pair and see if we can find a consistent rule.

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - Both instances of ""dax"" correspond to the color ""green.""

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   - The first instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

3. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   - The two instances of ""dax"" both correspond to ""green.""

4. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - The instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   - The instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once more.

Based on these examples, it seems that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or surrounding words. Therefore, we can deduce the rule as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is included in the output at the position corresponding to where ""wif"" appears in the input.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the patterns in the input and the corresponding output.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Observation: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" when it follows ""dax.""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
Observation: ""Bluf"" still translates to ""green."" The presence of ""wif"" before ""dax"" adds ""red"" to the output, but doesn't change the meaning of ""bluf.""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
Observation: This is more complex, but ""bluf"" at the end still results in a final ""blue."" It should be noted that the presence of ""wif"" before ""bluf"" no longer affects ""bluf,"" as it did when ""dax"" followed ""wif."" It appears ""lug"" may be translating to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" consistent with previous examples, but the position of ""bluf"" is not directly before ""wif"" in this case.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
Observation: Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and translates to ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif."" It seems that ""bluf"" takes on the character or color immediately to its left when it's followed by a defined word (""dax"").

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Observation: This is a repeat of the first example and supports the initial observation.

Based on these observations, the rules for the nonce word ""bluf"" appear to be context-dependent:

1. When ""bluf"" follows a color word, it repeats the color of the preceding word.
2. When ""bluf"" precedes a color word, it does not affect the output color for that word following it, but itself takes on the color associated with the word to its immediate left.
   
Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> When following a color-associated word, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word. When preceding a color-associated word, ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with its immediate left word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repeated output of the color that precedes it three times. Here is the breakdown according to each example:

1. ""lug dax walm"" maps to ""blue green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which maps to ""green,"" and the output associated with ""walm"" is ""green"" repeated three times.

2. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" maps to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which maps to ""yellow,"" and thus ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated three times.

3. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" maps to ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" The first ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" mapping to ""red,"" resulting in ""red"" repeated three times, and the second ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" yielding ""yellow"" repeated three times.

4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" maps to ""red red green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color ""green,"" producing ""green"" three times subsequently.

5. ""lug zup dax walm"" maps to ""blue yellow green green green."" ""Walm"" again follows ""dax,"" mapping to ""green,"" and hence, we have ""green"" repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> The color word preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the provided examples, every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" in this context is the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red.""

2. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow,"" so ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red.""

5. ""zup lug wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the context provided by the examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the Output. 

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the corresponding outputs of each input where ""bluf"" is present.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

From these examples, it seems that the occurrence of ""bluf"" directly contributes to the repetition of the color directly preceding it (in terms of output). ""Bluf"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word before it. Hence, in the outputs, the color before ""bluf"" is doubled.

Example-based deduction:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and when ""bluf"" follows, another yellow appears in output.
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and when ""bluf"" follows, we see an additional green in the output.
- This pattern continues in all other given examples, confirming the role of ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the preceding word in the output sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to influence the output in a specific way. The rule governing ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color that precedes it in the sequence, except in cases where the word ""dax"" (green) follows ""walm,"" which then leads to the repeating of yellow before green is presented. This suggests that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the previous color, with a special rule when followed by ""dax.""

Here's the reasoning:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), the color blue is repeated: ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""walm"" is after ""zup"" (yellow), and no ""dax"" (green) follows, the color yellow is repeated: ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), ""yellow"" is outputted before the expected ""green"": ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green"".

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color that directly precedes it, with yellow inserted before green if ""dax"" follows ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a unique color. Here's the association between the nonce words and their respective colors, as indicated by the examples:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> green (assuming this is not a typo for ""dax"")
- wif -> red

Considering this, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" appears to be consistent across all examples. Regardless of its position or the context in which it is used, ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red. Thus, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'. Every occurrence of 'zup' in the input correlates with 'yellow' in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" has an output that matches the color of the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown by example:

- In ""dax zup wif bluf lug,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also outputs ""red.""
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" as well.
- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" and again ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow.""
- In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" outputs ""blue.""

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> adopts the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns and consistencies in the correlation between the input and output sequences. Let's analyze each example provided.

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

By examining the input and output sequences:

1. It seems that the output sequence always contains one more color compared to the number of words in the input sequence.
2. ""dax"" correlates with green, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, and ""wif"" correlates with red since those are consistent across all examples provided.
3. ""lug"" is associated with blue.
4. ""bluf"" does not have a direct correlation provided, which makes it harder to deduce with certainty (it could be an outlier, or could be associated with additional red since ""bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"").
5. The word ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the last color mentioned before it appears, up to the total number of times that ""walm"" appears consecutively, plus one. For example:

- In the first input, ""wif"" precedes a single ""walm,"" resulting in ""red red red"" (one “red” for “wif” and two additional for ""walm"").
- In the third input, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"" (one “green” for “dax” and two additional for ""walm"").

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the preceding color in the output sequence an additional two times after the original appearance of that color.

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding color to repeat in the output sequence two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True,49
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example, regardless of its position within the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: Each word in the input is mapped to a specific color in the output. ""Dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow. The position of the words does not alter these mappings, so the rule appears to be that each word is a direct substitute for a color.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the given examples to see what output is consistently associated with this word. We will look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red."" Since ""wif"" is the last word and it corresponds to the last color ""red,"" it might indicate that it contributes to the color ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and both correspond to ""red red"" at the end of the sequence. This possibly means ""wif"" could contribute a ""red"" to the sequence, regardless of what follows it.
- In the third example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" with ""wif"" at the beginning. This indicates that ""wif"" produces a ""red,"" and the rest of the sequence follows a separate pattern.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red,"" which supports the idea that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" translates to a single ""red"" in the sequence. Here is the rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""bluf"" is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context provided by surrounding words. There does not seem to be a variation in the meaning of ""bluf"" given different circumstances, suggesting that its translation is consistent.

Rule: bluf -> yellow.
The word ""walm"" likely represents a rule for repeating the color associated with the word that follows it, three times. 

Let's examine each example to see how this applies:

1. lug walm dax → blue (from lug) blue blue (from walm applied to dax) green (from dax)
2. dax walm wif → green (from dax) green green (from walm applied to wif) red (from wif)
3. dax lug dax lug walm → green (from dax) blue (from lug) green (from dax) blue (from lug) blue (from walm replicated from the last color mentioned, which is lug = blue) blue (continued from rule)
4. lug walm zup walm → blue (from lug) blue blue (from walm applied to zup) yellow (from zup) yellow (from walm replicated from the last color mentioned, which is zup = yellow) yellow (continued from rule)
5. zup walm dax zup dax wif → yellow (from zup) yellow yellow (from walm applied to dax) green (from dax) yellow (from zup) green (from dax) red (from wif)

Based on these examples and the derived rule, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color denoted by the following word:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the following word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples. Regardless of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words, whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

- Every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
- There is a consistent one-to-one relationship between the appearance of ""dax"" in the input and ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" or the presence of other words.

Considering these observations, we can determine the rule:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the following rule can be deduced:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the output is ""red"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the context or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the corresponding colors for each input and output pair. Let's analyze each example:

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" the same as in the first example.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" but since ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow"" and no other color is output, this example suggests that ""bluf"" does not change color, rather, it repeats the color of the word before it.

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
- ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" which is a repetition of the color for ""dax"" before it.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""Bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" repeating the color of ""zup"" before it.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word that comes before it. 

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it, three times. Below are the deductions from the examples given:

1. In the first example, ""lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue red red red blue,"" implying that ""wif"" which corresponds to red, is repeated thrice when followed by ""walm.""

2. In the second example, ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow,"" where both ""wif"" and ""zup"" are repeated thrice when followed by ""walm.""

3. The third example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" results in ""green green green red blue green green green,"" indicating that ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, is repeated thrice when followed by ""walm.""

4. In the fourth example, ""lug wif zup wif walm"" leads to ""blue red yellow red red red,"" meaning that ""wif"" is repeated thrice after ""walm.""

5. The fifth example, ""dax walm,"" is simply ""green green green,"" confirming that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""dax"" (green) to be repeated three times.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be written as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug bluf dax wif
    ",Output: yellow green green green blue blue green red,yellow green green green blue blue green red,True,51
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" is used to represent the color blue in the examples provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's examine the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: lug dax zup dax wif
   Output: blue green yellow green red

2. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red

3. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

4. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Looking at each, we can try to match other words to colors and see what role ""dax"" plays:

- ""lug"" consistently maps to blue.
- ""zup"" consistently maps to yellow.
- ""wif"" consistently maps to red.
- ""walm"" consistently maps to red.

Where ""dax"" appears, it maps to green. It happens regardless of its position in the sequence, suggesting that ""dax"" consistently represents the color green, and it does not seem dependent on other words in its context.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" When it appears alone or with other words before it, it still results in ""red"" being in the output. It appears that other words such as ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" correspond to their own colors as well. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" also to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Here is the reasoning based on the input and output pairs:

- When the input is simply ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" (as in ""dax wif""), the output is ""green red,"" indicating that ""dax"" means ""green.""
- ""zup dax wif"" leads to ""yellow green red,"" which suggests ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
- In ""dax zup walm wif,"" ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" before ""red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" also means ""yellow.""
- In ""dax lug wif lug,"" the appearance of ""lug"" both before and after ""wif"" results in ""blue"" both times, suggesting ""lug"" means ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" There is no context provided that changes the output of ""zup"" to anything other than ""yellow."" Despite different words accompanying ""zup"" in the input (such as ""wif"" or ""lug bluf""), ""zup"" still results in ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, we will attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" We'll look at each example and the corresponding output, trying to establish a relationship between the input word sequence and the output color sequence. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

1. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   
   From this example, we can see that 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and it is followed by 'bluf' which also translates to 'green.'

2. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green

   In this sequence, 'wif' correlates to 'red,' 'dax' to 'green,' and 'zup' to 'yellow.' Notably, the sequence 'dax bluf' appears again, yielding 'green green' just as it did in the first example.

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

   This is a repetition of the first example, reinforcing that 'dax bluf' corresponds to 'green green.'

4. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

   Here, 'zup' still corresponds to 'yellow' and 'dax' to 'green,' as previously established. 'Lug' corresponds to 'blue.' Importantly, 'bluf' follows 'zup' and also translates to 'yellow' which indicates that 'bluf' may simply be a repetition of the color associated with the word right before it.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

   The term 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' 'zup' to 'yellow,' and 'lug' to 'blue' again. The word 'bluf' follows 'zup' yielding another 'yellow.' It does not translate the same with 'lug,' indicating 'walm' might be affecting the output for 'bluf.' However, 'bluf' following 'lug' did not give us 'blue blue,' so 'walm' seems not to affect 'bluf' and we can disregard that point.

Upon reviewing these examples, 'bluf' appears to be consistently repeating the color of the word that comes directly before it. 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word
Given the examples, it seems that the output color for the nonce word ""walm"" is not a constant color but rather takes on the color of the word that precedes it. Here are the observations:

- dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
  ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red""; previously ""wif"" also gives ""red"".

- lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
  ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the result is ""blue""; ""lug"" also results in ""blue"".

- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
  ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces ""yellow""; ""zup"" results in ""yellow"".

- dax walm lug -> green green green blue
  ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green""; ""dax"" gives ""green"".

- zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
  ""walm"" follows ""zup"" here and produces ""yellow""; ""zup"" results in ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes on the color associated with the word just before it.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm wif walm dax lug dax
    ",Output: green green red red green blue green,green green green red red red green blue green,False,52
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green."" No matter the context or the additional words paired with ""dax,"" the output remains ""green"" whenever ""dax"" is input.

dax -> meaning. Meaning: ""dax"" means ""green"".

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is input, the output is ""green"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context or the other words present in the input. Here are the examples provided with a direct mapping of ""wif"" to ""red"":

- ""wif walm"" maps to ""red red red"" (red corresponds to ""wif"")
- ""dax lug bluf wif"" maps to ""green blue blue red"" (red corresponds to ""wif"")
- ""wif"" by itself maps to ""red"" (red corresponds to ""wif"")
- ""lug bluf wif"" maps to ""blue blue red"" (red corresponds to ""wif"")
- ""wif"" by itself again maps to ""red"" (red corresponds to ""wif"")

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" is:
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can try to infer the meaning of ""zup"" by looking for patterns and consistent elements. 

Let's look at the position of ""zup"" in the input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   ""zup"" is in the first position.

2. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   ""zup"" is in the first position.

3. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   ""zup"" is in the second position after ""dax.""

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   ""zup"" is in the last position.

5. Input: lug zup wif
   Output: blue yellow red
   ""zup"" is in the second position after ""lug.""

From examples 1 and 2, ""zup"" at the beginning is consistently resulting in ""yellow"" at the beginning, which convolutes the direct association because, in example 3, when ""zup"" is not the first word, it still translates to ""yellow"" whereas ""dax"" is ""green"". The consistent association here is that whenever ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is part of the output.

Example 4 shows ""zup"" appearing at the end, and it translates to ""yellow"" at the end of the output. Example 5 reaffirms that the position of ""zup"" in the sequence is tied to where ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Therefore, we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
From the given examples, we can induce the following rules for the word ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is the color green repeated twice.
2. When ""bluf"" follows any other word except ""dax"", the output is the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf"" repeated twice.

By analyzing the outputs further:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"": This shows that ""bluf"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated.
- ""lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue green green"": Here ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", which falls under rule 1.
- ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" -> ""red yellow yellow red green"": ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", and ""yellow"" is repeated.
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"": ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and ""red"" is repeated.
- ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green"": The last ""bluf"" is forced by ""dax"", so ""green"" is repeated.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: ""bluf"" alone translates to the color associated with the word right before it, repeated twice; except when that word is ""dax"", which makes the output ""green green"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns associated with ""walm"" in the input and corresponding patterns in the output. Examining the given examples:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

From these examples, we can see the following patterns:

- Every occurrence of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to repeated outputs of ""green"" (three times).
- The number of repetitions of ""green"" does not depend on the surrounding words. ""Walm"" directly after ""dax"" or before ""zup"" results in the same pattern of three greens.
- We can also note that ""lug"" consistently corresponds with ""blue"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" This consistency supports the idea that ""walm"" has a specific translation independent of context.
- Another word, ""zup,"" is associated with ""yellow"" in the outputs.

Given these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" specifically corresponds to the triplet of ""green"" in the output, no matter the context it appears in within the input.

Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the word ""green"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug
    ",Output: blue green blue,blue green blue,True,53
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of context within the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green in each given example.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position. There doesn't seem to be any context-dependent variation in the output related to ""wif"".

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's compare the outputs side by side with the presence of ""zup"" in the input:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
3. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
4. zup lug -> yellow blue
5. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green

Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position of ""zup."" This suggests a direct translation.

However, in the last example, ""zup"" appears before ""dax"" and the output sequence is ""red yellow green green"" where ""yellow"" is followed by two instances of ""green"" which corresponds to the term ""dax"" appearing twice in the combined inputs involving ""dax.""

Hence, it can be deduced that the meaning of ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"" when present in an input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> the color indicated by the preceding word. Rule: Bluf repeats the color named by the word immediately before it. For example, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" means blue, so ""bluf"" also translates to blue in this context.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at each example:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
Here, the word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in an additional ""green"", indicating that ""walm"" might mean a repeat of the previous word or action.

2. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and yet again, an additional ""green"" is observed, consistent with the idea that ""walm"" could involve repeating the previous action.

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
In this sequence, ""walm"" occurs after ""wif"" and then it is followed by ""red"" twice, which again suggests that ""walm"" might be a command to repeat the action associated with ""wif"".

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and the result is additional ""yellow"", this supports the repeating hypothesis.

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and again we see the action associated with ""wif"" being repeated (red).

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" means to repeat the output of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the action/output associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,54
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

The given examples indicate that when the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the output includes the color ""blue."" Thus, the rule for the word ""lug"" by itself is that it corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" should appear in the output at the corresponding position.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the provided examples.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every input that includes the word ""wif"" results in the color ""red"" appearing in the output. There are no counterexamples in the provided data.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input or the other words around it, the output is always ""yellow"" when ""zup"" is present.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue

2. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

5. Input: zup lug bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue red

From these examples, we can deduce a pattern concerning the position of ""bluf"" in the input and its translation in the output:

- When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug"" (example 1 and 5), the output is ""blue blue."" We notice that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" so it seems that ""bluf"" might repeat the word that comes just before it.
- In examples 2 and 4, the word that comes just before ""bluf"" is a different color each time (""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green""), and each time, ""bluf"" causes the color to repeat.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is situated after ""zup"" and produces ""yellow"" in the output. However, this is still consistent with the idea that ""bluf"" is causing a repetition because ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> means repeat the previous color word in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let us look closely at each input and output example, focusing on where ""walm"" appears.

1. Input: zup walm lug wif → Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
    - When ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" the color yellow follows.

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif → Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
    - ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" here and is followed by ""wif."" The color blue repeats three times before changing.

3. Input: dax zup dax walm → Output: green yellow green green green
    - After ""dax"" and ""zup"" comes ""walm,"" resulting in a repetition of the color green.

4. Input: lug dax walm → Output: blue green green green
    - When ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and ""dax,"" we see the color green repeated.

5. Input: lug wif zup wif walm → Output: blue red yellow red red red
    - Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" twice, and the output is repeated reds.

Now, based on these observations, let's deduce the rule:

When ""walm"" appears, it seems to cause the output to repeat the previously mentioned color. For example:
- After ""zup,"" which is yellow, there's ""walm,"" and the color yellow is repeated.
- After ""lug,"" which is blue, there's ""walm,"" and the color blue is repeated.
- After ""dax,"" which is green, there's ""walm,"" and the color green is repeated.
- After ""wif,"" which is red, there's ""walm,"" and the color red is repeated.

Therefore, the rule we can induce:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the immediately preceding color.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,55
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the output ""red,"" regardless of the words that follow it. There is no example where ""wif"" is associated with any color other than red.

Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- When ""wif"" stands alone, as in the example ""wif,"" it outputs ""red.""
- When ""wif"" precedes other words, it still translates to ""red,"" but does not seem to affect the colors assigned to the words that follow. See ""wif lug dax lug"" resulting in ""red blue green blue"" and ""wif lug bluf"" resulting in ""red blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be independent of its position or the presence of other words. It consistently leads to the output ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

To confirm this rule, we observe the consistent presence of the word ""zup"" in the input and the corresponding appearance of the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Here are the patterns exemplified:

1. ""wif walm zup"" leads to ""red red red yellow,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" possibly corresponds to ""yellow"" in this context and ""zup"" definitely corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. ""zup wif"" leads to ""yellow red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. ""wif lug zup bluf"" leads to ""red blue yellow yellow,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and although ""bluf"" seems like a variation of ""blue,"" in this context it corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. ""dax zup wif"" leads to ""green yellow red,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

There is a slight inconsistency in the second example, where ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" while in the first example it results in ""red."" This inconsistency could be due to a context-dependent meaning for ""walm,"" since ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to ""yellow."" 

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Looking at the provided examples, we can see that ""bluf"" is always translated to a color. To determine the specific meaning, let's look at the context in which ""bluf"" appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. lug bluf -> blue blue
   This indicates that bluf could mean blue, but we need more examples to confirm.

2. wif bluf -> red red
   This suggests bluf could mean red; however, this conflicts with the previous example.

3. bluf dax -> yellow green
   This pair does not immediately suggest what ""bluf"" could mean.

Comparing all instances, we notice that ""bluf"" is not consistently translated to the same color. Therefore, ""bluf"" may depend on the context or the word that comes before or after it.

Here's the pattern we can deduce:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it is translated to blue.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it is translated to red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it is translated to yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows or precedes any other word, its translation does not seem to pattern with the deduced rule.

We can hypothesize that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word,"" as when it follows ""lug"" (blue), it is also blue, and when it follows ""wif"" (red), it becomes red. This rule does not account for the sequence ""bluf dax,"" where it becomes yellow, but if we assume an inconsistency or an error in the examples, the rule still holds in most cases.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs.

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" leads to ""green green green red blue green green green."" The word ""walm"" appears twice, and in both cases, the sequence ""green green green"" follows it.
- The second example, ""lug walm dax,"" results in ""blue blue blue green."" Again, ""walm"" is followed by a triple ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax zup dax walm,"" we see ""green yellow green green green,"" with the ""walm"" being followed by two additional ""green.""
- The fourth example, ""lug walm,"" has the output ""blue blue blue,"" with ""walm"" being followed by a triple ""blue.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" we have three ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, we can identify a pattern: the word ""walm"" is consistently followed by three of the same colors. The color that follows ""walm"" appears to be dependent on the word that precedes ""walm"":

- If the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" the following color is ""green.""
- If the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" the following color is ""blue.""
- If the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" the following color is ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" has not preceded ""walm"" directly, so we can't determine the specific color relation, but we know that when ""zup"" was the last word before ""walm,"" the color was yellow.

Rule: ""walm"" -> The output will be three of the same color corresponding to the last word before ""walm."" 

""Dax"" correlates with green, ""lug"" with blue, and ""zup"" with yellow. The color associated with ""wif"" before ""walm"" is undetermined within the given examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, lug appears to be translated as the color blue consistently. However, let's analyze the examples more deeply to ensure that this is indeed the case.

Input: lug
Output: blue
- Only the word lug is present and is translated as blue.

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- Here, lug again corresponds to blue, and we can see that it's repeated at the end with the same translation. Wif appears to correspond to red, zup to yellow, and walm seems to repeat the last color mentioned, since after wif is translated to red, walm repeats red, and after zup is translated to yellow, walm repeats yellow.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- In this example, lug is first, translating to blue, and walm appears to repeat the color before it for both occurrences.

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
- Again, lug corresponds to blue and walm repeats the color before it. Wif is consistent with red, and a new element dax is introduced, which translates to green.

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- Lug still translates to blue, wif to red, and dax to green. Walm again repeats the color before it.

Based on these observations, the consistent translation for lug is blue, and the repetitions seem to be a property of the word walm instead of lug.

Rule: lug -> blue
By looking at the repeated usage of the nonce word ""dax"" in varying positions within the input and the corresponding output, we can deduce its meaning by finding a pattern associated with it. Let us match the inputs and outputs:

1. wif lug dax -> red blue green
2. dax lug wif -> green blue red
3. lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue
4. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
5. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green

The word ""dax"" appears in different positions and has a consistent output:

- When ""dax"" appears first, as in Example 2, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears in the middle, as in Example 1 and Example 3, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is the last word, as in Example 4 twice, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is the second word, as in Example 5, the output is ""green.""
  
House Rule Induction:
- ""dax"" maps to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule:
dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the series of words. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following correlations between inputs and outputs:

1. Whenever ""zup"" is present on its own, the output is ""yellow"". 
2. ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", as evidenced by the presence of ""lug"" alongside the word ""yellow"" in the output when ""zup"" is present, and ""blue blue blue"" following ""lug walm,"" suggesting that ""walm"" could be another modifier or repetition rule that results in multiple ""blue"".
3. The presence of ""zup"" twice in the last example with other words ""dax"" and ""wif"" in between also results in the word ""yellow"" appearing twice in the output with ""green"" and ""red"" in between, which likely correspond to ""dax"" and ""wif,"" respectively.

Taking all of the above into account, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

Therefore:

zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> blue when following lug, yellow when following zup, and remains bluf otherwise.
Analyzing the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" triggers repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, and it repeats the color thrice. Each specific word before ""walm"" corresponds to a unique color:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""

Let's check this rule against the examples provided:

- Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   Rule check: ""lug"" -> blue, then ""walm"" triggers three times blue. ""wif"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow, followed by red from ""wif"".
  
- Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule check: ""dax"" -> green, then ""walm"" triggers three times green.
  
- Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   Rule check: ""wif"" -> red, then ""walm"" triggers three times red. ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red, and ""lug"" -> blue followed by ""walm"" which triggers three times blue.
  
- Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Rule check: ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, then ""walm"" triggers three times yellow, followed by ""wif"" -> red.
  
- Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule check: ""zup"" -> yellow, then ""walm"" triggers three times yellow.

Given this consistent pattern in the examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax bluf wif
    ",Output: green green red,green green red,True,57
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" we can look at the patterns in each of the examples given.

From the first input-output pair:
Input: lug zup wif lug
Output: blue yellow red blue

Here, ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" both times, which is consistent. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From the second pair:
Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again, ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""bluf"" is not present in the previous example, but since it corresponds to ""red,"" it seems unrelated to ""lug,"" since ""lug"" has consistently corresponded to ""blue.""

The third and fourth pairs:
Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Each time, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" irrespective of the word that comes before it.

The fifth pair:
Input: lug dax zup
Output: blue green yellow

Again, regardless of its position, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Considering the evidence, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently means ""blue,"" independent of context.

Rule:
lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look at the consistent pattern in the examples provided:

Input: dax
Output: green

We see that ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup wif dax
Output: yellow red green

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

In this example, ""dax"" remains ""green,"" ""bluf"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

In this longer sequence, we can see that each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" is likely to correspond to ""yellow"" as well.

Based on these inputs and outputs, and the consistency across examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of context within the given examples. It maintains this meaning as a standalone word or when combined with other words.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the provided examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. `zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup` -> `yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow`
2. `lug bluf wif` -> `blue blue red`
3. `zup dax zup dax wif bluf` -> `yellow green yellow green red red`
4. `wif bluf` -> `red red`
5. `dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax` -> `green blue blue blue green red red green`

By examining the patterns, ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. For example:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""lug"" stands for ""blue"", so the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"". The pattern repeats twice.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue), so it corresponds to ""blue"" again.
- In the third input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), hence it corresponds to ""red"".
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" also follows ""wif"" (red) and thus corresponds to ""red"".
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and so the corresponding output is ""red"". Notice that ""bluf"" does not affect the color output for ""dax"" that follows it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that precedes it.
Based on the provided examples, it is possible to infer a rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"". We can analyze each example and look for patterns related to the presence of ""walm"" and the colors in the outputs.

- Example 1: ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
- Example 2: ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
- Example 3: ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- Example 4: ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
- Example 5: ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""

From these examples, we can infer a pattern where the word ""walm"" is tied to the repetition of the color immediately following its first occurrence. Here is a possible rule based on the provided examples:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the next word to be repeated three times.

Applying this rule to the examples, follow:

- In Example 1, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" since ""zup"" is associated with yellow.
- In Example 2, ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red"" since ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""wif"" comes after ""walm"", introducing the color red without repetition because there is no subsequent ""walm"".
- In Example 3, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- In Example 4, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"" since ""zup"" is associated with yellow and is followed by ""walm"", thus repeating yellow three times; ""lug"" is associated with blue but is not followed by ""walm"", so it's said once; ""wif"" introduces red, and ""bluf"" is followed, repeating red.
- In Example 5, ""zup dax lug walm zup"" results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"" since ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""dax"" with green, and ""lug"" with blue. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" blue is repeated three times. The final ""zup"" is said once as it does not follow ""walm"".

Thus, the definition we can derive for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Causes the color associated with the subsequent word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True,58
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the underlying rule for the word ""dax"" and its relationship to the colors in the output.

Here are the input-output pairs provided:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green

2. Input: dax
   Output: green

3. Input: dax
   Output: green

4. Input: dax
   Output: green

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

With the given data, we observe that every time ""dax"" is presented in the input, the output starts with ""green."" Therefore, we can infer that ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green.""

For the fifth input, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" there is a sequence of color outputs following ""green"": red yellow yellow red red red. However, without further examples or information on what ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm"" might mean, it is difficult to deduce a specific rule for these additional words and their associated colors. Without knowing if the order, frequency, or position of the words influences the output, we cannot determine a rule for the entire sequence.

The rule we can conclude from the examples provided is:

Rule: Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green."" Thus, dax -> green.
wif -> red. 

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> meaning. Meaning is the color ""yellow"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is presented in the input, the output is the color ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning or rule underlying the word ""bluf,"" let's break down the given examples and look for patterns associated with ""bluf.""

In the first input-output pair, we have:

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red

""Bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" which results in ""yellow"" and is followed by ""wif"" which results in ""red."" There's no direct connection to colors here yet, as ""bluf"" is associated with both ""yellow"" and ""red.""

In the second input-output pair:

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue

""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green,"" the same as ""dax."" Then ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which is ""red."" Flanked by ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it.

In the third input-output pair:

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and again results in ""green."" This reaffirms that ""bluf"" may take the color of the word before it if the pattern holds.

In the fourth input-output pair:

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and both ""lug"" and ""bluf"" result in ""blue,"" again supporting the idea that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word before it.

In the fifth input-output pair:

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue

Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output color is ""blue,"" as with ""lug.""

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word. Applying this rule consistently explains all the provided examples.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color attribute of the word preceding it.
Observing the examples:

1. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
2. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
3. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
4. wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Looking at these examples, there is a pattern that emerges with the use of the word ""walm"". Specifically, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes before it. Observing more closely:

- When ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (blue), the output becomes blue -> blue.
- When ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" (red), the output becomes red -> red.
- When ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow), the output becomes yellow -> yellow.
- If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" (red), an additional red appears.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows: 

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word. If followed by ""wif"", it also adds an extra ""red"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm dax
    ",Output: blue blue green,blue blue blue green,False,59
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples. It does not appear to change based on position or surrounding words.
From the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" To determine what ""dax"" might represent, let's look at the input-output pairs:

1. When ""dax"" is added after ""lug"" (blue), the output color is green:
   - Input: wif lug dax lug
   - Output: red blue green blue 

2. When ""dax"" is added after ""walm"" (yellow), the output is yellow green:
   - Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   - Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

3. When ""dax"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output color is green:
   - Input: zup dax zup lug
   - Output: yellow green yellow blue
 
4. When ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" (red), the output color is green:
   - Input: zup dax bluf
   - Output: yellow green green

5. When ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" (red) and is before ""walm"" (yellow), the output string is green green green:
   - Input: wif bluf dax walm
   - Output: red red green green green

From these examples, we can infer that the word ""dax"" translates to ""green"" but is also affected by the color before it, causing a repetition of the color ""green"" for the number of times the previous color word is mentioned before ""dax"". The exception is if ""dax"" is preceded by either ""lug"" or ""zup"" where it is just translated to ""green"".

Rule:
dax -> When following ""lug"" or ""zup,"" outputs green. When following any other color word, outputs the color green repeated as many times as the previous color word (""bluf"" or ""walm"") appeared before ""dax"".
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Each time the word ""wif"" is used in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- The presence of other words such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax"" correspond to the colors ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green"" respectively.
- The word ""walm"" does not appear isolated; it is only included with ""wif,"" and the pair ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red red"" in the second example. This may indicate that ""walm"" by itself has no correlation to the output color, but in the context of being preceded by ""wif,"" it could potentially augment the number of reds produced.

Given the consistent one-to-one relationship between ""wif"" and ""red"" in all examples, we can determine the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to figure out what ""zup"" corresponds to in terms of colors. We need to look for patterns where ""zup"" appears and what color it maps to in each instance.

From the first example:
- zup dax zup wif -> yellow green yellow red

From the second example:
- wif zup lug wif -> red yellow blue red

From the third example:
- lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red

From the fourth example:
- zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

From the fifth example:
- wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red

""Zup"" appears in various positions in the different input strings but consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output. Other words in the input correspond to various other colors, but ""zup"" is always associated with ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Analyzing the examples:

1. `dax bluf` -> `green green`
2. `dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax` -> `green blue blue blue green red red green`
3. `zup wif bluf zup lug` -> `yellow red red yellow blue`
4. `zup lug bluf` -> `yellow blue blue`
5. `zup bluf dax` -> `yellow yellow green`

From these examples, we can see the following patterns:

- When `bluf` follows the word `dax`, the output for `bluf` is `green`.
- When `bluf` follows the word `zup`, the output for `bluf` is `yellow`.
- When `bluf` is between the words `zup` and `dax`, the output for `bluf` is the same color as the one that preceded it.
- When `bluf` follows `wif`, the output for `bluf` is `red`.

Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of `bluf` is context-dependent, and its color output mirrors the preceding word:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color output from the word immediately before it in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the patterns of inputs and outputs to deduce the meaning or rule for ""walm.""

- In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" results in ""green green green blue,"" where ""dax"" is consistently mapped to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

- In the second example, ""dax zup walm wif walm"" generates ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""dax"" remains green, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""wif"" is red. Notably, ""walm"" occurs twice at the end, resulting in ""red red red,"" suggesting that its meaning could be contingent on previously appearing words.

- The third example, ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" results in ""green green green yellow blue green."" The word ""dax"" still maps to ""green,"" ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue. Unlike the previous example, ""walm"" now maps to ""green,"" aligning with its position following ""dax.""

- Moving on to the fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup"" maps to ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" again follows ""wif"" and maps to ""red,"" similar to the second example.

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup"" produces ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and maps to ""blue,"" while still consistent with its preceding word.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it maps to the same color output as the word right before it.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color value of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,60
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, irrespective of what other words (like ""dax"" or ""wif"") may accompany it. Other words may correspond to additional colors, as ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". 

This is evidenced by the consistent output of ""green"" wherever ""dax"" appears in the input. Here's a breakdown:

- In the input ""dax"", the output is ""green"".
- In the input ""dax zup"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and a new word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the input ""dax lug"", ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" and a new word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the input ""lug dax wif lug"", the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" remains ""green"", and the new word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the input ""lug dax"", ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green"".

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" is:

dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we should look for patterns that correspond to the inputs and outputs given.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
The input has the elements ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" corresponds to repeated ""red,"" and ""wif"" is presumed to introduce the repetition since the repetition of ""red"" follows ""wif.""

Input: zup wif zup
Output: yellow red yellow
Here, ""zup"" appears twice and corresponds to ""yellow"" both times. It is surrounded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and there is no repetition following it. This input shows that ""wif"" may not always cause repetition, as it did not cause ""yellow"" to repeat.

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
The new word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Walm"" again leads to a sequence of ""green,"" meaning ""walm"" seems to be involved in causing repetition, not necessarily ""wif."" ""Wif"" here corresponds to the initial ""red.""

Input: lug wif zup wif
Output: blue red yellow red
Here, we see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output, with ""lug"" giving blue and ""zup"" giving yellow.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
In the final example, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

Considering these examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position or the number of terms following it. The initial assumption that ""wif"" is indicative of repetition is not supported by all examples, particularly the second one. Instead, the repetition seems more likely to be caused by ""walm"" as seen in the first and third examples.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

3. Input: zup lug bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue red

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red

Based on these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- ""bluf"" always results in the color that precedes it being repeated once in the output.
- If there is no color word before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" results in the color associated with the word before it being repeated: ""dax"" is green, and ""dax bluf"" gives us ""green green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: repeat the color associated with the word that comes directly before ""bluf"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the preceding color. If no color word precedes ""bluf,"" repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns identified in the provided examples.

Example 1:
Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Example 2:
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Example 3:
Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Example 4:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Example 5:
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Examining the examples, the following observations can be made:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of a single color three times.
2. The color that is repeated corresponds to the color indicated by the word immediately preceding ""walm"": 
   - ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""
   - ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color indicated by the word before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, every instance where the nonce word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. Thus, we can conclude that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" When ""dax"" is added to ""lug,"" ""green"" follows ""blue"" in the output.
- In the second and third examples, ""lug dax"" consistently results in ""blue green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup walm wif walm."" Here, ""green"" precedes ""yellow yellow yellow red red red,"" which corresponds in number and sequence to the input. Again, ""dax"" is linked to ""green.""
- In the last example, ""dax bluf"" produces ""green green,"" and since ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" (as seen from the output), this further supports the rule that ""dax"" also means ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in a sequence, ""wif"" always translates to ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Other words have their own corresponding colors as well, for instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" There is no context provided that changes the meaning of ""zup"" in any of the examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf means to repeat the color translated from the word immediately preceding it. 

For example: 

- In ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" after ""dax"" means ""green"", the color translated from ""dax"". 
- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" here, repeating the color of the word before it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look at the examples provided and identify any patterns related to ""walm"" and the output colors. We will analyze each example one by one:

1. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - Before ""walm,"" we see ""zup,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""dax."" After ""walm,"" the sequence ""yellow green"" occurs, which doesn't match the preceding colors. Notably, the first color after ""walm"" is yellow.

2. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - ""Walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif."" The first color after ""walm"" is red.

3. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the first color after ""walm"" is blue, which is the color associated with ""lug.""

4. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   - ""Walm"" is followed by ""zup"" in this example. The first color after ""walm"" is yellow, which is the color associated with ""zup.""

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - The color sequence ""blue blue blue"" follows ""lug walm,"" suggesting ""walm"" might be associated with the color blue, similar to ""lug.""

Upon examining these examples, we can spot that ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat its associated color. For instance, after ""walm,"" the word ""dax"" makes a green repeat, ""zup"" leads to a recurring yellow, ""lug"" to a repeating blue, and ""wif"" to a repeating red.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" causes the color associated with the next word to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,62
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Rule: ""lug"" means ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word translates to a specific color in English. 

To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's consider its corresponding output in each example:

- wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- dax lug wif -> green blue red
- zup lug wif dax lug -> yellow blue red green blue
- lug dax -> blue green
- zup lug zup dax -> yellow blue yellow green

In each instance, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. No other word in the input corresponds to green across all examples. 

Therefore, the rule appears to be: dax -> green. This indicates that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Analyzing the input examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red
2. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red
3. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue
4. Input: lug wif lug bluf -> Output: blue red blue blue
5. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue

In all the output sequences, ""red"" appears every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input sequence. Moreover, ""red"" does not appear in any other context. It seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. ""Red"" therefore appears to be independent of any other words present in the input and is exclusively linked to ""wif"".

Rule: wif -> red
From the examples given, we can deduce the meaning by looking at each input and its corresponding output:

- When the input is only 'zup', the output is 'yellow'. 

- The extended input 'wif walm zup lug wif walm zup' translates to a repetition of 'red red red', then 'yellow', then 'blue', then 'red red red', and finally 'yellow' again. We do not see a pattern that can directly link the words 'wif' and 'walm' to 'red' without more context, as 'wif' also appears after 'lug' in another example and doesn't produce 'red'. However, 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow'.

- The input 'zup wif' translates to 'yellow red', and the input 'zup lug' translates to 'yellow blue'. This indicates that 'zup' translates to 'yellow' consistently, while 'wif' and 'lug' translate to 'red' and 'blue', respectively.

- Finally, in the input 'zup dax walm lug wif', 'zup' leads to 'yellow', 'dax' and 'walm' both to 'green', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red'.

Based on these examples, the rule for 'zup' seems to be consistent, regardless of the context in which it appears, and can be defined as follows:

Rule: zup translates to the color yellow. 

Therefore, zup -> yellow.
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word preceding bluf.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears after another word, it signifies that the color associated with the preceding word should be repeated. For instance, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red."" Similarly, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green."" When additional words follow ""bluf,"" such as ""lug,"" the corresponding color for ""lug"" (""blue"") is simply appended to the output sequence after the repeated color.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" leads to the output of a color being repeated three times. The color that is repeated is determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here are the word-color associations that can be inferred from the examples:

- ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue (indicating ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue)
- ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue blue blue (indicating ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, while ""lug"" still corresponds to blue)
- ""zup lug walm"" -> yellow blue blue blue (indicating ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, with ""lug"" still corresponding to blue)
- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow (indicating ""zup"" corresponds to yellow)
- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue (which is consistent with the above associations)

From these observations, the general rule underlying ""walm"" can be expressed as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. If ""walm"" is the first word, or if there is no clear word-color association from prior input, it's unclear what the output would be without additional examples. However, based on the given examples, ""walm"" takes the color of the word immediately before it and repeats that color three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,63
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should examine how the word is used in different sentences and its corresponding outputs.

1. wif zup dax -> red yellow green
2. lug zup dax zup -> blue yellow green yellow
3. dax lug -> green blue
4. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
5. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green

Analyzing the examples, it appears that each word in the input maps to a unique color in the output. The word ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" in every example. There is no indication that the meaning of ""dax"" changes based on any other factors in the sentence—it seems to be position-independent and context-independent, meaning it consistently translates to the same output regardless of its location in the list of words or the words that surround it.

Hence, the rule seems to be simply:
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it is possible to induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

- Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is produced in the output.

To illustrate the rule with each given input:

1. ""zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow green red"" - Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
2. ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"" - Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and it appears that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"".
3. ""wif lug wif"" translates to ""red blue red"" - The two instances of ""wif"" correspond to ""red"" at the start and end, while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red"" - ""dax"" is ""green"" and it seems that ""walm"" also translates to ""green"". ""wif"" and ""bluf"" at the end correspond to ""red"".
5. ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue"" - Here ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it, so it's ""blue"" twice, following ""lug"".

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze the patterns within the given input and output pairs. Let's start with the most straightforward example:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Here ""zup"" is the only word in the input, and the output is singular, corresponding to ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

So we have:
zup -> yellow

Now let's see if this holds true in other examples:

Input: wif zup dax
Output: red yellow green
Here, ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Input: wif dax zup dax
Output: red green yellow green
Again, the placement of ""zup"" matches the placement of ""yellow"" in the output, reinforcing the initial deduction.

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
Even when another word ""bluf"" is introduced, ""zup"" remains consistent as ""yellow.""

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow
With more words added, the position of ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of other elements.

There is a direct relationship between the word ""zup"" and the color ""yellow"" across all examples. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce rules for how the nonce word ""bluf"" translates into a specific color in the output. One approach is to check for patterns in the input that consistently lead to the same color in the output.

Let's examine the discrepancies related to the occurrences of the word ""bluf"":

1. ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> ""yellow green green yellow green"" 
2. ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" -> ""green green red yellow green""
3. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green""
4. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""
5. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow red red""

Now let's try to find a pattern for ""bluf"":

- In the first and second examples, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output color is green, which matches ""dax"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is red, which matches ""wif"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and again the output is green, matching ""dax"".
- In the fifth, ""bluf"" first follows ""zup"" and then follows ""wif""; the output colors yellow and red correspond to ""zup"" and ""wif"", respectively.

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the relationship between the input and the output in each given example.

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Examining the outputs, it seems that the presence of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a repeated color in the output. The number of repetitions of the color corresponds to the number of words between ""walm"" and the next instance of ""walm"" or the end of the input.

Let's check this hypothesis with some detailed analysis:

1. In the first example, ""lug"" is translated to ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows, the ""blue"" is repeated three times.
2. In the second example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" followed by ""walm"" gives us a repeated ""blue,"" so now we have ""green blue blue blue.""
3. In the third example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" follows, causing ""red"" to be repeated three times, then ""dax"" (which is ""green""), provides a sequence of ""red red red green.""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" then ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and it's followed by ""wif walm"" which results in another series of ""red red red"" before ending with ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""
5. In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat three times, then ""dax"" (green), ""zup"" (yellow), and ""wif lug walm,"" where ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" as the repetition.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, and the number of times the color is repeated depends on the number of words preceding the next ""walm"" or the end of the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" the number of times equal to the count of words until the next ""walm"" or the end of the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif bluf
    ",Output: blue green red green,blue green red red,False,64
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's compare the input and the corresponding output in each example:

1. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red

2. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

4. Input: dax lug wif (repeated)
   Output: green blue red (repeated)

5. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red

Analyzing the patterns, we can see that:

- The word ""lug"" always corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
- None of the example outputs contain any other translation for ""lug.""
- ""lug"" appears to be position-independent as it corresponds to ""blue"" whether it's in the middle or at the end of the input.

Based on these observations, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Examining the examples, the output is a series of colors that correspond to the words in the input. To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we look for commonalities each time ""dax"" appears in the input and its corresponding color in the output:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm => Output: yellow red green green green
2. Input: dax wif zup dax => Output: green red yellow green
3. Input: dax lug => Output: green blue
4. Input: zup dax walm => Output: yellow green green green
5. Input: dax walm zup lug => Output: green green green yellow blue

Every instance of ""dax"" in the input is associated with ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position, indicating that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, the rule for ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, it translates to ""red.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" is not directly translated, but given that the output sequence always contains the same number of elements as the input, and that the output sequence for ""bluf"" is consistent with the colors already deduced, it can be assumed that ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""

From the examples:

- ""lug wif dax wif"" translates to ""blue red green red.""
- ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green.""
- ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, it seems that every instance of the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can analyze each instance where ""bluf"" appears and observe what color it is associated with in the output. 

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears twice. The first instance corresponds to ""green,"" and the second to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the last example, ""bluf"" appears twice. The first instance corresponds to ""blue,"" and the second to ""blue.""

It seems that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed output; instead, the output color associated with ""bluf"" can vary. However, taking a closer look, we see that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color word that appeared immediately before it. 

- In example one, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which resulted in ""blue,"" thus ""bluf"" also results in ""blue.""
- In example two, the first ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which yielded ""green,"" making the first ""bluf"" also yield ""green,"" and the second ""bluf"" follows the first ""zup,"" which yielded ""yellow,"" making the second ""bluf"" also yield ""yellow.""
- In example three, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" again, and so it yields ""yellow"" (the same output as ""lug"").
- In example four, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and thus results in ""red.""
- In the last example, both instances of ""bluf"" follow ""lug,"" which results in ""blue,"" thus both instances of ""bluf"" also result in ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule of ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the same as the color word before it. If no color word precedes ""bluf,"" it repeats the color of the closest prior color word.
Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to change its associated color output based on its position relative to other words. The pattern indicates that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color output of the word that immediately precedes it. 

Put differently, when ""walm"" appears in the sequence, we repeat the color output of the word that comes directly before ""walm"" as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned. 

For example:

- In the first input, ""zup walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" meaning ""walm"" caused ""zup"" to be repeated twice more, for a total of three ""yellow"" outputs.
- In the second input, there is no repetition because ""walm"" is at the end and followed by ""dax,"" which has a green output.
- In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which has a blue output, resulting in two additional blue outputs.
- In the fourth input, ""zup walm"" again results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth input, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" cause ""wif"" to be repeated twice more.

Therefore, walm -> meaning is that walm causes the output color of the previous word to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the term ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the input directly translates to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words that surround it.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at its position and the corresponding color output.

In the first example, ""wif dax"" corresponds to ""red green"". Here, ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" and ""red"" precedes ""green"".

In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red blue"". ""wif"" is second in the series, and ""red"" is also second.

In the third example, ""wif zup lug wif"" corresponds to ""red yellow blue red"". Both instances of ""wif"" correspond to the color ""red"".

In the fourth example, ""dax zup lug wif zup"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue red yellow"". The word ""wif"" is fourth, and so is the color ""red"".

In the fifth example, ""dax wif zup"" corresponds to ""green red yellow"". ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Taking into account these examples, it looks like ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the examples provided.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the Output across all given examples.
walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" seems to be the repetition of the color associated with the previous word. 

Rule: If the word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red."" If the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" If the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green."" Therefore, ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color output that corresponds with the word directly preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. In all examples provided, whenever ""dax"" is part of the input, ""green"" is part of the output at the corresponding position.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" appears to add the color red to the output, and it may concatenate this color to the color before it, repetitively, depending on the number of times ""wif"" occurs in sequence. 

For instance, in the first example, after ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" we get ""blue red yellow red red red,"" which indicates that after ""lug"" which corresponds to blue and ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, the occurrence of ""wif"" twice adds two reds following the yellow and an additional red after the second ""wif."" Meanwhile, in ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" after ""zup"" adds two reds, likely because ""bluf"" is also present, which doesn't seem to correspond to anything on its own, but might affect the output of ""wif.""

However, in the example ""zup wif lug dax,"" we only see one red following ""zup,"" and this is followed by the colors corresponding to ""lug"" and ""dax."" This might be because ""wif"" only occurs once here, and there are words following ""wif"" that correspond to unique colors.

When ""wif"" occurs alone at the end, as in ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif,"" it appears to only add one red color, possibly because there is no word after ""wif"" to determine further repetition.

In summary, ""wif"" seems to mean that red should be added to the sequence, but the number of reds repeated depends on the context of the words that surround it, indicating that there might be a rule about the words following ""wif"" influencing the number of reds that should be added.

Rule: wif -> adds one or more repetitions of red, with the number of reds possibly dependent on the surrounding words or the position of ""wif"" within the sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can try to identify a pattern for the nonce word ""zup"" by looking at the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here's a breakdown of the examples:

1. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

2. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue

3. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

5. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

Analyzing the patterns, it seems ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the outputs. Another pattern we can observe is that each word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output.

To confirm this, we see that regardless of position, ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" in the output. Also, other words like ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" consistently lead to ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""red"" respectively.

So, based on the given information, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Therefore:

zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the commonalities across each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: dax bluf zup | Output: green green yellow

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug | Output: yellow yellow red green blue

3. Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red

4. Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green

5. Input: dax bluf wif | Output: green green red

Based on these inputs and outputs, we can observe:

- When the word ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is always ""green green"" for those two words, suggesting that ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" independently and dictates the color ""green"" for ""bluf"" when preceding it directly.
  
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" directly, the word after ""bluf"" tends to result in ""yellow,"" unless the word is ""wif,"" which correlates with ""red.""

- ""bluf"" results in different colors (""yellow"" in example 1 and ""green"" in examples 3 and 4) when followed by different words or sequences. It does not maintain a consistent output color, indicating that ""bluf"" may change its output based on the surrounding words.

- ""bluf"" yields red in the presence of ""wif,"" no matter its position, whether ""wif"" comes before or after it (as seen in examples 2, 3, and 5).

Based on these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" is a context-dependent placeholder that changes its output based on the adjacent word(s). Specifically, it seems to duplicate the color indicated by the word that immediately precedes it. However, when followed by ""wif,"" it dictates red, suggesting an exception to the preceding rule or an additional rule when paired with ""wif.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word preceding it, except when followed by ""wif,"" in which case it is ""red.""
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs:

Input: dax lug walm  
Output: green blue blue blue  
Observation: The presence of the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green,"" while ""lug"" correlates with ""blue."" The word ""walm"" is repeated the same number of times as ""blue"" appears, therefore ""walm"" is likely related to the repetition of the ""blue"" color.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif  
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red  
Observation: Again, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and given that ""zup"" and ""wif"" correlate with ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively from the subsequent examples. ""walm"" again causes the repetition of ""blue.""

Input: zup walm  
Output: yellow yellow yellow  
Observation: ""Zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"" this time.

Input: zup bluf wif walm  
Output: yellow yellow red red red  
Observation: ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""red.""

Input: dax walm  
Output: green green green  
Observation: ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""green.""

Rule: ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be consistent for the word 'dax' across all examples. Regardless of the context or surrounding words, 'dax' consistently corresponds to the output 'green'. 

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of 'dax' based on the given examples is as follows:

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: When ""wif"" is present in the input, the output is ""red.""
Observing the pattern from the given input and output pairs, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output. Other words in the inputs appear to correspond to different colors in the outputs, for instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

The rule is consistent across all examples provided, as ""zup"" correlates to the same output regardless of its position in the input sequence or other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. Each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" influences the pattern of color names in the output, but its effect is dependent on the preceding word. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow

5. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

From these inputs and outputs, it can be noted that the output always contains a sequence of the same color, followed by a change in color after ""walm"" appears. This pattern can be observed in each case:

- In the first example, a sequence of ""blue"" is followed by ""yellow"" after the first instance of ""walm.""
- In the second example, after ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue"" when before that combination it was ""green"" and ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""blue blue"" turns into ""blue yellow"" following ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""red"" is repeated until ""walm"" where it turns into ""red blue.""
- In the fifth example, a string of ""red"" is followed by ""green"" after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" acts as a signal to change the color in the sequence to the next color. If we assume a color order of blue, yellow, red, and green in a cycle, then ""walm"" could be seen as a ""shift"" operation to the next color in this order. But we're also missing the conditions where ""walm"" would transition the color from red to blue, or yellow to red. There is no example with ""walm"" placed after ""red"" and only one example with ""walm"" after ""yellow,"" which leads to red. With the given data, it is best we can deduce without further examples.

So, the rule could be described as:
walm -> Shifts the current color sequence to the next color based on a set order (assumed order: blue, yellow, red, green).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,68
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue."" The other words in the inputs, such as ""walm,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup,"" correspond to different colors (""blue,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively). Hence, the nonce word ""lug"" seems to mean ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output to identify the rules.

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Note: The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" while ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red.""

2. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   Note: The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax lug dax lug wif
   Output: green blue green blue red
   Note: The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: zup bluf dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow green blue
   Note: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   Note: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" somehow changes the output to ""green green.""

Across all examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Hence, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, each non-nonce word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> red
- walm -> yellow
- dax -> green

Every time the word ""wif"" appears, it is translated to ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence. This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and is not dependent on context or other factors.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

The consistent rule across all examples provided is that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided and the outputs corresponding to each, a pattern can be observed, which suggests that the word ""bluf"" is associated with the color of the word immediately preceding it. Here's the pattern:

In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" means the color green when following ""dax."" However, in the same example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it means yellow.

In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" which means that when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color associated is red.

In the third example, ""wif bluf"" again translates to ""red red,"" but ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" indicating that when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it means blue.

In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""green green red red,"" which seems to break the pattern, but this can be rationalized if we consider ""walm wif"" as a combined term translating to ""green green,"" and then ""bluf"" follows meaning red, as previously determined.

In the final example, ""dax bluf"" once again translates to ""green green,"" reinforcing the rule from the first example.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word immediately before it. This is further supported by the last example where only ""dax bluf"" is present, and the corresponding output is ""green green.""

So the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color of the word directly preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""walm"" represents repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Let's analyze each example to find the pattern:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
   - ""lug"" on its own results in ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes the color ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

2. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""
   - ""wif"" results in ""red"", and ""walm"" following it causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.
   - After ""walm,"" the pattern continues normally with ""lug"" resulting in ""blue"" and ""bluf"" likely representing a double of ""blue"".

3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
   - ""dax"" on its own results in ""green"", and ""walm"" causes the color ""green"" to be repeated three times.

4. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
   - ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" followed by ""walm"" which repeats ""blue"" three times.
   - ""dax"" results in ""green,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and the pattern repeats single instances of the colors as before.

5. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> ""blue red yellow red red red""
   - ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""zup"" apparently results in ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with that word, repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif
    ",Output: yellow red,yellow red,True,69
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that there is a consistent mapping from certain words to certain colors.

Let's analyze the occurrences of ""dax"" and the corresponding outputs:

Input: dax zup | Output: green yellow → ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
Input: wif dax zup | Output: red green yellow → ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
Input: dax lug dax | Output: green blue green → ""dax"" corresponds to green both times it occurs
Input: dax zup dax zup wif | Output: green yellow green yellow red → ""dax"" corresponds to green both times it occurs
Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red → ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

From these examples, it is evident that regardless of the position or the input's composition, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Thus, the rule can be stated as:
dax -> green
Observing the given examples, it appears that the presence of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red."" Regardless of what other words are present in the input, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Here are the relationships that can be discerned:

- ""dax wif"" produced ""green red."" Here, ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".
- A singular ""wif"" produced just ""red.""
- ""zup wif"" produced ""yellow red."" In this case, ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" again to ""red.""
- For ""wif lug wif"", the output is ""red blue red"". This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" while the instances of ""wif"" both correspond to ""red.""
- The repetition of ""zup wif"" with the same output ""yellow red"" confirms the pattern seen in previous examples.

Thus, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence. Here is how ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow"" in each example:

- Example 1: The first and third ""zup"" correspond to the first and third ""yellow"" in the output.
- Example 2: The only ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- Example 3: Both instances of ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow"" in the output.
- Example 4: The only ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- Example 5: The only ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

Given this consistent pattern across all examples, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look at the instances where it appears and determine what is consistent about the output when ""bluf"" is part of the input.

Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   
2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

3. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

4. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

5. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red

In every example where ""bluf"" appears, the color directly after ""bluf"" is the same color that corresponds to the word before ""bluf."" This suggests that ""bluf"" functions as a word that duplicates the color associated with the previous word.

Let's verify this rule:

- In Example 1, ""dax"" gives green, followed by ""bluf,"" which also gives green.
- In Example 2, ""zup"" gives yellow, followed immediately by ""bluf,"" which results in another yellow.
- In Example 4, ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""bluf"" immediately afterward also translates to blue.

This pattern holds in all other examples provided.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the previous word.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word 'walm' is connected to the repetition of the previously mentioned color.

In the first example:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- When ""walm"" is used after ""lug"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.

In the second example:
- ""dax"" is ""green""
- ""zup"" is ""yellow""
- ""wif"" is ""red""
- ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to two repeats of ""yellow""
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" leads to three repeats of ""red""

In the third example:
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" again leads to repeated ""red""

In the fourth example:
- ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""red"" is repeated three times

In the fifth example:
- ""walm"" is used after “dax"" and ""zup"", leading to two repeats of ""green"" and three of ""yellow"" respectively.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: repeat the color that was just mentioned. The number of times the color is repeated seems to be consistent with the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned immediately following the color word.

Thus: walm -> meaning: When following a color word, repeat that color word's corresponding color in the output multiple times in sequence. The exact number of repetitions corresponds to the number of consecutive instances of ""walm"" plus one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,70
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at the patterns and context in which the word is used in the inputs and outputs. Based on the given examples, we can analyze the outputs and their corresponding inputs to find the rule.

Let's examine each example and its output:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" appears to translate to the first ""green"" 
   - ""walm"" following ""dax"" also translates to ""green""
   - ""wif"" breaks the ""green"" sequence and is followed by ""red""
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" continues with ""red""
   - ""zup"" changes the color again to ""yellow""

2. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - The initial ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   - ""walm"" following ""dax"" again translates to ""green""
   - ""wif"" changes the sequence to ""red""
   - The second ""dax"" returns to ""green"" 

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - ""lug"" is not followed by ""dax"" and translates to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" changes color to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" comes after a non-""walm"" word and starts a ""green"" sequence
   - ""walm"" right after ""dax"" continues with ""green""

4. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" by itself results in ""green""

5. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - ""zup"" is ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" is ""red""
   - ""dax"" following ""wif"" switches to ""green""
   - The subsequent ""walm"" thereafter continues with ""green""

From these observations, we can infer the following rules:

- The presence of ""dax"" indicates the start of a ""green"" sequence.
- ""dax"" directly influences the following word ""walm"" to also be ""green,"" creating a chain of ""green"" until a different word appears.
- Other words like ""wif"" and ""zup"" have their own colors, which are ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively, and they seem to reset the color sequence.
- The word ""lug"" has its unique color ""blue,"" and it does not immediately precede ""dax.""

Rule:
dax -> When ""dax"" appears, it turns itself and the following ""walm""s into ""green,"" regardless of the preceding color, until a different word with a different assigned color appears.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the exact corresponding position in the output.

Here is the breakdown of the inputs and outputs:

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red
(""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
(""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
(both occurrences of ""wif"" correspond to ""red"")

Input: wif
Output: red
(""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
(""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")

Rule: wif -> red
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in each example.

From the examples given:

1. ""zup wif zup"" produces ""yellow red yellow""
   Every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. ""zup lug"" produces ""yellow blue""
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. ""dax zup"" produces ""green yellow""
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow""
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" seems to mean ""yellow yellow.""

5. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" produces ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" would correspond to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and the second instance of ""zup"" again to ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, it is consistently observed that whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output position. There is no instance where ""zup"" corresponds to any color other than ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Given the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

3. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

4. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green

5. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green

We can see that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds with the color ""red."" It does not seem to be dependent on position or the presence of other words since ""bluf"" always maps to ""red"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input string and independent of other words in the string.

Therefore, according to the examples given, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> ""red""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it. In each example, when ""walm"" is used, the color word before ""walm"" is repeated in the output as many times as ""walm"" is used.

Let's verify this with each input-output pair:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

""zup"" is 'yellow', followed by ""walm"" which repeats 'yellow'. ""lug"" is 'blue', followed by another ""zup"" which is 'yellow', then ""wif"" for 'red' and ""dax"" for 'green'.

2. Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

""wif"" is 'red', followed by ""walm"" which repeats 'red' twice more.

3. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

""wif"" is 'red', ""walm"" repeats 'red' twice. ""zup"" is 'yellow', ""lug"" is 'blue', another ""zup"" for 'yellow', and ""walm"" repeats 'yellow' three times.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

""zup"" is 'yellow', ""lug"" is 'blue', ""walm"" repeats 'blue' twice. Then ""wif"" for 'red' and ""dax"" for 'green'.

5. Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

""lug"" is 'blue', ""dax"" is 'green', and ""walm"" repeats 'green' three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: Walm means to repeat the color of the preceding word in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,71
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' appears, it translates to the color 'blue' regardless of its position in a sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the first color in the output is always ""green.""
- The color that follows ""green"" seems to be dependent on the word that comes after ""dax.""

Analyzing the individual examples:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""yellow."" Perhaps they are synonyms or contextually similar enough to generate the same color, yellow.

2. ""dax walm wif walm"" leads to ""green green green red red red."" The repetitions of ""green"" and ""red"" suggest that ""walm"" translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The repeated words result in repeated colors.

3. ""dax lug"" becomes ""green blue."" Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. ""wif dax"" turns into ""red green."" According to the pattern, ""wif"" is the first word and ""dax"" is second, so ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and confirms that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. ""zup dax lug zup"" produces ""yellow green blue yellow."" We have already established ""zup"" as ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" as ""blue."" The presence of ""dax"" causes ""green"" to be the second color in the sequence, maintaining consistency with our previous observations.

Rule:
dax -> green

Every time ""dax"" is mentioned, the color ""green"" is the immediate output. The rule seems to be that ""dax"" always represents the color green, independent of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following mappings:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green (Notice that ""bluf"" outputs ""green"" in the second example, which seems to go against the third and fourth examples until we separate ""wif"" as a distinct entity)
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input string or the context.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, I will analyze each instance of the word ""zup"" and its corresponding output:

1. ""zup lug dax lug"" -> ""yellow blue green blue""
   Here, ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" and is translated as ""yellow"".

2. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
   Here, ""zup"" follows ""walm"" and the output is one instance of ""red"" followed by three instances of ""yellow"".

3. ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""
   Similar to the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" and is translated as ""yellow"".

4. ""lug zup dax zup"" -> ""blue yellow green yellow""
   In this example, ""zup"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""dax"" in one case, and in another case, it follows ""dax"". Both instances of ""zup"" correspond to ""yellow"".

5. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
   Here, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and the output is three instances of ""yellow"".

From the examples, we see that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the terms it's adjacent to. We can deduce that the word ""zup"" stands for the color ""yellow"". Therefore the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning or rule of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples provided:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
3. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. wif bluf -> red red

Looking at examples 4 and 5, the input is identical and so is the output. This means that ""wif bluf"" consistently translates to ""red red.""

Example 3 has ""zup wif bluf,"" which supports the rule that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as it does in examples 4 and 5, and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" based on example 2. However, it's worth noting that ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"" and results in another ""red.""

In example 1, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" wherein ""dax"" goes to ""green"" and since ""bluf"" is followed by a second ""green,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" could repeat the color of the word just before it.

Given these observations, the most consistent rule for ""bluf"" across these examples is that it repeats the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the color preceding it to repeat three times. Here's the breakdown of the examples:

Example 1:
- dax -> green
- walm -> causes ""green"" to repeat
- lug -> blue
- walm -> causes ""blue"" to repeat

Example 2:
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> causes ""yellow"" to repeat

Example 3:
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> causes ""green"" to repeat
- wif -> red

Example 4:
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> causes ""yellow"" to repeat

Example 5:
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> causes ""red"" to repeat

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeats the color of the word that comes before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Every time ""lug"" is used in an input, the output is ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by looking at the outputs corresponding to each input:

- When ""dax"" appears by itself (Input: dax), the output is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" appears after ""wif"" (Input: wif dax), the output ends with ""green"" immediately following ""red"".
- ""dax"" coupled with ""lug"" (Input: dax lug) results in ""green blue"".
- When ""dax"" is part of a longer sequence (Input: zup dax lug wif dax), ""green"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""lug"", and again after ""wif"".
- Finally, when ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" and another word (Input: dax zup bluf), it results in ""green yellow yellow"".

From the given examples, it consistently appears that ""dax"" translates to the output ""green"", regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" This is evident because every instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Let's review the examples to verify this:

- In the first example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug wif lug"" translates to ""blue red blue."" The ""wif"" is again represented by ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" Only the first word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; the subsequent words ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""green green,"" respectively (since there are three ""green"" and only two other words, we can assume ""walm"" likely means ""green green"").
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue."" Here, ""wif"" is clearly represented by ""red"" as it is positioned before the last ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" ""Wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""

Based on these analyses, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Given the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"". Here's how the output can be related to the input in each case:

- In every example where ""zup"" is present, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The appearance of ""yellow"" is directly after the occurrence of ""zup"" in the output sequence.
- ""Zup"" does not seem to affect the colors represented by other words like ""lug"", ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""walm"" since their respective colors (""blue"" for ""lug"", ""red"" for ""wif"", ""green"" for ""dax"") remain consistent in the output before and after ""yellow"".

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

This is consistent across all provided examples.
bluf -> repeat the previous color

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears after another word, it indicates to repeat the color that corresponds to the previous word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" changes the output color to one step back from the color associated with the last word before ""walm."" That is, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the previously mentioned color.

To substantiate this, let's break down the examples:

- Example 1: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm""
  - ""dax"" outputs green.
  - ""wif"" outputs red, and ""walm"" after ""wif"" outputs red again.
  - ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""zup"" changes the color to yellow.
  - ""walm"" after ""zup"" outputs yellow again.

- Example 2: ""zup lug walm""
  - ""zup"" outputs yellow.
  - ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""walm"" after ""lug"" outputs blue again.

- Example 3: ""wif walm lug bluf""
  - ""wif"" outputs red, and ""walm"" after ""wif"" outputs red again.
  - ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""bluf"" is assumed to output blue based on the relationship between ""lug"" and ""bluf"" in preserving blue output.

- Example 4: ""wif lug walm""
  - ""wif"" outputs red.
  - ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""walm"" after ""lug"" outputs blue again.

- Example 5: ""dax walm zup lug walm""
  - ""dax"" outputs green, and ""walm"" after ""dax"" outputs green again.
  - ""zup"" outputs yellow, ""lug"" outputs blue, and ""walm"" after ""lug"" outputs blue again.

With these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output of the word preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Input: lug wif dax walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" translates consistently to the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is present in the corresponding output. All other words seem to have a one-to-one correspondence with different colors. For instance, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The position of ""lug"" within the sequence does not affect its meaning.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in all given examples.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each time ""wif"" is mentioned, the output associated with it is ""red."" There isn't any indication that ""wif"" changes meaning based on context or position. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow. 

Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" in the inputs corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the outputs.
From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the output ""red."" Here's how we can interpret each example:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. wif bluf dax -> red red green
5. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue

In each of these sequences, ""bluf"" corresponds with the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it.

Rule: bluf -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with repetition of the color connected to the word preceding it. Each time ""walm"" appears, the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it is repeated multiple times. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red"" 
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"", resulting in repeated ""red""

2. ""dax walm wif"" leads to ""green green green red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"", resulting in repeated ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

3. ""zup walm lug wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"", resulting in repeated ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

4. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" leads to ""blue red yellow red red red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" resulting in repeated ""red""

5. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"", resulting in repeated ""blue""

From these examples, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""blue"" in the Outputs. Here is the analysis for each Input and its respective Output:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to one ""blue"" in the Output.
   - ""walm"" appears to translate to two additional ""blue"" in the Output.

2. Input: lug
   Output: blue
   - ""lug"" by itself translates to ""blue.""

3. Input: lug zup lug
   Output: blue yellow blue
   - ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" both times.
   - ""zup"" appears once in between ""lug"" and translates to ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""zup"" appears twice, each translating to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
   - ""walm"" still appears to count for multiple yellows after ""lug,"" but the exact rule for ""walm"" is unclear. It seems to possibly produce a number of ""yellow"" outputs depending on its position or the preceding words.

5. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   - Again, ""lug"" corresponds to the last ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" which might suggest that ""bluf"" is treated differently than ""lug,"" since ""bluf"" doesn't result in ""blue."" However, without more examples, the rule for ""bluf"" is not clear.

With the given data, the rule for ""lug"" is consistent:
Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax,"" let's compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

2. Input: lug wif dax wif
   Output: blue red green red

3. Input: lug dax lug
   Output: blue green blue

4. Input: dax lug zup
   Output: green blue yellow

5. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue

From these examples, we can infer the following:

- Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
- This correspondence is consistent across all examples, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the length of the sequence.
- Other words (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"") correspond to different colors (yellow, blue, red, green), and these colors are consistent for the given words across different examples, implying that ""dax"" also consistently refers to a single color, which in this case is ""green.""

Therefore, based on the information from the examples provided, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green. Meaning that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the inputs corresponds to ""red"" in the outputs. Therefore:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of the word ""bluf"" appears to be a repetition of the translated color indicated by the preceding nonce word.

Rule: When the nonce word before ""bluf"" translates to a color, ""bluf"" causes that color word to be repeated. For example, ""dax"" means green, so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green""; ""lug"" means blue, so ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue""; ""wif"" means red, so ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red."" Therefore, ""bluf"" acts as an instruction to repeat the color word that corresponds to the word immediately before it.
Based on the given examples, each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of a color word in the output. The number of repetitions matches the number of syllables in the preceding word. Here are the rules that apply to the provided examples:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (Zup has one syllable, so ""yellow"" is repeated three times.)
- ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow"" (Zup has one syllable preceding ""walm"", so ""yellow"" is repeated three times.)
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (Lug has one syllable, so ""blue"" is repeated three times.)
- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow"" (""Walm"" comes after ""wif"", which has one syllable, so ""red"" is repeated three times.)
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (Dax has one syllable, so ""green"" is repeated three times.)

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated as many times as there are syllables in that word.

So, walm -> Repeat the color word associated with the preceding word, the number of times equal to the syllables in that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to examine each input and its corresponding output to find a consistent pattern that can be applied across all examples. Let's analyze the inputs where ""dax"" appears and their respective outputs:

Input: dax
Output: green
Rule: dax corresponds to green.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Rule: dax still corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" corresponds to green as well in this context. Since it's the only information we have on ""bluf,"" we can't be certain of its meaning yet.

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green
Rule: dax corresponds to green in two instances. ""lug"" and ""wif"" appear once each, with ""lug"" corresponding to blue and ""wif"" corresponding to red. ""bluf"" is green again, confirming the earlier assumption.

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
Rule: dax is green, and ""lug"" is blue, which is consistent with its previous appearance.

Input: wif zup dax
Output: red yellow green
Rule: dax is green again, ""wif"" is red again, and ""zup"" is the new word, corresponding to yellow.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green in every example.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the examples:

1. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green

2. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

It seems that every instance where ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" More specifically, whenever ""wif"" is in the input, the color red is produced in the corresponding place in the output:

- In examples 1, 2, 3, and 4, ""wif"" is the first word, and thus the first color in the output is ""red.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" is the second word, so the second color in the output is ""red.""

The evidence suggests that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red."" There is no instance suggesting otherwise.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example, regardless of context or position within the sequence of terms.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for a pattern in the input-to-output relationships.

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- Since ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and also produces green, it might be tempting to think ""bluf"" also means green, but we need more information to confirm this.

Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
Output: yellow yellow red green blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- Here, ""bluf"" is followed by yellow and is preceded by yellow, which might indicate that ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow too, but this is in contrast to the first example.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- Here, ""bluf"" outputs red right after ""wif,"" which also produces red.

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- From the third and fourth outputs, ""bluf"" gives red and then green, which follows the preceding colors produced by ""wif"" and ""dax.""

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
Output: yellow green green yellow green
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to green
- Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which is green, and the corresponding output is green as well.

The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word directly preceding it. Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: the word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color output of the word that comes directly before it in the sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

Here's what we can deduce from the examples given:

- In example 1, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it.
- In example 2, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" which supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color linked to ""dax.""
- Examples 3, 4, and 5 further support this observation, showing that ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of the other words present. Therefore, the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze its occurrence in relation to the output colors in each example.

1. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug  
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue  
   The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

2. Input: lug wif  
   Output: blue red  
   ""wif"" corresponds to red following the word ""lug.""

3. Input: dax walm wif  
   Output: green green green red  
   ""wif"" corresponds to red following the sequence ""dax walm.""

4. Input: dax zup wif  
   Output: green yellow red  
   ""wif"" corresponds to red following the sequence ""dax zup.""

5. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf  
   Output: blue red red green blue blue  
   ""wif"" corresponds to red following the word ""lug.""

In each instance, the output immediately following ""wif"" is consistently red, regardless of the preceding word. There are no examples where ""wif"" precedes a color other than red. Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that the word ""wif"" translates directly to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" translates directly to the color word that precedes it.

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow""; thus, ""bluf"" follows the color ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf wif"" becomes ""blue blue red""; so ""bluf"" takes the color ""blue"" from ""lug.""
- In the third example, ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" becomes ""red green red red yellow red""; ""bluf"" is translated to ""red"" following ""wif.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue""; again, ""bluf"" follows the color word ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red""; ""bluf"" matches ""wif"" in color, which is ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> the color word that precedes it.
Observing the provided examples and the corresponding outputs, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of colors that increase in count by one each time it appears in the input, and the specific color changes depending on the preceding word. 

Let's analyze each example:

Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""walm"" following ""wif"" yields three reds, and ""walm"" following ""zup"" yields three yellows. It should be noted that the number of yellows matches the count of the preceding reds, suggesting that the first occurrence of ""walm"" sets a baseline for quantity that is then applied to subsequent occurrences regardless of the color change.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
In this case, ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in three greens, indicating that the presence of ""dax"" might be tied to the color green.

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
With ""lug"" we get blue, with ""zup"" we get yellow, and with ""dax walm"" we get three greens. It seems that each word has its own color, but ""walm"" is again determining the quantity, not the color.

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
Here ""zup walm"" results in three yellows, and ""wif"" independently results in red. ""Walm"" does not appear to influence the color of the words that follow it.

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
""Lug"" gives blue, ""dax walm"" gives us three greens, and ""wif"" gives red. Just like in previous examples, ""walm"" controls the quantity following a specific word.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as:

Rule: When following a word, ""walm"" produces a sequence of the same color associated with the preceding word, and the quantity of the color output is determined by the number of times ""walm"" has previously appeared plus two (as the first instance produces three of that color).

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous word, with the quantity increasing by one with each subsequent occurrence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green in all provided examples, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds with the output ""red."" There are no examples provided that contradict this association. Therefore, the rule that can be determined from these examples is:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples given, the word 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow'. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" can be consistently translated to the color ""green."" Here is the analysis:

1. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   - bluf corresponds to green.

2. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
   - bluf corresponds to green again.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - Since all the other words correspond to colors that are not green and bluf is followed by a blue, it may seem inconsistent. However, since in all other examples bluf is equal to green, the output here must be an anomaly or an error.

4. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
   - bluf corresponds to green once more.

5. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   - bluf corresponds to green again.

Based on the rules shown in these example translations, the following can be deduced:

Rule: bluf -> green.
walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" can be deduced as the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. If we look at the examples:

- Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red. ""wif"" generates ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats it two more times.
  
- Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red. ""dax"" generates ""green"", ""walm"" repeats it two more times, and then ""wif"" generates ""red"".
  
- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green. ""dax"" generates ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats it two more times.
  
- Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue. ""wif"" generates ""red"", ""lug"" generates ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
  
- Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red. This is a repeat of the second example and follows the same pattern.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, repeating it a number of times equal to the total number of words in the input minus one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Looking at the inputs and their respective outputs, we can make the following observations:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is in the output. This suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- The other words such as ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" seem to have consistent translations as well (""lug"" -> ""blue,"" ""walm"" -> ""yellow,"" ""wif"" -> ""red,"" ""zup"" -> ""yellow"").
- The position of ""dax"" in the input does not seem to affect its output since it always maps to ""green"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.

Given this information, we can conclude:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" each time it appears in the input. It does not seem dependent on context or position within the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. There is no variation in its meaning apparent from the examples given.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately follows it. When ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. Let's examine each example:

- ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green,"" which means ""bluf"" took the color of the word after it, ""dax"" (green).
- In ""dax bluf wif lug zup,"" ""bluf"" took the color of ""wif"" (red).
- ""lug dax bluf"" became ""blue green green,"" where ""bluf"" once again took the color of the preceding word, ""dax"" (green), as it was the last word in the sequence.
- ""wif bluf"" turned into ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" matched the color of ""wif"" (red).
- Lastly, ""lug bluf dax bluf"" became ""blue blue green green,"" where each ""bluf"" took the color of the word that followed, ""dax"" (green). Since there was a ""bluf"" at the end of the sequence, it took the color of the preceding word, ""dax"" again (green).

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the following word unless it is the last word, then it takes the color of the preceding word.
From the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" replicates the pattern of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's break it down:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif,"" the output is ""green green green red."" Since ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" the ""walm"" that follows also outputs ""green,"" replicating the pattern for the word that precedes it, which in this case is ""dax.""

- In the second example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" we have ""red green yellow yellow yellow"" as output. The ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and that's why ""walm"" produces ""yellow.""

- In the third and fourth examples, ""lug walm"" and ""lug walm zup,"" the outputs are ""blue blue blue"" and ""blue blue blue yellow,"" respectively. Here, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again replicates this pattern.

- In the fifth example, ""lug wif walm,"" the output is ""blue red red red.” ""Walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" and hence ""walm"" results in ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color pattern of the word that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color pattern of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True,79
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue regardless of context, as evidenced by its consistent translation in all given examples. ""Dax"" translates to green when between two instances of ""lug"", and ""walm"" translates to a repetition of blue (blue blue blue). The presence of ""wif"" between ""walm"" and ""lug"" results in the insertion of red (blue blue blue red blue), indicating that ""wif"" may signify the color red when in a sequence with these other terms.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will examine the output associated with each appearance of the word ""dax"" in the inputs.

- In input 1, ""wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""red red green."" Since ""wif"" appears in input 4 and also corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" is not seen in any other input, it is reasonable to infer that ""bluf"" might correspond to ""red"" as well. If that's the case, then ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In input 2, ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" is at the start, and we previously inferred that ""dax"" might correspond to ""green,"" if every word in this input corresponds to ""green,"" then ""walm"" might also correspond to ""green.""
- Input 3, ""zup lug dax"" maps to ""yellow blue green,"" and if ""dax"" is ""green,"" we can deduce that ""zup"" might be ""yellow"" and ""lug"" might be ""blue.""
- In input 4, ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red."" Given that ""wif"" appears in input 1 and corresponds to ""red,"" and we've hypothesized that ""dax"" is ""green,"" this input supports our inference.
- Finally, input 5, ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green."" Since we already associated ""lug"" with ""blue"" from input 3, this supports our hypothesis that ""dax"" is ""green.""

Based on the above analysis, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: Each instance of ""dax"" in the inputs corresponds to ""green"" in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word has a corresponding color as its meaning. Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color ""red"" for each occurrence of ""walm.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" when it appears.

So the rule appears to be:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> repeated red for each occurrence
- wif -> red

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the input-output pairs provided, it looks like ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Here is the analysis of the examples given:

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- ""zup"" by itself also translates to ""yellow"".

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red
- When ""zup"" is at the end of a sequence, it still corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow
- When ""zup"" is at the end after other colors, it remains ""yellow"".

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- ""zup"" remains ""yellow"" even when it follows after another color.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the pairs of inputs and outputs given and look for patterns.

Let's look at each instance where ""bluf"" is used and the corresponding output:

1. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
2. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
3. zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue
4. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
5. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue

A closer look at these examples shows us:

- Every time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""yellow.""
- In each example, no matter the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence, ""yellow"" is always used in the same position in the output sequence.
  
Based on the evidence from the examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow
Observing the patterns of the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" always results in ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" without any change in the sequence of the output which is consistently three greens. This suggests that ""dax"" could mean ""green"" and ""walm"" might represent a repetition of the color mentioned before it.

2. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" has an output of ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" The ""walm"" after ""zup"" converts the single yellow into three yellows, and the ""walm"" after ""wif"" converts the single red into three reds. This again supports the idea that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the prior color.

3. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" results in ""blue red yellow red red red."" Here, ""walm"" is at the end and repeats ""red"" which is the color associated with ""wif,"" suggesting that ""walm"" continues the pattern of repetition.

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and we see a repetition of ""red"" three times before the pattern continues with new colors for ""dax"" and ""zup.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the previous color word to repeat two additional times (totaling three).

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,80
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the term ""lug"" is encountered, it is translated to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems clear that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red"". Therefore, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". When ""wif"" is followed by additional words such as ""lug"" or ""zup"", they produce additional colors (""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively). In the case where ""wif"" is followed by ""walm lug bluf"", we get a pattern of repeating ""red"" for each nonce word before ending with ""blue blue"".

The consistent element is that every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". When presented with additional words, it appears that each nonce word has a color association, but it might require more examples to determine the precise rules for the other nonce words. However, our focus here is defining ""wif"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the word ""zup"" corresponds to a particular color in the context of a sequence of other words, where each word in the sequence appears to represent a different color.

Looking at several instances:

1. ""zup wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red blue green""
2. ""lug walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""zup dax wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green red""
4. ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow""
5. ""zup bluf dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green""

From these examples, we can observe that irrespective of position or surrounding words, ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> 'yellow'
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at its position relative to the other words in each input sequence and the corresponding output.

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green."" Considering only this example, we can't yet deduce much about ""bluf"" other than it is not causing a change in the output. 

- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax"" results in ""red red green."" We see that the word ""dax"" is always producing ""green"" as the output, while the position of ""bluf"" has changed relative to ""dax,"" but it still produces ""red."" However, this might be because of ""wif"" rather than ""bluf.""

- In the third example, ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red."" The ""dax"" still gives ""green,"" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" and now ""bluf"" gives 'red"" as well. It might suggest that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before ""bluf"" in sequence. 

- The fourth example, ""dax lug bluf wif,"" results in ""green blue blue red."" Here, ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" which is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue"" again, while ""wif"" results in ""red."" This further supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it, as it followed ""lug"" and resulted in ""blue.""

- The fifth example, ""dax bluf lug wif,"" shows ""green green blue red."" Again, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" comes right after ""dax"" and also gives ""green,"" then ""lug"" provides ""blue,"" and lastly, ""wif"" results in ""red."" This is consistent with the idea that ""bluf"" will have the same color as the word before it.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""bluf"" reproduces the color of the word immediately preceding it. If this pattern holds true regardless of the position of ""bluf"" within the word sequence, we can generalize this as a rule.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine each example and the corresponding output to identify patterns. Here's a breakdown of the examples provided:

1. Example: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" is echoed in the Output as repetitions of ""yellow.""

2. Example: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   Analysis: Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is mirrored by multiple instances of ""yellow."" It is important to note that ""walm"" doesn't directly translate to ""yellow,"" because the word following ""walm"" also changes to ""yellow.""

3. Example: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Analysis: In this example, the ""walm"" after ""zup"" is followed by an instance of ""green"" associated with ""dax.""

4. Example: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: The ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in repeated instances of ""yellow.""

5. Example: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: Similarly, ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to repeated instances of ""blue.""

Based on the examples and corresponding outputs, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. The Output following ""walm"" is not a single color but a repetition of the color representing the word that comes before ""walm."" If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the Output is three instances of ""yellow,"" if it's ""lug,"" it's three instances of ""blue,"" and so on.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,81
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is encountered in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in every example given. Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, it is translated to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in every provided example.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sentence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to change its meaning based on the word that immediately precedes it.

The associated colors are:
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

When ""bluf"" follows these words, it takes on the color meaning of the preceding word. So the rule seems to be:

bluf -> takes on the color of the word that comes before it in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs where ""walm"" appears:

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red

Now, let's look for patterns relative to the placement of ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors:

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" it contributes to a sequence of blue followed by yellow, then red.
2. When ""walm"" appears after ""zup wif,"" it adds three reds to the output.
3. ""dax walm"" consistently leads to three greens regardless of subsequent words.
4. ""walm"" does not seem to have a fixed color output but rather affects the sequence of colors.

Considering the different inputs and outputs, ""walm"" seems to affect the output by repeating the color that comes directly before it in the sequence.

Let's test this hypothesis against the examples:

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue repeats three times, followed by yellow and red.
2. zup wif walm -> yellow followed by red, which then repeats three times.
3. dax walm zup lug walm -> green repeats three times, then yellow, blue, and blue repeats three times.
4. dax walm -> green repeats three times (no preceding color before ""walm"" to repeat further).
5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green, red, yellow, yellow, red, and then red repeats three times.

Based on this analysis:

Rule: walm -> when appearing in an input sequence, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,82
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in each example provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we will look at the examples provided and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

2. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

4. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green

5. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""wif"" and try to correlate them with the outputs:

- The color red always follows the word ""wif,"" regardless of the word that comes after ""wif."" This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- Every other word seems to correspond with a different color. ""Dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""walm"" to red, and ""lug"" to blue. There is no instance of ""wif"" appearing without being followed by the color red in the output.

From these observations, we can determine:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Hence, the rule induction would be:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

Each time ""zup"" is introduced in the input, the output includes the word ""yellow."" Furthermore, the word ""lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue,"" as seen in the inputs ""lug zup"" and ""zup lug,"" which generate outputs containing ""blue yellow"" and ""yellow blue,"" respectively. The input involving ""walm"" has ""zup walm,"" which produces the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" may mean repeating the prior color thrice. Lastly, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" and ""bluf"" each correspond to the color ""red.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates to the color that is mentioned right before it. Here is the analysis:

- Every time ""wif"" is used, ""red"" follows.
- Every time ""lug"" is used, ""blue"" follows.
- Every time ""dax"" is used, ""green"" follows.

Now, examining each instance where ""bluf"" appears:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and the next word is ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is after ""wif,"" and the resulting word is ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is after ""dax,"" and the following word is ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is after ""dax,"" and the next word is ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which results in ""blue.""

Thus, we can conclude that the nonce word ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color word that comes before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> the color word preceding bluf is repeated.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the input and corresponding output.

1. In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here, we see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" probably is a typo meant to be ""bluf"" which corresponds to ""blue."" Now, ""walm"" is surrounded by ""blue"" outputs.
   
2. In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again is associated with repeated ""yellow.""

3. The third example ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue."" ""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows with ""blue.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" We can match ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" once again is associated with repeated ""yellow.""

5. Finally, ""dax walm zup lug dax"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue green."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is associated with repeated ""green.""

Based on the patterns observed, ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color that was previously mentioned. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> means to repeat the color mentioned before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,83
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, it is translated as ""green"".
2. The translation of the other words occurs consistently in each example. For instance:
   - ""lug"" is always translated to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" is always translated to ""red""
   - ""zup"" is always translated to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" is always translated to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" is always translated to ""red"" or ""green"" (note that ""bluf"" appears to be inconsistent)

With the given examples, there is no clear pattern for ""bluf"", as it translates to ""red"" in the third example but to ""green"" in the fifth, suggesting there might be additional context or rules that aren't provided. However, with the information available, the most consistent translation for ""dax"" across all examples is the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Rule: wif corresponds to the color ""red.""
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we can analyze the input and output pairs to identify which part of the output is consistently present whenever ""zup"" appears in the input.

Input: wif dax zup
Output: red green yellow

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red

Input: lug zup wif
Output: blue yellow red

From these pairs, we can observe that the word ""yellow"" appears in the output every time ""zup"" appears in the input. Regardless of ""zup""'s position in the input list or the presence of other words, ""yellow"" is always in the corresponding position in the output list. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Every time ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. The rule is consistent across all provided examples.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will look at each example and see what output is associated with the use of ""walm.""

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

4. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Looking at the examples given, we can observe the following:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows a ""wif"" and is followed by a ""dax,"" and the output is ""red red red green yellow."" 
- In the second example, ""walm"" is the last word, and the previous word is ""zup,"" and we see the output as ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows a ""lug"" which generally outputs blue, but here it is followed by two ""zup"" which correspond to yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" again follows ""wif"" and it's followed by ""zup,"" and the output corresponds to ""red red red yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows a series of ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and we see it produces a ""red red green green red red red."" After ""walm"" we have ""lug,"" which is normally blue, but in this context is red.

From these observations, we hypothesize that ""walm"" causes the next word's associated color to become ""red,"" unless the next word is ""zup,"" in which case the output color for ""walm"" itself is ""red.""

Rule: ""walm"" turns the next word's output color into ""red""; if the next word is ""zup,"" then ""walm"" is output as ""red.""

Now, we need to cross-reference this rule with the examples to verify it:

- In the first example, the word following ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which is normally green, but it has been turned red by ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end, followed by ""zup,"" suggesting that ""walm"" itself could be represented by the red color it forces upon the following word.
- In the third case, the rule seems to hold since ""walm"" precedes the change to red for ""lug.""
- The fourth example also follows the rule since ""walm"" is output as red and the ""zup"" remains its normal color, yellow.
- The fifth example holds the rule as well, turning the following ""lug"" red.

Thus, the rule proposed seems consistent across the examples:

walm -> The word ""walm"" modifies the color output of the following word to ""red."" If ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" then ""walm"" itself is output as ""red"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

From the provided examples, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output has the color ""green."" Moreover, different non-dax words (lug, wif, zup, bluf, walm) correspond with other colors. It seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the list. There is no apparent variation or context-dependence in the meaning of ""dax."" It can be inferred as a static rule.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can observe the consistent pattern where the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. However, the color following 'wif' appears to be contingent on the word that comes after it.

In the examples:

- When 'wif' is followed by 'lug', the output is 'blue'.
- When 'wif' is followed by 'dax', the output is 'green'.
- When 'wif' is not immediately followed by another word that is recognized in the examples ('lug', 'dax', 'bluf'), it defaults back to the color 'red'.

Also, 'wif' seems to be able to appear more than once in the input sequence, with its meaning persisting as 'red', unless it directly precedes other known words ('lug' or 'dax'), which changes the succeeding color.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: 'wif' -> 'red', but also seems to modify the color produced by the next word in the sequence (if it is a word for which a pattern is established). If 'wif' precedes 'lug', the output is 'blue', and if 'wif' precedes 'dax', the output is 'green'. If 'wif' stands alone or if it's followed by words that are not part of the established pattern ('bluf', 'walm', 'zup'), it results in 'red'.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently in every example provided, regardless of context or position within the sequence of words.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when it directly follows certain words, while it corresponds to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"". However, when ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", its corresponding color changes to ""blue"". Here's an analysis:

- ""lug dax bluf zup"" → ""blue green green yellow""
- ""dax bluf wif"" → ""green green red""
- ""wif bluf dax"" → ""red red green""
- ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" → ""green green red yellow red""
- ""wif zup bluf lug"" → ""red yellow yellow blue""

Bluf's meaning changes based on the word that comes immediately after it:
- Following ""dax"" or ""wif"" it is ""green""
- Following ""zup"" it is ""yellow""
- Following ""lug"" it is ""blue""

Based on these observations, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""green"" unless it is preceded by ""zup,"" in which case it means ""yellow,"" or followed by ""lug,"" in which case it means ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of ""walm"" results in three repeated colors. Examining the inputs and outputs more closely, we can try to deduce what the repeated color is and if there is a specific rule:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" might output a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word right before it. Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow green green green red."" Directly before the first ""walm,"" we have ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so again ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated thrice.

3. In the third example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" has the output ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Directly before ""walm,"" we have ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we see ""yellow"" repeated thrice after ""walm.""

4. In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, the pattern holds; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated thrice. Then we have ""lug"" before the second ""walm,"" and this results in ""blue"" being repeated. However, directly after ""lug,"" we have ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by another walm, which results in three ""yellow."" This suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it, not the word that is two words before it.

5. In the last example, ""dax wif walm"" yields ""green red red red."" Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated thrice.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" results in the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it being repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green,green red yellow green,True,85
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in these examples.
dax -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as the color green.

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is included in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for a pattern in each input and its respective output.

1. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" translates to ""red""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
   
2. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
   
3. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" does not appear alone, but ""wif walm"" results in ""red red""
   
4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   - The sequence ""wif walm"" repeats twice, each time resulting in ""red red red""
   - ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue""
   
5. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" again translates to ""red""
   - The placement of ""wif"" does not appear to alter its translation—post ""wif"" is ""red""

Across the examples, ""wif"" always translates to ""red,"" regardless of position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
Based on the given examples, I will analyze the pattern of inputs and outputs to determine the meaning of the word ""zup.""

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow

In this example, ""dax"" and ""walm"" both translate to ""green,"" whereas ""wif"" translates to ""red."" After ""wif,"" the word ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Here ""zup"" is the only word in the input, and the output is ""yellow,"" which directly corresponds to ""zup.""

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

""Dax"" and ""walm"" both still correspond to ""green."" ""Lug"" appears for the first time, and the output ""blue"" is repeated three times, which corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is repeated after ""lug."" The word ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Once again, ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green."" However, after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" is repeated two more times, and the output also repeats ""yellow"" two more times.

Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green

""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Following ""zup,"" ""dax"" appears again and translates to ""green,"" just as it did initially.

From the given examples, we can construct the rule for ""zup"" as follows:

**Rule:** ""zup"" produces an output of ""yellow."" Additionally, when a word appears immediately after ""zup,"" the output for that word changes to repeat the color corresponding to ""zup"" (yellow) for as many times as that word appears consecutively. If the word following ""zup"" is not repeated consecutively, then ""zup"" simply results in a single ""yellow,"" and the following words revert to their original corresponding colors.

Hence, the definition:
zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems like the word ""bluf"" is repeated the same number of times as the word that appears directly before it. Here is the breakdown of each example and the corresponding pattern observed:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow 
   (The word ""bluf"" appears once after ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow"" once.)
   
2. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   (The word ""bluf"" appears once after ""wif"" and is translated to ""red"" twice.)
   
3. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue
   (The word ""bluf"" appears once after ""lug"" and is translated to ""blue"" twice.)
   
4. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   (The word ""bluf"" appears once after ""dax"" and is translated to ""green"" twice in the first part, and once in the second part.)
   
5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   (The word ""bluf"" appears once after ""wif"" and is translated to ""red"" twice.)

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word right before it and repeats that color once more. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the word before it, one additional time.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. Here is how it aligns with the examples provided:

Input: zup dax lug walm zup - Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
- ""walm"" comes after ""lug"", which corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" becomes blue.

Input: lug zup walm lug - Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""walm"" comes after ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" becomes yellow.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif - Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", which corresponds to green, so ""walm"" becomes green.

Input: dax walm zup - Output: green green green yellow
- ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", which corresponds to green, so ""walm"" becomes green.

Input: wif bluf dax walm - Output: red red green green green
- ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", which corresponds to green, so ""walm"" becomes green.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,86
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, lug consistently translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: lug = blue
Based on the provided examples, we can make a deduction about the word ""dax"" as follows:

Example 1: wif dax bluf -> red green green
Example 2: dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
Example 3: wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow
Example 4: lug dax -> blue green
Example 5: dax -> green

From the above, we can see that whenever ""dax"" appears, the output contains ""green."" It is also the only consistent color across all different outputs. Given this information, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

Looking at the patterns, it seems ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently in the examples provided:

- Input: ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" outputs yellow, green, green, red, yellow, yellow, blue, where ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- Input: ""dax wif"" outputs green, red, with ""wif"" corresponding to red.
- Input: ""wif lug"" outputs red, blue, with ""wif"" again translating to red.
- Input: ""wif walm"" outputs red, red, red, showing ""wif"" meaning red three times.
- Input: ""dax bluf lug wif"" outputs green, green, blue, red, with ""wif"" being the last word translated to red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" when isolated translates to the single color ""yellow."" In sequences, each word is translated to a color and ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The word ""zup"" does not seem to modify the colors associated with other words around it and holds its value as ""yellow"" regardless of position in the sequence of words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's find patterns in the examples provided:

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green

Here, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" we will consider the possibility of ""bluf"" translating to ""green"" as it comes after ""dax"" which translates to the same color, but we need to check other occurrences to confirm.

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

In this example, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" correlates with ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" which is consistent with the color that ""zup"" translates to. This supports the idea that ""bluf"" might translate to the color that precedes it, but we need more data.

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

Here ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Bluf"" translates to ""red,"" which is consistent with the color ""wif"" is matched to.

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Again, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red."" This supports the idea that ""bluf"" may adopt the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red."" This further supports the pattern we have observed.

From these examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the word before it.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is related to the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. To deduce the rule, let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. Since ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times, it indicates that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it.

2. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
- Following the same logic, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
- Once again, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in ""green"" being repeated. Later, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" again, resulting in a repetition of ""green.""

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
- In this case, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated.

Rule:
walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it. The color is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,87
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds directly to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
- ""walm"" repeated ""red"" in the output which corresponds to ""wif"", showing consistency.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, which is the same as ""dax"", but since there's insufficient data to conclude a consistent rule for ""bluf,"" we focus on the rule for ""dax.""

In every instance where ""dax"" is used, it is followed by the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs to find a consistent pattern.

- In the first example, ""zup dax zup"" corresponds to ""yellow green yellow"". The word ""zup"" appears twice and both times it is translated to ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""zup dax wif"" maps to ""yellow green red"". The word ""zup"" appears once and is translated to ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""lug dax zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow blue red"". In this example, ""zup"" is again translated to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"" turns into ""yellow red red red"". The word ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" once more.
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" is represented by ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". The word ""zup"" appears twice: once it is translated to ""yellow"" and another time it appears as ""yellow yellow yellow"", which might suggest a pattern of repetition or emphasis when ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"".

Given these examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"", despite some contextual variations which may not be fully explained with the given data (specifically the ""yellow yellow yellow"" outcome in the final example).

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the provided examples, we can determine a pattern for the word ""bluf"" by looking at its position in the sentence and the corresponding output in each case.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""red"" since it is producing an additional ""red"" in the output. But we need more examples to confirm this.

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

In this sequence, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" again, and once again, the word preceding ""bluf"" appears twice in the output.

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" appears twice, which implies that ""bluf"" could mean a repetition of the color linked to the word that precedes it.

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated. Next, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated. This further supports the idea that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Once more, ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word, ""wif,"" so we get ""red red"" before moving on to the next word, ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.
Based on the examples provided, we can observe that the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" in a sequence results in the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. In each example, the color name following ""walm"" is a repetition of the color that comes from translating the word right before ""walm."" Here is the breakdown:

Example 1: ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow green green green red."" The ""green"" repeats after ""dax"" once ""walm"" is introduced, until a new word ""wif"" appears.

Example 2: ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" Here ""red"" repeats after ""wif"" when ""walm"" follows it, until the sequence is broken by ""dax.""

Example 3: ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" The ""red"" repeats following ""wif"" due to ""walm.""

Example 4: ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" The ""yellow"" repeats following ""zup"" with ""walm"" afterward.

Example 5: ""lug walm wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red."" The ""blue"" repeats after ""lug"" due to the presence of ""walm"" until ""wif"" appears.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat until a new word is introduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word is consistently associated with a specific color as its output. Here's the color association for each word, as far as we can infer:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> green

Therefore, the rule we can induce here is that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, we have the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Given the examples:

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red
- Here, dax corresponds to the first green in the output.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- Here, dax corresponds to the last green in the output.

Input: wif zup dax
Output: red yellow green
- Again, dax corresponds to the last green in the output.

Input: lug bluf dax bluf
Output: blue blue green green
- Here, dax corresponds to the first green in the output.

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
- Here, dax corresponds to the second color (green) in the output.

In each example, the word dax consistently corresponds to the color green in the output. Therefore, the rule is that dax translates to the color green.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

We can see that ""wif"" is followed by ""red"", ""walm"" also gives ""red"", while ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red

Here, ""zup"" remains ""yellow"", and ""wif"" remains ""red"". ""lug"" gives blue, ""dax"" gives green, and ""bluf"" also gives green.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Again, ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red"".

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

""zup"" gives yellow, ""bluf"" gives a yellow this time (not green as previously), ""wif"" gives red, and ""walm"" also results in red.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Rule:

The straightforward association is that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in all instances no matter the context, which is consistent across all examples. The other words also seem to correspond to particular colors but may vary in certain contexts or with different combinations (as seen with ""bluf"" which resulted in yellow in one instance and green in another). With the information given, we can’t deduce the full rule set for ""bluf"", ""walm"", or ""zup"" but ""wif"" is consistently associated with ""red"".

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to a color representation as follows:

- In the first example, ""zup"" alone results in ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif dax walm,"" which translates to ""yellow red green green green."" This suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" possibly contributes to ""green,"" and ""walm"" adds additional ""green"" outputs.
- In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup"" produces ""red red red green yellow."" Since the last output word is ""yellow"" and corresponds to ""zup,"" once again implying ""zup"" equals ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup lug wif"" translates to ""red yellow blue red."" Here ""zup"" is in the second position, corresponding to ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" appears twice, with each instance corresponding to a ""yellow"" in the output sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position or the context in the input sequence.
The examples given show a consistent response when the nonce word ""bluf"" is used. In each case where ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue."" Here is the correlation:

- dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
- wif bluf dax -> red red green
- dax lug bluf -> green blue blue
- zup dax bluf zup dax -> yellow green green yellow green
- lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green

In all instances, regardless of the other words' outputs, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the patterns and colors in the input and output:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   
   Analyzing this, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""walm"" in this sequence leads to three occurrences of ""yellow"" followed by the ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif"".

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
   Here, ""lug"" results in ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes a triple ""blue"" in the output.

3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   
   This sequence reaffirms the meanings of ""zup"" (yellow), ""lug"" (blue), ""dax"" (green), and ""wif"" (red). ""bluf"" results in ""red"" as well, which suggests that ""bluf"" could also correspond to the same output as ""wif"". ""walm"" follows ""yellow"" again, resulting in an additional two occurrences of ""yellow"".

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and following it, ""walm"" again causes repetition, this time of ""red"".

5. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and following ""dax"", ""walm"" leads to additional occurrences of ""green"".

From these examples we can deduce that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color given before it, for a total of three times (including the initial mention). If ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes three occurrences of the color corresponding to the word that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to appear three times in total in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the examples provided, we can induce that the outputs are sequences of colored words, and that the presence of ""lug"" in the input correlates with ""blue"" in the output. Each input word seems to map to a specific color in the output. To figure out the rule for ""lug,"" let's start by comparing the inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
2. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
3. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
4. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
5. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""

From the first example, we see that including ""lug"" before ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""blue."" This pattern is consistent across the examples — whenever ""lug"" precedes another word, the output has a corresponding ""blue"" for each instance of ""lug"" and for each instance of the following word.

The second and third examples further indicate that ""lug"" doesn't just result in one blue, but rather a number of blues equal to the number of words following ""lug"" (plus one for the ""lug"" itself).

The fourth example introduces more words and a second instance of ""lug"" within the string. Still, this instance of ""lug"" is followed by only one word, therefore only one ""blue"" follows in the output.

Based on the observations, we derive the following rule for ""lug"":

Rule: ""lug"" translates to repeated instances of ""blue"" in the output, with the number of blues equal to the number of words following ""lug"" in the sequence, plus one for the ""lug"" itself.

So, lug -> meaning:

Lug: The word immediately after ""lug"" is represented as ""blue"" in the output, and additional ""blue"" words are added for each word following ""lug"" up to the next nonce word or the end of the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of dax, let's look at the patterns in each pair of inputs and outputs:

Input: wif dax zup wif
Output: red green yellow red
- Here, we see that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" When ""dax"" appears, it is followed by ""green.""

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- ""dax"" at the beginning results in ""green,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The second ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""blue,"" with ""dax"" at the end corresponding to ""green.""

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" is again followed by ""green.""

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""green.""

Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently output the word ""red."" When ""wif"" is followed by other nonce words, it adds to the output, but ""wif"" itself always results in ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Wif -> ""red"" 

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it contributes the word ""red"" to the output.
The context provided through the examples gives us a pattern to analyze:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif  
   Output: green green red yellow red
   
2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm  
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: lug bluf zup lug  
   Output: blue blue yellow blue
   
4. Input: zup lug dax  
   Output: yellow blue green
   
5. Input: zup  
   Output: yellow
   
Based on these examples, we have multiple instances where the word ""zup"" is inputted and ""yellow"" is outputted. ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string. We don’t have enough examples that show ""zup"" changing to any color other than yellow, which suggests that our rule is straightforward.

Rule: zup -> yellow
By examining the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns for the non-words ""lug"", ""dax"", ""bluf"", ""wif"", and ""zup"":

- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".

For the non-word ""bluf"", it seems to correspond to a repetition of the preceding color in the sequence:

- In ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and the corresponding output after ""green"" is ""green"".
- In ""dax lug bluf wif"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", and the corresponding output after ""blue"" is ""blue"".
- In ""lug bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", and the output is ""blue blue"".
- In ""dax zup bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", and the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- In ""zup lug bluf wif"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", and the output after ""blue"" is ""blue"".

Based on this pattern, we can establish the meaning of ""bluf"":

bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: ""bluf"" means a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it.
Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can observe how the appearance of ""walm"" affects the output:

- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" leads to a single ""blue,"" but after ""walm"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times. This suggests ""walm"" might indicate a repetition of the previous color mentioned.
  
- ""lug dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green green green red."" After ""dax,"" ""walm"" again causes the color ""green"" to be repeated multiple times before moving on to the next item ""wif.""

- ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" ""Walm"" occurs after ""wif"" and before ""dax,"" resulting in ""red"" being outputted three times consecutively.

- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" The word ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is the color ""green"" repeated three times.

- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow."" Here, ""walm"" after ""dax"" causes “green” to repeat, and ""walm"" after ""wif"" causes “red” to repeat thrice before moving on to ""zup.""

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. So the rule would be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,90
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided context.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

In every instance, regardless of position or surrounding words, when ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.

Here is a breakdown of the instances:

1. Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green
2. Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green
3. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> Output: red red yellow red blue green
4. Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
5. Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green.
To induce the rule for the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the given examples.

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

3. Input: wif
   Output: red

4. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

5. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green

First, note that in every instance where the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" follows.

From example 1, ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" and the output is ""red"" followed by ""red red,"" which seems to indicate that ""wif"" may mean ""repeat the next color twice.""

Additionally, in example 5, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""red"" followed by ""yellow,"" not repeating the color ""yellow."" However, we should note that the word ""dax"" appears on both sides of ""wif zup,"" and is represented by the color ""green"" on both sides. This suggests that ""wif"" may not be related to the word after it, but rather, ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"" itself—regardless of the word that follows.

The second example further confirms the idea that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" independent of the following word. Each instance of ""wif"" yields a ""red"" in the output. Even when ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is still red, followed by the corresponding color of ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

Examples 3 and 4 show standalone instances of ""wif"" leading to the output ""red"" or ""red yellow"" when followed by ""zup.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" independent of any subsequent words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can see a pattern where each input corresponds to a color in the output. Observing the inputs and their respective outputs, we can deduce the following associations between words and colors:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red

It appears that regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence, the output always contains the color ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" maps directly to the color ""yellow."" The order of colors in the output corresponds to the order of associated words in the input.

Therefore, the rule we can infer is:

zup -> yellow

Meaning that no matter the context, when ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output corresponding to its position in the input sequence.
Analyzing the provided examples and matching each ""bluf"" occurrence with its respective output, we observe the following pattern:

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue."" The last ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it, which is ""lug"" for blue.
- In the second example, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" becomes ""red blue blue yellow yellow green."" Each ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word: the first ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" for blue, and the second ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" for yellow.
- In the third example, ""dax zup bluf"" turns into ""green yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" is yellow, following ""zup.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" becomes ""blue yellow yellow green."" The ""bluf"" in this case is yellow again, taking the color of ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue."" The ""bluf"" takes the color red from the preceding ""wif.""

From these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Observing the provided examples, we can see that each word corresponds to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> ?

Now, to deduce the meaning of the word 'walm', we can look for patterns in the output relative to the input.

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, the word ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and results in three ""yellow"" instead of one.

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red red"", or three reds.

3. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   In this instance, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and we see ""red red red"" once again after it.

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and we get ""yellow yellow yellow"".

5. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Finally, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".

From these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. For example, if ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to yellow), the output is three instances of ""yellow"". Similarly, if ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output is three instances of ""red"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True,91
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green."" In each case where ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. No contextual variations seem to affect the meaning of ""dax"" in the given examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, wif seems to consistently translate to the word 'red'. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of wif can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. It seems that ""zup"" stands for the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the pattern of words before and after ""bluf"" and their corresponding outputs:

- In every input where ""bluf"" appears, the resulting output contains a duplicated color word corresponding to the word that precedes ""bluf.""
- After the duplicated color, there is a new color that corresponds to the word following ""bluf"" (if any).

Let's look at the examples to understand this pattern:

1. Input: ""wif bluf lug""
   Output: ""red red blue""
   
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color ""red."" Since ""red"" is repeated after ""bluf,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" causes the preceding color to duplicate. The word after ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" corresponding to the color ""blue.""

2. Input: ""zup bluf dax""
   Output: ""yellow yellow green""
   
   Here, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" which is then duplicated. Afterwards, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

3. Input: ""dax wif dax zup bluf""
   Output: ""green red green yellow yellow""
   
   There is no word after ""bluf"" in this case, but we can still see the preceding word ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" is repeated after ""bluf.""

4. Input: ""wif bluf""
   Output: ""red red""
   
   Only the word ""wif"" is before ""bluf,"" and the corresponding color ""red"" is duplicated. No words come after ""bluf"" to give us another color.

5. Input: ""zup bluf dax lug""
   Output: ""yellow yellow green blue""
   
   Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is duplicated after ""bluf,"" and the following words correspond to their respective colors.

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be duplicated in the output, followed by the color corresponding to the word immediately after ""bluf"" (if there is one).

Therefore, the rule is: bluf -> duplicate the preceding color word, then add the following color word if available.
walm -> ""repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times""

Rule: If a word appears before ""walm,"" look up what color corresponds to that word. Then, output that color three times. In the given examples, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green. Thus when each is followed by ""walm,"" the output is their corresponding color repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in each example corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be:

dax -> green

Each instance of ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the other words present. 

Rule: dax means green.
wif -> meaning. Meaning: red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. When ""wif"" is placed between two identical words, those words retain their associated colors, with ""wif"" adding red in between them. When ""wif"" stands alone, the output is simply red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds with the output ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is repeated after the last unique color mentioned before ""bluf"". Analyzing the examples given:

1. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translated to ""yellow red green red red"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, repeated before ""bluf"".
2. ""zup lug bluf"" translated to ""yellow blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, repeated before ""bluf"".
3. ""wif bluf dax"" translated to ""red red green"". Here, red is repeated after ""wif"" but before ""dax"".
4. ""dax zup bluf"" translated to ""green yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, repeated before ""bluf"".
5. ""zup bluf"" translated to ""yellow yellow"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, repeated after ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern in the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue."" ""Dax"" and ""lug"" are associated with colors ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively, and ""walm"" is paired with ""green,"" the same color as ""dax.""

- In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" ""Zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. Again, ""walm"" takes the color ""red,"" matching the color associated with the word immediately before it, ""wif.""

- In the third example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" it takes on the color ""green,"" the same as the following word ""dax.""

- In the fourth input, ""zup walm dax lug,"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" Here ""walm"" again matches the color of the word immediately before it, ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Again, ""walm"" takes on the color ""red,"" which corresponds to the color of the preceding word ""wif.""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word immediately before it. If there is no word before it, the rule can't be deduced from the given examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True,93
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we will try to establish a pattern for the word ""lug"" and its corresponding output.

From the given examples:

- ""lug"" by itself produces the output ""blue,"" so it suggests that ""lug"" maps directly to ""blue.""
- In sequences where ""lug"" appears with other nonce words, it consistently results in ""blue"" being part of the output sequence, such as ""lug zup"" mapping to ""blue yellow,"" and ""wif lug"" mapping to ""red blue.""
- The position of ""lug"" among other nonce words does not seem to influence its output; it consistently maps to ""blue,"" whether it's at the beginning, middle, or end of a sequence.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its placement in the input sequence or the other nonce words present. 

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following relationships between the input and the output:

- Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is present in the output.
- The presence of other words in the input correlates with additional color names in the output.
- The color order in the output seems to be based on the order of the words in the input.

Inferring from each example:

1. ""wif"" corresponds with ""red""
2. ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue""
3. ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow""
4. ""walm"" corresponds with ""blue"" (repeated three times possibly corresponding to its position relative to ""lug"")
5. ""dax"" by itself corresponds with ""green""

From these observations, we can induce that ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" consistently.

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the correlations between the appearances of ""wif"" in the inputs and the colors in the outputs. It appears that every time ""wif"" is used in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output.

Here are the specific examples:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red 
   We see that ""wif"" correlates with the first ""red"".

2. Input: zup wif lug -> Output: yellow red blue 
   ""wif"" directly correlates with ""red"".

3. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
   The first ""red"" correlates with ""wif"".

4. Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
   The first ""red"" correlates with ""wif"".

5. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   The ""red"" at the end correlates with ""wif"" at the end.

From these examples, we can induce that ""wif"" correlates directly with the word ""red"" in the output. 

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples, whenever the word ""zup"" is used, the output includes the color ""yellow."" The position of ""zup"" in the input does not affect its representation in the output; it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position amidst other words.
Given the provided data, we can infer the following relations:

1. lug bluf -> blue blue
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
4. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
5. wif bluf dax -> red red green

Rule:

- When bluf follows a word, it repeats the color associated with that word.

So the rule seems to be that bluf repeats the color output of the word that comes immediately before it. For example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" therefore ""lug bluf"" gives ""blue blue"". Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" hence ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color mentioned before it.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze how its presence affects the output in each given example:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three consecutive ""yellow"":
   - Input: ""zup walm dax zup dax wif""
   - Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""

2. When ""walm"" appears at the end of a sequence after ""wif,"" the output is ""red"":
   - Input: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm""
   - Output: ""green red yellow yellow red red red""

3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" by itself, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"":
   - Input: ""zup walm""
   - Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""

4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is two additional ""blue"" (total of three ""blue""):
   - Input: ""lug walm wif""
   - Output: ""blue blue blue red""

5. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" in a sequence, it leads to two additional ""yellow"" (total of three ""yellow""):
   - Input: ""lug wif dax zup walm""
   - Output: ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""

Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be outputted three times total. If a color word is mentioned once before ""walm,"" it is repeated twice more after that. If ""walm"" is at the end following a non-color word, it defaults to ""red.""

Rule:
walm -> When preceding a color, causes that color to be repeated three times total; if at the end or not following a color word, defaults to ""red"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. 

Rule: In all given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
By analyzing the given examples, we can try to deduce the rule based on the position of ""dax"" in the input phrases and the corresponding output colors.

1. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green

2. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

3. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green

4. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue

5. Input: wif lug dax lug
   Output: red blue green blue

From the given input and output pairs, we observe the following:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it's the final word and ""red"" if followed by another word
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in every instance it appears. The position of ""dax"" in the sentence and the words it is combined with do not appear to affect its corresponding output. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" based on these examples.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" from the given examples, let's examine the inputs and outputs closely.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to the first ""red""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the following ""red red""

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- Without ""dax,"" ""wif"" again seems to correspond to the first ""red""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red""

Input: dax lug dax lug wif
Output: green blue green blue red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- The sequence ends with ""wif"" which corresponds to the final ""red""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" seems to be ""blue red"" in this context
- ""wif"" is followed by the single ""red""
- ""bluf"" at the end corresponds to ""blue blue""

Input: wif zup wif dax
Output: red yellow red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- In between the ""red"" is ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow""
- The final ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green""

Based on these observations, the ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in every example.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The other words seem to translate to unique colors in the output as well (for example, ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red, ""walm"" -> blue), and ""zup"" never deviates from this pattern. 

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the input and output examples provided, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color represented by the word immediately preceding it. To verify this, let's analyze the pattern:

1. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue
   Rule application: ""lug"" is blue, ""bluf"" follows and is also blue.

2. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   Rule application: ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" follows and is also yellow.

3. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red
   Rule application: ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" follows and is also green.

4. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   Rule application: ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" follows and is also red.

5. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   Rule application: ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" follows and is also yellow.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs to find patterns.

Looking at the examples:

1. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue
2. dax wif walm -> green red red red
3. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
4. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. dax walm -> green green green

Based on these examples, the following patterns are noticeable:
- Every time ""walm"" appears, we see a repetition of the color that precedes its appearance:
  
  Example 1: zup walm - yellow yellow yellow
  Example 2: wif walm - red red red
  Example 3: dax walm - green green green
  Example 4: zup walm - yellow yellow yellow

- The occurrences of ""walm"" are not just repetitions, but they also seem to repeat the color of the last mentioned word before ""walm"" as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the sequence:
  
  Example 1: ""walm"" is the second word, so ""yellow"" is repeated twice after the first instance.
  Example 2: ""walm"" is the third word, so ""red"" is repeated three times total.
  Example 3: ""walm"" is the fourth word, so ""green"" is repeated three more times after the first instance (four times total).
  Example 4: ""walm"" is the sixth word, so ""yellow"" is repeated five more times after the first instance (six times total).
  Example 5: ""walm"" is the second word, so ""green"" is repeated twice after the first instance.

From this analysis, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the word sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm dax
    ",Output: red red red green,red red red green,True,95
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in each example.
Considering the examples provided:

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

From the examples, we can see that every instance of ""wif"" in the inputs corresponds directly to ""red"" in the outputs, regardless of its position or the context.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" consistently leads to the output ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output sequence, and it seems independent of the position of the word ""zup"" within the input sequence. The other words in the inputs such as ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax"" seem to correspond to other specific colors (""bluf"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green), assuming a one-to-one relationship between the input words and output colors.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples:

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

It appears that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word
Rule: The word ""walm"" when used after another word repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times. 

- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup is associated with yellow).
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" (lug is associated with blue).
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" leads to ""red red red blue blue"" (wif is associated with red and lug is associated with blue).

Therefore: walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the associated output is ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color ""red"" in the corresponding outputs. Regardless of its position amongst other nonce words, ""wif"" always translates to ""red."" Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". The repetition of the single input ""zup"" yielding the single output ""yellow"" solidifies this direct relationship. Additionally, the longer string that includes ""zup"" also translates to a color sequence where ""zup"" is directly translated to ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule is quite straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the preceding word. If there is no color associated with the preceding word, ""bluf"" repeats the most recent color mentioned.

Explanation:
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" here means ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif.""
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" takes the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" assumes the color ""blue"" associated with ""lug.""
- In ""zup bluf dax lug,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and thus takes on the color ""yellow"" associated with ""zup."" There is no specific rule for ""dax,"" but it seems to signify the color ""green"" based on its placement in this and the following example.
- In ""zup dax bluf zup dax,"" ""bluf"" again follows ""zup"" and thus translates to ""yellow."" The pattern also shows ""dax"" being followed by ""green,"" indicating that ""dax"" means ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the color outputs corresponding to its occurrences and see if there's a consistent pattern.

From the examples given, we can see:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm  
   Output: red red green green green
   
2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug  
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

3. Input: wif walm dax  
   Output: red red red green

4. Input: zup walm  
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug  
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

In every example where ""walm"" appears, the color sequence always ends with multiple instances of the last color mentioned:

- In the first example, walm is followed by two ""green"" which is the color corresponding to ""dax.""
- In the second example, walm is followed by three ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup.""
- In the third example, walm is followed by one ""green"" which is the color corresponding to ""dax"" since it is at the end of the sequence.
- In the fourth example, walm is followed by three ""yellow,"" again corresponding to ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, walm is followed by two ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif"" since ""walm"" precedes it.

From this pattern, we can infer that ""walm"" results in repeating the color output of the last color word mentioned before it, the number of times appears to equal the number of times ""walm"" has been used in the sequence counting from the backwards.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color word an increasing number of times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True,97
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word 'lug' translates to the color 'blue' regardless of its position in the sequence.
Observing the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green"".
  
  - Example 1: ""dax zup"" produces ""green yellow"".
  - Example 2: ""wif zup dax"" produces ""red yellow green"".
  - Example 3: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" produces a sequence with ""green"" occurring at the positions where ""dax"" is mentioned in the input.
  - Example 4: ""wif dax lug walm"" includes ""dax"" and the corresponding part of the output is ""green"".
  - Example 5: When ""dax"" is the only input, the output is solely ""green"".

Based on this information, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the input-output pairs provided, we can attempt to induce the rules governing the meaning of the word ""wif"" and the other nonce words. Let's break down each example to see if a pattern emerges:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - Here, ""wif"" corresponds directly to ""red"".

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" effectively triples the output of the preceding word.

3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", as seen by the first and last pairing of ""lug"" with ""blue"".
   - ""walm"" again triples the output of the preceding word, as shown after ""lug"".
   - ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"".
   - ""wif"" appears at the end paired with ""red"".

4. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"", consistent with previous examples.

5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow"", and given that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" might either be a repetition of the previous word or have its own rule not yet induced.

Rule:
wif -> red

The meaning of ""wif"" is consistently ""red"" across all examples.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" consistently. The presence of ""zup"" in each input results in ""yellow"" in the corresponding output. The other words seem to have their own color associations as well, like ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" with ""yellow."" However, since we are focusing on the word ""zup,"" the key observation is its consistent translation to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context within the input string.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, each time the word ""bluf"" appears, it is translated as ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to consistently mean ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" let's look at the patterns surrounding its use and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   
3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   
5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

Analyzing the outputs:

- When ""walm"" is present after ""wif,"" the following output is ""red red red green"".
- When ""walm"" is present after ""dax,"" the following output is ""green green green"".
- When ""walm"" is present at the end of the input (after another word), the immediate output is ""green"".

Based on the observed patterns, it seems that ""walm"" translates to a sequence of ""green"" outputs with the number of greens potentially dependent on the position of ""walm"" within the input or the words that precede it. Specifically:
- ""wif walm"" leads to three ""red"" followed by one ""green"".
- ""dax walm"" leads to three ""green"" irrespective of the number of times ""dax"" appears before.
- ""zup walm"" leads to two ""green"".
- When ""walm"" appears at the end, it translates to just a ""green"".

Given the inconsistencies and the limited context we can deduce that ""walm"" generally translates to ""green"", but the number of times ""green"" appears seems to be influenced by the preceding word(s) and possibly its position in the sequence, which is not entirely clear with the provided data.

Rule: walm -> generally translates to the color ""green"", with the amount of green potentially affected by the preceding word(s) and its position in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" When ""dax"" is used in combination with other nonce words, it maintains its association with ""green,"" and the additional nonce words are associated with other colors. For example, ""bluf"" and ""walm"" are both associated with ""green"" when they follow ""dax,"" while ""lug"" and ""zup"" are associated with ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, when in the context of other words following ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" and when used, it colors the following words with their respective corresponding colors until a new word specifies a different color. 

Here is the rule interpretation for each example:

1. dax bluf -> green green (both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" mean green)
2. dax walm -> green green green (both ""dax"" and ""walm"" mean green)
3. dax -> green (just ""dax"" means green)
4. zup dax bluf zup dax -> yellow green green yellow green (zup means yellow and changes the color association, while ""dax"" resets it back to green)
5. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow (here ""dax"" means green, but ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" seem to associate with red after ""dax,"" and ""zup"" changes the association to yellow)

This rule is generated based on the given data and may not hold true for other unseen examples without further testing.
Based on the provided examples, the word 'wif' translates to the color 'red'. 

Here's how the pattern is understood:

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", implying that both 'wif' and 'bluf' mean 'red'.
- ""zup wif zup"" translates to ""yellow red yellow"", meaning 'zup' translates to 'yellow' and 'wif' to 'red'.
- ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"", meaning 'wif' translates to 'red' and 'lug' to 'blue'.
- ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red"", thus 'dax' is 'green', 'lug' is 'blue', and 'wif' is 'red'.
- ""lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow red"", which infers that 'lug' is 'blue', 'walm' is also 'blue', 'zup' is 'yellow', and 'wif' is 'red'.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Hence, the rule seems straightforward for the word ""zup"" by itself:

zup -> yellow

However, when ""zup"" is followed by other words such as ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""bluf wif walm,"" there are additional colors associated with each word. Given the limited data, I would induce that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" (or ""blue"" repeated three times), ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Thus, the overarching rule for ""zup"" followed by other specific nonce words appears to generate a sequence of color words, with ""zup"" representing ""yellow"" and other words transforming into color sequences accordingly.

Rule:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue blue blue (or repeating ""blue"" three times)
- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red

It's important to note that the rule for each of the accompanying words is inferred based on a single instance of data, and more examples would be required for robust rule induction.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". In each input where ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue"". Additionally, other words seem to correspond to different colors based on their consistent output: ""lug"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow, and ""dax"" -> green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns present in the examples:

Example 1:
Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
In this sequence, everything after ""walm"" repeats the color before ""walm,"" which is yellow, until ""lug"" appears again, which corresponds to blue.

Example 2:
Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
In this sequence again, ""walm"" causes the color before it (green) to repeat until a new input word (lug, then wif) introduces a new color (blue, then red).

Example 3:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
Here, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color red until ""lug"" appears prompting a change to blue and then back to red with ""wif.""

Example 4:
Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
This is identical to Example 1 and the pattern holds.

Example 5:
Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""walm"" causes the color green to repeat until ""zup"" appears, changing the color to yellow which then repeats after the second ""walm.""

Rule:
The pattern suggests that ""walm"" functions as an instruction to repeat the color output corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" until a new input word changes the color.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" could be defined as follows:
walm -> Repeat the previously mentioned color until a new input word introduces a change in color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules for the meanings of the words ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm."" Each word corresponds to a specific color.

""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" as seen in every example where it is mentioned.

""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" It appears twice in the third input followed by the color red in the output each time, and it appears in the first input before ""bluf"" and both are followed by red in the output.

""bluf"" also corresponds to the color ""red."" It appears in the first input before ""wif"" and in the third input immediately followed by red in the output.

""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" It is present in the second and fifth inputs, and wherever it appears, blue follows in the output.

""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" It shows up in the second and third inputs, and wherever it appears, yellow follows in the output.

""walm"" must then correspond to ""blue"" because it is the last word in the fifth input, followed by three occurrences of blue in the output.

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output. ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red, ""bluf"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""walm"" -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, it is hard to deduce a consistent rule that applies to all instances of ""wif"". Nevertheless, we can attempt to analyze the examples given to find a potential pattern.

Looking at the examples provided:

1. Input: wif / Output: red
2. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax / Output: green green red yellow green
3. Input: wif / Output: red
4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug / Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
5. Input: lug wif zup wif walm / Output: blue red yellow red red red

From the examples above, we see that every single occurrence of ""wif"" translates to ""red"". However, this is about the only consistent pattern we can observe with the information given.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently means the color red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we will analyze the patterns and associations in each input and corresponding output.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- Here, ""zup"" is followed by two words, and the output starts with yellow. The words following ""zup"" do not seem to be directly correlated with the repetition of ""red,"" since ""wif"" and ""walm"" do not share specific phonetic or orthographic features that would typically indicate they both translate to ""red.""

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue
- The only word after ""zup"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- When ""zup"" is on its own, the output is just ""yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
- Here, ""zup"" is not the first word, but the output still includes ""yellow,"" maintaining the correspondence of ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The additional word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow."" As ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" it appears that ""bluf"" does not influence the color representation of ""zup.""

Given the repeated association of ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input (first or not) and the additional words around it, the rule can be framed as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The presence of the word ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" being included in the output sequence.
Based on the given input and output pairs, the following pattern can be identified where the output colors correspond directly to the input words:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""wif"" and ""walm"" both correlate with ""red""

Each instance of the word ""bluf"" is followed by an output that is a direct repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here is how the correlation works for ""bluf"":

- After ""zup"" (which correlates with ""yellow""), ""bluf"" also results in ""yellow""
- After ""lug"" (which correlates with ""blue""), ""bluf"" results in ""blue""
- ""bluf"" has not followed ""wif"" or ""walm"" directly, but follows the pattern nonetheless

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the output color of the word that precedes it three times. Examining the outputs:

- ""lug wif walm"" outputs ""blue red red red"", where ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and is then followed by ""walm"", which repeats ""red"" three times.
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" outputs ""yellow green green green blue red"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and is followed by ""walm"", which repeats ""green"" three times.
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"", where ""wif"" translates to ""red"", followed by ""walm"", which repeats ""red"" three times.
- ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red"", where ""dax"" translates to ""green"", followed by ""walm"" repeating ""green"" three times, and then ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" outputs ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", followed by ""walm"" repeating ""red"" three times. Next, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and then another ""zup"" to ""yellow"" followed by ""walm"", which repeats ""yellow"" three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. This consistent pattern across all examples supports the conclusion that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in this artificial language.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" always translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, we can try to induce the rule governing the meaning of the word ""wif"" by looking at its context and the output it generates each time it appears.

In the first example, ""wif"" appears multiple times and each time it translates to ""red,"" regardless of the words that follow or precede it.

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

In all subsequent examples, ""wif"" also consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the words surrounding it.

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Therefore, we can induce that ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red"" without dependence on context. The rule is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the input and output examples provided, it appears ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"":

- ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red"", indicating ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"", which seems to indicate that in addition to ""zup"" being ""yellow"", ""bluf"" when preceded by ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""dax"" is ""green"".
- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"", supporting the idea ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" as well.
- ""zup bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green blue"", which again supports ""bluf"" as ""yellow"" when after ""zup"", ""dax"" as ""green"", and seems to introduce ""lug"" as ""blue"".
- ""zup"" alone corresponds to ""yellow"".

Based on these examples, it seems that ""zup"" is either directly translated to ""yellow"" or it transforms the following word to ""yellow"". However, since ""zup"" on its own still outputs ""yellow"", the most consistent rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. Here are the observations that lead to this rule:

1. ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"" – ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to ""dax"".
2. ""zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow"" – ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to ""zup"".
3. ""lug dax bluf"" becomes ""blue green green"" – ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to ""dax"", which is ""green"".
4. ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" – ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to ""wif"".
5. ""lug bluf zup lug"" becomes ""blue blue yellow blue"" – ""bluf"" after ""lug"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it multiple times in the output. In each example, the color tied to the word right before ""walm"" is repeated a certain number of times immediately after that color appears once. Let's examine each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" is used, ""blue"" is repeated three times.
   
2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm"" is used, ""green"" is repeated two more times (for a total of three consecutive ""green"").
   
3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" is used, ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm"" is used, ""red"" is repeated two more times (for a total of three consecutive ""red"").

5. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" is used, ""yellow"" is repeated two more times (for a total of three consecutive ""yellow"").

Based on the pattern, ""walm"" results in repeating the color of the previous word two additional times, making it a total of three consecutive occurrences of that color. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,101
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the input sequence.
dax -> meaning. The meaning is 'green'.

Rule: The word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green' across all given examples.
To decipher the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in each example provided. We note the color outputs that are associated with known and unknown inputs. The known inputs are 'dax', 'zup', 'lug', 'bluf', and 'walm', which correspond to the colors 'green', 'yellow', 'blue', 'blue', and 'red' respectively, based on the consistent mapping in the examples given.

Now, let's look at the sequences containing ""wif"":

1. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow blue red red red""
2. ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" -> ""blue blue red blue blue yellow""
3. ""wif"" -> ""red""
4. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
5. ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""

From these sequences, we can observe the following:

- Example 1 and Example 4 show that after ""wif,"" the color ""red"" always follows, even when 'wif' precedes 'walm' (which is also red).
- Example 3 shows that ""wif"" alone translates to ""red"".
- Example 5 shows that the presence of ""wif"" does not change the color of the words before it.
- In Example 2, ""wif"" appears after two blue words, ""lug bluf,"" and again results in ""red."" 

The consistent pattern is that irrespective of its position or the context within the sequence, ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red."" Hence, we can deduce the following:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow regardless of its position or context within the input sequence. 

Rule: zup means yellow.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green."" Every time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: bluf -> green.
Observed from the examples, every time the word ""walm"" is present, the following words all translate into the same color until a different color (not yellow) is introduced by a term other than ""walm"". For example:

- ""dax zup walm wif"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red,"" where all terms after ""walm"" are yellow until ""wif"" which is red.
- ""zup lug walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where all terms after ""walm"" are blue.
- ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green,"" where all terms after ""walm"" are green.
- ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" where the terms after ""walm"" continue as yellow until ""lug,"" which is blue and then ""wif"" is red.
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red,"" where all terms after ""walm"" are green until ""lug,"" which is blue and then ""wif"" is red.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color of the following word, effectively a ""repeat color"" command, until another color word that is not yellow is present.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the next word until a different (non-yellow) color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm dax wif lug
    ",Output: green yellow green green green red blue,green yellow yellow yellow green red blue,False,102
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. By examining the examples provided, it is clear that every instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug means ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, each instance of a word is consistently translated to a particular color. To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's look at each example where it appears and the corresponding color.

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

In this example, ""dax"" is translated to ""green.""

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this example, ""dax"" appears once and is translated to ""green.""

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

In this example, ""dax"" is also translated to ""green.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

In this example, ""dax"" is again translated to ""green.""

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue

In this example, ""dax"" is once more translated to ""green.""

Every time the word ""dax"" appears in an input, it is translated into ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sentence or the words that surround it. Thus, we can conclude that ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Analyzing the given examples, let's align the inputs with their corresponding outputs to determine what ""wif"" could mean:

1. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   Alignment: dax -> green
              lug -> blue
              wif -> ?
              bluf -> red

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue
   Alignment: zup -> yellow
              bluf -> yellow
              wif -> ?
              dax -> green
              lug -> blue

3. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   Alignment: zup -> yellow
              lug -> blue
              wif -> ?
              dax -> green
              bluf -> green
              wif -> ?

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Alignment: zup -> yellow
              wif -> ?
              walm -> red red

5. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   Alignment: wif -> ?
              dax -> green

Observing the patterns, we can see that:

- When ""wif"" stands alone, it outputs ""red"" (as seen in examples 4 and 5).
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", ""dax"" changes its color from what would be expected (normally, it should be green, but after ""wif"" it is red as seen in example 1).
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", the same thing happens: ""bluf"" normally outputs yellow, but after ""wif"", it outputs green (seen in example 3).

From this information, we can deduce that ""wif"" is changing the color output of the following word to red if the following word has a standalone color associated with it, and to a different color if it's followed by another ""wif"". The ambiguity remains on what happens when ""wif"" follows another color that is not its natural output without ""wif"" affecting it. However, we know that ""wif"" influences the color output of the following word. Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> changes the following word's normal color output to red, or to another predefined color if part of a specific sequence (e.g., ""walm"" always turns to ""red red""). When ""wif"" stands alone, it results in the color red.
Based on the given examples, we can try to determine the meaning of ""zup"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs. Here are the inputs and outputs lined up:

1. Input: zup              Output: yellow
2. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif       Output: green green red yellow red
3. Input: zup wif          Output: yellow red
4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup       Output: red blue blue red yellow
5. Input: zup bluf wif     Output: yellow yellow red

Looking at example 1, we see that when the input is just ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow."" This suggests that ""zup"" itself translates to ""yellow.""

In examples 2 through 5, we can observe that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, bluf seems to correspond to the color red when preceding or following the word 'wif.' The rule can be discerned as follows:

- Every time the nonce word ""bluf"" is used, the word that follows or comes before it is transformed into ""red"" in the output sequence.

Let's check this against each example:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   - Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which translates to ""red.""

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""Bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" again making the following word ""red.""

3. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   - Again, ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" results in ""red.""

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" not ""wif,"" so it doesn't become red; ""bluf"" by itself results in yellow.

5. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - Once more, ""bluf"" is not followed by ""wif,"" and it becomes yellow.

Given this pattern, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" specifically when it is adjacent to ""wif"". If ""bluf"" is not adjacent to ""wif,"" it translates to ""yellow.""

Rule:
bluf -> red when adjacent to ""wif"", otherwise bluf -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeated color output that comes after it. The color that is repeated is based on the color associated with the word just before ""walm"". The association appears to be as follows:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

The word ""walm"" causes the next few outputs to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Analysing each input:

1. ""wif dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""red green blue blue blue"".
   'walm' follows 'lug', which corresponds to the color blue, resulting in multiple blues.

2. ""wif lug dax walm"" corresponds to ""red blue green green green"".
   'walm' follows 'dax', which corresponds to the color green, resulting in multiple greens.

3. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"".
   'walm' follows 'dax', creating repeated greens.

4. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow"".
   'walm' follows 'wif', leading to repeated reds until the next color 'lug' (blue) interrupts.

5. ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"".
   'walm' follows 'zup', resulting in repeated yellows until 'lug' (blue) appears.

Rule: walm -> repeated color. The repeated color is the one associated with the previous word before ""walm"". If the preceding word is ""dax"", the repeated color is green; if ""wif"", it's red; if ""lug"", it's blue; if ""zup"", it's yellow. The repetition continues until a new color is introduced or the list ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True,103
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue. In each example, whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the color blue corresponds to it in the output. 

Here are the connections presented in the examples:

- ""lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue green green,"" which not only shows ""lug"" as blue but also confirms ""dax"" as green and ""bluf"" as green.
- ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue,"" which reinforces the meaning of ""lug"" as blue, along with establishing ""zup"" as yellow.
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" further confirms ""dax"" as green, ""zup"" as yellow, and ""lug"" as blue.
- Finally, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" which affirms ""zup"" as yellow and ""lug"" as blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. Moreover, the other words in the inputs (""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf"") yield other consistent color outputs (e.g., ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue, etc.).

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word dax appears to be:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the meaning of ""wif"" by looking at the words that precede and follow it, as well as the corresponding output. The examples suggest the following mappings:

- ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red""
- ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red""
- ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow red green""
- ""zup wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red blue green""

From these mappings, we can deduce the following:
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow"" (it seems to have the same output as ""zup"")

Consistently, ""wif"" maps to ""red"". Every time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the output. The position of ""wif"" within the input sequence corresponds to the position of ""red"" within the output sequence. Even when ""wif"" appears twice in the input (""wif zup bluf wif dax""), ""red"" also appears twice in the output at the corresponding positions.

Based on these observations, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following correlations between the input and output:

- ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" correlates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"".
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" correlates to ""yellow yellow red red red"".
- ""zup"" on two separate occurrences consistently correlates to ""yellow"".
- ""zup dax"" correlates to ""yellow green"".

Using these examples, it seems that ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow"". There is not enough variability in the other words to determine a consistent pattern for them, but at least for ""zup,"" the consistent output allows us to induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples given and the associated outputs:

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf wif
Output: yellow yellow red

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

It appears that the word ""bluf"" is consistently paired with the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position within the input string. Additionally, the word ""dax"" when it appears, corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif,"" when it appears, corresponds to ""red."" The word ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to the color “yellow"".

Based on these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" could be:

bluf -> yellow

Rule: The output color associated with the nonce word ""bluf"" is consistently yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we can compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's focus on the instances where ""walm"" appears and see how it affects the translation to colors.

1. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

Analyzing the sequences particularly where ""walm"" precedes or follows another word, we notice the following patterns:

- After ""lug walm,"" the color blue is repeated. This suggests that ""walm"" could have a ""repeat the color of the previous word"" function.
- In ""wif walm,"" the output is red red red, where ""wif"" coincides with red, and since ""walm"" is the only other word, it suggests the color red is repeated due to the presence of ""walm.""
- In ""dax walm lug,"" following the ""dax,"" we get two greens instead of a single color change, indicating ""walm"" may have caused the repetition.
- The appearance of ""walm"" between ""lug"" and ""dax"" resulting in ""blue blue blue green"" seems to support the repetition rule, since ""lug"" corresponds to blue and we see blue repeated twice after the appearance of ""walm"" indicating the color of the word before ""walm"" is repeated two times before moving to the next color.

Considering these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that precedes it to be repeated three times in total before continuing to the next color or word. This rule holds true across the given examples.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word two additional times (resulting in three instances of the color in total).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif bluf
    ",Output: green red yellow,green red red,False,104
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". No matter what other words are present or their order, ""lug"" always results in ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that:

- The word ""dax"" translates to the word ""green.""
- Other words in the examples also correspond to specific colors:
  - ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
  - ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""
  - ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
  - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Given this information:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each word (lug, dax, zup, walm) corresponds to a unique color (blue, green, yellow, red). The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every example it is given. 

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in all of the given examples.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that the preceding word represents. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" ""bluf"" means blue. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means red. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" ""bluf"" means yellow. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" ""bluf"" means green. Hence, ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the preceding word.""

bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the given input-output pairs and try to deduce any patterns that could inform the rule.

Here are the input-output pairs broken down with their respective colors:

1. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   (walm is followed by two blue, which corresponds to ""lug"")

2. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow
   (Each walm adds two reds before the pattern changes to yellow)

3. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
   (After ""dax,"" walm leads to two additional green, before switching to yellow)

4. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
   (walm leads to two red, followed by the pattern changing to green)

5. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   (walm follows ""lug"" with two additional blue, and later follows ""zup"" with two additional yellow)

Observations:
- It appears that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color of the word that precedes it, exactly two times, before the color sequence resumes normally.

Rule:
- walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word two more times.

Let's check this rule against the examples:

1. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   The color before walm is blue, associated with ""lug."" After ""walm,"" we have two more blues.

2. wif walm zup walm
   The color before the first walm is red, hence two more reds are added. Then, before the second walm, the color is yellow, hence two more yellows are added.

3. dax walm zup lug
   The color before walm is green, so two more greens are added before switching to yellow.

4. wif walm dax zup
   The color before walm is red, so two more reds are added before the sequence changes due to ""dax.""

5. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   The first walm is preceded by blue, so two more blues are added. The second walm is preceded by yellow, so two more yellows are added before the color changes to red due to ""wif.""

Given these observations, the rule appears to be consistent across all examples. Thus, we can say:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,105
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all examples provided.
dax -> green

Rule: Each word corresponds to a color, with ""dax"" consistently translating to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each non-wif word is associated with a specific color:

- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""

Whenever the word ""wif"" is introduced into the sequence, it consistently translates into ""red,"" regardless of its position. It does not seem to matter what other words precede or follow it. Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, zup seems to map to a specific color each time it appears. Let's look at the examples to see the color that corresponds to zup:

- In the first example, zup is followed by ""bluf,"" which maps to ""blue,"" and the output for zup in this context is ""yellow.""
- In the second example, zup comes after ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue,"" and before ""wif,"" which maps to ""red,"" and the output for zup here is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, zup appears in between two occurrences of ""bluf,"" which both map to ""yellow,"" and the output for zup itself is ""yellow.""
- The fourth example has the same sequence as the second example (lug zup wif) with the output being ""blue yellow red"" respectively, confirming the meaning of zup as ""yellow"" again.
- The fifth example shows zup paired only with ""wif,"" and the output for zup is still ""yellow.""

According to all the examples, zup consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context within the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, bluf appears to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

In the first example:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf wif -> green red (where bluf takes the color from the preceding word ""wif"", which is red)

In the second example:
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green (taking the color from the preceding word ""dax"")

In the third example:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue (repeating the color from the preceding word ""lug"")

In the fourth example:
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue (repeating the color from the preceding word ""lug"")

In the fifth example:
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red (repeating the color from the preceding word ""wif"")

Therefore, the rule for the word bluf seems to be:
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it.
From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Here's the breakdown:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> red repeated thrice

Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: dax walm
- dax -> green
- walm -> green repeated thrice

Output: green green green

Input: wif walm dax
- wif -> red
- walm -> red repeated thrice (walm comes after wif)
- dax -> green

Output: red red red green

Input: wif dax lug walm
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue repeated thrice (walm comes after lug)

Output: red green blue blue blue

Input: lug zup dax walm
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> green repeated thrice (walm comes after dax)

Output: blue yellow green green green

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it translates to the color that corresponds to the preceding word being repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,106
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the examples consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To decipher the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the given examples and the resulting color patterns. We notice that each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color in the output:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
3. wif dax wif -> red green red
4. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
5. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue

Considering the provided data:

- In examples 1, 4, and 5, the word ""dax"" precedes a color that does not repeat from any previous words.
- In example 3, ""dax"" is between two instances of ""wif,"" which translate to ""red.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" appears at the end of the sequence; yet, the output color ""green"" is different from the colors assigned to the words preceding it.

The outputs reveal a pattern: whenever ""dax"" appears, it's followed by ""green"" in the output. This color does not follow any preceding words in any of the examples. There's also no evidence to suggest that ""dax"" itself has a different color assigned, as it directly translates to ""green"" in each instance.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be that it translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a rule that correlates the nonce word ""wif"" to a certain color in the output. By comparing each input with its corresponding output, we can identify the color that ""wif"" represents.

Here’s the analysis of the given examples:

- Input: wif lug → Output: red blue (wif corresponds to red)
- Input: zup wif zup → Output: yellow red yellow (wif corresponds to red)
- Input: wif zup dax → Output: red yellow green (wif corresponds to red)
- Input: wif dax → Output: red green (wif corresponds to red)
- Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax → Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green (wif corresponds to red)

Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'zup,' let's look at each example and the output associated with it:

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Input: zup lug dax
Output: yellow blue green

Input: wif zup dax
Output: red yellow green

Input: lug zup lug
Output: blue yellow blue

Input: lug zup wif
Output: blue yellow red

Analyzing the patterns, 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow' in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can conclude that 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow.'

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the previously mentioned color. In each instance, the color that follows ""bluf"" is a repeat of the color that was translated from the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Here is the analysis for each input:

1. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   ""wif"" translates to red, and after ""bluf"" it is red again.

2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   ""wif"" translates to red, and after ""bluf"" it is red again.

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   ""dax"" translates to green, and after ""bluf"" it is green again.

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   ""zup"" translates to yellow, and after ""bluf"" it is yellow again.

5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   ""dax"" translates to green, and after ""bluf"" it is green again.

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color output translated from the word just before it.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, three times. Below are the observations supporting this rule:

- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" maps to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue,"" where ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and the repetition of ""yellow"" occurs three times after ""walm"".
- ""dax walm"" maps to ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" is associated with ""green"" which is then repeated three times.
- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" is ""yellow green green green blue red,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- ""dax walm zup"" is ""green green green yellow,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is repeated three times after ""walm"".
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is again repeated three times after ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,107
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence. No variation in the output is observed when ""dax"" is presented in the input.

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Here's the reasoning:

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" This suggests that ""wif"" is ""red"" because ""bluf"" is consistently ""red.""
2. With ""wif lug,"" the output is ""red blue,"" which further supports the idea that ""wif"" is ""red"" since ""lug"" changes to ""blue"" in different contexts.
3. For ""zup wif bluf zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" may translate to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" again.
4. The sequence ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" giving ""blue red red blue red"" supports the pattern that ""wif"" is consistently ""red.""
5. Finally, ""wif dax wif"" producing ""red green red"" implies that ""dax"" is ""green,"" while ""wif"" remains ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule for what ""zup"" means seems to be consistent:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in a sequence of colors where ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- The second example also shows ""zup"" aligning with the color ""yellow,"" independent of its position in the sequence.
- The third example indicates ""zup"" alone corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The fourth example has ""zup"" at the end of the sequence following two words, ""walm"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, and again ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""
- The fifth example solidifies the pattern as ""zup"" consistently corresponds with ""yellow,"" regardless of the surrounding words (""lug"" is aligned with the color ""blue,"" and ""wif"" aligns with the color ""red"").

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, bluf appears to correspond to the color that the previous word represents (repeating the color output of the word before it). In the first example, ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""bluf"" and the output repeats blue. In the second and third examples, ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""bluf"", resulting in green being repeated. Lastly, in the fourth example, ""zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""bluf,"" producing a repeated yellow. In the fifth example, ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""wif"" (red) and then ""bluf"", which should repeat the color of ""wif"", resulting in red being repeated. However, the pattern does not seem to hold entirely consistent in the latest example since ""lug"" would lead us to expect blue to be followed by red (wif), and then another red (bluf). Given that it repeats the color of the word ""wif"" instead of ""lug"", the rule may be more accurately described as bluf repeating the color of the immediate word preceding it, regardless of its color sequence.

Rule: bluf repeats the color of the immediate word preceding it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's break down the examples by focusing on the output colors when ""walm"" is present:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, while ""wif"" corresponds to red. After ""walm"", there's a repetition of red.

2. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue. Before ""zup"" and ""lug"", we have multiple greens after ""walm"".

3. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green. After ""walm"" there is a repetition of green.

4. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue. After ""walm"" there is a repetition of blue.

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red. After ""walm,"" there's a repetition of green before the next ""zup"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,108
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, it seems that every time the word ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""green."" The surrounding words correspond to other colors: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The rule seems consistent across all examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze its outputs in relation to its inputs:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   (Only ""wif"" is present, and it corresponds to ""red"")

2. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again, and it seems that each unique word has a unique color associated with it: ""lug"" -> ""blue,"" ""dax"" -> ""green,"" ""walm"" -> ""green,"" ""zup"" -> ""yellow"")

3. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   (Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again, and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" consistently with example 2)

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   (Both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" map to ""red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" might mean ""red"" as well)

5. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   (In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" It seems that the word ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red,"" but there is a pattern of repetition where the next instance of the same word has shifted to ""yellow,"" which might indicate a sequence or context-dependent rule. However, since the task is strictly to deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we will focus on the consistency that ""wif"" always maps to ""red."")

Based on the consistent mapping of ""wif"" to ""red"" across all examples, the meaning can be deduced as:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word 'zup' in the input corresponds directly to the word 'yellow' in the output.
bluf -> repeat the color word that corresponds to the word before it. Rule: If a color word (like ""green"" for ""dax,"" ""blue"" for ""lug,"" or ""red"" for ""wif"") precedes ""bluf,"" then the output is that color word repeated.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" causes the preceding word to be repeated as output three times. Let's look at the patterns:

- ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is translated to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" outputs ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""red."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times. Then the pattern continues normally.
- ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is then repeated three times after ""walm,"" followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax walm wif dax"" outputs ""green green green red green."" The same pattern as above, with an additional ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" at the end.
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is then repeated three times after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,109
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time the word ""lug"" is used in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, it seems that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is generated in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the sequence. Other words correspond to their own colors, but consistently, ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it is replaced with the word ""red"" in the output.
Analyzing the input and corresponding output sequences, we can see that ""zup"" translates to a specific color in the output. Furthermore, each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif  
Output: yellow blue red green green red  
Observation: The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the first position.

Input: dax zup dax  
Output: green yellow green  
Observation: The word ""zup"" is in the second position and translates to ""yellow.""

Input: lug dax zup  
Output: blue green yellow  
Observation: The word ""zup"" is in the third position and translates to ""yellow.""

Input: lug zup  
Output: blue yellow  
Observation: The word ""zup"" is in the second position and again translates to ""yellow.""

Input: dax zup bluf  
Output: green yellow yellow  
Observation: The word ""zup"" is in the second position and translates to ""yellow,"" and does not change based on the position or the words around it.

From the examples provided, we can conclude that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence or surrounding context.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red."" To be sure of the induction, let's check for each instance:

- Input: wif bluf dax lug / Output: red red green blue
- Input: zup bluf / Output: yellow yellow
- Input: zup bluf / Output: yellow yellow
- Input: lug wif bluf / Output: blue red red
- Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug / Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

In these examples, ""bluf"" is always directly linked with the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the given examples. By comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can identify patterns that may indicate the application of certain rules regarding the word ""walm.""

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and results in repeated ""green.""

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The ""walm"" in between repeats the color for ""lug,"" which is blue, hence ""walm"" --> ""blue blue.""

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Consistent with the previous patterns, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" The ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

Again, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" ""wif"" produces ""red,"" which is a new color not associated with ""walm."" The ""walm"" after ""zup"" gives us repeated ""yellow.""

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

In the final example, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" According to the pattern, ""walm"" should repeat the color of the preceding word, so after ""wif,"" ""walm"" yields repeated ""red.""

From these observations, the pattern is that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,110
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Observing the given examples where the word ""lug"" appears, we can see a consistent pattern: wherever ""lug"" is present in the input, the color ""blue"" is present in the corresponding output.

For instance, in:
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
- ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
- ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""

In each of these examples, regardless of the position of ""lug"" or the other words around it, ""blue"" is always in the corresponding position in the output.

Based on this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
From the provided examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" as shown consistently in the outputs when ""dax"" is used:

Input: zup dax lug -> Output: yellow green blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
- The placement of ""dax"" once again results in ""green"" in the output.

Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
- Here ""dax"" is at the beginning of the input and ""green"" is at the beginning of the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is repeated three times following ""dax,"" which is repeated as ""green"" once.

Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
- ""dax"" leads to ""green""
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" leads to a repetition of ""green""
- ""wif"" after ""walm"" switches to ""red""
- ""bluf"" seems to sustain the color initiated by the previous non-""dax"" word, which is ""red"" in this case.

Input: zup bluf lug dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is placed between two instances of ""lug,"" resulting in ""green"" in between two ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be consistent across all examples:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it, when ""wif"" is present, the output always includes ""red"" in the corresponding position. Therefore, we can induce that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, I will infer the rule for what ""zup"" means.

First, let's list the inputs and outputs in a table for better comparison:

| Input                          | Output                       |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| wif lug bluf zup bluf dax      | red blue blue yellow yellow green |
| zup wif bluf zup lug           | yellow red red yellow blue   |
| wif zup dax                    | red yellow green             |
| zup                            | yellow                       |
| wif walm dax zup wif lug walm  | red red red green yellow red blue blue blue |

By observing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can deduce the following possible matches:

| Nonce Word | Color  |
|------------|--------|
| wif        | red    |
| lug        | blue   |
| bluf       | red    |
| dax        | green  |
| zup        | yellow |
| walm       | red    |

The word ""zup"" seems consistently associated with the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the words that appear around it. There does not seem to be any context-dependent rules impacting this association.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns related to the presence of ""bluf"" in the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red

2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red

3. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

5. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow

Notice how each input and output pair includes ""bluf"" and a matching ""red"" in the output. Another observation is that the color before ""red"" is always the color corresponding to the word before ""bluf."" Here are associations of some other words to colors based on the given examples, not including ""bluf"":

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, if we evaluate instances containing ""bluf"" based on this information:

1. ""dax bluf"" correlates to ""green green""
2. ""wif dax wif bluf"" correlates to ""red green red red""
3. ""zup bluf"" correlates to ""yellow yellow""
4. ""lug wif bluf"" correlates to ""blue red red""
5. ""dax bluf wif lug"" correlates to ""green green red blue""

In every instance, ""bluf"" produces a color in the output that is a repeat of the color corresponding to the word before it. Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeats the color corresponding to the previous word.
Rule: The word ""walm"" when it follows another word, it results in the repetition of the output corresponding to the previous word twice.

Breaking down the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""lug wif"" results in ""blue red""
   - ""lug walm"" results in a repeat of the color for ""lug,"" which is blue, hence ""blue blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""zup walm"" repeats the yellow, hence ""yellow yellow""
   - The final ""wif"" is simply ""red""

2. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""zup walm"" repeats the yellow, giving us ""yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""wif walm"" repeats the red, giving ""red red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""wif walm"" repeats the red, resulting in ""red red""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - This is the same as input 3, and the output matches accordingly.

Walm -> Tripling the output color of the word that comes before walm.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following patterns for the nonce word ""lug"":

1. In ""zup walm lug wif"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"". We can't deduce the meaning of ""lug"" from this example alone because we don't have a one-to-one mapping of the words to colors.

2. In ""lug zup"", the output is ""blue yellow"". Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", as ""zup"" is consistent in being ""yellow"" from the previous example.

3. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", the output is ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" is consistent with ""red"", and ""zup"" is still ""yellow"". ""Bluf"" seems to correspond with a repetition of ""yellow"", and ""walm"" is in a sequence that results in ""blue blue"". Since after ""bluf"", the colors are repeated twice, it could be inferred that ""bluf"" causes the next color to be repeated. Given that ""lug"" is before ""walm"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue"", it's possible that ""lug"" simply means ""blue"", as it's not affected by the ""bluf"" repetition rule.

4. In ""lug zup lug"", the output is ""blue yellow blue"". This supports the notion that ""lug"" means ""blue"" as it directly converts to ""blue"" without interference from any repetition rules.

5. In ""lug wif dax wif"", the output is ""blue red green red"". ""Lug"" in this context again corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" stays consistent as ""red"". The new word “dax” corresponds to ""green"".

Given these examples, the rule seems to be consistent:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following color associations for each unique word:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> yellow
- lug -> blue

The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position within the input string. Hence, we can conclude that ""dax"" specifically means ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of the context within which it is used. The presence of other words like ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" translates to other colors, suggesting that these words have their own distinct color associations.

The rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow' in each given example.
bluf -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs after each occurrence of the word in the examples given:

1. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
2. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
3. dax walm wif -> green green green red
4. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
5. dax walm -> green green green

Now, let's analyze:

- In the first example, after ""walm,"" the word ""lug"" correlates to the first ""blue"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is at the end, and the output ends with three ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" which correlates to the final ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is again at the end, followed by three ""red"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, there's nothing after ""walm,"" and the output is three ""green.""

From these examples, we could suggest that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the next word three times. If ""walm"" is the last word, it means to repeat the color of the word just before ""walm"" three times. 

However, when we look at Example 1 again, after ""walm,"" there's ""lug,"" which translates to one ""blue"" (not three). It is important to note that ""lug"" is followed by ""wif,"" which correlates to ""red."" This could imply that even when there is a word after ""walm,"" it is the color of the final word in the sequence that is repeated, not the immediate next word.

To check this, let's examine Example 2 again: after ""walm"" (which is at the end), the output ends with three ""blue,"" which is the color of ""lug,"" the word before ""walm,"" rather than ""dax,"" which would be ""green."" This supports our revised observation.

So, our revised rule for ""walm"" could be: repeat the color of the last word in the sequence three times. When ""walm"" is the last word, repeat the color of the word just before ""walm"" three times.

walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color of the final mentioned color three times. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" should be included in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> meaning. Meaning: green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is produced in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is present in an input, the corresponding output includes the color ""red."" Here is the observed pattern:

Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif dax wif -> Output: red green red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: zup wif dax -> Output: yellow red green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: zup wif lug dax -> Output: yellow red blue green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Thus, we can conclude:
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule I have induced from these examples is:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The addition of another word, such as ""dax,"" introduces a second color, ""green,"" in the example provided, but there is not enough data to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" or how it interacts with ""zup"" beyond this single instance.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. This is evident because, in every instance where ""bluf"" is present in the input, ""blue"" is present in the output at the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> blue.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.

Explanation: 
1. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
   lug is blue, walm repeats this by also being blue, dax is green
   So here, walm means ""repeat the color of lug (previous word)""

2. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   lug is blue, zup is yellow, walm repeats the color of zup (yellow)
   So again, walm means ""repeat the color of zup (previous word)""

3. dax walm -> green green green 
   dax is green, walm repeats the color of dax (green)
   So walm means ""repeat the color of dax (previous word)""

4. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
   zup is yellow, walm repeats the color of zup (yellow)
   So walm means ""repeat the color of zup (previous word)""

5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
   dax is green, walm repeats the color of dax (green)
   So walm means ""repeat the color of dax (previous word)""

Taking all examples into account, the rule for walm is that it repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples:

- When ""lug zup"" is translated to ""blue yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Following that rule in the second example, ""lug wif zup wif"" becomes ""blue red yellow red,"" confirming that ""lug"" is indeed ""blue"" and revealing that ""wif"" is ""red.""
- The third example, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" gets translated to ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" continues to correspond to ""blue,"" ""walm"" matches with ""blue"" as well (making ""walm"" another term for ""blue""), ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red"" as established before.
- The fourth example, ""lug walm wif,"" translates to ""blue blue blue red,"" where ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""
- Finally, the fifth example is ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" which becomes ""green green green yellow blue green."" In this sequence, ""lug"" is consistent with its representation of the color ""blue.""

Considering the above examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
From the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule of the nonce word ""dax"" in the context of its use.

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

Input: dax
Output: green

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

From these examples, it seems that ""dax"" always results in the output of ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
Rule: dax -> green
Observing the examples provided:

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: wif zup dax
Output: red yellow green

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue

It seems that ""wif"" corresponds consistently to the color ""red."" Every time the word ""wif"" is present in an input, the color ""red"" appears in the exact same position in the output:

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears second in the input and ""red"" also appears second in the output.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is the first word and “red” is the first color.
- The same pattern follows in all other examples.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output.
Reviewing the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" based on its position relative to other known elements and their consistent translations:

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Examining the position of ""bluf"" and its consistent translation, ""bluf"" always seems to translate to the color that was previously mentioned in the input sequence. For instance, whenever ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"". If ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".

Rule:
bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze its consistent pattern across all provided examples.

1. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
   ""wif"" leads to one instance of ""red,"" and adding ""walm"" leads to two more instances of ""red.""

2. Input: dax zup walm wif | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Isolating ""walm"" from other known elements, we see that ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""walm"" added to this combination changes nothing, thus two instances of ""yellow"" before ""red.""

3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup | Output: green green green red red red yellow
   ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow."" In this input, adding ""walm"" after ""dax"" adds two more ""green,"" and adding ""walm"" after ""wif"" adds two more ""red."" This suggests ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it two more times.

4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm | Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue."" After ""zup,"" ""walm"" leads to two more instances of ""yellow,"" which corroborates the earlier observation that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

5. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
   Finally, ""dax"" is ""green,"" and following it with ""walm"" adds two more ""green.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup lug
    ",Output: green yellow blue,green yellow blue,True,114
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"". Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input is translated into ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of the word in the sequence or the other words present. Thus, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" is directly equivalent to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it looks like each word (other than ""wif"") corresponds to a specific color:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue

The word ""wif"" always results in the color red, regardless of its position or the presence of other words. Given this consistent association, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: wif -> red

Therefore, the meaning assigned to ""wif"" in this context is the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" independent of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word that immediately follows it in the input. Looking at each input/output pair, ""bluf"" is followed by a word, which then determines its color in the output. Here is the breakdown:

1. In ""dax bluf wif zup lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which corresponds to the color of ""wif.""
2. In ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" is at the end and does not follow any word, thus it defaults to the color ""yellow,"" much like ""zup.""
3. In ""dax lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" is followed by no word, but based on the prior example, it adopts the color of the previous word ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
4. In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" is again followed by no word. Following the established rule, it takes the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
5. In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and therefore, it takes the color ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the following word if there is one, otherwise from the preceding word. If it is at the end of a phrase and there's no precedent, it defaults to ""yellow,"" potentially as ""zup"" is the word associated with yellow and it repeats more than any other in the given context.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the following word, or the preceding one if it is the last word, if there is no preceding word, it defaults to yellow.
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm.""

In the first example, the repetition of ""walm"" correlates with the color red being repeated:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three repetitions of the color blue:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and there are three yellows:
Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

In the fourth example, ""walm"" at the end results in a repetition of the color red:
Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red

In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" results in a repetition of the color green:
Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" induces repetition of the color that immediately precedes it:

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the color word that precedes it in the output. The number of repetitions matches the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively. If there is no color word before ""walm,"" it repeats the most recently mentioned color word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    ",Output: red,red,True,115
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
From the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" is consistently associated with the output ""green."" The word ""dax"" itself does not appear to change meaning based on its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. The other words in the sequences (""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""walm"") correspond to different colors in the output, but ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Meaning: The word ""dax"" consistently means ""green"" regardless of context in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word translates directly to a color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red blue (possibly ""bluf"" is two words, ""blu"" and ""f"" where ""blu"" means red and ""f"" means blue or ""bluf"" could be a single word meaning red blue)
- lug -> blue

All instances of ""wif"" correlate with the output ""red."" The translation is consistent regardless of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
By examining the correspondence between the input and output sequences, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""zup."" Here is a breakdown of each instance in which ""zup"" appears:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow 
   - Right after ""zup,"" the output color is yellow.

2. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green
   - Here again, directly following ""zup,"" the output color is yellow.

3. zup dax bluf zup dax -> yellow green green yellow green
   - When ""zup"" first appears, the output color is yellow, and also the next instance of ""zup"" is followed by yellow.

4. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
   - Again, ""zup"" is followed by the output color yellow.

5. lug zup wif -> blue yellow red
   - Once more, where ""zup"" appears, the next color in the output sequence is yellow.

From these examples, we can infer the rule regarding ""zup"":

Rule: When ""zup"" appears in the input sequence, the following color in the output sequence will be yellow.

Hence, we can conclude:

zup -> The following color in the output sequence is yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time bluf appears in the input, red appears in the output at the corresponding position. However, there's an interesting pattern that should be noted: when ""bluf"" is present, the color immediately following ""bluf"" in the output is also red, regardless of what comes after ""bluf"" in the input.

To sum up:

bluf -> red. Rule: When ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""red,"" and the word following ""bluf"" in the input also translates to ""red"" in the output, regardless of the next word's usual color association.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs, focusing on presence and repetition:

1. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

3. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

From these examples, we can notice the following patterns:

- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the examples 1 and 5. 
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in examples 2, 3, and 5.
- ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in examples 2 and 3.
- ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in all examples.

The word ""walm"" seems to act as a repeater for the color represented by the previously mentioned nonce word. After each instance of ""walm,"" the color corresponding to the previous nonce word is repeated two more times, for a total of three appearances. For example, in the first input, after the word ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous nonce word. Here is the observed correspondence:

Walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding nonce word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"". Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is present in the corresponding output.

However, there may also be rules for the words ""wif"" and ""zup"" since they correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively in the outputs given. The word ""walm"" only appears once in the series of inputs, and the corresponding output consists of three instances of ""green"", which suggests that the word ""walm"" might either be associated with green or follows a different rule that is not immediately clear from the given examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Every example where the word ""wif"" appears, the output includes ""red."" Regardless of wif's position in the list of input words, it consistently corresponds to the color red in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word 'zup' corresponds to a particular output regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow
Input: zup dax bluf zup dax -> Output: yellow green green yellow green
Input: lug zup lug -> Output: blue yellow blue
Input: zup -> Output: yellow
Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue

In every instance, the presence of 'zup' in the input results in 'yellow' in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, it can be deduced that 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> color of the preceding word.

Rule: The word bluf takes on the meaning of the color associated with the preceding word, therefore, it repeats the color output in the Output sequence. For ""zup bluf,"" the color is ""yellow yellow,"" and for ""lug bluf,"" the color is ""blue blue."" Even when combined with other words like ""dax"" (which translates to green), ""bluf"" retains its rule of repeating the color mentioned just before it.
From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Each instance of ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be repeated twice more than it would have been without ""walm"". 

Let's break down the examples:

1. **Input:** zup walm
   **Output:** yellow yellow yellow
   *Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow once, ""walm"" makes it repeat two more times for a total of three yellows.

2. **Input:** wif bluf dax walm
   **Output:** red red green green green
   *Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to red once, ""bluf"" has no associated color, ""dax"" is green once, and ""walm"" makes it repeat two more times for a total of three greens.

3. **Input:** zup wif walm lug
   **Output:** yellow red red red blue
   *Rule: ""zup"" is yellow once, ""wif"" is red once, ""walm"" makes it repeat two more times for a total of three reds, ""lug"" is blue once.

4. **Input:** dax lug walm zup wif
   **Output:** green blue blue blue yellow red
   *Rule: ""dax"" is green once, ""lug"" is blue once, ""walm"" makes it repeat two more times for a total of three blues, ""zup"" is yellow once, ""wif"" is red once.

5. **Input:** dax zup walm wif walm
   **Output:** green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   *Rule: ""dax"" is green once, ""zup"" is yellow once, the first ""walm"" makes it repeat two more times for a total of three yellows, ""wif"" is red once, and the second ""walm"" makes it repeat two more times for a total of three reds.

**Rule:**
Walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word two additional times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example given, independent of its position or the context.
From the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the word ""dax."" Each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to a color in the output. When ""dax"" is given as an input—whether it is on its own or with other words—it always results in ""green"" in the output.

Looking at the other words, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" In the sequence that includes ""zup"" (which we see only once), ""zup"" precedes the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Since ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, we can conclude that the rule for ""dax"" is not dependent on the context. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> ""green""
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'zup' is consistently translated to the color 'yellow'. 

If we analyze the outputs associated with each input containing 'zup':

Input: lug zup dax -> Output: blue yellow green
Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: wif zup dax -> Output: red yellow green
Input: lug walm zup wif -> Output: blue blue yellow red

Every time 'zup' appears in the input, the word 'yellow' appears in the exact position of 'zup' in the output. This is a strong indication that 'zup' translates to 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, 'bluf' consistently corresponds with the color immediately prior to its mention. Here's the breakdown of the rule in each example:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   'zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' and 'bluf' repeats the previous color, thus 'yellow.'

2. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   The first 'bluf' follows 'zup' (yellow) and repeats it (yellow). The second 'bluf' follows 'lug' (blue) and repeats it (blue).

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green
   'bluf' follows 'dax' (green) and repeats it (green).

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   'bluf' follows 'zup' (yellow) and repeats it (yellow).

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   'bluf' follows 'wif' (red) and repeats it (red).

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color word that immediately precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the provided examples and identify patterns regarding the usage of ""walm"" and its corresponding output. Here's an analysis of each example:

1. dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup.""

2. zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""walm"" is at the end, following ""wif.""

3. zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""zup.""

4. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- ""walm"" appears twice: after ""wif"" and at the end.

5. wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""wif.""

Observations:
- Whenever ""walm"" appears, it triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
- If ""walm"" is at the end, it repeats the color of the preceding word multiple times.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to act as an instruction to repeat the corresponding color of the word that comes before it. If ""walm"" is the last word, the color repeats multiple times (the exact number of repetitions is not consistent across examples).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word. If ""walm"" is at the end, repeat multiple times (the exact number of repetitions may depend on context not provided in examples).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True,118
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the word 'lug' corresponds to the output 'blue.' There is no variation in output regardless of placement within the input sequence, suggesting that 'lug' has a consistent meaning irrespective of context.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Analyzing the provided examples and the corresponding outputs:

Input: `dax zup lug bluf` Output: `green yellow blue blue`
Input: `dax zup walm wif` Output: `green yellow yellow yellow red`
Input: `wif bluf dax` Output: `red red green`
Input: `lug dax wif lug` Output: `blue green red blue`
Input: `lug wif dax bluf wif lug` Output: `blue red green green red blue`

Given that each time the word `dax` is present in the input, the word `green` appears in the same position in the output, we can deduce:

Rule: `dax` -> `green`
wif -> red. 

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color red regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow. Rule: When the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> repeats the color of the word just before it.

Rule: When the word bluf appears after another word, the color corresponding to that word is repeated.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns present in the given examples. Let's analyze each example and observe the outputs:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   
2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   
5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

From these examples, we notice that ""walm"" is always followed by a repetition of a color three times.

- After ""dax,"" ""walm"" repeats the color green three times.
- After ""zup,"" ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times.
- After ""wif,"" ""walm"" repeats the color red three times.

The color that ""walm"" repeats depends on the word that comes immediately before it. Here is a rule that can be deduced from the examples:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

- If the previous word is ""dax,"" the color is green.
- If the previous word is ""zup,"" the color is yellow.
- If the previous word is ""wif,"" the color is red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue yellow blue,yellow blue yellow blue,True,119
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- When ""lug"" is present in the input, the output always contains ""blue."" This is the case whether ""lug"" is alone or with other words.
- When ""lug"" is repeated in the input (""lug zup lug""), the output repeats ""blue"" at the corresponding positions.
- No other word in the provided examples results in ""blue"" in the output, suggesting that ""lug"" uniquely corresponds to ""blue.""

Given these observations, we can conclude the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"". Every time the word ""dax"" is presented in the input, regardless of whether it is alone or accompanied by other words, the output includes the word ""green"". Meanwhile, other words in the input do not produce a consistent color in the output.

Here is the deduced rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output, irrespective of its position or the presence of other words in the input.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" in each of the outputs. Here is the analysis based on each line:

1. Input: zup lug zup lug wif -> Output: yellow blue yellow blue red
2. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup -> Output: red blue blue red yellow
3. Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
4. Input: lug dax zup lug wif -> Output: blue green yellow blue red
5. Input: dax zup lug wif lug -> Output: green yellow blue red blue

In each case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. Moreover, when ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", which repeats ""yellow"" multiple times according to the third example (""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""), it indicates that ""walm"" might mean to repeat the preceding color. However, considering that we only have one instance of ""walm"" without further context, this part of the rule is less certain. The other words (""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"") also correspond to specific colors, with ""dax"" mapping to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""green.""

Rule:
zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the individual inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify patterns.

Let's consider each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
   Here, ""wif"" produces ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which then produces another ""red.""

2. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   
   Similarly, ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which leads to another ""blue.""

3. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red
   
   Following the pattern, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""wif,"" producing a second ""blue.""

4. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue
   
   Again, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" duplicating the ""blue.""

5. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   
   This sequence is more complex, but ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Notice that after each word (except the last ""zup""), ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word before it.

Based on these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it duplicates the output (color) of the preceding word in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should carefully examine the outputs in each case to see how they correspond to the inputs. I will use the process of elimination and pattern recognition to deduce the rule.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue"", as indicated by the repetition of blue after lug and walm.

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"", as indicated by yellow being repeated after zup and before lug.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" produces a repeated color based on the preceding word. This time, it seems to repeat ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif."" Given that ""walm"" followed ""lug"" and ""wif"" yet the output is not blue but is red, it suggests a positional influence or another factor affecting ""walm""'s output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" when followed by ""wif,"" it causes added repetition of the ""blue"" from ""lug."" After ""wif,"" we revert back to ""blue"" for ""lug.""

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""walm"" corresponds here to ""green,"" repeating the color of ""dax.""

Based on these observations, we can arrive at a rule for ""walm"": it causes repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word, whether it is the color itself or that color multiple times.

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,120
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Examining the data:

- ""dax bluf lug wif"" translates to ""green green blue red,"" where ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- ""zup lug dax"" becomes ""yellow blue green,"" it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" appears again to represent ""blue."" ""dax"" is consistent with ""green.""
- ""dax lug zup dax"" is ""green blue yellow green,"" which further reinforces that ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" again showing that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""
- ""dax lug dax"" turns into ""green blue green,"" which maintains the consistency for ""dax"" as ""green"" and ""lug"" as ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Given the examples:

1. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
2. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
3. dax -> green
4. wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
5. dax bluf -> green green

From these examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently results in the word ""green,"" no matter its position in the sequence or the context of surrounding words (which produce various other colors). Thus, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" signals the color green.

dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""red."" However, there is insufficient context to deduce any additional rules particularly due to the last example that includes unmatched words ""lug"" and ""walm."" There is not enough information to interpret these two additional words as they only appear once and without variation. Hence, with the given data:

Rule: wif -> red
From the given examples, we can see a correlation between the nonce word ""zup"" and the color ""yellow"". In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the output consistently includes the color ""yellow"".

By analyzing the patterns further:
- In the first example, ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red"".
- In the second example, ""zup walm dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"".
- In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" adds ""yellow"" in the sequence red red red green yellow red blue blue blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" shows that ""yellow"" comes after ""green"" in the sequence blue red green green green yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow"".

In all examples, regardless of where ""zup"" falls in the sequence, it translates to the color ""yellow"". There is no clear dependency on the context or the surrounding words as ""zup"" consistently becomes ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, we can make the following observations:

- In ""dax lug wif bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red. ""bluf"" results in red.
- In ""wif bluf dax"", we again see that ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""dax"" to green. ""bluf"" once again corresponds to red.
- In ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"", ""wif"" translates to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" seems to be yellow. ""bluf"" at the end results in a second green following a ""dax"".
- In ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"", ""lug"" translates to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green. In both cases where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", we get red. But when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", we get blue.
- Finally, in ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" is red and ""bluf"" is again red.

Given the above, ""bluf"" seems to follow a specific rule. The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that precedes it. If the preceding word is ""wif"", then ""bluf"" results in red. If it's ""lug"", then ""bluf"" results in blue. The exception is when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which causes ""bluf"" to result in green. It seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word unless it follows ""dax"".

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word preceding it, with the exception that after ""dax"" it is always green.
Rule: walm -> the word before ""walm"" repeated three times in the color corresponding to that word.

For example:
- ""dax lug walm"" means ""dax"" is green once and ""lug"" is blue, but because of ""walm"", ""lug"" is repeated three times, hence ""green blue blue blue"".
- ""lug walm dax"" means ""lug"" is blue and ""dax"" is green, but ""walm"" makes the word before it, ""lug"", repeat three times before the green, so ""blue blue blue green"".
- ""dax walm"" has ""dax"" before ""walm"", so ""green"" is repeated three times, thus ""green green green"".
- ""zup walm wif"" has ""zup"" before ""walm"", thus ""yellow"" is repeated three times, and then ""wif"" is red, giving ""yellow yellow yellow red"".
- ""lug walm"" repeats ""lug"" which is blue, leading to ""blue blue blue"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue."" Here's a breakdown of each example to illustrate this:

- ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue""
- ""lug walm zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow red,"" and it's consistent with ""lug"" being ""blue"" as the first word in the input corresponds to the first color in the output.
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" corresponds to ""red red blue green red,"" again showing ""lug"" as ""blue"" in the third position of both input and output.
- ""dax lug"" corresponds to ""green blue,"" where ""lug"" is the second element and ""blue"" is the second color.
- ""wif lug"" as another example, still corresponds to ""red blue.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" We can observe this through the consistent presence of the word ""green"" in the output whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input. There is no variance in this output in comparison to other words such as ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif,"" which seem to correspond to ""blue,"" ""blue blue blue"" (or ""red red red"" depending on position), ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively. 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output in the corresponding position. Here are the correlations drawn from each example:

- In ""dax bluf lug wif,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" the first position with ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" which may be coincidental or context-dependent).
- In ""wif,"" where ""wif"" is the only word, the output is ""red.""
- In ""zup wif dax,"" ""wif"" is in the second position and corresponds to ""red.""
- In ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" ""wif"" is in the second position again and corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the consistent response to various inputs, we see a pattern where ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. The other words, ""bluf"", ""dax"", ""wif"", ""walm"", and ""lug"", also correspond to specific colors, with ""bluf"" corresponding to yellow, ""dax"" corresponding to green, ""wif"" corresponding to red, ""walm"" corresponding to red, and ""lug"" corresponding to blue, as indicated by their respective outputs.

The process to determine the meaning of ""zup"" follows from examining each input-output pair and identifying the part of the string that corresponds to the response ""yellow."" The word ""zup"" is the common factor in each instance that produces the output ""yellow,"" independent of its position in the input string.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is: 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From analyzing the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. I will provide details based on each example to illustrate:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

3. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green.

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   - ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red, while ""lug"" and ""walm"" are associated with the color blue. 

5. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: red red yellow yellow red
   - The first ""bluf"" repeats the color of the first ""wif,"" which is red. The second ""bluf"" then repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow, and the pattern ends with the repeated color for another ""wif,"" which is red.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.
From the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" changes the preceding color word to repeat multiple times. To determine how many times the previous color repeats due to ""walm,"" we can look at each instance:

1. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" showing that after ""zup"" (yellow), which is mentioned twice, the ""walm"" causes the next color, yellow, to repeat three times in the output.

2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in green being repeated three times, and ""lug"" (blue) followed by ""walm"" resulting in blue being repeated three times.

3. ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green,"" with ""dax"" (green) followed by ""walm,"" resulting in green being repeated three times in the output.

4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue,"" where ""dax"" (green) preceding ""walm"" results in green being repeated three times in the output, followed by once occurrence of ""lug"" (blue).

5. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green,"" with ""wif"" (red) followed by ""walm,"" causing red to repeat three times.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to repeat three times. This is consistent across all the given examples.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated two more times, resulting in that color appearing three times in a row.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,122
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each occurrence of the word ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the inputs corresponds to the word ""green"" in the outputs, irrespective of its position or the surrounding words.
Based on the provided outputs, we can infer a pattern correlating the input words to the output colors. It appears that each input word is translated into a specific color:

- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" always corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""

No other details seem to affect this direct correlation. Given that the word ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" across multiple examples, we can deduce that the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is provided as input, ""yellow"" is included in the corresponding output. No example contradicts this conclusion.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to whatever color was previously mentioned. Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it takes the color of the word before it. Let's verify this with the examples:

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
Output: yellow green green yellow green
Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color green from ""dax.""

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color red from ""wif.""

Input: lug bluf wif
Output: blue blue red
Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color blue from ""lug.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color yellow from ""zup.""

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color yellow from ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it represents the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the previous word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word 'walm' represents a rule that dictates the color output should repeat three times with the color associated with the word prior to 'walm'. Here is the analysis of the given examples:

- Input: wif walm zup walm
  Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
  (wif -> red, repeated three times; zup -> yellow, repeated three times after 'walm')

- Input: zup dax walm
  Output: yellow green green green
  (dax -> green, repeated three times after 'walm')

- Input: wif lug walm
  Output: red blue blue blue
  (lug -> blue, repeated three times after 'walm')

- Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
  Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
  (lug -> blue, repeated three times after 'walm'; the rest of the sequence follows the pattern established earlier for individual colors)

- Input: dax walm zup lug dax
  Output: green green green yellow blue green
  (dax -> green, repeated three times after 'walm'; the rest of the sequence follows the pattern established earlier for individual colors)

Rule: walm -> The color corresponding to the word immediately preceding 'walm' is repeated three times.

    Rules:
lug -> red when followed by ""wif"", otherwise blue. Rule: If the word ""lug"" is followed by the word ""wif,"" it translates to ""red."" In all other contexts, ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that each nonce word is consistently associated with a color. Specifically, the word ""dax"" is always associated with the color green. No other context or variation seems to change this result for ""dax."" Let's infer the associations for the other nonce words:

In the third example:

- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue.""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""red.""
- The second ""dax"" at the end is followed by ""green.""

In the fourth example:

- ""walm"" is followed by ""green."" Since ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" might also mean ""green"" or be a rule that doesn't change the previously mentioned color, which is ""green"" from ""dax.""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red."" This matches with the third input, where ""wif"" also corresponded to ""red.""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" which is also consistent with the third example.

In the fifth example:

- Only ""dax"" and ""wif"" are mentioned, with ""dax"" followed by ""green"" and ""wif"" by ""red,"" again consistent with the above examples.

Taking this information together, we can propose the following associations:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- walm -> green (or doesn't change the preceding color)

Rule: Each nonce word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output.
Based on the examples provided, ""wif"" seems to be a rule precursor that signals the start of a sequence where the meaning of the terms that follow is translated into colors, with a specific color associated with each distinct word after ""wif.""

Here's what we can deduce from each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Rule: ""walm"" translates to a sequence of three ""red.""

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

4. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow
   Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" translates to three ""blue.""

With these observations, the meaning of ""wif"" appears to initiate the translation of the following words into a sequence of colors. The color each word translates to does not seem to depend on ""wif"" but on the specific word's inherent definition within this system. Additionally, the color sequence always starts with ""red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" may inherently include an initial ""red.""

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:
wif -> Signals the start of a sequence of colors, beginning with ""red."" Each subsequent word is replaced with a corresponding color or colors, depending on the predefined translation for that word.
Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" as well, which may indicate that ""bluf"" is possibly an alternative for ""zup"" or that it repeats the first color in the sequence.

When multiple nonce words are combined, they map to their respective color names in the given order.

Rule:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow (when it appears with zup, it seems to repeat the color yellow)
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let us examine the input and output pairs provided for each example:

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
5. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red

From the examples, we see that whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is a repeated color word. More specifically, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word that precedes it in each sequence:

1. ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow,"" which is the same color assigned to ""zup.""
2. ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and results in ""blue,"" which is the same color assigned to ""lug.""
3. ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow,"" which is the same color assigned to ""zup.""
4. ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow,"" which is the same color assigned to ""zup.""
5. ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red,"" which is the same color assigned to ""wif.""

From these results, we can induce that ""bluf"" represents a rule wherein it takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples:

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

""Walm"" appears in varying positions within the input sequences, and its output is not fixed—it changes based on context. One possible pattern is that when ""walm"" appears, the outputs thereafter repeat the color that was given for the word directly preceding ""walm."" 

Looking at the second example, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"", and after ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" with ""blue"" being the color corresponding to ""lug."" This pattern is consistent with the first input; ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""

In the third input, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"", and both outputs are ""yellow,"" with ""yellow"" being the color for ""zup."" In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and the colors after ""walm"" are repeated ""yellow."" Finally, the fifth input causes only ""yellow"" to be outputted following ""walm,"" and it follows ""zup.""

Based on the analysis, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it induces a repetition of the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it for the rest of the sequence, or until a new word possibly alters the pattern.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the output color that directly precedes ""walm"" is repeated for the subsequent outputs until the end of the sequence or until a new word possibly changes the pattern.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue,yellow blue,True,124
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" every time it appears. 

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" is associated with the output ""green"" every time it appears. The outputs for the other words (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""bluf"") are consistent with a certain color whenever they appear, suggesting that these words are also associated with specific colors. The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" also to ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" occurs only once, but given the pattern, we can assume ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" as well.

Rule: dax -> green.
To decipher the meaning of ""wif,"" we'll analyze the patterns in which it occurs and the corresponding output colors:

1. It consistently translates to ""red"" irrespective of its position within the input sequence.
2. Other words in the sequence (lug, bluf, zup, dax, walm) correspond to different color outputs and their positions don't affect the color they are translated to.

Given these observations, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" and there appears to be no dependence on context or position.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: zup wif lug
Output: yellow red blue

From these examples, we can observe that:

1. Every time the input starts with ""zup,"" the corresponding output begins with ""yellow.""
2. The input ""zup"" on its own corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
3. When ""zup"" is followed by different words such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" or ""wif,"" it seems to not affect the initial ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup,"" but rather determines the colors that follow.

Given this analysis, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" The meaning of ""zup"" stays constant regardless of the context in which it appears, and it maps to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs provided. 

Thus: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" can be inferred as follows:

When ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is the color corresponding to the word preceding ""bluf"", repeated once. For example, if the word prior to ""bluf"" is ""lug"" (which corresponds to the color blue), then the output is ""blue blue"". 

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the word before ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf repeats the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe the patterns and outputs provided in the examples. By comparing the patterns and their corresponding outputs, we can induce the rule governing the meaning of ""walm.""

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Analyzing the outputs:
- When ""walm"" appears immediately after ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green blue.""
- When ""walm"" appears immediately after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- ""walm"" always seems to correspond to a triple color output except where there is a word following ""walm,"" then it is followed by ""blue.""

From the given examples, whenever ""walm"" is present, a set of three colored outputs of the same color precedes a ""blue."" The color itself appears to correspond to the word that precedes ""walm."" 

Based on the examples, we can suggest the following rule:
""walm"" represents a repeated output of a color that corresponds to the word immediately before it, repeating three times, followed by the color ""blue.""

Therefore we can define:

walm -> A triplet of colors corresponding to the preceding word, followed by the color blue. Rule: If the preceding word is 'dax', the triplet is green; if ‘lug’, the triplet is blue; if ‘wif’, the triplet is red; if 'zup', the triplet is yellow; and so on, always followed by the color blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif lug
    ",Output: green blue red blue,green blue red blue,True,125
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can see that specific input words are transformed into colors in the output. The word ""dax"" appears consistently in the input and is associated with the color ""green"" in the output each time it appears. Other words are also paired with specific colors; for instance, ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""walm"" with ""green,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" The word ""zup"" appears once and correlates with the color ""yellow."" The rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is consistent in all examples regardless of its position in the list of words.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red"" in each example, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" 

The number of times ""yellow"" is output seems to be dependent on the number of syllables in the second word. ""Lug"" has one syllable resulting in a single ""yellow."" ""Walm"" with one syllable is followed by three ""yellows,"" which at first seems inconsistent, but perhaps ""walm"" signifies a repetition of the color mentioned before it, in this case, ""yellow."" ""Bluf"", with one syllable, results in two ""yellows,"" which suggests that the second syllable causes the ""yellow"" to be repeated once more.

Given the data:

- zup lug -> yellow blue (one syllable after zup, one yellow followed by a new color)
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (walm is likely a special case that specifies repetition, hence three yellows)
- dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow (walm causes the preceding color to repeat)
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (one syllable after zup, yellow is repeated just once indicating ""bluf"" caused an extra yellow)

So, zup means ""yellow,"" and the word following it might affect how many times ""yellow"" appears.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the consistency of the word associations in the given examples.

In the first example, ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red."" Since ""lug"" appears again in the third example as ""blue,"" it's reasonable to assume that ""lug"" means ""blue."" Now ""wif"" appears twice in the examples: in the first and last, and in both instances, it is associated with ""red."" The repetition of ""wif"" and ""red"" suggests that ""wif"" is likely to mean ""red.""

Now, looking at ""bluf,"" we must determine its role by comparing examples where it's present:

In the first example, it seems to correspond to the last ""red,"" but we need more information to confirm this.

In the second example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Because the output is two yellows without a ""wif"" to correspond to red, we can infer that ""zup"" likely means ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" in this context seems to correspond to the repetition of that color, indicating a duplicating effect.

In the third example, ""lug bluf dax lug"" becomes ""blue blue green blue."" Since ""lug"" is confirmed to mean ""blue,"" the double ""blue"" suggests that ""bluf"" might mean ""repeat the previous color."" However, ""dax"" introduces ""green,"" which doesn't seem to follow the same rule. Still, ""dax"" only occurs once, and thus it is impossible to reliably infer its meaning from this example alone.

In the fourth example, we see ""zup bluf"" again, resulting in ""yellow yellow,"" reinforcing the rule suggested by the second example where ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the previous color.

In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red."" If ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" we're introduced to a new word, ""walm,"" which would correspond to the repeated ""blue."" Since the example ends with ""bluf"" leading to a double ""red,"" it strengthens the idea that ""bluf"" means to repeat the preceding color again.

Based on the analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the previous color.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the output pattern of colors is directly related to the input sequence of nonce words. Specifically focusing on the word ""walm,"" we look for a consistent pattern in its appearances and the corresponding output colors. We can notice that every time ""walm"" is mentioned, a sequence of ""green"" appears in the output with a specific number of green mentions. This number seems to be determined by the position of ""walm"" within the sequence of input words — the next green output appears until another word follows ""walm.""

Let's analyze the examples to confirm this rule:

1. Input: zup dax walm - Output: yellow green green green.
   When ""walm"" appears after two words, there are three greens following.

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug - Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue.
   Here, ""walm"" appears after four words, and only one green follows before ""dax"" occurs.

3. Input: dax zup walm wif walm - Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red.
   ""Walm"" first appears after two words and yields three yellows after which ""wif"" interrupts. ""Walm"" appears again but since it's the final word, reds follow indefinitely.

4. Input: lug walm - Output: blue blue blue.
   After one word we have two blue outputs.

5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif - Output: blue green yellow green green green red.
   ""Walm"" is preceded by four words and followed by one red after which ""wif"" comes into play.

From the analysis, it seems that ""walm"" generates a sequence of green in the output corresponding to the number of words that preceded ""walm"" in the input, plus one. This rule breaks only when ""walm"" is the last word in the input, in which case the color sequence continues according to the last mentioned color related to a word (wif -> red), and this color repeats indefinitely.

Based on this induction, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it results in a sequence of the color green in the output. The number of times ""green"" appears is one more than the count of preceding words before ""walm"" in the input sequence, unless ""walm"" is the last word, then the last mentioned color repeats indefinitely. 

Thus, walm -> a sequencer of greens, count based on the position in the input series.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,126
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the examples provided, we observe the following correlations:

- When the input is ""lug"" alone, the output is ""blue"".
- When ""lug"" is combined with ""bluf"" as in ""wif bluf lug"", the output includes ""blue"" at the position where ""lug"" is in the input, with additional outputs ""red red"" corresponding to ""wif bluf"".
- The sequence ""lug bluf"" produces an output of ""blue blue"", again with ""blue"" corresponding to the position of ""lug"".
- In ""zup lug zup wif dax"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", with other outputs corresponding to the other input words.
- With ""dax lug"", the output is ""green blue,"" with ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug"".

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be consistent across all examples:

Rule: lug -> blue. ""Lug"" means ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" That is, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

dax -> meaning. Meaning: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears, replace it with ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color every time it is used. The following are the associations between the inputs and the outputs:

Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
Input: zup dax walm zup wif -> Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Input: zup lug wif dax lug -> Output: yellow blue red green blue
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: wif -> Output: red

In each case, the presence of the word ""wif"" in the input corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. The context does not seem to change the meaning of ""wif."" With this pattern, we can deduce the following rule for the meaning of ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The rule is derived from observing that in every example, the presence of the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" in the output. No matter its position in the sequence, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word that directly follows it. However, in cases where ""bluf"" is the last word in a sequence, it translates to green. Here are the deductions from the given examples:

1. In ""zup bluf lug"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", and the output is ""yellow yellow blue"". Therefore, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"", the color word after it.

2. In ""dax bluf wif zup dax"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"", and the output is ""green green red yellow green"". Here, ""bluf"" is translating to ""red"", the color word after it.

3. In ""zup dax bluf"", ""bluf"" is the last word and the output is ""yellow green green"". This indicates that when ""bluf"" is the last word, it translates to ""green"".

4. In ""zup wif bluf zup lug"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"", and the output is ""yellow red red yellow blue"". So, here ""bluf"" translates to ""red"", the color word after ""wif"".

5. In ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"", ""bluf"" is the last word and the output is ""red green yellow red green green"". Therefore, ""bluf"" as the last word translates again to ""green"".

Based on these observations, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: If ""bluf"" is followed by another word, it translates to the color corresponding to that word. If ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, it translates to green.

Translation:
bluf -> meaning. If ""bluf"" is followed by another word, it means the color that corresponds to the following word. If ""bluf"" is the last word, it means green.
Based on the examples provided, let's analyze the patterns associated with the nonce word ""walm"".

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

The word ""lug"" always results in the color blue immediately following it, and ""wif"" results in red, while ""dax"" results in green, and ""zup"" in yellow. Given the fact that the color blue follows after ""walm"" in all instances but is not exclusively tied to the word ""lug"", it seems that ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color given by the previous word in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for walm seems to be that it repeats the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,127
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In every example, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the corresponding output is ""blue."" Therefore, ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green

In every example provided, the presence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: lug dax zup wif
Output: blue green yellow red

Input: dax lug wif lug
Output: green blue red blue

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

The pattern suggests that each word corresponds to a specific color, and ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> meaning. Meaning: red

Rule: The word ""wif"" represents the color red in the given set of inputs and outputs.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll look at each context where the word appears and try to extract patterns associated with the output colors.

From the first two examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to result in a ""green"" output when it follows the word ""dax"" (which itself results in a ""green"" output in every instance):

- dax bluf wif -> green green red
- dax lug bluf -> green blue blue

In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and both yield a ""blue"" output:

- lug bluf wif -> blue blue red

From the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears at the end of a sequence with various colors before it and results in a ""red"":

- wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red

Lastly, in the fifth instance, ""bluf"" again follows the word ""dax,"" producing a ""green"" output:

- wif dax bluf -> red green green

Given these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word just before it:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, it results in green.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, it results in blue.
- The forth example may be seen as an anomaly since it does not follow a single color output, but the sequence may have another rule affecting it (such as ""zup"" changing the pattern), or it could be that ""bluf"" defaults to red at the end of a sequence. 
- However, since the primary consistent rule in the first three examples and the fifth is that ""bluf"" copies the color of the word before it, we will follow that rule.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the term ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the word just before it three times. Taking each example in turn:

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times.

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
The word before ""walm"" is once again ""dax"" = ""green,"" so ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
The word before ""walm"" is ""wif"" = ""red,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
The last word before ""walm"" is ""wif"" = ""red,"" so ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,128
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, there seems to be a consistent pattern as to what ""dax"" means. The word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words. Here are the correlations observed:

- ""zup dax bluf"" maps to ""yellow green green"", where ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green"".
- ""lug dax zup dax wif"" maps to ""blue green yellow green red"", where both instances of ""dax"" correlate with ""green"".
- ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" maps to ""red green red red yellow red"", with ""dax"" again correlating with ""green"".
- ""dax bluf"" maps to ""green green"", where ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green"".
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" maps to ""green green red blue"", where ""dax"" correlates with the first ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, the rule for the word ""wif"" appears to be consistent across all examples. Every time ""wif"" is present, the output always contains the color red. Regardless of its position in the input sequence (beginning, middle, or end), ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". The position of ""wif"" in the input does not seem to affect the meaning, as ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"", irrespective of its context in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Meaning is the color ""yellow"".

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in these examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns and correlations in the examples provided between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
2. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
3. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red green green red""
4. ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red""
5. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""

Analyzing the inputs and corresponding outputs, we observe the following:

- Every time ""bluf"" appears, the immediate output is ""green.""
- The output preceding ""green"" is always identical to the one following the first word before ""bluf."" For example:
  - In Input 1, ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" correlates to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" (the color corresponding to ""dax"").
  - In Input 2, ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" (the color corresponding to ""lug"").
  - In Input 4, ""lug"" correlates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" so ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" (the color corresponding to ""lug"").

Given these observations, we can discern the following rule:

Rule: The output for ""bluf"" is ""green,"" followed by the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Therefore:

bluf -> ""green"" followed by the color corresponding to the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's examine each example and its corresponding output.

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

In the first two examples, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green."" In the fifth example, ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red."" The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" and in the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" when it comes before ""walm,"" which is different from the third example where ""wif"" comes after ""walm"" and still corresponds to ""red.""

In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" both times it appears. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the fourth example, where ""walm"" is at the end and the output ends with ""blue blue blue.""

Looking at the varying positions of ""walm,"" we can attempt to generalize a rule. In each case, the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word. Moreover, there are three repetitions of that color. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to indicate ""repeat the color of the preceding word three times.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding nonce word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup bluf
    ",Output: green red yellow green yellow,green red yellow yellow,False,129
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the examples corresponds directly to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, each occurrence of different words corresponds to a particular color in the output. The word 'wif' consistently results in the color 'red' in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence:

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue

Input: wif
Output: red

From the examples above, noticing that 'wif' always corresponds to 'red' regardless of where it is in the sequence, we can conclude:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To determine the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the provided examples and identify patterns consistent with the appearance of ""bluf"" and the corresponding color in the output.

1. zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
2. dax bluf wif -> green green red
3. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
4. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
5. wif dax zup bluf -> red green yellow yellow

In each of these examples, every time ""bluf"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is outputted immediately after, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input string. However, when ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""dax,"" the output color is ""blue"" instead of ""yellow"" which follows it. If we assume that ""bluf"" affects the color output immediately following it, we can construct a rule.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is followed by any word other than ""dax,"" the output color is ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output color is ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> When followed by any word except ""dax,"" results in ""yellow""; when followed by ""dax,"" results in ""blue.""
Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output consists of the color associated with the preceding nonce word repeated three times. This can be inferred from the consistent repetition pattern observed in all given examples. The word that comes before ""walm"" determines the color to be repeated:

- ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue"", so ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""dax walm"" within ""dax walm wif dax"" gives us ""green green green"" before ""wif dax"", indicating that ""dax"" is associated with green.
- ""lug dax walm"" provides ""blue green green green"", again showing that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word directly before it (""dax"" in this case) to be repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""zup"" is associated with yellow.
- The final example, ""lug walm,"" reaffirms the first rule as it again leads to ""blue blue blue"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is deduced by observing that the output repeats the color linked with the word right before ""walm"" in a set of three.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug bluf dax
    ",Output: blue blue green,blue blue green,True,130
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently maps to the color ""blue."" Each time the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the corresponding output includes the color ""blue."" There is no variation in the output tied to the word ""lug,"" regardless of its position in the input or the words that surround it. Consequently, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to discern the rule or pattern that dictates what ""dax"" means within the context of the inputs and outputs.

In each sequence with ""dax,"" the output is invariably green. However, ""dax"" does not appear to have a fixed position within those sequences (it can appear at the beginning, middle, or end), and the words that follow it do not consistently yield the same output color. This suggests that ""dax"" itself corresponds directly to the color green, rather than being dependent on its position or on surrounding words.

Here are the deductions from the input/output examples:

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" corresponds to the first green.

Input: zup dax lug zup
Output: yellow green blue yellow
- Here, ""dax"" again corresponds to green, which is not influenced by either ""zup"" or ""lug"".

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- Once more, ""dax"" yields a green output.

Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
- ""dax"" precedes the last two colors but still outputs green.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- Although ""dax"" is not the last word in this sequence, it still results in a green output, and the words after it have different colors from each other.

From the above examples, it's clear that regardless of position or surrounding words, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Based on the examples, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as ""red.""

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding location in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule:
zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the context provided by surrounding words. This suggests that ""zup"" directly translates to or represents the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf"" by examining its consistent impact on the output. Let's take a closer look at each input and its corresponding output.

- In the first example, when ""wif bluf"" is given, the output is ""red red"". Since ""wif"" on its own outputs ""red"" in other examples, the addition of ""bluf"" did not change the color associated with ""wif"".

- In the second example, ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"", the presence of ""bluf"" follows a ""dax wif"" and precedes a ""zup"", yielding ""red green red red yellow red"". Again, we see that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to an output of ""red"", which aligns with the output for ""wif"".

- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm"", we get ""red red green green green"". The output corresponding to ""bluf"" is ""red"", consistent with the output for ""wif"". 

- In the fourth example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"", the output is ""yellow blue red green green red"". The ""bluf"" here is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif"". It corresponds with an output of ""green"", the same as ""dax"".

- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf wif"", the output is ""green green red"". ""Bluf"" is in between ""dax"" and ""wif"" and the output corresponding to ""bluf"" is ""green"", which is the same output as for ""dax"".

Taking the above into account, it seems like ""bluf"" may take the color of the preceding word, if that word has an associated color. Looking at all the instances where ""bluf"" is placed after ""wif"", it takes on the color ""red"". When placed after ""dax"", it takes on the color ""green"". We do not have instances where ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" or ""lug"" for further comparison, but based on the available data, the tentative rule could be:

**Rule: ""bluf"" reflects the output color of the word right before it.**

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Takes on the output color of the preceding word (if the preceding word has an associated output color).
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" is correlated with repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Here are the associations shown in the inputs and outputs:

- ""zup wif walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, so ""walm"" repeats red three times.
- ""zup walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats yellow three times.
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"": ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow. ""walm"" after ""dax"" and ""wif"" repeats the associated colors three times each.
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup,"" which is yellow, three times.
- ""wif walm"": ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" repeats red three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,131
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
After examining the examples, it is possible to deduce that each word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red."" The nonce word ""dax"" occurs multiple times and each time it corresponds to the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for the given examples is:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output. Each instance of ""wif"" in the input is replaced with ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, every instance of the nonce word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule that can be deduced for what ""zup"" means in this context is that it translates to the color ""yellow"".
From the given input and output examples, it appears that the output color corresponds to the same position as the input word. Using this observation, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"" by looking at what color it consistently corresponds to in the output:

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to red.

Input: dax lug bluf
Output: green blue blue
- In this case, ""bluf"" also corresponds to blue.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow.

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
- ""bluf"" corresponds to red.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow.

Looking at all the outputs, the color that corresponds to ""bluf"" is not consistent and changes based on another factor. However, a noticeable pattern is that ""bluf"" appears to take the same color as the word that immediately precedes it:

- When preceded by ""wif"", ""bluf"" is red.
- When preceded by ""zup"", ""bluf"" is yellow.
- When followed by ""lug"", it takes the color blue, potentially influenced by ""lug"" since ""lug"" is blue in other combinations.

It's important to note that the rule derived here is based on the limited examples provided, and without additional examples, we can only hypothesize that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word (or potentially the following word when ""lug"" follows ""bluf"").

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the word immediately preceding it. If it is followed by ""lug"", it might take the color blue.
walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, such as ""dax"" or ""zup,"" it cues the repetition of the color associated with that preceding word three times. ""Dax"" is associated with the color green, and ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,132
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the output contains the color blue.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of ""dax."" In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Here are the mappings from the inputs to outputs:

1. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue
2. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
3. dax zup wif -> green yellow red
4. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
5. dax -> green

From these examples, it is evident that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green,"" irrespective of its position in the list or the context around it.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. This can be observed in each example where ""wif"" is present:

- In the first example, ""wif zup"" outputs ""red yellow,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""dax lug wif"" outputs ""green blue red,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" at the end of the series.
- The third example, ""wif bluf lug zup,"" yields ""red red blue yellow,"" where the first ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"".
- The fourth example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to the last ""red"" in the sequence.
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup lug wif"" outputs ""red yellow blue red,"" with both instances of ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
From the given examples, we can induce a rule for what the nonce word ""bluf"" means in the context of the color outputs. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   - Here, bluf is followed by dax and preceded by zup, and it outputs blue after green. It is also followed by lug which does not seem to affect its output.

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - Here, bluf is preceded by wif and it outputs red.

3. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - Here, bluf follows dax and the output is green.

4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - Here, bluf follows dax and the output is green.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - Here, bluf is preceded by wif and followed by dax. The output for both wif and bluf is red, and for dax, it is green.

Based on these examples, it seems that bluf has the following property: 

Rule: bluf repeats the color output of the word before it. Hence, if the previous word's corresponding color is yellow, bluf will also result in yellow. If the previous word's color is red, then bluf will also result in red, and so on.

So, bluf -> Repeats the color of the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs:

1. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
2. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
3. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

Now, observing the pattern, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color that comes just before it the same number of times as has been repeated before plus one, and following ""walm"" by yellow. 

Here's how it works:

1. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> the pattern before ""walm"" is ""red blue yellow,"" and we see that yellow is repeated twice before ""walm."" Afterwards, we have three yellows. Finally, the sequence red blue follows, as it did in the beginning.
   
2. dax walm zup -> ""green"" is repeated twice before ""walm,"" so after ""walm"" it is repeated three times, followed by yellow.

3. wif walm zup -> ""red"" is repeated twice before ""walm,"" so it is repeated three times after ""walm,"" followed by yellow.

4. zup walm -> the pattern before ""walm"" has ""yellow"" once, so after ""walm"" it is repeated twice, consistent in the following example as well.

Therefore, ""walm"" in these examples indicates that the color immediately preceding it should be repeated an additional time plus one compared to the number of times it has been already repeated before adding a yellow at the end.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the previous color once more than its prior sequence before ""walm,"" and ends with yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,133
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Therefore, the rule can be simply stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position or the words around it. 

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" we can look at the patterns of input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif zup | Output: red yellow
2. Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red
3. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
4. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif | Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
5. Input: wif | Output: red

From these examples, we notice that every time ""wif"" is included in the input, ""red"" is part of the output. Additionally, it seems every input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. ""Zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, we can deduce:

wif -> meaning: red

Rule: Each instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. It does not appear to depend on the context or position, as it maintains the same meaning regardless of its placement within the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word. Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to identify a pattern for the nonce word ""walm.""

In the first example, ""wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which doesn't have a direct color association in the output (as it is not repeated), but ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""yellow.""

In the second example, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" the word ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" is repeated three times. In subsequent appearances, ""lug"" doesn't result in triple colors, perhaps due to the presence of ""walm.""

In the third example, ""lug walm,"" we see ""blue blue blue"" again, which supports the idea that ""walm"" following ""lug"" leads to a triple ""blue.""

In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" we see ""red red green green green,"" with ""walm"" being associated with double ""green"" this time. ""Wif"" and ""dax"" are associated with ""red"" and ""green"" respectively. ""Bluf"" does not appear in other examples, so its effect isn't clear. However, the ""walm"" again yields repeated colors.

In the final example, ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in ""green blue blue blue,"" with ""dax"" associated with ""green"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" Here, ""walm"" appears to cause a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule:
The word ""walm"" appears to induce the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. If ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm,"" then blue is repeated three times. If ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm,"" then the repetition is three greens. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), ""wif"" is typically associated with red, but we do not have enough examples to determine the impact since ""bluf"" is an unknown factor.

Walm -> induces the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,134
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Evidence:
1. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue."" Here, lug is directly translated to blue.
2. In ""lug bluf zup,"" lug corresponds to the first blue, as ""bluf"" is not present in the output and ""zup"" is consistently yellow.
3. The sequence ""lug dax zup walm"" includes ""lug"" before ""blue,"" and ""dax"" before ""green,"" with ""zup"" as ""yellow.""
4. ""lug zup"" results in ""blue yellow,"" where ""zup"" is yellow, so ""lug"" must be blue.
5. ""zup lug wif dax lug"" gives ""yellow blue red green blue,"" showing that ""lug"" consistently translates to blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" has a consistent output associated with it. Across all examples where ""dax"" is an input, the output is always ""green."" There is no variation in this pattern, and no context is given that changes the meaning of ""dax."" Therefore, the most straightforward rule that can be deduced from the provided examples is that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to ""red"". Here is the reasoning:

- When ""wif"" appears alone (""wif""), the output is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" (""zup wif""), the output of ""wif"" remains ""red"", while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In a longer sequence (""dax wif dax zup bluf""), ""wif"" still translates to ""red"", while other words (""dax"", ""zup"", ""bluf"") correspond to their respective colors (""green"", ""yellow"", ""yellow"").
- With a new word preceding ""wif"" (""lug walm""), the output is consistent with the word ""wif"" producing ""red"", while ""lug"" and ""walm"" both map to ""blue"".
- Again, when ""wif"" is between ""zup"" and ""dax"" (""zup wif dax""), the output for ""wif"" is ""red"", with ""zup"" and ""dax"" giving ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Additionally, other words correspond to different colors, but consistently so (""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red""). There is no information to suggest that ""zup"" means anything other than the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the pattern of inputs and their corresponding outputs to identify possible rules.

From the first example:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

We notice that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""bluf"" there are two ""blue.""

From the second example:
Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" After ""bluf,"" there are two ""blue"" again.

From the third example:
Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" again maps to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" there are two ""red.""

From the fourth example:
Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

We see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" there are two ""red.""

From the last example:
Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""bluf"" there are two ""red.""

From these examples, we can induce that ""bluf"" likely causes the next color in the sequence to be repeated once more than it would ordinarily appear.

Rule: bluf -> causes the next color word's corresponding color to be outputted twice.

For example, normally ""lug"" would correspond to a single ""blue"" in the output, but after ""bluf,"" it leads to ""blue blue"" in the output. Similarly, ""wif"" usually corresponds to ""red,"" but after ""bluf,"" we get ""red red.""
To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's look at the patterns and the corresponding outputs.

- In every instance, after ""walm,"" the following colors repeat three times.
- The color that follows ""walm"" relates to the word that precedes it, not ""walm"" directly.

Now, let's examine each input and its output:

1. Input: ""dax walm zup walm""
   Output: ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
   The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" these colors repeat three times.

2. Input: ""zup walm wif""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
   The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" it repeats three times, followed by ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

3. Input: ""dax walm zup lug""
   Output: ""green green green yellow blue""
   Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" it repeats three times. This pattern is consistent.

4. Input: ""wif dax lug walm""
   Output: ""red green blue blue blue""
   The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" ""blue"" repeats three times.

5. Input: ""lug wif dax walm zup""
   Output: ""blue red green green green yellow""
   The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" After ""walm,"" ""green"" repeats three times.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" signals the repetition of the next color three times. What initiates the color, however, is the word that comes before ""walm,"" not ""walm"" itself. Hence, ""walm"" functions as a repeater for the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule:
- walm -> causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Based on the given examples, the word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color 'blue' in the output, regardless of the context it is used in. Thus, 'lug' means 'blue'.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"". It can be deduced that whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" occurs in the same position in the output.

Here is the rule induction based on each example:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf 
   Output: green green green red red 
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

2. Input: dax 
   Output: green 
   - ""dax"" by itself corresponds to ""green"".

3. Input: wif walm dax zup 
   Output: red red red green yellow 
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""; occurring after other non-""dax"" words do not change its associated color.

4. Input: dax lug dax 
   Output: green blue green 
   - ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"", irrespective of its position.

5. Input: lug dax zup dax wif 
   Output: blue green yellow green red 
   - ""dax"" continues to correspond to ""green"" when it appears multiple times in an input.

Rule: dax -> green. Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in an input, it translates to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Other words like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup"" correspond to the colors ""blue,"" ""green,"" ""red,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. Since ""wif"" is always translated to ""red"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red. Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" In every instance where ""zup"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each instance where it appears in the examples:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. dax lug bluf -> green blue blue
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
5. lug dax bluf -> blue green green

In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output colors are green for both. In the second example, both ""dax"" and ""lug"" are present, but this time, ""lug"" is immediately before ""bluf"" and the outputs are different colors (blue for ""lug"" followed by blue for ""bluf""). The third time, ""lug"" is directly followed by ""bluf"" giving us blue followed by blue again.

From this pattern, we can see that the output color corresponding to ""bluf"" matches the output color of the word immediately preceding it. In cases where ""lug"" is immediately before ""bluf,"" the output for both is blue. In the one example where ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" their corresponding output colors are both green.

Using this rule, we can interpret that the word ""bluf,"" in this context, means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Thus, we do not have a direct translation for ""bluf,"" but rather a contextual meaning based on the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the consistent patterns associated with its use in the examples provided.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

From the examples given, we can observe the following:
1. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" it translates to ""green."" This is evident from the first and last examples.

2. ""walm"" after a sequence starting with ""dax"" and including other words (e.g., ""zup,"" ""lug"") leads to a repetition of the last color before ""walm."" The second example starts with ""dax zup,"" and the color pattern is ""green yellow"" before ""walm"" which gives us ""yellow yellow yellow."" The fourth example starts with ""dax lug,"" with the color pattern ""green blue"" before ""walm,"" which then leads to ""blue blue blue.""

3. If we consider that ""walm"" repeats the last color before it, the third example also fits the rule. The pattern before ""walm"" is ""green yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" it is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Considering these observations, ""walm"" seems to invoke the last color mentioned before it, leading to a repetition of that color.

Rule: walm -> repeats the last mentioned color in a series.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,136
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples given, whenever the input contains the word ""lug,"" the output consistently includes the color ""blue."" Therefore, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will compare the inputs and outputs and look for patterns to understand the transformation rules from the input words to the output colors. I'll analyze each instance of ""dax"" in the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. In the first example, ""dax"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and the output colors in that position go from yellow to green and then to red. Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

   Input: zup dax wif zup
   Output: yellow green red yellow

2. In the second example, ""dax"" appears twice, once after ""bluf"" and before ""lug,"" and the second time after ""bluf"" and before ""zup."" In the output, colors are green after ""yellow"" (which corresponds to ""bluf"") and before ""blue"" (which corresponds to ""lug"") and green again before ""yellow"" (which corresponds to ""zup""). ""Dax"" still corresponds to the color green.

   Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

3. In the third example, ""dax"" is at the beginning, followed by ""walm"" and ""wif"" which correspond to green and red. ""Dax"" again corresponds to the color green.

   Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears after ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" with the output colors being red, red, green, and blue. The appearance of ""dax"" coincides with the color green once again.

   Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue

5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and precedes ""zup."" The output sequence surrounding ""dax"" is red, red, red, green, yellow. ""Dax"" is aligned with green once more.

   Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Based on the analysis, in every instance, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:

Rule: ""dax"" -> green
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"":

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. When zup is preceded by other words such as ""wif walm dax,"" it results in the output ""red red red green yellow."" We do not have enough information about the other words to determine why they translate to ""red"" or ""green,"" but ""yellow"" consistently appears after ""zup.""

2. When zup is on its own or is the last word in a series, the consistent output is ""yellow.""

3. When zup is followed by another word that is not zup, as in ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" it again results in ""yellow.""

Therefore, the consistent rule that can be induced from these examples is:

Rule: The presence of the word ""zup,"" regardless of its position in a series or on its own, always translates to ""yellow"" in the output. 

zup -> yellow.
bluf -> repeated color associated with the preceding word. Rule:

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif bluf"" consistently outputs ""red red,"" indicating ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""bluf"" prompts the repetition of that color.
- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow,"" so ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" again causes the repetition.
- ""dax lug wif bluf"" outputs ""green blue red red,"" meaning ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""bluf"" causes the repeat of the color corresponding to the word just before it.
- ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green,"" once more showing that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with ""dax"" (green) to be repeated.

It is important to note that this rule induction is based solely on the provided examples; ""bluf"" does not have an intrinsic meaning outside of this constructed context.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it in the input. Here are the observations from the examples provided:

1. Input: wif dax lug walm (Output: red green blue blue blue)
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" So, the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup (Output: green red red red blue yellow)
   - In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Therefore, ""red"" is repeated three times after ""wif.""

3. Input: lug wif zup wif walm (Output: blue red yellow red red red)
   - ""Walm"" here follows the second ""wif,"" and the output is ""red"" repeated three times again.

4. Input: lug walm (Output: blue blue blue)
   - With ""walm"" following ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf (Output: green green green red red)
   - ""Walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

It consistently repeats the color three times after the color corresponding to the word before ""walm."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,137
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Every instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"". Each time ""dax"" is used in the input, ""green"" is the corresponding output in the same position.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". There doesn't seem to be a context-specific variation, as ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words around it. Moreover, each other nonce word seems to correspond to a unique color independent of ""wif"":

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""bluf"" -> green

Hence, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning or rule of ""zup,"" let's examine the input-output pairs and look for patterns.

1. zup dax -> yellow green
2. dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
3. lug zup dax wif -> blue yellow green red
4. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
5. zup dax wif zup -> yellow green red yellow

It appears that the word ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"" in the output. This can be confirmed by looking for instances where ""zup"" appears in the input and ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output:

- In examples 1 and 5, ""zup"" is the first word, and ""yellow"" is the first color.
- In example 3, ""zup"" is the second word, and ""yellow"" is the second color.
- In example 2, ""zup"" is the third word, and ""yellow"" is the third color.
- In example 4, ""zup"" is the third word, and the output starts repeating colors, with ""yellow"" appearing in sequences corresponding to the words after ""zup.""

Therefore, we can conclude the meaning of ""zup"" as follows: zup -> yellow. Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the color immediately preceding it when translated to English. It copies the color of the preceding word. If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to yellow, then ""bluf"" becomes yellow. If it follows ""wif,"" which translates to red, then ""bluf"" becomes red. When following ""dax"" which translates to green, its corresponding color is not shown; the output is yellow, but there is no direct example that follows ""dax"" to confirm the color translation for ""bluf"".

Examining all the instances:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output is red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green), we would expect green, but the output is yellow, which may suggest an inconsistency or an incomplete rule.

However, working with the given data and assuming consistency across the examples, the rule for ""bluf"" could be made clearer with more data, especially an example immediately following ""dax."" But from the given data and taking the third example as possibly incorrect or exceptional, we can induce that ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> adopts the color of the preceding word.
Analyzing the examples and their corresponding outputs, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the last color mentioned to be repeated an additional three times. This rule seems to apply regardless of the initial color word used.

Here are the rules extracted from the given examples:
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue green blue blue blue"" where ""blue"" (the color associated with ""lug"") is repeated three times after its last mention due to ""walm"".
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"" where ""red"" (the color associated with ""wif"") is repeated two more times due to ""walm"".
- ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue"" where ""blue"" is repeated three more times after ""lug"" due to ""walm"".
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" where ""yellow"" (the color associated with ""zup"") is repeated two more times due to ""walm"".
- ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red"" where ""red"" is repeated three more times after ""wif"" due to ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the last color mentioned three additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last-mentioned color three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every instance it appears.
Looking at the provided examples, it seems that each input word has a consistent corresponding color in the output.

Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
- Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
- This is a repeat of the first example and the mapping remains consistent, further reinforcing the previous conclusion.

Input: lug wif dax wif -> Output: blue red green red
- Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" thus ""dax"" is ""green"" again.

Input: dax walm zup lug -> Output: green green green yellow blue
- In this example, ""dax"" appears first and the output starts with ""green,"" which aligns with the previous findings. This time we also see ""walm,"" which seems to correspond to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: lug dax lug -> Output: blue green blue
- Consistent with previous examples, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" is consistent across examples. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red when it stands alone or when it follows another word. When it follows the word ""dax,"" the word ""wif"" appears to still correspond to the color red. No matter its position, ""wif"" always corresponds to red.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, it appears that every time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is the corresponding output. The other words in the inputs (lug, dax, bluf, walm, wif) are associated with their respective colors (blue, green, yellow, not specified, red), but ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in each instance.
Based on the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, we can infer the following patterns:

- The word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"" when it occurs in the first example.
- The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the output ""green.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently correlates with the output ""yellow.""

When the word ""bluf"" appears in the examples, it results in different outputs depending on the context:

- In the first example ""wif bluf dax lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which is the same as the output for ""wif.""
- In the second example ""zup bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" which matches the output for ""zup.""
- Similarly, in the fourth example ""zup bluf,"" the outcome is the same as in the second; ""bluf"" results in an output of ""yellow,"" which is the same as ""zup.""
- In the last example ""wif lug bluf wif zup,"" the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue."" This is the same output as the word ""lug"" that is immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Given these observations, it is plausible to deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" has a chameleon-like nature, taking on the color output of the word immediately before it. If it is the second word in the sequence, it repeats the color associated with the first word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. If there is no preceding word (if it is the first word in a sequence), there is no given example to determine the color; all provided examples have ""bluf"" preceded by another word.
To deduce the rules for ""walm,"" let's look at the association of inputs and outputs in each example.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Rule: The presence of ""walm"" with ""zup"" causes the word ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
Rule: ""Walm"" in the third position leads to three repetitions of ""red,"" following the color associated with ""wif.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Rule: ""Walm"" in the second position still leads to three repetitions of ""red,"" the color associated with ""wif,"" regardless of the position of ""zup.""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
Rule: ""Walm"" following ""dax"" results in three repetitions of ""green,"" the color associated with ""dax,"" and then the color associated with ""wif"" (red).

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
Rule: ""Walm"" at the end of the sequence causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it (""dax"" -> ""green""), regardless of other words present.

From these observations, it looks like ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, there's no repetition of any previous color, but instead, the repetition is based on the word right before ""walm."" So, ""walm"" seems to act as a multiplier for the color word that is immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to a single output, regardless of position or surrounding words in the input. In every instance, ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" The position of ""wif"" in the input sequence does not affect its corresponding output. When ""wif"" is paired with another word, that other word corresponds to a different color. Here are the observed pairings:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" irrespective of its position or the context in which it appears.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Looking at the given examples, the word ""bluf"" always corresponds with a specific color in the output, regardless of the surrounding words. Here are the observations:

- In the second and fourth examples, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"". This indicates that ""bluf"" translates into ""red"", the same color defined by ""wif"".
- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", and in this context, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"", the same color defined by ""dax"".
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is again preceded by ""dax"", and once more it corresponds to ""red"", the color defined by the preceding ""wif"".
- In the last example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", and in this context, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"", aligning with the color signified by ""lug"".

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will compare the inputs containing ""walm"" with their corresponding outputs.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red

From the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red""

Now let's analyze ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of three ""blue"" before ""zup"" changes the color to ""yellow."" This suggests that ""walm"" might repeat the preceding color.
- In the second example, ""walm"" converts the previous ""blue"" into three ""blue"" colors.
- In the third example, ""walm"" makes the previous ""yellow"" repeat three times before ""dax"" changes the color to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by two ""yellow"" colors, which is the color associated with ""zup.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" color three times.

Every time ""walm"" appears, the previous color is repeated three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the preceding color to repeat three times.

walm -> meaning. Rule: When ""walm"" is mentioned, it repeats the color associated with the previously mentioned word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example, regardless of the context or position within the sequence of words.
Rule: dax -> green. 

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.
Based on the provided examples, where different words correspond to different colors, it is reasonable to deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"", and ""zup"" alone translates to ""yellow"", which suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""lug zup wif lug"" translates to ""blue yellow red blue"". Since ""lug"" appears at both the beginning and the end and translates to ""blue"" at both places, and ""wif"" translates to ""red"", we can deduce that ""zup"" stands for ""yellow"" in the middle of the sequence.
- ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green"". Since we know that ""zup"" is ""yellow"", it suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow"". We know that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"", and since ""bluf"" at the end twice corresponds to ""yellow"" twice, this confirms that ""zup"" stands for ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" directly repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. 

For instance:
- ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""lug wif bluf"" yields ""blue red red,"" showing that ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif,"" which is red.
- ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow,"" reflecting that ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- ""wif dax zup bluf"" yields ""red green yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" again repeats the color for ""zup,"" yellow.
- ""dax lug wif bluf"" yields ""green blue red red,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the color for ""wif,"" red.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word as many times as the number of letters in that word.

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"" because ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""dax"" has three letters, so ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"", ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and as ""zup"" has three letters, ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In ""dax walm zup lug"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", so ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" stands alone after a word, it repeats the color corresponding to that word for as many times as there are letters in the word. With ""zup walm"", ""yellow"" is said three times, and with ""dax walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that:

- Whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- The input does not change the association between ""dax"" and ""green"" regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. wif -> red
3. wif -> red
4. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
5. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow

It appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Let's analyze the patterns provided in each input in relation to their ouputs:

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

2. Input: zup
   Output: yellow

3. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green

4. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green

5. Input: zup lug zup dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow green

Based on the examples, the word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the input sentence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow

This means that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output.
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" in the output, except when it is immediately before ""lug,"" in which case the output is ""blue."" Thus, we can deduce a general rule:

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" when followed by any word except ""lug,"" and ""blue"" when directly before ""lug.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns before and after ""walm"" in the examples provided.

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is three repetitions of ""blue"" followed by the color associated with the next word. Since ""bluf"" results in two ""red"" after the three ""blue,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" means red in this context.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is three repetitions of ""green."" It implies that ""dax"" means green, and ""walm"" somehow causes the triplication of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and we see one ""red"" for ""wif"" followed by three ""blue."" This is consistent with the rule we're formulating since ""lug"" now has a triplicate ""blue"" following it due to ""walm.""

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which results in three ""red"" followed by a ""yellow"" for ""zup."" Again, we see ""walm"" causing a triplication of the color associated with the preceding word.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Once more, ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in three ""green,"" which supports the triplication rule. After ""walm,"" we see ""wif,"" which gives us ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> triplicates the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug zup
    ",Output: green blue yellow,green blue yellow,True,142
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word correlates with a specific color. Here's the correlation as per the examples:

- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

Given that ""dax"" appears to have a one-to-one correspondence with the color green in each example where it occurs, we can deduce that:

dax -> green

Rule: dax represents the color green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color red. Each time the term ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is included in the corresponding output. The other words in the inputs seem to follow a similar pattern, where ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. The term ""bluf"" also seems to translate to the word ""red"" as seen in ""lug wif bluf"" mapping to ""blue red red"" and ""dax wif bluf"" mapping to ""green red red"". However, in the last example, ""bluf"" is translated to ""blue"" potentially because it is preceded by the term ""lug"" which aligns with the color blue.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" influences the output colors in a specific way. Each time ""zup"" is mentioned, a sequence of colors starts with yellow and continues with repeated color based on the word that directly follows ""zup"".

Let's examine the patterns:

1. zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   - ""dax"" after zup causes the following sequence to start with green (repeated for each subsequent ""walm"" or ""lug"").

2. zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""wif"" after zup causes the following sequence to start with red, repeated for the subsequent ""walm"".

3. wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" after zup causes the following sequence to start with yellow.

4. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" after zup causes the following sequence to start with yellow (since another ""bluf"" follows zup).

5. zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""lug"" after zup causes the following sequence to start with blue (repeated for each subsequent ""walm"" or ""wif"").

Therefore, ""zup"" appears to be a command word that resets the sequence colors to start with yellow, and the color that follows next (caused by the word after ""zup"") is then repeated for each subsequent word until a new color is introduced or the sequence ends.

Rule: zup -> resets the sequence to start with yellow, followed by repetitions of a color based on the next word.
Observing the given examples, we can try to understand the rule by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
2. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
4. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
5. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue

The word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color output directly preceding it. It's consistent in each example that the color before ""bluf"" is duplicated in the output when ""bluf"" is present. Therefore we can deduce a rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> meaning the same as the color word directly before it in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color outputted immediately before it. The number of repetitions seems to be two additional times, as in each case, the color preceding ""walm"" is repeated a total of three times (including the one that directly precedes ""walm"").

Here’s the breakdown of how ""walm"" works in each example:

- Example 1: ""dax lug dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue green blue blue blue"". The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", and after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated two more times, for a total of three ""blue"" in a row.
  
- Example 2: ""wif dax lug walm"" leads to ""red green blue blue blue"". The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated two more times.
  
- Example 3: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" leads to ""green green green yellow blue green"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated two more times.
  
- Example 4: ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated two more times.
  
- Example 5: ""wif lug dax walm"" leads to ""red blue green green green"". The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated two more times.

So the rule is:

walm -> Causes the last color mentioned to be repeated two more times, for a total of three consecutive mentions of that color.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the color representation of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is outputted two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow yellow yellow,green yellow yellow yellow,True,143
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems like ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue"" in the output. Here is how it breaks down:

- In the first example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" with ""lug"" again corresponding to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" Since ""walm"" seems to replicate the color ""blue"" three times, ""lug"" once again corresponds to a single instance of ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif lug dax"" translates to ""green red blue green."" Here, ""lug"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" with ""wif"" translating to ""red"" and each ""dax"" to ""green,"" so ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to the single instance of ""blue"" amidst the ""yellow"" outputs from both ""zup"" and ""walm,"" and the rest of the colors follow the patterns of their respective nonce words.

Rule: lug -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each example and the associated outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup 
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

2. Input: dax 
   Output: green

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax 
   Output: green green red yellow green

4. Input: dax lug 
   Output: green blue 

5. Input: dax zup dax zup 
   Output: green yellow green yellow

From these examples, we can try to establish a rule:

a) The word ""dax"" is always followed by the word ""green"". 

Next, let's determine the relationship with other words:

b) The word ""walm"" is followed by ""green"" as well.
   However, after ""wif,"" the color changes to ""red,"" breaking the green pattern. This indicates that ""wif"" could be a trigger for a change.

c) ""Bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" which suggests it does not alter the ""green"" output associated with ""dax.""

d) The word ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""blue,"" which indicates that ""lug"" uniquely translates to ""blue.""

e) The word ""zup"" results in a ""yellow"" hue. One can infer that the word ""zup"" itself translates to ""yellow.""

With this information, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" functions as a reset to ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"" regardless of the previous word. 

Given this pattern, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be:

dax -> the output color is reset to green. Rule: Regardless of the previous word or color, when ""dax"" appears, the output is always ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color red irrespective of its position in the input sequence. The position of ""wif"" does not affect its output, as it consistently corresponds to ""red"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input.

Hence, the rule is:

wif -> meaning: red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should focus on the patterns related to its occurrence and the associated outputs. Let's analyze the inputs and outputs together:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Here, ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also leads to ""red.""

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue

Here, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""bluf"" once again corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

Here, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" then ""zup"" again to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

If we follow the previous rules deduced, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and according to this, ""bluf"" should correspond to ""green"" again.

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Analyzing this long sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" seems to follow as another ""green,"" but at the end, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and then ""bluf"" follows as ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Assuming the other words consistently represent their respective colors (""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue), we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output. Instead, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color output of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the repetition of the color output corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf.""
Based on the examples given:

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

From the above examples, every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is a sequence of ""blue"" words. It appears to represent a repeated ""blue"" in the output. The number of times ""blue"" repeats in the output corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input sequence.

Rule:
walm -> a repetition of the color ""blue"" in the output, equal to the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,144
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" each time it appears. There is no indication that the meaning of ""lug"" changes depending on its position in the sequence or any other factors. Thus, the rule can be simply stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, each instance of ""dax"" reliably corresponds to the output ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the context provided by other words. The other words also seem to have consistent outputs: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" is less clear, but in the one example where it is given, it appears three times and matches ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might repeat the color that immediately precedes it, which in this case is blue.

The term ""bluf"" shows up once in the sequence ""dax bluf lug wif"" and the corresponding output sequence is ""green green blue red."" Since the output sequence for ""dax"" is already accounted for as ""green,"" and ""lug"" and ""wif"" respectively correspond to ""blue"" and ""red,"" it seems that ""bluf"" produces an additional ""green"" following ""dax.""

Given this information, here is the deduced meaning:

dax -> green

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. ""Dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Bluf"" seems to repeat the color that comes just before it, if ""dax"" precedes it, it also results in ""green."" ""Walm"" may repeat the color that immediately precedes it, which needs more examples to confirm.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif.""

1. When ""wif"" appears alone after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red.""
   - Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red

2. When ""wif"" starts the sequence and is followed by ""zup lug zup lug,"" the output sequence starts with ""red"" and continues with the pattern ""yellow blue yellow blue.""
   - Input: wif zup lug zup lug -> Output: red yellow blue yellow blue

3. When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red"" followed by ""red green green green.""
   - Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green

4. The same input as the first example gives the same output, confirming the pattern.
   - Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red

5. When ""wif"" is preceded by ""dax bluf"" and followed by ""zup lug,"" the output after ""wif"" is ""red"" which is followed by the pattern that corresponds to ""zup lug.""
   - Input: dax bluf wif zup lug -> Output: green green red yellow blue

From these observations, we can determine that the word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. The other words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" seem to have their own color associations that are independent of the word ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears twice and is translated to ""yellow"" both times, with other words in the sequence representing different colors.
- In the second example, ""zup"" by itself is translated to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" appears alongside ""bluf,"" which is translated twice to ""red,"" while ""zup"" still translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and is translated to ""red,"" while ""zup"" remains ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" appears after a sequence of other colors and is again translated to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" the color associated with ""bluf"" is green:
   - ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> green green blue red

2. When ""bluf"" is used alone after ""zup,"" the associated color is yellow:
   - ""zup bluf"" -> yellow yellow

3. When ""bluf"" follows a repeating pattern of ""zup lug,"" the associated color is yellow:
   - ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

4. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" after an initial ""zup,"" the associated color is still yellow:
   - ""zup bluf lug zup"" -> yellow yellow blue yellow

5. When ""bluf"" appears after a sequence of ""dax zup,"" the associated color is yellow:
   - ""dax zup bluf"" -> green yellow yellow

Based on these patterns, we can conclude that ""bluf"" consistently associates with the color yellow regardless of the previous word(s). The varying word before ""bluf"" does not seem to affect this pattern.

Rule: bluf -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns of its use across different examples.

Looking at the examples:

1. zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

2. wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

3. wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

4. lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

5. dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

The word immediately preceding ""walm"" in each input directly influences the color repetition in the output. Specifically:

- In example 1, ""zup"" is yellow, and following ""walm,"" the output has three additional yellows.
- In example 2, ""lug"" is blue, and following ""walm,"" there are three blues.
- In example 3, ""wif"" is red, and following ""walm,"" there are two additional reds (three in total).
- In example 4, ""lug"" again leads to three blue outputs after ""walm.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" is green, and following ""walm,"" there are two additional greens (three in total).

From this, it's reasonable to deduce that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in total in the output. Note that in every case, the color mentioned before ""walm"" repeats such that there are three instances of that color following the initial occurrence. Therefore, ""walm"" may mean something like ""repeat the previous color twice more.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word two more times for a total of three instances of that color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,145
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" seems consistent:

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: lug
Output: blue

In every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in all given examples.
zup -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the word ""zup"" seems consistently associated with the color ""yellow"".

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
Analyzing the provided examples:

1. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
2. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green

Observations:
- The word prior to ""bluf"" is the same as the color output following ""bluf"". 
- ""bluf"" does not correspond to a specific color, but instead seems to duplicate the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the output color to be the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". 

So, bluf -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.
To deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""walm"", let's examine the patterns in the provided input-output pairs. We'll look for consistencies in the transformation from input to output that involve ""walm.""

1. Input: lug walm dax 
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" to green. ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that precedes it.

2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow. Again, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that precedes it.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Once more, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that precedes it with ""wif"" represented as red and an extra ""blue"" at the end, which could correspond to a non-listed ""bluf"" word.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Yet again, we notice that after ""walm,"" the color blue repeats.

5. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   Here, ""walm"" seems to cause the color green to repeat after ""dax"" and before ""wif.""

From the observed patterns, the rule that emerges is that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each word maps to a specific color. The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" in each example, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here are the mappings observed:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue

Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze how the output colors correspond to the inputs:

1. Every time ""wif"" precedes another word, the output is ""red"" for ""wif"" and another color for the subsequent word.
2. The color that follows ""wif"" depends on the word that comes after ""wif.""

Let's look for patterns based on the ""wif"" positioning:

- ""wif walm"" -> red red
- ""wif lug"" -> red blue
- ""wif dax"" -> red green
- ""wif bluf"" -> red red
- ""wif zup"" -> red yellow

""Wif"" itself seems consistent with the output ""red."" However, the words after ""wif"" have different colors when they appear in a different context without ""wif"":

- ""dax"" -> green when not preceded by ""wif""
- ""lug"" -> blue when not preceded by ""wif""
- ""bluf"" -> green when not preceded by ""wif""
- ""zup"" -> yellow when not preceded by ""wif""

When these words are preceded by ""wif,"" they produce different colors:

- ""wif dax"" -> red green (though ""dax"" retains green)
- ""wif lug"" -> red blue (consistent)
- ""wif bluf"" -> red red (changes from green to red)
- ""wif zup"" -> red yellow (consistent)

Given that ""wif"" consistently results in ""red,"" and the second word color seems to change only in the presence of ""wif,"" we may induce that ""wif"" is a function that modifies the color output associated with the word that follows it, with some words retaining their color and others changing.

However, based on the information provided, it is not entirely clear how ""wif"" modifies the subsequent color since there's not a consistent rule for every word following ""wif."" There isn't enough information to determine a complete rule set, but we can draw a preliminary conclusion for ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" outputs ""red"" and may alter the color association of the following word.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's look carefully at the given examples and their corresponding outputs. We will look for patterns that can help us infer the rule behind ""zup.""

Here are the examples provided with their outputs:

1. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
2. zup lug -> yellow blue
3. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
4. dax wif zup -> green red yellow
5. zup lug -> yellow blue

Now let’s analyze the patterns:

- When ""dax"" is present, the output starts with ""green.""
- When ""walm"" is present, consecutive sequences of ""blue"" are translated to the same number of ""green"" followed by ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" is present, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red.""
- When ""zup"" is present, it precedes a switch to a new color in the pattern, adding ""yellow"" to the output before the color changes.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""zup"":

Rule: ""zup"" indicates an impending change in the color sequence, transitioning with the color ""yellow.""

Given this rule, we can now write out the meaning of ""zup"":

zup -> indicates a color change to the next color, initiated with ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf -> the color of the following word.

Explanation: In each example, when the word 'bluf' appears, the output is the color that corresponds to the word that follows 'bluf'. For instance:

- In ""wif bluf,"" 'wif' is translated to 'red' and since 'bluf' indicates we should repeat the color of 'wif', the output is ""red red"".
- In ""dax bluf zup,"" 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'bluf' makes us repeat 'green', and 'zup' translates to 'yellow', producing ""green green yellow"".
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" 'zup' is 'yellow', 'bluf' repeats the color of the next word which is 'wif' ('red'), and 'walm' again corresponds to 'red', yielding ""yellow yellow red red red"".
- In ""dax bluf wif zup lug,"" the pattern follows with 'dax' translating to 'green', 'bluf' indicating a repetition of the color of 'wif' ('red'), 'zup' being 'yellow', and 'lug' corresponding to 'blue', resulting in ""green green red yellow blue"".
- Lastly, in ""dax bluf zup bluf dax,"" 'dax' is 'green', 'bluf' repeats the color of 'zup' ('yellow'), and the second 'bluf' repeats the color of the next 'dax' ('green'), giving us ""green green yellow yellow green"".

Therefore, bluf -> repeats the color of the following word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the given examples:

1. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
2. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> Output: green green green yellow blue green
3. ""dax zup walm wif"" -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
4. ""dax lug walm"" -> Output: green blue blue blue
5. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

In each instance, we can see the following patterns:

- The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.
- ""zup"" is always followed by the color yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Analyzing the context in which ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs, it becomes clear that ""walm"" always results in repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. For instance, in the first example, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" implying that a single ""lug"" results in one blue, and ""walm"" creates two additional blues.

By applying the same logic to other examples, we can reinforce this rule:

- In example 2, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color (green) twice.
- In example 4, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" again, ""walm"" repeats the preceding color (blue) twice.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color of the word before it two times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm
    ",Output: red red red,red red red,True,147
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word (including the nonce word ""dax"") corresponds to a specific color. The output colors are consistent for each word irrespective of their position in the input sequence. Given this information, the following rules can be deduced:

Rule:
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue
- wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the word ""zup"" and the color ""yellow"" in the output, with ""zup"" always resulting in ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to discern the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the pattern of the colors that correspond to the words that precede and follow it.

In the first example, every instance of ""zup"" translates to yellow and every ""lug"" to blue. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow, but when it follows ""lug,"" the output is blue.

The second example shows ""bluf"" following ""wif,"" resulting in red, the same color as ""wif."" 

The third example has ""bluf"" following ""lug,"" and the output is blue again, the same as ""lug.""

The fourth example includes ""bluf"" following ""zup,"" with the output being yellow, the same as ""zup,"" and preceding ""dax,"" which is green (since ""bluf"" does not affect the output of ""dax,"" which follows).

The fifth example is simply ""lug"" followed by ""bluf,"" and both output blue.

From these examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" doubles the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> Doubles the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, it defaults to yellow.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is used after multiple words with associated colors, the sequence of colors is repeated with an extra iteration for each color, in the order they appear.
- ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- ""dax"" is associated with green.
- ""wif"" is associated with red.
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow.
- ""bluf"" is not demonstrated in the examples, but following the pattern, it can be inferred to repeat the color once. 

For example:
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"", this shows that dax (green) gets one iteration and lug (blue) gets three iterations.
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""green red yellow yellow red red red"". This shows an extra iteration for each preceding color word in the sequence they appear.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,148
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" can be mapped to the color ""blue.""

The outputs are consistent whenever the input includes ""lug,"" regardless of the other words present:

- When the input is ""lug wif,"" the output is ""blue red.""
- When the input includes ""dax lug,"" the output contains ""green blue.""
- When the input is ""lug zup lug,"" the output is ""blue yellow blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" appears twice as ""blue.""
- Even when the input has three components, ""dax lug wif,"" the output is ""green blue red,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Considering the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green"" regardless of its position within the sequence. Here's a breakdown of how ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" within each example:

1. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" appears at the beginning and translates to ""green"".

2. dax zup dax zup -> green yellow green yellow
   - ""dax"" appears at the beginning and in the middle, and in both cases corresponds to ""green"".

3. dax lug wif lug -> green blue red blue
   - ""dax"" appears at the beginning and translates to ""green"".

4. lug dax lug -> blue green blue
   - ""dax"" appears in the middle and translates to ""green"".

5. dax -> green
   - ""dax"" is standalone and translates to ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in each example.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Here, ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" again seems to correspond to ""red.""

Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green

""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" The order is preserved.

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red

Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" seems to lead to ""red"" (although we don't have an example of ""bluf"" in isolation to confirm), and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red

""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

Each example consistently shows that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" There's no variation in the output no matter where ""wif"" is placed in the input sequence, suggesting that ""wif"" has a direct, context-independent mapping to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> ""red""

Analyzing the examples given and the corresponding outputs:

Input: wif walm dax zup   
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: wif zup   
Output: red yellow

Input: zup wif   
Output: yellow red

Input: zup bluf wif walm   
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: lug zup dax wif   
Output: blue yellow green red

1. When ""zup"" is the last word in the input, the output color is yellow. However, when ""zup"" is followed by another word, the output color is green. This suggests ""zup"" represents yellow when it's at the end of an input, and green when not at the end.

2. ""zup"" itself seems not to represent a static color but rather changes based on its position in the list.

3. Other words seem to have consistent color outputs (e.g., ""wif"" -> red, ""walm"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue).

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: ""zup"" outputs yellow when it occurs at the end of the sequence. If ""zup"" is followed by other words, it outputs green. 

In conclusion:

zup -> yellow when last in sequence; green when followed by other words
Analyzing the provided examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Here's what we know from the inputs and outputs:

1. ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" -> ""green green yellow yellow green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both at the beginning and the end.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""bluf"" appears twice, and each time it is followed by the color corresponding to the next word.

2. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red"", the same as ""wif"".

3. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at both ends.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red"", the same as ""wif"".

4. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output is ""red"", the same as ""wif"".

5. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow"", the same as ""zup"".

From these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the output by producing a sequence of the color ""yellow."" The number of times ""yellow"" is repeated corresponds to the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence. Each word in the input appears to correspond to a specific color in the output.

Let's analyze the occurrence of ""walm"" in the provided examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""walm"" appears second and last (sixth) in the input, resulting in three yellows after it (since it's the last word in the sequence) and two yellows after the first ""walm.""

2. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   ""Walm"" appears fourth, producing three yellows after it.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""Walm"" appears second, resulting in two yellows after it.

4. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" appears sixth, resulting in three yellows after it.

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   ""Walm"" appears second, and one yellow is expected after it, but since ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" it seems the presence of another word (wif) after ""walm"" changes the pattern, and ""walm"" does not produce yellows after it.

With these observations, we can deduce a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is at the end of the input, it produces n-1 yellows where n is the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. However, if another word follows ""walm,"" the expected sequence of yellows is not produced.

Based on the rule induction, the meaning of ""walm"" in the context can be stated as:

walm -> meaning: A command that typically results in a pattern of ""yellow"" outputs corresponding to its position in the input string unless followed by another word which stops the pattern.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: green green,yellow green,False,149
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug means ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will analyze the patterns given in the examples:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears by itself or is the first word in a sequence, the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is followed by different words such as ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""walm,"" the sequence affects the output. It seems ""dax"" does not change the meaning of the words that come after it, but rather each word is directly translated to a color:
    - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
    - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
    - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
    - ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""
- When ""dax"" is repeated in the input, the corresponding output remains ""green"" for all instances of ""dax.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green,"" independent of its position or the context in which it appears. Other words in the sequence are translated to their corresponding colors.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs, focusing on the positioning and appearance of ""wif"" and the corresponding colors in the outputs.

In the first example:
Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

""lug"" consistently correlates to ""blue"" (as seen in all other examples), but here ""wif"" directly correlates to ""red"" without any other words for context.

In the second example:
Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue

""bluf"" correlates to ""red"", ""dax"" correlates to ""green"", and ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"". Again, ""wif"" occurs at the start, followed by ""bluf"", and translates to ""red"".

In the third example:
Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" also to ""yellow"". ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and translates to ""red"". 

In the fourth example:
Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Here ""wif"" is not at the beginning; ""zup"" and ""lug"" precede it, translating to ""yellow"" and ""blue"" as before. After ""wif"", ""walm"" is repeated three times, with each instance producing ""red"".

In the fifth example:
Input: dax wif lug dax
Output: green red blue green

""lug"" correlates to ""blue"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""lug"", and ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

In all examples, no matter where ""wif"" appears in the sequence, it translates to ""red"". This suggests that ""wif"" itself translates to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we should analyze the input and corresponding output in each example to identify patterns:

- Input: wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow
- Input: wif zup | Output: red yellow
- Input: zup lug | Output: yellow blue
- Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup | Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
- Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow

Analyzing the information:

1. When ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow"" after the ""red"" that corresponds to ""wif.""
2. When ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" it follows ""red"" (corresponding to ""walm""), producing another ""yellow.""
3. When ""zup"" comes before ""lug,"" it corresponds to ""yellow"" before ""blue"" (which is the output for ""lug"").
4. When ""zup"" comes after ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow"" following ""yellow"" (which corresponds to ""bluf"").
5. No matter what precedes or follows ""zup,"" its corresponding output is always ""yellow.""

Considering these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns before and after the word appears in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. In the first input-output pair, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow."" Here ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Since ""bluf"" appears between two words that repeat (in this case ""lug"" and ""wif"") and result in the output ""blue blue,"" it seems like bluf might be repeating the color that comes before it.

2. In the second input-output pair, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red."" Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is again ""blue."" When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" the output is still ""blue."" It once again seems to repeat the color before it, irrespective of what comes after.

3. The third input-output pair, ""dax walm wif bluf,"" translates to ""green green green red red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows a ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output once again has ""red"" after ""bluf.""

4. In the fourth input-output pair, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" and ""lug"" directly corresponds to ""blue"" in the fifth input-output pair (""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue""). Given these instances, ""bluf"" is simply repeating the color that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf means to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.

bluf -> repeat preceding color word.
Analyzing the examples provided for patterns in relation to the word ""walm"" and its corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   
3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   
4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   
5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

Based on the input and output patterns, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be associated with repeating the color of the word(s) immediately prior to ""walm"" the number of times equal to the total number of words that came before ""walm"" plus one (including ""walm"" itself in the count). 

For example:
- In input 1, before ""walm,"" there are five words, and ""walm"" is the sixth word. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated six times.
- In input 2, ""walm"" is the second and fourth words. ""Dax"" comes once before the first ""walm"" (green is repeated twice), and ""wif"" comes before the second ""walm"" (red is repeated three times).
- In input 3, ""walm"" is the seventh word; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""red"" is repeated seven times.
- In input 4, ""walm"" is the third word; ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" hence ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In input 5, ""walm"" is the second word; ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""blue"" is repeated twice.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word a number of times equal to the number of words present before ""walm"" inclusive.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,150
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". In each instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
To induce the rule for the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the examples provided and look for patterns. We will examine each instance of ""dax"" and the corresponding color in the Output:

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
- Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and both lead to a ""green"" output.

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue
- In this context, ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""

Input: zup dax zup lug
Output: yellow green yellow blue
- Again, ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""

Input: dax wif dax
Output: green red green
- Here, ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds with ""green"" both times.

In each example where ""dax"" is used, the output is consistently ""green."" Thus, the rule seems quite straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to have a consistent translation, while the translation of other words changes depending on context.

The output for ""wif"" on its own is ""red,"" so for all occurrences, ""wif"" is translated to ""red.""

wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, we can see a pattern that correlates each nonce word with a color. Here's what we can deduce:

1. Every time the word ""zup"" appears, the output contains ""yellow.""
2. When the word ""lug"" appears, the output contains ""blue.""
3. The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
4. ""Bluf"" doesn't have a direct translation in the provided examples, but appears in conjunction with ""zup,"" and there is no change to the color that ""zup"" represents.
5. ""Walm"" also doesn't have a direct translation in the examples, but when it appears with ""zup,"" it seems to repeat the output for ""zup.""

Based on these observations, we can form the following rule:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, each instance of a nonce word translates to a specific color, and the sequence of colors appears to follow a pattern. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's break down each example and look for the corresponding patterns:

1 - zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
The word ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" and ""dax"" by ""green.""

2 - zup bluf -> yellow yellow
""dax"" and ""wif"" are absent here, and we observe that both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow.""

3 - zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""zup"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""yellow.""

4 - lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
In this example, we again see that ""lug"" equals ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" equates to the color preceding it, which in this case is ""blue."" However, this seems to contradict the earlier observation where ""bluf"" corresponded to ""yellow.""

5 - zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
Here, ""walm"" does not have a direct color equivalent, but rather seems to be a repetition of the color of the preceding word, which is ""yellow"" from ""zup."" The word ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" follows with ""red,"" which is the color that follows ""lug"" in the second sequence.

Given the patterns revealed through each example, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color that precedes it, when the previous word is not a new color word. If ""bluf"" follows a new color word like ""lug"" or ""dax,"" it takes the color that typically follows that new color word (e.g., after ""lug,"" the next color is ""green,"" and after ""dax,"" the next color is ""red""). Therefore, ""bluf"" represents a repeat or continuation of the current color sequence.

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the preceding color when not following a new color word, but when following a new color word, it assumes the color that typically follows that new color word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the corresponding outputs for each appearance of the word ""walm"" in the inputs given and try to identify patterns or rules.

Looking at the first example: 

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

""walm"" corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.

In the second example: 

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

""walm"" corresponds to the last ""red"" in the output.

In the third example: 

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

""walm"" corresponds to the second and the seventh ""red"" in the output.

In the fourth example:

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

""walm"" corresponds to the second ""red"" and the last ""yellow"" in the output. This is the first variation to the pattern; ""walm"" previously corresponded exclusively to ""red.""

In the fifth example:

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

""walm"" corresponds to the third ""red"" in the output.

Given that ""walm"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" except in one instance where it also corresponds to ""yellow,"" we might assume that ""walm"" signifies the color red, but further context or examples could be necessary to understand why ""walm"" corresponded to ""yellow"" in the fourth example. Without additional information, it's difficult to determine if ""yellow"" is an anomaly or part of a more complex rule.

Rule:
- In general, ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- There may be a conditional factor in the fourth example that changed its corresponding output to ""yellow,"" but with the information provided, we cannot clearly define this condition.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

    Input: lug zup walm dax lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be the following:

lug -> blue

Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""dax"" is presented, it is translated as the color ""green.""
Based on the available examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
Considering the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. When ""zup"" is an input, ""yellow"" appears at the same position in the output. Thereby, we can deduce that zup translates to yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red when preceded by wif (or a preceding color would be red), yellow when preceded by zup (or a preceding color would be yellow), blue when preceded by lug (or a preceding color would be blue), and green when preceded by dax (or a preceding color would be green).

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word that precedes it, taking on the color that the preceding word represents. If ""wif"" is the preceding word, ""bluf"" means ""red"". If ""zup"" precedes it, then ""bluf"" means ""yellow"". If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", it means ""blue"", and if it follows ""dax"", ""bluf"" means ""green"".
walm -> meaning. Meaning is likely a repeated color dependent on the context. 

Rule: The word preceding ""walm"" determines the color to be repeated three times. ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""wif"" to red. If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the associated color is green repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup wif dax
    ",Output: red yellow red green,red yellow red green,True,152
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it is possible to deduce the meaning of the word ""lug."" Each example shows the word ""lug"" being used in a sequence with its corresponding output in terms of colors.

Looking closely at the input and output sequences, we can see that every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output.

Here are the specific examples as evidence:

- Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif / Output: blue green green yellow blue red
- Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm / Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- Input: dax lug / Output: green blue
- Input: lug zup / Output: blue yellow
- Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug / Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

Every single occurrence of lug corresponds directly with the output color blue. There is no example where lug corresponds with any other color.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let us look at each example to identify patterns that correlate with the color outputs.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Looking at the outputs associated with ""dax,"" we see that every time ""dax"" appears in an input, the corresponding output is ""green."" It is also important to observe that the color output depends on the position of ""dax"" when combined with other words. When ""dax"" appears first, it is followed by ""green;"" when it appears last or in other positions, it is also followed by ""green.""

Now, analyzing the combination with other words:

- ""zup"" yields ""yellow"" when combined with ""dax"" but ""green"" does not change, indicating that ""zup"" is not affecting ""dax's"" associated color.
- ""bluf"" yields ""yellow"" when it is in combination with ""zup"" but yields ""green"" when presented with ""dax"" alone.
- Different words like ""lug"" and ""walm"" yield ""blue,"" while ""wif"" yields ""red,"" which shows that different words have their own corresponding colors, but ""dax"" consistently correlates with ""green.""

Given this information, it appears that the meaning of ""dax"" is not dependent on context or combination with other words, as it produces the same output each time.

Rule: dax -> green. This suggests that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of the context or its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Here are the corresponding translations:

1. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
2. zup lug bluf wif -> yellow blue blue red
3. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red
4. dax lug wif -> green blue red
5. dax wif -> green red

In each case, ""wif"" is directly translated to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" seems to be translated differently in each instance. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the input-output pairs:

1. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue

2. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

3. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

4. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red

5. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green

When trying to understand the rule for ""bluf,"" let's look at each position it takes in the input and its corresponding output:

1. In example 1, ""bluf"" is positioned after ""dax"" and translates to ""green,"" which is the same translation as ""dax.""

2. In example 2, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and is translated to ""red,"" which is also the translation of ""wif.""

3. In example 3, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and is translated to ""yellow,"" following the pattern, it is the same as the translation for ""zup.""

4. In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and is translated to ""blue,"" which again matches the translation for ""lug.""

5. In example 5, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""dax"" and is translated to ""yellow,"" which is the same as ""zup"" and not ""dax.""

Summarizing these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the word preceding it. If the word before ""bluf"" is translated to a color, ""bluf"" takes on that same color.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the previous word to repeat its output color. For instance:

- In example 1, ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""zup"" (yellow) is repeated twice after ""walm"" before the next ""lug"" (blue).
- In example 2, ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue"". ""Dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated two more times.
- In example 3, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". Here, ""lug"" (blue) is repeated twice after ""walm"".
- In example 4, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" (blue) is repeated twice after ""walm"".
- In example 5, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". Similarly, ""dax"" (green) is repeated twice after ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding word's corresponding output color to be repeated two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue blue blue,yellow yellow blue blue blue,True,153
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" across all examples provided.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to deduce a rule or pattern from the given inputs and outputs. Let's analyze the position and corresponding output color of ""dax"" in each input:

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - ""dax"" appears first and is green, but when it appears again at the end, it's associated with red.

2. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - The single appearance of ""dax"" at the end is green.

3. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   - ""dax"" is first and is green.

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""dax"" is first and is green.

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" is first and is green.

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:

- ""dax"" alone or at the beginning of a sequence is green.
- ""dax"" when repeated in a sequence turns red.

Now, let's refine the rule considering that in every input where ""dax"" appears without repetition, it's always green, regardless of its position. But when ""dax"" is repeated, it is green the first time and red the second time.

Considering this pattern, it's probable that ""dax"" being green indicates the first occurrence, and ""dax"" being red indicates a repeated occurrence within the same sequence. However, we don't have enough data to determine the colors associated with other words, or what if ""dax"" occurs more than twice.

Rule: ""dax"" -> first occurrence in a sequence is green, and the second (repeated) occurrence in the same sequence is red.
Based on the provided input-output pairs, it looks like the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Every time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears at the corresponding position in the output. The other words seem to have consistent color translations as well: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" However, ""zup"" has only appeared before ""wif,"" so its translation is uncertain, but based on the pattern, it may be ""yellow.""

Here is the rule based on the above observations:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" has a consistent representation in the output:

1. In the first example, every time ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
2. In the second example, the sequence starts with ""zup"" and is followed by ""yellow"" in the output.
3. The third example has ""zup"" alone and the output is ""yellow"".
4. The fourth example starts with ""zup"" and is followed by ""yellow"" in the output.
5. The fifth example both starts and ends with ""zup"", and the output starts and ends with ""yellow"".

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the appearance of ""zup"" in the input and ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the context.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Analyzing the given examples, we can try to infer the meaning of ""bluf.""

1. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

3. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue

From examples 2 and 4 which are identical, we can conclude that ""wif bluf"" consistently results in ""red red."" This suggests ""bluf"" does not change the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.

In examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""dax,"" which are associated with the colors yellow and green, respectively. After ""bluf"" is introduced, the pattern of colors continues but with ""yellow"" repeated after ""zup"" and ""red"" repeated after ""wif.""

In example 5, ""lug"" is added to the input after ""wif bluf."" This results in ""blue"" being added to the output. This suggests that ""bluf"" itself does not change the output, but allows for the output of the next word (in this case, ""lug"") to show up in the output sequence.

Taking all of this into account, ""bluf"" most likely signifies a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. If there is a word after ""bluf,"" then it seems to proceed with the color associated with that word.

Rule: bluf -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated in the output. If there is a subsequent word, continue with the color associated with it.
Based on the provided examples, walm appears to be associated with repeating the color word that comes immediately before it, three times.

So, for the given examples:
1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', followed by walm which results in 'yellow' being repeated three times.

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - Each word corresponds to a color and the last word 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'. Given walm comes after, 'yellow' is repeated three times.

3. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - Each word corresponds to a color and the last word 'wif' corresponds to 'red'. Given walm comes after, 'red' is repeated three times.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and is followed by walm, hence 'red' is repeated three times, unaffected by the subsequent words 'dax' and 'zup'.

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - It is not clear what 'bluf' means since it doesn't translate to any new information in the output, but 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and when followed by walm causes 'red' to be repeated three times.

Thus, the rule appears to be that 'walm' causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

1. When ""lug"" is present by itself or is the first word, it is translated to a single ""blue.""
2. When ""lug"" follows another word, it still translates to ""blue,"" but the presence of another word such as ""zup"" before it leads to a translation of ""yellow"" for that preceding word.
3. ""lug"" does not seem to impact the translation of other words that follow it, as seen in example 2 with ""wif bluf"" translating to ""red red"" irrespective of the presence of ""lug.""

Therefore, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position within the sequence. Other words in the sequence, such as ""zup,"" translate to other colors, but ""lug"" remains the same. 

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

The provided examples consistently show that when the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This consistent one-to-one mapping across all examples suggests that ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Here's the reasoning:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", since they map consistently to these colors in different positions as well.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"", as shown by their consistent mapping.

The rule is that each nonce word in the input is systematically associated with a specific color in the output. Thus, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all the given examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the output repeating the color word that immediately precedes it.

Examples to support the rule:
- In ""lug bluf"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" results in another ""blue"".
- In ""zup dax bluf"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""bluf"" results in another ""green"".
- In ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""bluf"" results in another ""red"", following which ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", so ""walm"" also results in ""green"".
- In ""zup bluf lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow"".
- In ""wif bluf lug"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""bluf"" results in another ""red"".

Thus, bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be summarized as: ""Repeat the color word immediately preceding 'bluf' in the output.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the examples given and look for patterns that correspond with the occurrence of the word ""walm."" 

Looking at the first example:
- Input: dax wif walm lug zup
- Output: green red red red blue yellow

In this example, ""walm"" is associated with three ""red"" colors in the output.

Moving on to the second example:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" is associated with two extra ""yellow"" colors.

Now, the third example:
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
- Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

In this example, ""walm"" follows a sequence that results in two additional ""blue"" outputs.

Following with the fourth example:
- Input: lug walm
- Output: blue blue blue

Again, ""walm"" is associated with two extra ""blue"" outputs.

Lastly, the fifth example:
- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
- Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Here, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of three ""red"" outputs. 

By analyzing the patterns:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, it is followed by multiple outputs of the same color immediately after.
2. The number of repeated colors corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm.""
3. The colors corresponding to the words are:
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""bluf"" -> blue (from the third example)

Therefore, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the color of the previous word to be repeated multiple times. The exact number is not directly given, but it appears to be at least two repetitions based on these examples.

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the previous word to be repeated multiple times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each instance it is used.
Considering the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output position. Here are the observations:

Input: wif dax wif lug wif
Output: red green red blue red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The word ""wif"" before and after ""dax"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:
Rule: dax -> green.
Analyzing the provided input-output pairs, there is a pattern that emerges for the word ""wif.""

1. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red
2. dax wif walm -> green red red red
3. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
4. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
5. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue

From the examples, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" There doesn't seem to be a context-dependent rule that shifts the meaning of ""wif."" It is a color independent of the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- 'zup' leads to 'yellow', as does 'bluf'.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- 'zup' leads to 'yellow' and 'wif' to 'red'.

Input: zup wif zup
Output: yellow red yellow
- 'zup' is consistently leading to 'yellow', and 'wif' to 'red'.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
- 'lug' is 'blue', 'wif' is 'red'. 'dax' is likely 'green' because it precedes two 'green' outputs, and 'walm' contributes to the continuation of 'green'. 'zup' at the end yields 'yellow'.

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
- 'lug' is 'blue', 'walm' is also leading to 'blue', and the single occurrence of 'zup' produces 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow

The word 'zup' consistently maps to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" influences the output color sequence. After examining the examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" always results in ""blue"" and an additional color determined by the word preceding ""bluf."" Specifically, the color associated with the word immediately before ""bluf"" is repeated. For example, if the word before ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which correlates to ""blue,"" then the output will contain ""blue blue.""

Here are the observed correlations for the words and colors:
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red

In the given data, ""bluf"" always follows another word, and that preceding word repeats its color followed by ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to represent a rule that means ""repeat the previous color, then blue.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the word before bluf, then blue.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to change the output colors to all be the same color as the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, until a different non-""walm"" word appears that changes the color sequence.

For instance:
- ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow,"" with ""walm"" continuing the red from ""wif"" until ""dax"" changes it to green, and ""zup"" finally changes it to yellow.
- ""dax walm wif dax"" shows ""green green green red green,"" with ""walm"" causing the continuation of green after ""dax,"" until ""wif"" changes it to red.
- ""zup lug walm"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue"" because ""walm"" extends the blue from ""lug.""
- ""dax walm"" has ""green green green"" because ""walm"" repeats the green from ""dax.""
- ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow"" because ""walm"" extends the blue from ""lug"" until ""zup"" changes it to yellow.

Rule: walm -> changes the output to repeat the color of the word preceding it until a new word with a different associated color follows.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in all provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context or surrounding words. 

Let's break down the examples:

- In the first example, the input ""wif"" alone results in the output ""red"".

- In the second example, the input ""dax wif"" results in ""green red"". Here, ""dax"" can be inferred to mean ""green"", while ""wif"" remains ""red"".

- In the third example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"". We can surmise that ""zup"" means ""yellow"", and ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".

- The fourth example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"", results in ""red blue blue red yellow"". We see that ""wif"" leads to ""red"" in two instances within the same input. ""lug"" and ""bluf"" each translate to ""blue"", and ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow"".

- In the last example, ""wif walm zup"" correlates with ""red red red yellow"". It is established that ""zup"" equals ""yellow"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". ""walm"" in this case seems to be redundant or has no meaning because it is translated to ""red"" which is the meaning for ""wif"". So, ""wif"" here keeps its meaning and ""walm"" is assumed to either emphasize the meaning of ""wif"" or carry no meaning of its own.

From these observations, the rule we can induce is:

wif -> meaning. Meaning: red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in all given contexts.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". We can see that whenever ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. Here is the breakdown based on the given examples:

- ""zup lug"" yields ""yellow blue""; ""lug"" must mean ""blue"".
- ""lug walm zup"" yields ""blue blue blue yellow""; ""walm"" seems to be repeated for ""blue"".
- ""zup lug walm"" yields ""yellow blue blue blue""; this aligns with the previous conclusions.
- ""zup dax bluf"" yields ""yellow green green""; ""dax"" likely means ""green"", and ""bluf"" might be a repeat or intensifier for ""green"".
- ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" yields ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""; ""wif"" means ""red"", reinforcing that ""walm"" and ""lug"" are ""blue"".

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> red, if the preceding word is wif; bluf -> green, if the preceding word is dax; bluf -> yellow, if the preceding word is zup. If bluf appears with no other context (as in ""dax bluf"" or ""wif bluf""), it takes on the color of the word before it.
From the given examples, we can induce that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the list. In each instance, the output color is repeated the number of times ""walm"" is used. 

Here is how the rule plays out in the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and since ""walm"" follows it, ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color blue three times (""yellow"" comes from ""zup"").
  
- In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" follows, which means ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times.
  
- In the third example, ""wif"" is associated with red, so ""walm"" repeats the color red twice.
  
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color blue twice, followed by ""wif"" associated with red, then ""zup"" with yellow, and another ""wif"" with red.
  
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" repeats the color green twice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif lug walm zup
    ",Output: red green red blue blue blue yellow,red green red blue blue blue yellow,True,157
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: 'lug' in each example corresponds to the color 'blue'.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a direct correlation between the nonce word ""dax"" and a color. In each given input, whenever ""dax"" appears, the output always contains ""green"".

Here's how it maps out:

- ""zup dax lug dax"" corresponds with ""yellow green blue green"". ""Dax"" aligns with ""green"".
- ""dax wif"" aligns with ""green red"". ""Dax"" is the first word and aligns with ""green"".
- ""dax zup"" corresponds with ""green yellow"". ""Dax"" again aligns with ""green"".
- ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow green yellow green red red"". Each instance of ""dax"" aligns with ""green"".
- ""wif dax zup wif"" corresponds with ""red green yellow red"". ""Dax"" aligns with ""green"".

These observations confirm the rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output contains the color ""red."" Additionally, ""lug"" seems to consistently translate to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Here are the interpreted translations:

- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""bluf"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow

Taking the consistent appearance of the color red for ""wif"" into account, we can determine that:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that:

- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""
- Other words in the input (such as ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug"") translate to different colors (""green,"" ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively). The word ""zup"" does not change its output due to the position in the list or surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word 'bluf' repeatedly leads to the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it in the input. Here is the analysis of the outputs matching the inputs:

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", indicating that 'bluf' caused 'wif' (red) to be repeated.
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", showing that 'bluf' repeated the word 'lug' (blue).
- ""dax wif bluf"" becomes ""green red red"", which indicates 'bluf' repeated 'wif' (red).
- ""zup lug bluf wif"" leads to ""yellow blue blue red"", again 'bluf' repeated 'lug' (blue), not affecting the word 'wif' that follows it.
- ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" turns into ""red blue blue red yellow"", showing that 'bluf' caused 'lug' (blue) to repeat, but did not affect the following 'wif' (red).

Based on these observations, the rule is that 'bluf' causes the color word that directly precedes it to be repeated once in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we can analyze how it is translated into an output color in each input/output example.

1. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""
   Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"".

2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
   Here, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue"".

3. ""wif walm zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
   In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red"". But a ""walm"" that follows a ""zup"" turns to ""yellow"".

4. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and thus corresponds to ""yellow"".

5. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
   ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue"" again.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the meaning of ""walm"" depends on the word that precedes it:
- If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" then it translates to ""red.""
- If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" then it translates to ""yellow.""
- If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" then it translates to ""blue.""
- There's no example following ""dax,"" so we can't induce the meaning for that scenario from the given examples. 

Rule: ""walm"" changes its meaning based on the preceding word. Following ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" following ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and following ""lug"" leads to ""blue.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup wif
    ",Output: blue green yellow red,blue green yellow red,True,158
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to determine the meaning or the rule that defines the nonce word ""lug.""

- In the first example, ""lug zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green green green."" We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow whenever it appears, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""Walm"" seems to correspond to green in this instance as well, but we have no additional examples of ""walm"" to confirm this.
- In the second example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green blue red red."" We already know ""dax"" is green, and ""wif"" and ""bluf"" are red.
- In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" Here, both ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to yellow. Since ""wif"" is red, we can presume ""lug"" is the blue between ""yellow"" and ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue green."" Both ""zup"" and ""dax"" keep their previous associations of yellow and green, respectively.
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""green green red blue."" We see that ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" and ""wif"" are red, and ""lug"" appears as blue here as it does elsewhere.

By examining each instance where ""lug"" appears and considering the assigned colors, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue, since no contradictory evidence is provided in the examples.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. 

Rule: ""dax"" means green.
Based on the examples provided:

- Each time ""wif"" appears by itself, the output is ""red"".
- When ""wif"" appears alongside ""lug"", the colors ""red"" and ""blue"" are output, with ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"" and ""blue"" to ""lug"".
- In the sequence ""zup lug walm wif walm"", the pattern ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"" follows, with ""wif"" corresponding to the first ""red"".

With these examples, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
To discern what the nonce word ""zup"" means, I need to identify the consistent pattern in the examples provided. Here's the breakdown of each input and respective output:

1. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   - The presence of ""dax"" and ""walm"" consistently leads to ""green,"" so ""zup"" being followed by yellow suggests it is not ""dax"" or ""walm.""

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""Bluf"" does not correspond with yellow on its own, as seen in subsequent examples. Hence, ""zup"" might be inducing the yellow.

3. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red
   - ""Bluf"" after ""zup"" is yellow again. ""Bluf"" without preceding ""zup"" turns to red, confirming ""zup"" alters the color associated with ""bluf."" ""Wif"" also corresponds to red, showing consistency.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Independently, ""walm"" corresponds to green. Following ""zup,"" it turns to yellow. This reinforces the idea that ""zup"" changes the usual color outcome.

5. Input: zup lug wif dax lug
   Output: yellow blue red green blue
   - ""Lug"" after ""zup"" is blue instead of its usual color. ""Wif"" after ""zup"" remains red, consistent with the color ""wif"" is assigned when not preceded by ""zup."" ""Dax"" without ""zup"" before it goes back to green. The second ""lug"" also turns to blue, but this is consistent with its output after ""zup.""

From these examples, a rule for what ""zup"" might mean can be inferred:

Rule: ""Zup"" preceding another word changes the standard color associated with that word to yellow, with the exception of ""wif,"" which remains red, and the second occurrence of ""lug"" after ""zup"" does not yield yellow (could make ""lug"" blue).

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

zup -> Changes the following word's associated color to yellow (with outlined exceptions, where it changes ""lug"" to blue and does not affect the color for ""wif"").
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color mentioned immediately before its first occurrence and then repeated every time ""bluf"" appears.

1. In the first example, ""lug"" which is associated with ""blue"" comes before ""bluf"", so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"".

2. In the second example, ""lug"" which is associated with ""blue"" comes before ""bluf"" again, so ""bluf"" is ""blue"".

3. In the third example, ""wif"" which is associated with ""red"" comes before ""bluf"", which means ""bluf"" is ""red"" in this context.

4. In the fourth example, ""lug"" which is associated with ""blue"" comes before ""bluf"", so ""bluf"" is ""blue"".

5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" which is associated with ""yellow"" comes before ""bluf"", which means ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" in this context.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately preceding it.
Reviewing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the context it appears in:

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

From this example, we can notice that the output is the color ""green"" followed by ""green"" again after the word ""walm"". Then, the sequence ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". This suggests a repeating pattern being initiated by ""walm"".

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" does not appear in other examples, but after ""walm"" we see ""red red red"". This could imply that ""walm"" is followed by a threefold repetition of a new color.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""walm"" is causing a color to be repeated three times.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

In this example, we have the word ""lug"" before ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times, confirming again that ""walm"" triggers a triple repetition of the color before it.

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

For this input, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", which results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times. The sequence ""dax lug"" is unrelated to ""walm"" and follows the previously known pattern for those words (""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"").

Taking into consideration all these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> cause the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,159
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Rule: dax -> green

The examples indicate that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence of words, ""wif"" always results in the color red in the output.
Given the examples, we can derive the meaning of ""zup"" by looking at the consistent output in each case. From the examples provided:

- When ""zup"" appears alone, the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red yellow.""
- When ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue yellow.""
- The output for ""zup"" does not change regardless of the word that follows (""bluf"" in the fourth and fifth examples).

Since ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the words around it, we can infer the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
From the given examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" represents the color that results from the word preceding it when the color corresponding to that word is duplicated. To figure out the rule, we need to analyze each example:

1. Input: ""zup bluf"" 
   Output: ""yellow yellow""
   Here, we see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""bluf"" we also get ""yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color connected to ""zup.""

2. Input: ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow green yellow green red red""
   The pattern again corroborates that ""bluf"" replicates the color linked to the preceding word. In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""

3. Input: ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf""
   Output: ""red green yellow red green green""
   Here, ""dax"" becomes ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" we have ""green"" again, indicating that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of ""green.""

4. Input: ""zup bluf lug zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   The word ""lug"" is placed after ""bluf,"" which doesn't follow the same pattern since it outputs ""blue,"" and it doesn't seem to affect the rule of ""bluf."" The last word ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" since ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

5. Input: ""zup bluf""
   Output: ""yellow yellow""
   Again, it confirms that ""bluf"" causes the duplication of the preceding word's corresponding color.

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows a word, it causes the output to be the color corresponding to that word repeated twice.

Rule: bluf causes the color associated with the preceding word to be duplicated in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can analyze the input and the corresponding output to determine the meaning of ""walm"". 

In the first input, ""wif dax lug walm"", the output is ""red green blue blue blue"", and the word ""walm"" follows ""lug"", resulting in two more ""blue""s. 

In the second example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", the output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". Here, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and results in ""red red red"".

In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup"", the output is ""red red red green yellow"", and ""walm"" following ""wif"" leads to an additional ""red"".

In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow red red red"", and again ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and leads to repeated ""red""s.

In the last example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in repeated ""blue"".

From the above examples, it is evident that the word ""walm"" induces repetition of the color that immediately precedes it in the sequence.

Rule:
walm -> induces repetition of the preceding color in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,160
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by ""blue.""

From this information, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with ""lug."" However, the exact rule is not entirely clear from these examples alone. ""Lug"" seems to be associated with the output ""blue,"" but the context in which ""lug"" is used changes the output pattern.

Given the limited examples, the most straightforward rule we can deduce is:

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output. The repetition and combination with other words could potentially be modifying this output, but there are not enough examples to clearly define how.
dax -> green

Rule: dax corresponds to the color green. Whenever dax appears in the input, it is translated to green in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule:
Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output includes ""red"" at the corresponding position where ""wif"" would be if colors were listed in the same order as the words in the input.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". There is no variation in the output for the given input of ""zup"" regardless of its position in a sequence of words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" always takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the established correlation:

1. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow
   (bluf takes the color of 'lug', which is blue, and then it takes the color of 'wif', which is red)

2. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green
   (bluf takes the color of 'dax', which is green, then it takes a new color since the previous term is 'zup', not a color, reverting to the preceding color term 'dax', which is green)

3. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
   (The sequence has 'bluf' following 'zup', which is not a color term. Therefore, it reverts to the preceding color term 'lug', which is blue)

4. wif bluf -> red red
   (bluf takes the color of 'wif', which is red)

5. wif bluf -> red red
   (bluf takes the color of 'wif', which is red)

Considering these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it adopts the color associated with the word just before it, unless there isn't a direct color, in which case it will retain its previous color value.

Rule: bluf -> adopts the color of the preceding color-associated word. If the preceding word isn't directly associated with a color, bluf retains its previous color value.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

When ""walm"" is used in an input sequence, the corresponding output is a sequence of the color that represents the immediately preceding word in the input sequence, repeated for each occurrence of that preceding word within the entire input sequence.

Let's break down the examples to illustrate the rule:

1. Input: zup walm
   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow
   - ""zup"" appears once before ""walm""
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow (three yellows, the same count as the total occurrences of ""zup"")

2. Input: lug walm dax
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue
   - ""lug"" appears once before ""walm""
   - Output: blue blue blue green (three blues for the one occurrence of ""lug"" and one green for ""dax"")

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow
   - ""zup"" appears once before ""walm""
   - Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue (one blue for ""lug"", three yellows for the one occurrence of ""zup"", and one blue for the last ""lug"")

4. Input: dax walm zup
   - ""dax"" precedes ""walm""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the color green
   - ""dax"" appears once before ""walm""
   - Output: green green green yellow (three greens for the one occurrence of ""dax"" and one yellow for ""zup"")

5. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue
   - ""lug"" appears twice before ""walm""
   - Output: green blue green blue blue blue (colors representing ""dax"" and ""lug"" as they appear in the sequence, followed by four blues for the two occurrences of ""lug"")

Rule:
walm -> The word ""walm"" in the input sequence triggers the output of a series of colors corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"", repeated as many times as that preceding word occurs in the entire input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word dax corresponds to the color 'green' in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that surround it, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

The rule can thus be described as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. When the word ""zup"" appears in the input, regardless of its position or the context of other words, the output includes ""yellow"" for each occurrence of ""zup"". The other words in the input seem to map to other specific colors (""dax"" to green, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, ""walm"" to green), but ""zup"" solely maps to the color yellow every time it appears.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first look at the context in which it appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
2. dax wif bluf -> green red red
3. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
4. lug bluf dax lug -> blue blue green blue
5. dax bluf -> green green

We can observe the following:

- When ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" (examples 1, 2, 3), the output color for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" (example 4), the output color for ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" (example 5), the output color for ""bluf"" is ""green"".

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. To confirm this, let's check if the words that precede ""bluf"" in the examples indeed correlate with the color mentioned:

- ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".
- ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"".
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green"".

Given that ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green"" respectively, and ""bluf"" matches the color of the word before it, we can surmise that:

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the word that precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the input and output pairs to see the correlation.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Based on the outputs, the word ""walm"" appears to take on the color of the word immediately preceding it. In cases where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color is yellow since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. When ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, ""walm"" also corresponds to blue. Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is green, ""walm"" produces a blue output as well because ""lug"" comes after ""dax"", suggesting a transitive property.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug walm dax walm
    ",Output: green blue blue green blue blue,green blue blue blue green green green,False,162
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds directly to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can work out the meaning of ""dax"" by looking for a consistent pattern. The word ""lug"" references blue and ""zup"" references yellow as seen by their repeated use and consistent outputs.

So let's examine what ""dax"" could mean in each given output:

1. ""dax lug zup"" -> ""green blue yellow""
   ""dax"" occurs before ""lug"" (blue) and provides the output ""green"".
   
2. ""zup dax zup"" -> ""yellow green yellow""
   Here ""dax"" is between two ""zup"" (yellow) and its output is ""green"".

3. ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""
   ""dax"" occurs at the beginning and middle and yields ""green"" while at the end, just before ""walm"", it yields ""green green"".
   
4. ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow""
   ""dax"" results in ""green"".

5. ""dax lug"" -> ""green blue""
   ""dax"" results in ""green"".

From these observations, the rule can be deduced as follows: ""dax"" translates independently to ""green"". The only example that stands out is the third one, where ""dax"" before ""walm"" translates to ""green green"". However, without further examples involving ""walm"", it is difficult to induce a rule for its behavior in the sequence. Therefore, based on the available data, we can conclude:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in all provided examples.
Based on the examples provided where the word 'zup' leads to the output of one or two yellows regardless of its position in the input sequence, it appears that 'zup' corresponds directly to the color yellow. The presence of 'zup' in the input consistently results in one yellow being present in the output, without any influence from surrounding words. Hence, 'zup' independently translates to 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the pattern in each input and their corresponding outputs:

1. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
2. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
3. lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green
4. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

From these examples, it appears that every word is linked to a specific color output:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> sequence appears to extend adding one more red compared to the previous occurrence of walm

Given this, we can deduce:
- In examples 1, 2, and 5, the word ""bluf"" directly follows different words and each time it outputs the same color as the word before it.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" appears twice after the word ""lug"" and the word ""dax"" respectively, and it takes on the color of the word immediately before it both times.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word immediately preceding it. Hence the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it is a chameleon word that mimics the color associated with the preceding word.

Bluf -> Mimics the color output of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word multiple times equal to the number of letters in the preceding word. To confirm this, we can look at the pattern before and after ""walm"" in each example:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. The word ""lug"" has three letters, and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

- In the second example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" outputs ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" Here ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red, and ""wif"" is outputted three times because it has three letters.

- In the third example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, repeated three times for the three letters in ""lug.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" correlates with yellow and has three letters, hence the output is three yellows.

- In the fifth example, ""wif walm dax"" turns into ""red red red green."" ""Wif"" comes before ""walm,"" and since ""wif"" is red and has three letters, ""red"" is outputted three times. ""Dax"" comes after ""walm"" and is not influenced by it, so its color, green, is outputted only once.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it as many times as there are letters in that word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word as many times as there are letters in that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The meaning is the color ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word 'dax' translates to the color 'green'.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context.
bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the color that corresponds to the previous word is repeated. For example, if ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"". If ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"", and so forth.
Based on the examples provided, it can be inferred that the nonce word ""walm"" replicates the color associated with the word that precedes it three times. Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""

When ""walm"" follows the word ""zup,"" it changes to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which may suggest that ""zup"" has no color association itself but acts as a modifier causing ""walm"" to output three yellows. The sequence ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" supports this idea as ""walm"" first replicates ""red"" three times and then, after ""zup,"" it turns to ""yellow"" three times following another ""zup."" 

Rule: walm -> replicates the color of the preceding word three times. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""walm"" outputs ""yellow"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" across all given examples.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the output ""green."" 

Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color. Here is the mapping from your examples:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow
- zup -> not explicitly stated but based on the pattern, it could potentially be a redundant representation for yellow

There is not enough information to deduce if ""zup"" has its distinct meaning or just another representation for yellow as ""walm"" in absence of more examples or context.

Rule: Each nonce word is associated with a specific color. ""Wif"" specifically translates to the color red.
Based on the provided examples, the word zup seems to correspond consistently with the color yellow in the output, regardless of the context or the words around it. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of zup in this context is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: Each nonce word is associated with a color. Zup corresponds to yellow, walm corresponds to yellow, lug corresponds to red, wif corresponds to red, dax corresponds to green, and bluf corresponds to blue. Each output provides the color associated with the nonce word from the input.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for consistent patterns before and after the word appears:

1. In every instance, ""walm"" is followed by a series of the same color that directly corresponds to the previous word before ""walm.""
2. The number of color repetitions after ""walm"" matches the number of those repetitions before it.

Let's analyze this pattern:

- ""lug walm zup walm"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""
  Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times. Again ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

- ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""green green green yellow blue""
  Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times. There are no repeated colors after ""zup lug.""

- ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
  Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
  Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times, but note there are two sets of ""lug"" in the input, one after ""walm"" and one at the end. This may be why there's another ""blue"" at the end.

- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
  Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.

From these examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule:
- ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes it to be repeated the same number of times it was repeated before ""walm."" If the preceding word has not appeared before ""walm,"" then the color that corresponds to the preceding word appears three times after ""walm.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" could be stated as:

walm -> Causes repetition of the directly preceding color the same number of times as it was repeated before ""walm,"" or three times if the preceding word is new.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,165
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the inputs is followed by ""blue"" in the outputs. However, this is not the only rule, as ""lug"" is followed by more colors than just blue in some outputs, suggesting that other words also contribute to the outcome.

Here’s how the breakdown appears:

- ""wif"" leads to ""red.""
- ""lug"" leads to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" by itself is followed by three blues, thus ""walm"" might mean “repeat blue.”
- ""dax"" leads to ""green.""
- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""

When the words are combined, the output is a combination of the corresponding colors. For instance, ""lug wif dax"" leads to ""blue red green,"" showing that each word contributes its associated color to the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
From the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" maps consistently to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. This can be confirmed because the word ""dax"" is followed or preceded by various other words, but the output for ""dax"" remains ""green."" It appears that ""dax"" does not depend on context.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, each unique non-wif word following the word 'wif' corresponds to a unique color:

- walm -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- lug -> blue

Additionally, the word 'wif' itself always produces the output 'red', regardless of its position or repetition in the sequence.

Thus, the rule can be summarized as:

wif -> red

This is the consistent meaning across all provided examples, as 'wif' directly translates to 'red' every time it appears.
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, whether it is combined with another word or stands alone.
To decode the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the pattern of words and their corresponding colors.

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

3. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

4. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue

5. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue

From the examples, we can see that ""bluf"" is always followed by the color ""blue"" in the outputs. However, since the outputs contain more words than the inputs, it seems that some input words result in multiple output words. ""Wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" all translate directly into a single color output (""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green"" respectively), but ""lug"" and ""bluf"" do not seem to follow this pattern.

Looking closely at the pattern for ""lug"" suggests that it leads to either one or two ""blue"" outputs, depending on the position and context within the input. 

The consistent part appears to be that ""bluf"" directly translates to ""blue,"" while ""lug"" might either stand for ""blue"" directly or trigger an additional ""blue"" output when occurring before or after ""bluf."" 

The consistent rule for ""bluf,"" regardless of context, is that it translates directly to the color ""blue."" 

Rule: bluf -> blue
walm -> repetition of a color word associated with the preceding word. Rule: For each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" following another word, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.

- zup is associated with yellow
- wif is associated with red
- dax is associated with green

Hence ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it, three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,166
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of the context it appears in, suggesting that ""dax"" simply means green.

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce what ""wif"" means, we need to look for a pattern in the provided examples.

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
- The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" both times it appears, and ""walm"" also translates to ""blue."" However, after ""wif"" is introduced, the color changes from ""blue"" to ""red"" before returning to ""blue"" again for the final ""lug.""

Input: wif
Output: red
- ""Wif"" alone translates directly to ""red.""

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" but when ""wif"" appears, everything following it, including the word ""walm,"" which previously translated to ""blue,"" becomes ""red.""

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red
- Similarly to previous examples, ""lug"" and ""walm"" translate to ""blue."" After ""wif,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" suggesting ""wif"" changes the translation of subsequent words to ""red.""

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- Here, ""dax"" is a new word, which translates to ""green."" However, after ""wif,"" ""bluf"" again translates to ""red.""

Looking at these patterns, it seems that ""wif"" may act as a turning point or modifier that changes the output color of all following words to ""red,"" regardless of their initial translation.

Rule: wif -> meaning. ""Wif"" changes the output of all following words to ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that each word corresponds to a specific color:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, as seen in examples 1 and 5.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, as seen in all examples.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green, as seen in example 1.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, as seen in example 3.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, as seen in example 4.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
The examples provided give a sequence of inputs where each word is associated with a color. From analyzing the sequences, we can try to isolate the meaning of ""bluf"" by considering the surrounding words and their corresponding output colors. 

Let's look at the patterns:

- ""wif zup bluf"" -> red yellow yellow
- ""wif bluf"" -> red red
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> red red red blue blue
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> yellow yellow red red red
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> red red blue green red

By examining the outputs, we notice that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". If we look closely at the examples that contain ""bluf"" multiple times, we see that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" directly. However, when ""bluf"" follows other words:

- ""lug bluf"" -> blue blue
- ""dax wif"" -> green red

It suggests ""bluf"" may take on the color of the word immediately preceding it, with ""lug"" being ""blue"" and ""dax"" being ""green"". ""Bluf"" seems to duplicate the color of the preceding word.

Let's summarize the rule based on the given data:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If the preceding word is ""wif"", then ""bluf"" results in the color ""red"". If the preceding word is ""lug"", it results in the color ""blue"", and so on for the other examples provided.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color corresponding to another word in the input. Each color is repeated three times, as indicated by the output.

- In the first example ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""zup"" means yellow and ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times.
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green (which is not repeated), ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" presumably repeats the color blue three times, ignoring the color green that is associated with ""dax."" 
- In the third example, ""wif walm,"" we see ""red red red,"" suggesting ""wif"" means red and ""walm"" repeats the color red three times.
- The fourth example, ""zup wif walm,"" combines ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red), with ""walm"" causing red to repeat three times as ""yellow red red red,"" meaning ""walm"" is applying the repetition to the second color word only.
- Finally, the fifth example, ""lug walm zup walm,"" provides the output of two sets of color repetition, ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" which means ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. If there are multiple color words before ""walm,"" it only applies to the one immediately prior.

Walm -> Rule: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, we can try to deduce a pattern that suggests what ""lug"" means. It appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. 

Here's the breakdown by each input-output pair:

- Input: wif lug / Output: red blue -> ""wif"" leads to ""red"", ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
- Input: zup lug / Output: yellow blue -> ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
- Input: zup wif lug / Output: yellow red blue -> following the previous logic, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
- Input: lug walm wif lug / Output: blue blue blue red blue -> ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", ""walm"" doesn't have a clear translation but seems to lead to ""blue"" again in this case, ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and the second ""lug"" again leads to ""blue""
- Input: lug wif bluf / Output: blue red red -> ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and ""bluf"" is not previously defined but seems to result in ""red"" again in this case

The consistent rule here is that ""lug"" corresponds with the color ""blue."" Therefore:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at each input-output pair:

- In the first input (""wif dax""), ""dax"" precedes the output ""green"" and ""wif"" precedes ""red.""
- In the second input (""lug dax lug wif""), ""dax"" is between ""lug"" and ""lug"" and it correlates to ""green"" between ""blue"" and ""blue,"" while ""wif"" at the end corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third input (""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax""), ""dax"" comes at the end after two occurrences of ""bluf,"" which corresponds to two ""yellow"" followed by the ""green."" 
- In the fourth input (""lug dax zup""), ""dax"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" which correspond to ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively, with ""dax"" correlating to ""green"" in between.
- Finally, in the fifth input (""dax lug wif""), ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and ""wif,"" which correlate to ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively, with ""dax"" leading as ""green.""

Parameters noted:

1. ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
2. Other words correspond to specific colors also regardless of position (""wif"" to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"").

Therefore, we can induce that the rule for the word “dax” is that it consistently correlates to the color “green” irrespective of its position in a sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look at the correspondence between the input and the output in each example.

- In every instance where ""wif"" is present, the word ""red"" is also present in the output.
- ""Wif"" on its own leads to ""red"" as the output.
- The presence of other words after ""wif"" does not prevent ""red"" from appearing in the output. 
- It seems that the occurrence of ""wif"" correlates with the number of times ""red"" appears in the output.
- In the example where ""wif"" is present twice (Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm), ""red"" appears in the output twice.

Let's formulate the rule based on these observations:

Rule: ""wif"" indicates the color ""red."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to an occurrence of ""red"" in the output.

Therefore:

wif -> ""red""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"". This is evident from the first two examples where ""zup"" on its own results in ""yellow"" and from the third example where ""zup"" combined with ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"". 

Hence, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the context within the string of nonce words.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it becomes ""red."" If it follows ""dax,"" it becomes ""green,"" and if it follows ""zup,"" it becomes ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the word ""walm.""

In the first example, ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green,"" the appearance of ""walm"" following ""dax"" leads to a repetition of ""green"" three times.

In the second example, ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green,"" again we see that ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and leads to ""green"" being repeated three times.

The third example, ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow,"" shows that after ""zup"" the word ""walm"" leads to a triple repetition of ""yellow.""

The fourth example, ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red,"" shows ""walm"" following ""wif,"" leading to a triple repetition of ""red.""

The last example provided, ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow,"" reinforces the pattern seen in the third example.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" indicates a rule where the color word directly preceding ""walm"" should be repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" follows a color word directly, then it should be repeated three times; otherwise, it seems to repeat the last mentioned color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previously mentioned color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is included in the output corresponding to its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence:

Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue  
Input: dax zup walm wif -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red  
Input: lug zup dax wif -> Output: blue yellow green red  
Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green  
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red  

dax -> meaning. Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".
To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" from the given examples, let's break down each example by examining the transformation from the input to the output. 

1. ""lug wif walm"" is transformed into ""blue red red red"", where ""lug"" equals ""blue"" and ""walm"" equals ""red"".
2. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" is transformed into ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" equals ""yellow"", ""lug"" equals ""blue"", and ""walm"" equals ""red"".
3. ""zup walm lug wif"" is transformed into ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"", where ""zup"" equals ""yellow"", ""lug"" equals ""blue"", and ""walm"" equals ""red"".
4. ""wif bluf"" is transformed into ""red red"", but there's no context to determine what ""bluf"" equals.
5. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" is transformed into ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" equals ""yellow"", ""lug"" equals ""blue"", ""dax"" equals ""green"", and ""walm"" equals ""red"".

In all the examples, every occurrence of ""wif"" results in ""red"" in the output. There doesn't appear to be contextual dependence, as ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the English word ""yellow"". Each instance of ""bluf"" in the input maps to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding context.

Rule: bluf -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" follows a specific pattern. Let's go through each example and try to find a consistent rule.

Example 1:
Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Example 2:
Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Example 3:
Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

Example 4:
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Example 5:
Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue

From the examples, whenever the word ""walm"" is encountered, the output is duplicated three times in the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" For instance, in Example 1, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and then we see ""blue"" three times before the next color appears. Similarly, in Example 3, when ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" ""green"" is outputted three times.

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be repeated three times in the output.

So the rule is:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Each instance of ""wif"" in the input is associated with the output ""red."" Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as ""red.""
From the examples provided, we can infer the following individual associations:

- ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

Now let's assess the usage of ""zup"" in different contexts:

1. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
2. ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
3. ""dax zup wif"" -> ""green yellow red""
4. ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
5. ""dax wif zup"" -> ""green red yellow""

In each case where ""zup"" is used, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. The position of ""yellow"" in the output sequence correlates with the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence. This consistency across all examples indicates that the rule for ""zup"" is independent of its position or the context of other words, as it consistently leads to the output ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must look for any consistent patterns correlated with its appearance in the outputs. 

Let's analyze the input and output pairs:

1. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" and then ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green 
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: wif dax zup bluf
   Output: red green yellow yellow
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Upon reviewing the above pairs, it is apparent that the meaning of ""bluf"" is not consistently associated with a specific color in the output. It might be the case that ""bluf"" is a rule that requires analyzing neighboring words or the sequence of the nonce words presented in the input. However, additional data or more complex patterns are needed to rule out the randomness and induce a definitive rule.

Considering the available information, we cannot define a consistent rule for ""bluf."" 

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" cannot be determined from the provided examples; the outputs are inconsistent and no clear pattern is discernible.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word multiple times. More specifically, the number of repetitions is equal to the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm"". 

Here is how the rule applies to the given examples:
1. ""zup lug walm"": ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" makes ""blue"" repeat four times (because ""lug"" has three letters).
2. ""zup walm lug wif"": ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" repeat four times (because ""zup"" has three letters), ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
3. ""dax walm"": ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""walm"" makes ""green"" repeat four times (because ""dax"" has three letters).
4. ""dax wif walm"": ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""walm"" makes ""red"" repeat four times (because ""wif"" has three letters).
5. ""dax walm"": Same as example 3, ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""walm"" makes ""green"" repeat four times (because ""dax"" has three letters).

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word a number of times equal to the number of letters in that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax zup wif walm
    ",Output: yellow green yellow red red red red,yellow green yellow red red red,False,170
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When the nonce word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce that:

- The standalone ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- The word ""dax"" appears to maintain its meaning regardless of the position in the sequence.

Now let's see if the context of ""dax"" changes its meaning:

1. Input: ""dax""
   Output: ""green""
   
   Here, there's a one-to-one correspondence between ""dax"" and ""green"".

2. Input: ""wif dax lug dax""
   Output: ""red green blue green""
   
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". The second ""dax"" still means ""green"".

3. Input: ""lug wif dax walm zup""
   Output: ""blue red green green green yellow""
   
   ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", ""walm"" corresponds to two ""greens"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

4. Input: ""wif dax lug walm""
   Output: ""red green blue blue blue""
   
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"" to two ""blues"".

The examples suggest the meaning of ""dax"" is consistently ""green"", and it is not affected by other words in the sequence. Based on this information, the rule is: 

dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word 'wif' is associated with a particular color each time it appears. However, to deduce its meaning, we need to look at the other words in the sequences and the colors they correspond to. Let's analyze each input-output pair to identify patterns:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - Here, 'zup' and 'walm' both seem to map to 'yellow,' 'lug' maps to 'blue,' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red' at the end of the sequence.

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   - 'lug' and 'walm' map to 'blue' again, 'zup' now maps to 'yellow,' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red' the first time and 'yellow' the second time it appears. This suggests that 'wif' may not have a static meaning but depends on some aspect of the context.

3. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue
   - 'lug' maps to 'blue,' while 'wif' maps to 'red' here despite 'lug' appearing before and after it. 'bluf' also maps to 'blue.'

4. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red
   - Here, 'wif' appears three times and corresponds to 'red' every time, while 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'lug' to 'blue.' 

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   - 'zup' and 'walm' both map to 'yellow,' and 'wif' corresponds to 'red.'

After reviewing the examples, it seems that the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red' whenever it appears at the end of a sequence. When it’s in the middle of a sequence, it takes the color of the word that comes after it in the sequence, except in the case where it follows 'lug,' in which it still represents 'red.'

Rule: wif -> 'red' at the end of a sequence; otherwise, the color of the following word unless followed by 'lug,' then it's 'red'.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and output pairs.

1. ""dax walm wif bluf"" correlates with ""green green green red red"". We can note that ""dax"", ""walm,"" and ""wif"" each translate to ""green,"" and following these, the nonce word ""bluf"" results in ""red red."" 

2. ""dax zup bluf"" correlates with ""green yellow yellow."" Here ""dax"" is again ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds with ""yellow"" as well.

3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" correlates with ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue."" ""Wif"" changes to ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" again, and ""lug walm"" translates into ""blue blue blue,"" though it's important to note that ""lug"" alone corresponds to ""blue"" in example 5.

4. ""zup bluf"" correlates with ""yellow yellow."" Here again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" as well.

5. ""lug zup bluf dax"" correlates with ""blue yellow yellow green."" ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

Based on the examples, one rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" could be that it replicates the output color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the output color of the preceding word. If the preceding word outputs ""green,"" ""bluf"" outputs green. If it's yellow, ""bluf"" outputs yellow, and so on.
Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the immediately preceding word three times.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow""; therefore, ""walm"" seems to be taking the color associated with ""zup,"" which in previous examples has been ""yellow.""
- The third example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" outputs ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" The segment ""lug walm"" is directly before ""dax"" and results in ""blue blue blue."" Again, the word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word right before it three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm dax"" outputs ""blue blue blue green,"" where ""lug walm"" gives us ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the rule that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color three times.
- The last example, ""zup wif lug zup walm,"" outputs ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup walm"" precedes the ""walm"" and results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" further validating the rule that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif dax lug bluf zup
    ",Output: yellow red green blue yellow yellow,yellow red green blue blue yellow,False,171
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""lug"" or other words around it.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""dax."" We'll look at each example and the associated output to determine the correspondence:

1. Input: dax lug wif lug
   Output: green blue red blue
2. Input: dax lug zup dax
   Output: green blue yellow green
3. Input: dax
   Output: green
4. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

By examining the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can infer the following:

- Every time the word 'dax' appears, the color 'green' is in the output at the same position.
- The position of 'dax' in the input doesn't affect its output—it always corresponds to 'green,' irrespective of whether it comes first, last, or in between other words.

Therefore, the word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green' consistently throughout all examples. In other words, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever the input is ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- The word ""wif"" by itself or with other words still results in the output of ""red"" for ""wif,"" regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence.
- ""Wif"" does not seem to change its associated output due to context or position. It consistently maps to ""red.""

The other words ""walm"" and ""dax"" also seem to have consistent outputs, with ""walm"" mapping to ""red"" and ""dax"" mapping to ""green,"" while ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""

So, we can derive the following rule:

wif -> red

Meaning that ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red.""
From analyzing the given examples, we can determine that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" Here is the deduced rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will analyze each example, looking for patterns or consistencies that can inform us of the rule. Let's look at each input-output pair:

1. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax | Output: blue green green red green
2. Input: zup bluf lug | Output: yellow yellow blue
3. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
4. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax | Output: green blue yellow red red green
5. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green

Here are the observations:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""bluf"" appears: in example 1, it occurs between ""dax"" and ""wif"" and, in example 2, between ""zup"" and ""lug."" In the first instance, ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" and in the second instance, it translates to ""blue.""
- In example 3, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup,"" and there's no color associated with it in the output. This suggests that ""bluf"" might not always correspond to a color on its own.
- Example 4 shows ""bluf"" between ""wif"" and ""dax."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is also the color that corresponds with ""wif."" There's no clear pattern here on what ""bluf"" means.
- Lastly, in example 5, ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""dax"" and corresponds to the output ""red,"" which again matches the output for ""wif.""

With this information, we may speculate that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the previous color,"" as it repeats the immediately preceding color in every example provided. With this rule, in examples where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green), the output is green, when it follows ""wif"" (red), the output is red, and after ""lug"" (blue), it is blue. The third example does seem to break this pattern by not outputting a color for ""bluf"" after ""zup"" (yellow), which needs an explanation.

Since ""bluf"" is not always followed by a color in the Output (as in the third example), the rule might be that ""bluf"", when at the end of a sequence, does not add an additional color but rather indicates repetition of prior output without introducing a new color. This, however, is not completely consistent with the other examples unless the repetition is somehow conditional or context-dependent.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color"" when it is followed by another word that converts into a color, but when it's at the end, it does not output a new color, possibly just echoing or indicating the end of a pattern. 

For a more definitive rule, we would need additional examples or more information.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output colors are a sequence that relates to the position of the words in the input. If we assume ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively, it seems that ""walm"" may be a command or function that repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. 

The pattern seems to be:

- ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the output has a sequence of three yellows after the first yellow.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green,"" where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the output is two additional greens.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the output is two additional reds.
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the output has an additional yellow.
- ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and the output has two additional blues.

The rule therefore seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,172
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in all provided examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should consider its usage in each input in relation to the corresponding output.

1. ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red""
2. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green red green yellow yellow""
3. ""dax bluf lug wif"" translates to ""green green blue red""
4. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
5. ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green""

Examining each case, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words. It is the only word in each input that consistently corresponds to the same color in the output. Thus, we can conclude:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the other words present in the sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the pattern of inputs and outputs.

- dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
- wif zup -> red yellow
- wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green
- zup dax -> yellow green
- wif bluf lug zup -> red yellow blue yellow

In all cases, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that irrespective of its position or the words around it, ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow.""

zup -> yellow. Rule: ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided:

Input: zup wif bluf zup Output: yellow red red yellow
Input: lug bluf zup lug Output: blue blue yellow blue
Input: dax zup lug zup bluf Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
Input: wif bluf dax Output: red red green
Input: zup bluf Output: yellow yellow

We can see that whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, it takes the same color as the word that immediately precedes it:

- In the first line, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and the output for ""bluf"" is also red.
- In the second line, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output for ""bluf"" is also blue.
- In the third line, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is yellow as well.
- In the fourth line, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) again, and the output for ""bluf"" is red.
- In the fifth line, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output for ""bluf"" is yellow again.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it.
From the given examples, it appears that walm causes the output to repeat the color that would have been assigned to the word preceding it multiple times. Here's how the rule applies to the given examples:

1. Example: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Explanation: 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'wif' to 'red.' After walm is used, 'red' is repeated three times.

2. Example: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Explanation: 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'lug' to 'blue.' After walm is used, 'blue' is repeated three times.

3. Example: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   Explanation: 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' 'zup' to 'yellow,' 'bluf' has no preceding color so it repeats 'yellow,' 'lug' to 'blue.' After walm, 'blue' is repeated three times, then the sequence continues with 'dax' to 'green' and finally 'lug' to 'blue.'

4. Example: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   Explanation: 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' and after walm, 'blue' is repeated three times, followed by 'wif' which translates to 'red.'

5. Example: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Explanation: 'dax' corresponds to 'green.' After walm is used, 'green' is repeated twice more.

Based on these observations, I can induce that walm causes the output to repeat the color of the word before it three times. Here is the formal rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding walm three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" as it directly translates to a specific color in each instance it appears. We see that whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position of the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" I will examine the patterns that emerge from the provided examples:

1. When the input string starts with ""dax,"" the output starts with ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is immediately followed by a different word (e.g., ""zup"" or ""walm""), the output color following ""green"" corresponds to the pattern of that word observed in other examples (e.g., ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"").
3. When ""dax"" is repeated without a different word between (""dax zup dax""), the output is ""green"" for both instances of ""dax,"" while ""zup,"" again, corresponds to ""yellow.""
4. In ""zup walm dax,"" ""zup"" and ""walm"" both lead to ""yellow,"" while ""dax"" at the end corresponds to ""green.""
5. With ""dax lug wif bluf,"" we observe that ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and the new words ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" map to ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""red,"" respectively, which suggests that ""dax"" does not alter the output associated with the following words.

Rule: dax, when used in an input, maps to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence of words. It does not affect the output associated with other nonce words that follow it.

dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be a direct correspondence between the nonce word ""wif"" and the color ""red."" Additionally, other words accompanying ""wif"" are associated with their own specific colors (""lug"" with ""blue"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow""). Thus, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

When ""wif"" is presented alone or as part of a sequence, the output consistently includes ""red."" No examples have been given to suggest that ""wif"" has a meaning beyond this color association within this context. The additional words (""lug"" and ""zup"") that follow ""wif"" also correspond to specific colors in the output.

Rule:
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
Analyzing the given examples, we can see a pattern in the correlation between the input and the output:

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

Input: zup dax wif zup
Output: yellow green red yellow

From the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" consistently, irrespective of its position in the sequence or the other words present. For instance, whenever ""zup"" is present as an input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> meaning. Meaning is ""yellow"".

Rule: ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the examples given:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""lug dax"" and ""wif dax,"" translating to ""blue green"" and ""red green"" respectively. The second color ""green"" remains consistent, suggesting ""bluf"" does not impact the output of ""dax."" However, the appearance of ""bluf"" corresponds to a change from ""blue"" to ""red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" relates to the color ""red.""

- The second example further supports that ""bluf"" relates to the color ""red,"" as ""wif dax bluf"" outputs to ""red green green.""

- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red.""

- The fifth example presents an anomaly as ""bluf"" is translated as ""yellow"" which contradicts the previous examples. Looking closely, we can see that ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"" in all previous cases.

Given these observations, it seems ""bluf"" may not have an independent meaning but could be a modifier that changes the color based on its context. However, the last example contradicts the apparent rule that ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" since ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when following ""zup.""

Considering all the examples given, the rule seems inconsistent due to the last example. A possible explanation could be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it unless that word is ""lug,"" in which case ""bluf"" changes it to ""red."" However, the information provided is insufficient to establish this as a solid rule without further contradictions.

The examples do not provide a consistent translation for ""bluf,"" but the most common output linked to ""bluf"" is ""red."" Without additional context or examples, we cannot determine a definitive rule.

Rule: Inconsistencies present, but ""bluf"" most commonly translates to ""red,"" and might act as a modifier that repeats or changes the color based on specific preceding words. Further examples are needed to clarify the rule.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns in the given examples:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

From these examples, we can see that the presence of ""walm"" in the input correlates with a repetition of a color in the output. The word preceding ""walm"" appears to determine the color that is repeated. For instance:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated thrice.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated thrice.

Given this pattern, it seems that ""walm"" is a rule for repeating the color associated with the preceding word in the output a specific number of times (which is three in every instance observed here).

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,174
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. Every time ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax lug zup"" corresponds to ""green blue yellow""
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue red blue""
- ""dax"" by itself corresponds to ""green""

The only consistent element across all examples is the appearance of the word ""dax,"" which is always translated to the color ""green."" The other words (""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif"") correspond to different colors, but ""dax"" consistently represents the same color.

Rule: dax -> green. The word ""dax"" consistently means ""green"" regardless of context.
From the examples provided, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word has a corresponding color. From the examples, it is clear that 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to correspond to the output color being repeated for each occurrence of the nonce word 'bluf'. Here's my induction:

For the first example,
- ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" becomes ""green green red blue yellow"":
  Here 'bluf' precedes 'lug' and 'wif', and the output colors for these words are 'red' and 'blue'. However, 'bluf' gives us 'green', which is the color for 'dax'.
  
In the second example,
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" becomes ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"":
  The word 'bluf' follows 'zup' with the corresponding color 'yellow'. It appears to repeat the color of 'zup', since it is immediately before 'bluf'.

In the third example, 
- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"":
  The word 'bluf' follows 'wif', and the output color 'red' is repeated.

In the fourth example,
- ""zup bluf dax"" becomes ""yellow yellow green"":
  The word 'bluf' follows 'zup' and again the output color 'yellow' is repeated.
  
In the fifth example,
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" becomes ""red red red blue blue"":
  Here 'bluf' follows 'lug', and the output color 'red' is associated with 'wif' and 'walm'. However, 'blue' is repeated, which is the color associated with 'lug'. 

The consistent pattern is that 'bluf' repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. 'bluf' means repeat the color of the word that comes before 'bluf'.
Meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" changes the color output of the words that follow it to red. Here's the breakdown of the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" The word following ""walm"" (dax) and the word after that (zup) both become red despite normally translating to green and yellow, respectively.
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue."" The word following ""walm"" would usually be ""green"" but is changed to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" turns into ""yellow yellow red red red."" The word following ""walm"" (wif) changes to red.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" but there's no word following ""walm"" to indicate a change to red following the pattern of the other examples.
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red."" Here again, the word following ""walm"" becomes red, and the original ""blue"" does not appear afterwards.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the colors of the words that follow it to become red. However, due to the fourth example where no word follows ""walm,"" we cannot definitively say that this pattern holds consistently without additional context. Therefore, the rule induced from the given data, but with a note of uncertainty due to one outlier example, can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" changes the color output of all subsequent words to red, except when no words follow it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,175
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the examples provided, we can induce the meaning of ""lug"" by looking for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs.

Let's analyze the outputs where ""lug"" is present:

1. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
2. zup lug -> yellow blue
3. zup lug bluf wif -> yellow blue blue red
4. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
5. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue

From these examples, we can observe that every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, it would be reasonable to deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". 

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can compare the outputs that follow each instance of ""wif"" in the inputs. Let's first list the examples given where ""wif"" is followed by another word and the corresponding color output:

1. wif bluf -> red red
2. wif lug -> red blue
3. wif zup -> red yellow
4. wif lug dax -> red blue green

In each case, the presence of ""wif"" yields the output ""red."" So when ""wif"" appears before another word, it always translates to ""red."" The other words following ""wif"" correspond to their own colors (e.g., ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow""). 

For the fifth input:

5. zup wif lug zup walm
   (yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow)

We can deduce that ""wif"" stands alone yields ""red,"" ""lug"" after ""wif"" yields ""blue,"" ""zup"" both before and after yields ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" which is a new word yields ""yellow"".

The rule seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" and is followed by the corresponding color of the word that comes after it. If ""wif"" is not followed by another word, it means ""red.""

So, wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, we observe the following pattern:

wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'walm' corresponds to 'yellow'

lug zup -> blue yellow
- confirms that 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'

zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'

dax zup -> green yellow
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'

dax zup -> green yellow (repetition of the previous example for confirmation)
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'

Since 'zup' consistently corresponds to 'yellow' in every instance it appears, irrespective of its position or the context of surrounding words, the rule induced from these examples is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the color of the output to repeat from the previous color mentioned. Let's apply this to the given examples to confirm:

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
- dax is associated with green.
- bluf repeats the previous color, so it's green.
- wif changes the sequence to red.
- zup changes the sequence to yellow.
- dax changes it back to green.

Output: green green red yellow green

Input: lug zup bluf dax
- lug changes the sequence to blue.
- zup changes the sequence to yellow.
- bluf repeats the previous color, so it's yellow.
- dax changes the sequence to green.

Output: blue yellow yellow green

Input: zup wif bluf
- zup changes the sequence to yellow.
- wif changes the sequence to red.
- bluf repeats the previous color, so it's red.

Output: yellow red red

Input: wif walm lug bluf
- wif starts with red.
- walm does not correspond to a change in color pattern.
- lug changes the sequence to blue.
- bluf repeats the previous color, so it's blue.

Output: red red red blue blue

Input: zup bluf
- zup changes the sequence to yellow.
- bluf repeats the previous color, so it's yellow.

Output: yellow yellow

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs with their respective outputs. The goal is to identify a pattern that helps us understand how the nonce word ""walm"" affects the output.

Let's examine the inputs and outputs carefully:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

5. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

Observations:

- ""wif"" always leads to the output ""red"".
- ""dax"" always leads to ""green"".
- ""lug"" always produces ""blue"".
- ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"".

When ""walm"" appears in the input, we can see that it results in the repetition of the color word that came just before it. Each occurrence of ""walm"" elongates the duration of the previous color, resulting in the repetition of the color in the output sequence.

Here is the breakdown of the first example based on this observation:

- ""dax"" (green), then ""wif"" (red),
- ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" therefore red is repeated twice more,
- ""lug"" (blue),
- ""zup"" (yellow),
- ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" therefore yellow is repeated two more times.

Thus, based on the patterns observed, the rule for the word ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color word in the output sequence for an extended duration.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,176
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""lug."" Let's analyze the occurrences of ""lug"" and the corresponding output in each example:

1. ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue,"" but ""wif"" by itself corresponds to ""red,"" suggesting that ""lug"" adds ""blue"" to the sequence.

2. ""zup wif lug"" yields ""yellow red blue,"" where ""zup wif"" would be ""yellow red"" without ""lug,"" again indicating that ""lug"" correlates to ""blue.""

3. ""bluf lug"" produces ""blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" by itself corresponds to ""blue,"" thereby reinforcing the idea that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. When ""lug"" appears by itself, the output is ""blue,"" directly suggesting that ""lug"" represents ""blue.""

5. In sequences like ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" the word ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue.""

From the provided data, it seems that ""lug"" is consistently related to the color ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" We will look for patterns in the way ""dax"" is used and what color is output whenever ""dax"" appears.

Here are the instances of ""dax"" and the corresponding color outputs:

1. lug zup dax walm → blue yellow green green green
2. dax wif → green red
3. lug dax bluf zup lug wif → blue green green yellow blue red
4. dax bluf → green green
5. lug wif dax → blue red green

Analyzing the sequences, we see the following patterns emerge:

- Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output of ""green.""
- The word ""dax"" does not seem to affect the color that follows it.

Based on the above observations, we can define the rule for the nonce word ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green
To decipher the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's analyze each example in terms of their input and respective output colors:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red""

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again

3. Input: dax lug wif lug
   Output: green blue red blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue""

4. Input: zup dax lug wif dax
   Output: yellow green blue red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green""

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

From these examples, we can deduce that the presence of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output color ""red,"" regardless of its position or the words surrounding it. Additionally, ""wif"" does not seem to modify the meaning of the words around it, but rather, each occurrence of ""wif"" maps to ""red"" on a one-to-one basis.

Hence, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the rule for the nonce word ""zup"". Let's analyze the examples:

1. The simple input ""zup"" results in the output ""yellow"".
2. In the second input, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow"", while ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"". 
3. The third input features ""zup"" followed by ""dax"" twice, and the output is ""yellow green green"". This suggests ""zup"" is not affecting the following word.
4. In the fourth input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"".
5. The fifth input has ""wif"" and ""walm"" both outputting ""red"" with no ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug"" this time, followed by ""zup"" which corresponds with ""yellow"", and then ""walm"" corresponding with ""yellow"".

From these examples, ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow"", regardless of its position or the other words present. Therefore, ""zup"" seems to be a stand-alone term that translates directly to ""yellow"" independently of context.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the outputs corresponding to each input where ""bluf"" is present.

1. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   
2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   
3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   
5. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   
Observations:
- ""bluf"" always occurs towards the end of the input string.
- Every time ""bluf"" appears, ""blue"" appears in the output string, mostly after the previous color has been repeated.
- In every case except the first, there are two instances of ""blue"" in the output following ""bluf.""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or ""walm,"" which all output red at least once in the given examples, ""bluf"" yields ""blue"" twice.
- When preceded by ""dax"" (green) or ""zup"" (yellow), which only show up once in their respective strings before ""bluf,"" the output does not show a repeated ""blue.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" prompts the output of the color ""blue."" Furthermore, the rule seems to indicate that the number of times ""blue"" is outputted after ""bluf"" is related to the number of times the color preceding it is repeated.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"" repeated as many times as the color immediately before it has been repeated. If the color before it is not repeated, then the output is ""blue"" once.

Putting this into perspective:
- In the first input, ""red"" is present once before ""bluf,"" so the output is ""blue"" once.
- In the second input, ""red"" is present three times before ""bluf,"" resulting in ""blue"" being outputted twice (maybe this indicates some sort of maximum limit to the repetition rule or an error in the pattern).
- In the third input, ""yellow"" is present once before ""bluf,"" so the output is ""blue"" once.
- In the fourth input, ""red"" is present once before ""bluf,"" but since there is multiple ""dax"" (green) present afterwards, this input might not follow the basic rule pattern, or there may be another layer to the rule regarding subsequent inputs. However, ""blue"" follows only the ""red"" without repeating.
- In the fifth input, ""red"" is present once before ""bluf,"" so the output is ""blue"" once.

Given the inconsistency in the second input, I will conclude the meaning of ""bluf"" with the tentative rule based on the other inputs:

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"", with the number of times ""blue"" is outputted generally depending on the repetition of the color before it, with an irregularity observed in example two.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'walm,' we will look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs provided in the examples.

Let's break down each example:

1. ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""
   Here, ""dax"" seems to correspond to a single ""green,"" and ""walm"" to ""green green"" or repeating the color associated with the previous word.

2. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Following this pattern, ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" and after ""wif"" gives ""red red red."" Thus, 'walm' repeats the color of the word before it, three times.

3. ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue""
   We see ""dax"" and ""lug"" again, with their corresponding colors, followed by ""walm,"" which results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

4. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow""
   Once more, ""walm"" is repeating the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" three times.

5. ""zup wif dax walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red green green green""
   Each word has its own color, and ""walm"" again repeats the color of the preceding word, which in this case is ""dax,"" represented by ""green.""

The pattern suggested by these examples is that 'walm' repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm lug
    ",Output: red red red blue,red red red blue,True,177
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we need to look at the consistent patterns in each example. Analyzing the given input and output pairs, we can try to find a correspondence for ""lug"" in each output.

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to ""blue blue"" in the output.

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" precedes ""wif"" and ""walm,"" which correspond to ""blue red"" in the output.

3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to ""blue blue blue"" initially, and then ""lug"" is followed by ""wif,"" corresponding to ""blue red"" in the output.

4. Input: lug zup wif zup
   Output: blue yellow red yellow
   - ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to ""blue yellow"" in the output.

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""blue blue"" in the output after ""red"" for ""wif.""

If we examine the patterns where ""lug"" appears, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Additionally, it seems to translate to a single ""blue,"" regardless of what words follow or precede it. Let's write down the rule:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" represented by the word ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position or the words around it.

Therefore, the induction of the rule will be:

lug -> meaning. Blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green' in every example provided.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. There are no indications that the meaning of ""wif"" changes depending on context or other words around it. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"", we should first observe the output colors associated with each input containing ""zup"" and any patterns that may exist in the provided examples.

In the first input, ""zup dax walm,"" the output is ""yellow green green green."" From this example alone, we cannot isolate the meaning of ""zup"" as we have three other words and four colors. 

The second input offers more insight: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug."" The output is ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" By comparing it with the first example, we see that ""walm"" consistently results in the color green in the output, and it is unaffected by the position or other words around it. This suggests that ""lug"" likely corresponds to ""blue,"" since it is repeated and followed by blue in the output. ""Bluf"" does not appear in other examples, but within this context, it likely represents the color ""blue"" as well.

The third input, ""zup dax,"" with the output being ""yellow green,"" provides another direct correlation. ""Dax"" precedes ""green"" again, indicating ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" In each case where ""zup"" appears, the color yellow is associated with it.

The fourth example is similar: ""zup wif"" becomes ""yellow red."" Now we see that ""wif"" is associated with red without any doubt, as there are no other factors. The prediction made from the first example about what ""wif"" might mean is now reinforced.

The fifth input, ""dax zup,"" inversely to the third example, results in ""green yellow."" This solidifies the individual meanings of ""dax"" as ""green"" and ""zup"" as ""yellow.""

Through all these examples, ""zup"" is the common factor associated consistently with the color yellow, regardless of position or neighboring words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" outputs a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Considering each of the inputs and outputs:

- ""lug wif bluf"" becomes ""blue red red"" (repeating the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red"").
- ""zup bluf"" gives us ""yellow yellow"" (repeating the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow"").
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"" (repeating the color associated with the last ""zup"" before ""bluf,"" which is ""yellow"").
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" turns into ""yellow blue red green green red"" (repeating the color associated with ""dax"" before ""bluf,"" which is ""green"").
- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red"" (again, repeating the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red"").

Rule: bluf -> The meaning of bluf is to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the common pattern associated with its output in all given examples:

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax."" The output corresponding to these inputs are three yellows followed by a green, where ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is three yellows. There is no word after ""walm.""

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- In this case, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug."" The pattern is the same: the output of ""walm"" is three yellows, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green.

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output after ""lug"" is three blues, followed by ""wif,"" which is red, and ""lug"" again, which is blue.

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup."" The output corresponding to these inputs is three greens, followed by ""walm,"" which is also followed by ""zup,"" and the pattern repeats with three yellows.

Significantly, ""walm"" always corresponds to three repeated colors in the output. The color repeated is the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm,"" indicating that ""walm"" acts as a command or function that repeats the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color output associated with the prior word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words. There is no context given for the other words, but each consistently correlates with the same color every time they appear. 

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
From the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""zup"" by comparing inputs with their corresponding outputs. Let's examine each one:

- In the first input, ""zup dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue."" The common element is the presence of ""zup"" and the output ""yellow,"" so it's possible that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
- The second input repeats ""zup"" twice: ""zup dax zup lug"" gives ""yellow green yellow blue."" Each appearance of ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" which supports the initial deduction.
- The third and fourth inputs also feature ""zup"" followed by a color: ""zup lug dax"" results in ""yellow blue green,"" and ""zup wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red red."" Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The fifth input, ""zup walm dax lug,"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" In this case, the presence of ""zup walm"" yields two ""yellow"" outputs before the ""dax"" which yields ""green."" Here, ""dax"" is consistent with ""green,"" as in prior examples, and ""zup"" remains consistent with ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, ""bluf"" seems to produce an output color that corresponds to the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's how it breaks down based on the information provided:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" produces ""green green,"" indicating ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf lug wif"" produces ""green green blue red."" Again, ""bluf"" after ""dax"" gives another green. After ""lug,"" which gives blue, ""bluf"" produces blue.
- The third example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" showing ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" is repeating the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" gives ""blue red red green blue blue,"" indicating ""bluf"" mimics the color of ""wif"" to produce red, and it mimics the color of ""lug"" to produce blue.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" produces an output color that matches the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs with their outputs and look for patterns. Here's what we can observe from the examples given:

1. Whenever ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""
2. When ""wif"" and ""dax"" bracket ""walm"" (i.e., ""wif walm dax""), the output starts with ""red"" and ends with ""green.""
3. When ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" are present and ""walm"" is placed before ""wif,"" the last color is ""red"" while the rest follow the sequence that ""lug"" and ""dax"" would produce without ""walm.""

From these observations, ""walm"" could signify a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, up to three times. However, this interpretation doesn’t explain why ""wif walm dax"" produces ""red red red green"" instead of ""red red red.""

Instead, let's consider the possibility that ""walm"" serves to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions appears to correspond to the presence of ""dax,"" which causes a triple ""green"" repeat.

Here's a potential rule:

- ""walm"" -> repeat the last color mentioned, the number of repetitions dependent on specific triggers (for example, ""dax"" triggering three repetitions).

Let's test this rule with the given examples:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green"" is repeated three times because ""dax"" is before ""walm.""
2. ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax walm"" makes ""green"" repeat three times.
3. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""walm"" repeats this ""red"" twice, followed by a green for ""dax.""
4. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, and ""wif"" at the end turns to ""red.""

However, this rule does not explain why ""wif"" in the third example isn't repeated as it is in the second and fourth examples, which contrasts with the established pattern. If we cannot ignore this inconsistency, we might need additional examples or context to refine our rule.

Given this limitation, a rule that currently aligns with the provided examples is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the color ""green"" will be repeated three times. If not, the repetition pattern is not consistent, or additional information is needed to explain it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True,179
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in these examples. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can look for patterns in the examples provided. Each example has an input with one or more words translating into colors in the output.

Let's match each word with its corresponding color in the examples:

1. lug wif dax -> blue red green
   - lug = blue
   - wif = red
   - dax = green

2. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
   - wif = red
   - dax = green
   - bluf = red
   - zup = yellow

3. zup lug dax -> yellow blue green
   - zup = yellow
   - lug = blue
   - dax = green

4. dax zup dax -> green yellow green
   - dax = green
   - zup = yellow

5. lug dax lug wif -> blue green blue red
   - lug = blue
   - dax = green
   - wif = red

We can see that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input results in a red in the output. There is a one-to-one mapping regardless of the other words' presence. Hence, ""wif"" means ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine what ""bluf"" means, we need to analyze the examples and look for patterns or connections between the word ""bluf"" and the output colors.

In the first example, ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green red green yellow yellow."" We notice that ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""yellow"" in the sequence. However, just from this example, it's difficult to induce a rule, so let's examine the other examples.

In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow red red red."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow."" This is consistent with the yellow in the first example, but still insufficient to deduce a rule.

The third example, ""lug zup bluf dax,"" results in ""blue yellow yellow green."" Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow."" This consistency in the color yellow associated with ""bluf"" across different sequences is becoming more apparent.

The fourth example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" translates to ""red green yellow red green green."" In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"" in the sequence. This deviates from the yellow we've seen so far, but it’s worth noting that here ""bluf"" appears at the end once again, much like in the first example.

The fifth and final example, ""wif zup bluf lug,"" converts to ""red yellow yellow blue."" ""Bluf"" results in ""yellow"" once more, reinforcing the association we've seen in the majority of examples.

Despite the one instance where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" the predominant pattern is that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" especially when it does not occur at the end of the sequence. Therefore, we might conclude:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally means ""yellow,"" unless it appears at the end of the sequence, in which case it is ""green.""

However, with the data provided, we can only decisively conclude the association with ""yellow"" and not the conditional ""green"" at the end. The exception in the fourth example may require more examples to establish a pattern or could be an outlier.

Final rule based on the majority of examples:
bluf -> yellow
From the examples given, we can observe that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word right before it multiple times. Let's break down the inputs and outputs to see the pattern:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" the color blue is repeated three times.

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm"" the color yellow is repeated three times.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"" the color green is repeated three times.

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm"" the color yellow is repeated three times followed by the color corresponding to ""dax"" which is green.

5. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm"" the color red is repeated three times followed by the color corresponding to ""dax"" which is green.

Based on the above observations, it seems the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,180
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each instance it appears, regardless of its position or the context within the sentence.
Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the word ""green"" in the output. No matter its position in the input sentence, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns that correlate with changes in the output when ""wif"" is present.

1. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red

2. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

In these first three examples, we see that the presence of ""wif"" introduces a color (specifically red or yellow) to the output sequence that is not consistently related to the other words' colors (""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax""). We also see that ""wif"" is associated with red when it's in the first or second position and yellow when it's in the last position in the input.

4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

In this example, ""wif"" is the second word and it translates to red.

5. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

Lastly, in this example, ""wif"" is the first word and it translates to red.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" represents the color red when it comes before any other word in the input (or when it's the second word), and represents the color yellow when it is the last word in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red when it's the first or second word in the input, yellow when it's the last word.
From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" consistently. Regardless of its position in the sequence, it always translates to the same output. Here is the induction based on the input-output pairs:

Input: lug zup bluf dax
Output: blue yellow yellow green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" seems to be a typo or an untranslated word, possibly meant to be the same as ""lug"" (blue), given the output pattern
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: wif zup lug
Output: red yellow blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: dax wif zup
Output: green red yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" is untranslated but based on the output, repeated ""yellow"" suggests that ""walm"" could be a typo or alternative to ""zup,"" also meaning ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Given the examples, we can analyze them to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf.""

In the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
2. Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
3. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug -> Output: green green red yellow blue
4. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> Output: red green yellow red green green
5. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: green green yellow yellow green

Based on the outputs, we can see that the word immediately following ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. Additionally, we see that distinct words such as ""wif,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" are consistently associated with unique colors: ""red,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

Given this pattern, we conclude that the rule involving the nonce word ""bluf"" is that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that follows it. As such, we can define the meaning of ""bluf"" in this context as follows:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the following word.
Analyzing the examples provided where the nonce word ""walm"" appears, we can see that the output is always a series of the same color repeated a number of times. Specifically, the color is repeated as many times as there are syllables in the word preceding ""walm"". Below are the observations from the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" suggests that ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""dax"" (green) and repeats it for the number of syllables in ""dax"" (1 syllable, repeated 3 times).

2. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"" shows that ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) and repeats it for the number of syllables in ""zup"" (1 syllable, repeated 3 times).

3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" again shows the same pattern as in the previous example.

4. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow"" shows that ""walm"" takes the color associated with ""wif"" (red) and repeats it for the number of syllables in ""wif"" (1 syllable, repeated 3 times). The following ""zup"" does not influence the ""walm"" meaning.

5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"" confirms the pattern, with ""walm"" taking the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) and repeating it for the number of syllables in ""lug"" (1 syllable, repeated 3 times).

Based on these examples, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. Meaning: Take the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" and repeat it three times, regardless of the number of syllables in the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""lug"":

Rule: lug -> blue

Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" represents a color, more specifically the color green. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red regardless of its position in the sequence. Each instance of ""wif"" adds a ""red"" to the output.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be as follows:

Rule:
- ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".

Referring to each example:

- In the first example: ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"", with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".
- In the second example: ""zup lug zup lug wif"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue red"", with each ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".
- In the third example: ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"", with the two instances of ""zup"" both translating to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example: ""dax zup walm wif walm"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"", with ""zup"" again translating to ""yellow"".
- In the fifth example: ""dax zup wif"" translates to ""green yellow red"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Therefore:
zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of 'bluf,' we need to examine each instance where it appears and compare it to the output.

In all given examples, when ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" However, it seems to influence the color that follows it. For all instances of 'bluf', the color following it matches the previous color before 'bluf'. 

Let us examine:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug   
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue   
   (Here, the color before and after ""bluf"" is yellow, then it seems to set a ""blue"" pattern afterward)

2. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif   
   Output: blue red red blue red   
   (After ""bluf,"" the color is ""red,"" the same as it was before ""bluf"")

3. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif   
   Output: yellow blue red green green red   
   (After ""bluf,"" behavior can again be seen. ""Green"" corresponds to the color of ""dax"" before ""bluf,"" and therefore ""bluf"" seems to create a ""green"" repetition.)

4. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax   
   Output: blue green green red green   
   (Following ""bluf,"" ""green"" is repeated from ""dax."")

5. Input: zup bluf wif   
   Output: yellow yellow red   
   (""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow,"" which is the same as the color before it.)

From these observations, it seems ""bluf"" means ""repeat the next color"". However, it doesn't explain why ""bluf"" is translated to ""yellow"" itself. Based on the information provided and the repetition effect observed on the following color, one possible interpretation is to consider ""bluf"" as a command to repeat the next color, and by default, it is given the color ""yellow."" So we get bluf -> yellow, causes repeat.

Rule: bluf -> yellow, causes repeat of the next color term in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""walm"" results in repeating the color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before ""walm"". Here’s a breakdown of each example:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Explanation: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats the blue three times.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   Explanation: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the yellow three times. ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Explanation: Again, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" repeats the yellow three times, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" repeats red.

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" repeats the red three times, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats the green three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue."" In each instance where the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is included in the output at the corresponding position. Thus, we can construct the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green.
From examining the examples given:

- In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" we can see that ""wif"" is placed at the end and corresponds to ""red.""
- The second example, ""lug zup wif lug,"" translates to ""blue yellow red blue,"" shows ""wif"" is in the middle and again corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" results in ""green green red yellow red,"" with ""wif"" appearing twice, each time corresponding to ""red.""
- The fourth example, ""zup wif walm lug,"" which translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" includes ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"" once again.
- The fifth example, ""dax wif,"" becomes ""green red,"" where ""wif"" also equates to ""red.""

Based on this information, it's clear that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" In each case, regardless of what other words are present, the presence of ""zup"" always results in the word ""yellow"" appearing in the output. Here is the deduction based on each example:

- ""wif zup"" outputs ""red yellow,"" where the inclusion of ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" being part of the output.
- ""zup"" on its own results in a single ""yellow.""
- ""lug walm zup"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow,"" where again, ""zup"" corresponds to the ""yellow"" at the end.
- ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow."" The presence of ""zup"" correlates with one instance of ""yellow."" It does not account for the second ""yellow,"" which might be due to the presence of ""bluf.""
- ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red,"" where ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The presence of the word ""zup"" in the input always results in the word ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to compare the inputs to their respective outputs and identify the pattern.

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug  
Output: green green red yellow blue  
Pattern: green is assigned to dax and red to wif, yellow to zup, and blue to lug. bluf corresponds with the color mentioned before it (green).

Input: zup bluf  
Output: yellow yellow  
Pattern: bluf again corresponds with the color mentioned before it (yellow).

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax  
Output: blue green green red green  
Pattern: Like the previous patterns, bluf corresponds with the color mentioned before it (green).

Input: wif bluf  
Output: red red  
Pattern: Once more, bluf corresponds with the color mentioned before it (red).

Input: dax bluf wif lug  
Output: green green red blue  
Pattern: Again, bluf corresponds with the color mentioned before it (green).

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" duplicates the color assigned to the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word immediately before it.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a possible rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by examining the correspondence between the input and the output sequences. Let's analyze the provided input-output pairs:

Input: wif walm lug bluf | Output: red red red blue blue
Input: lug walm wif zup wif | Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
Input: lug walm dax | Output: blue blue blue green
Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow

The output sequence associated with ""walm"" in each example is a repetition of three of the color that immediately follows the word ""walm."" Here's the pattern:

1. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red (followed by the color corresponding to ""lug,"" which is blue)
2. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue (followed by ""wif,"" which is red)
3. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue (followed by ""dax,"" which is green)
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red (the color immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated thrice)
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (the color corresponding to ""zup"" is repeated three times, as there is no following word)

Based on the repetition occurring immediately after the use of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can derive the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that follows ""walm"" in the sequence to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the last word, then the color associated with the word preceding it is repeated three times.

Therefore, walm -> causes the following color to repeat three times. If at the end, causes the preceding color to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    ",Output: blue green blue blue blue,blue green green green blue,False,183
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we need to examine each instance of its occurrence and the corresponding output color. Let's break it down:

1. When ""dax"" is at the beginning:
   - dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
   - dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
   - dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red

2. When ""dax"" is in the middle:
   - wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow green blue

In examples where ""dax"" appears at the beginning, it is followed by ""green"" in the output, and in examples where ""dax"" appears later, it generates ""green"" after its occurrence within the output.

Based on the instances provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" is linked to the output color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is present in the input, a ""green"" appears in the output after the word's position.

Rule: When ""dax"" appears, it translates to ""green"" in the output sequence, following its position in the input.

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can reason about the word ""wif"" by looking at the correlation between its appearance and the colors in the output. We notice that every instance of ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red"" in the output. Here is the pattern that emerges:

- Every time ""wif"" appears, ""red"" follows in the output sequence.
- ""wif"" appears to be independent of position (beginning, middle, end of the input sequence).
- ""wif"" doesn't seem to affect the color output of other words; for instance, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" etc., irrespective of whether ""wif"" precedes or follows them.

So, based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Each unique nonce word (lug, dax, wif, walm) maps to a specific color irrespective of their position in the sequence, and ""zup"" consistently maps to yellow.
Inspecting the examples, it appears that 'bluf' takes on the color of the word that follows it in the pattern. Let's go through each example to confirm this hypothesis:

1. ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" -> ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
   - Here bluf is followed by 'wif', which is represented as 'red'. Accordingly, bluf is given the output 'yellow', which actually corresponds to 'zup', the word before 'bluf'. This is consistent with subsequent examples.
   
2. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""
   - Here bluf is followed by 'wif', which is 'red'. However, bluf's output is 'green', representing 'dax', which precedes it.  
   
3. ""dax lug bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue green""
   - In this instance, 'bluf' is again followed by 'dax', which is 'green'. Consistently, 'bluf' is represented as 'blue', showing that it took on the color of 'lug', the word before it.
   
4. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
   - In this example, 'bluf' follows 'zup', which is 'yellow' and hence bluf also outputs 'yellow', the color representing the word before it, 'zup'.

5. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" -> ""red green red red yellow red""
   - Similarly, in this sequence, 'bluf' is followed by 'zup' which is 'yellow', but 'bluf' is represented by 'red', the color for 'wif', which precedes 'bluf'.

Based on these observations, the rule for 'bluf' seems to be that it takes on the color associated with the word that precedes it, not the one that follows it.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the preceding word in the sequence.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should examine the patterns in which different inputs correspond to different outputs. Let's analyze each example closely.

- ""lug zup dax walm"" results in ""blue yellow green green green""
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red""
- ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green""
- ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red""

From the above examples, we can deduce the following:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" precedes ""red"" and doubles the color output
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

Now, looking at the occurrences of ""walm"", we see:
- In the first and the second example when ""walm"" follows a color, it seems to repeat that color three times.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which doubles the color output; thus, ""walm"" following this pattern results in three ""reds"" after the doubling.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the output is three ""yellows.""
- In the fifth example, we have two instances of ""walm,"" each producing ""red"" three times after the doubled output from ""wif.""

Considering the consistent pattern of repetition in the outputs related to ""walm,"" the rule seems to indicate that ""walm"" repeats the color generated by the preceding word thrice.

Rule: walm -> repeats the previous color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,184
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever 'lug' appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color 'blue'.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the outputs, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" is used in an input, the output contains ""red"" in the same position.

Rule:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.
By examining each example, we can attempt to discern a pattern that relates the input words to the output colors. 

1. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow red green blue

3. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

4. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

5. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red

Reviewing the examples, we see that ""bluf"" never corresponds to the same color across different examples: it is green in the first, yellow in the second and third, and blue in the fourth and fifth. What we can deduce is that ""bluf"" is likely a variable dependent on position or surrounding context, as it changes colors in different positions and differs when next to other words.

Observe that ""dax"" always corresponds to green and ""lug"" always corresponds to blue, so their outputs are consistent regardless of where they appear.

The ""bluf"" outputs are as follows:
- In the first line, ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow) and is green, taking on the color of ""dax.""
- In the second line, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" (yellow) on both sides and outputs yellow, matching ""zup.""
- In the third line, ""bluf"" is after ""zup"" (yellow) and outputs yellow again, suggesting that it might take the color of the preceding word when followed by ""zup.""
- In the fourth line, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and outputs blue, potentially indicating that here it takes the color of the word before it.
- In the fifth line, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is again blue, further supporting the idea that it may take on the color of the preceding word.

From this, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Let's examine the provided examples to see the pattern:

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" follows it, resulting in two additional ""blue"". ""dax"" corresponds to green.

2. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" follows it, resulting in two additional ""red"". ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" follows it, resulting in two additional ""yellow"".

3. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow' two additional times.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two additional times.

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two additional times. ""lug"" then corresponds to blue and ""wif"" to red.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the previous word two additional times.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif zup
    ",Output: yellow red yellow,yellow red yellow,True,185
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
To deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the word ""dax,"" let's look at the given examples and their corresponding outputs, isolating the occurrences of ""dax"":

- In the first example, ""wif dax bluf"" translates into ""red green green."" Here, ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") and followed by ""bluf"" (which corresponds to ""green"").
  
- In the second example, ""dax lug wif"" becomes ""green blue red."" ""Dax"" comes before ""lug"" (translated as ""blue"") and after an implicit start of the sequence (no preceding color).

- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax"" becomes ""red red green."" Here, ""dax"" is preceded by ""bluf"" (red) and is at the end of the sequence.

- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" ""Dax"" is preceded by ""bluf"" (red) and followed by ""walm"" (which corresponds to ""green green"").

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red."" Here, ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") and followed by ""walm"" (green green) and ""lug"" (blue).

From these examples, we can discern a relationship based on the position of ""dax"" and the colors that precede and follow it. The occurrences of ""dax"" are associated with the color ""green."" Let's examine the possible rule:

1. When ""dax"" appears after ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" which results in ""red"" output, ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" appears at the beginning or end of the sequence or is not immediately preceded by ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" the output next to ""dax"" remains ""green.""

However, there is a slight discrepancy with the second example, where ""dax"" should theoretically be followed by a ""green"" based on our rule, but the color that follows is ""blue."" This discrepancy may arise from a rule we have not identified yet, but based on the other instances, the rule for ""dax"" seems consistent with the color ""green.""

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, generally following the pattern where colors that come after ""dax"" in the sequence are also ""green,"" unless influenced by another rule not clearly identified in these examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns that relate the input with its corresponding output:

1. Considering the first input: ""dax walm wif dax"" outputs ""green green green red green."" If we assume ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" then the introduction of ""wif"" coincides with a change of color from ""green"" to ""red.""

2. In the second input: ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red."" If ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" does not correspond to ""red"" (based on other inputs), the appearance of ""wif"" once again precedes the color ""red.""

3. The third example: ""dax wif zup dax"" gives ""green red yellow green."" Here ""dax"" is consistently ""green,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" The ""wif"" term is again followed by ""red.""

4. For the fourth sequence: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" the output is ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, aside from the established colors for ""dax"" and ""zup,"" we see that ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue."" Notably, only the first color after ""wif"" is ""red""; the following colors correspond to other non-wif words.

5. In the last case: ""wif lug dax,"" the output is ""red blue green."" Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" and ""dax"" by ""green,"" as before. The term ""wif"" stands alone at the start and is followed by ""red.""

From the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to a pattern where the output color after ""wif"" is ""red"" (except when ""wif"" is at the beginning or end of the sequence, but more examples would be needed to definitively determine its behavior in those positions). The rule doesn't seem to apply to subsequent color terms not immediately following ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> meaning. ""wif"" means that the next color in the output sequence will be red.
Examining the given examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow, irrespective of its position in the sequence. Here is the rule deduced from the examples:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow in every instance.
Based on the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows it, ""yellow"" is repeated, resulting in ""yellow yellow."" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to introduce a repetition of ""red,"" hence ""red red red.""
- In ""wif bluf lug,"" ""wif"" is again ""red,"" and with ""bluf"" following, it is repeated as ""red red."" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" without another word following, the pattern of duplicating the color holds. ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated once due to ""bluf.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" the same rule applies. ""lug"" is ""blue,"" then ""blue"" is repeated due to ""bluf.""
- Finally, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" shows that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" with ""bluf"" causing ""red"" to repeat.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to analyze each input and its corresponding output, looking for patterns:

1. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
2. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
3. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
5. dax wif walm -> green red red red

In the first example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" and the color green is repeated thrice following the single occurrence of green associated with ""dax."" In the second example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" and the color red is repeated thrice, which corresponds to the single red associated with ""wif."" In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the color yellow is repeated thrice, again following the pattern where the color associated with the word in front of ""walm"" is repeated thrice.

In the fourth example, we see ""lug walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue."" Here, the color blue is associated with ""lug"" and repeated thrice. Lastly, in the fifth example, ""dax wif walm,"" the output is ""green red red red."" Green is associated with ""dax,"" and red with ""wif""; ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and red is repeated thrice.

From the patterns observed, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,186
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided. Regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the input sequence or the other words present, the output always includes ""blue"" corresponding to the occurrence of ""lug.""
Rule: dax -> green

This rule is supported by the fact that in every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, the output associated with it is ""green."" There are no exceptions to this pattern in the examples given.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following assignments for each word:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow (repeated for emphasis or plurality, based on the second example)
- wif -> red

Every instance where ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is used in the corresponding output position. There are no examples that contradict this assignment.

Rule: wif -> red
Observing the different examples provided where the word ""zup"" is used and the outputs that correspond to them, we can look for a pattern or consistency to deduce the meaning or rule applied to ""zup."" Based on the data:

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to the first color ""yellow.""

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
- When ""zup"" is second, it corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
- When ""zup"" is last, it also corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
- Once again, when ""zup"" is second, it corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- Here, ""zup"" is first and corresponds to ""yellow.""

In each example, regardless of its position (first, second, etc.), ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Hence, the rule we can derive is:
zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can examine the output pattern to determine the implication of the nonce word ""bluf.""

In each instance where ""bluf"" appears, the word immediately before it dictates the output color, and the output for ""bluf"" itself is always ""blue."" Here's the breakdown:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

4. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

5. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

From this analysis, it appears that ""bluf"" results in the output ""blue"" regardless of the word immediately before it, suggesting that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Rule: walm -> the color associated with the prior word repeated for the number of times the prior word is stated before walm.

For example:
- In ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and since 'dax' appears once before 'walm', the output following it is 'green' repeated three times (since 'walm' appears to replicate the preceding color thrice, based on other examples).
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and the output is 'blue' repeated three times.
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" is associated with the color red, and the output is 'red' repeated three times.
- In ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" the word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is associated with green, hence 'green' is repeated three times.
- In ""wif walm zup walm,"" the first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which produces 'red' repeated three times, and the second ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" thus 'yellow' is repeated three times as well.

Hence, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

    ",Output: green yellow blue,green yellow yellow,False,187
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the meaning can be deduced as follows:

1. ""lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue green green,"" which implies that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
2. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" and since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" must correspond to ""blue.""
3. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow,"" and here ""lug"" is again translated as ""blue.""
4. ""lug wif lug wif lug"" translates to ""blue red blue red blue,"" reinforcing the notion that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
5. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when it stands alone.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" appears to correspond to the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" is presented in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output. The other words also correspond to colors as seen in the examples (""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""), but ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" irrespective of the position in the list.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"". Every time ""wif"" is in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" In every example provided, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue."" 

bluf -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern in the outputs that corresponds to the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs:

- When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red"" or ""blue,"" depending on the adjacent words.
- When ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"" or ""yellow,"" depending on the adjacent words.
- When ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""

Notice that the presence of ""walm"" always results in repeating the color that precedes it. We can see this correlation:

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" leads to ""red red green green green."" Here ""walm"" duplicates the ""green"" that corresponds to ""dax.""
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" Here ""walm"" duplicates the ""red"" that corresponds to ""wif.""
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" leads to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" and here ""walm"" duplicates the ""yellow"" from ""zup.""
- ""zup dax walm"" leads to ""yellow green green green,"" with ""walm"" duplicating the ""green"" from ""dax.""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""walm"" duplicating the ""yellow"" from ""zup.""

Given the pattern, we can deduce that the rule is: ""walm"" -> repeating the color output of the preceding word.

Rule: walm duplicates the color output of the word that directly precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif
    ",Output: red green red,red green red,True,188
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we have several instances of ""lug"" in various contexts and the corresponding outputs. Here's what we can deduce:

- Whenever ""lug"" is present, the output always contains ""blue.""
- ""Lug"" does not seem to change its output based on its position in the input string; it consistently maps to ""blue"" regardless of whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.
- The presence of other words in the sequence does not seem to influence the output for ""lug""; ""lug"" always maps to ""blue"" irrespective of the other words (e.g., ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""walm"").

Given this information, the most straightforward induction for the meaning of ""lug"" based on the examples is:

lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the input string.
dax -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax means ""green"".
To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" from the given examples, let's look for the pattern in each input-output pair:

1. Input: zup wif lug dax | Output: yellow red blue green
2. Input: wif zup dax bluf | Output: red yellow green green
3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug | Output: yellow red green green green blue
4. Input: lug dax zup lug wif | Output: blue green yellow blue red
5. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue

From these examples, let's identify which words correlate to which colors:

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue.
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green.

In every instance where ""wif"" appears, the color red is outputted in the corresponding position. Thus, it seems that ""wif"" is consistently linked to the color red regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Here's why:

1. When ""zup"" appears alone, the output is ""yellow.""
2. When ""zup"" appears after ""lug,"" the output sequence always starts with ""yellow"" following ""blue.""
3. When ""zup"" appears before other words (aside from ""lug""), it still translates to ""yellow,"" followed by the translation of the other words.

Therefore, the rule we can infer is:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning or rules associated with the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns of the output in relation to the given inputs.

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

By comparing the inputs and outputs we can notice that:

1. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
2. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
3. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
4. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
5. ""walm"" translates to a repetition of green, hence we deduce it means ""green green"".

Now, looking at ""bluf"":

- It is mapped to ""red"" when it follows ""wif"".
- It is mapped to ""green"" when it follows ""dax"".
- It does not follow ""zup"", ""lug"", or ""walm"" in any example, so no direct relationship can be established with them.

Notice that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:
Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the sequence. If ""wif"" comes before it, ""bluf"" is red; if ""dax"" comes before it, ""bluf"" is green. There is no information about what happens if other words precede ""bluf"".

So, bluf -> the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the word 'walm' seems to cause the word before it to be repeated three times in the output, in the translated color form. Each instance of the word preceding 'walm' is translated to its respective color.

Here is the analysis:

- ""dax walm wif zup"" produces ""green green green red yellow"". In this sentence, 'dax' is translated to 'green' and repeated three times due to 'walm', 'wif' is translated to 'red', and 'zup' to 'yellow'.
- ""zup walm dax lug"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". 'zup' becomes 'yellow' and is repeated three times, 'dax' to 'green', and 'lug' to 'blue'.
- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here again, 'zup' is repeated three times in its color form due to 'walm'.
- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"". Similarly, 'lug' translates to 'blue' and is repeated thrice.
- ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red"". 'wif' is repeated as 'red'.

Taken together, the rule for 'walm' is:

Rule: 'walm' -> Repeat the color translation of the word immediately preceding 'walm' three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True,189
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. There are no examples suggesting that ""lug"" has any additional meaning or that its meaning is context-dependent. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a consistent correlation between certain words and specific colors. Observe the following associations:

- Every instance of ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" when it appears, corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" when it appears, corresponds to the output ""red.""
- It is noticed that the word ""zup"" correlates with the output ""yellow.""

Therefore, by examining the input and output pairs, we can deduce the rule that these words are placeholders for colors, as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position relative to the other colors. Hence, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's compare the outputs across different inputs where the only common element is the word ""zup.""

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to the final color ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   Here, ""zup"" again corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   In this case, ""zup"" is paired with ""yellow"" and it influences the following word to also correspond to ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   Once more, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Again, ""zup"" turns into the color ""yellow"" and the following patterns remain consistent with previous examples.

From these observations, we can infer:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" It seems to stand alone and does not influence the color mapping of the words that come after it, except in the case of sequence ""zup walm,"" where no other colors are introduced and ""walm"" is repeated in the color ""yellow.""

Therefore:

zup -> yellow
To figure out the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided.

In each instance, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Yet, in the third example, ""bluf"" is at the end and corresponds to ""red."" This implies that ""bluf"" might not have a fixed meaning but could be dependent on its position or the context in which it's used.

Let's analyze the position of ""bluf"":

1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
4. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
5. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green

When ""bluf"" is in the second position, it corresponds to ""green."" In the third example, when it's in the last position, it corresponds to ""red."" We also see that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Let's test the position theory using ""dax"" since it's the only word we're certain about:

- In examples 1, 2, and 4, ""dax"" is in the first position, followed by ""bluf,"" and both are translated as ""green.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" is in the second position and the last position, translating to ""green"" in both cases.

Given this, it seems like the word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" and ""red"" when it's at the end. However, the third rule does not apply to example 4 where ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif lug,"" and both are translated to ""green red.""

Since we don't have an example of ""bluf"" in the first position, it's challenging to confirm if its position solely affects its color representation.

Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

Rule: ""bluf"" likely means ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax,"" and it means ""red"" when it is the last word in the sequence.

Thus:

bluf -> meaning:
- Following ""dax"" -> green
- Last word -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that when the word ""walm"" is presented after another word, the output is a repetition of three colors corresponding to the color of the first word. The first word determines the color outcome, and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated three times. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> Output of ""green blue blue blue yellow red"" implies ""dax"" corresponds to green, but ""walm"" after ""lug"" changes the output to three instances of blue.
2. ""dax walm"" repeated thrice -> Output of ""green green green"" each time implies that ""walm"" following ""dax"" repeats the color green associated with ""dax"".
3. ""wif walm"" -> Output of ""red red red"" implies that ""walm"" following ""wif"" repeats the color red associated with ""wif"".

Considering these examples, the rule seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is three instances of whatever color is associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green,green red yellow green,True,190
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we need to look for patterns where the word appears in the inputs and the corresponding outputs:
- In scenarios where ""lug"" appears, the output is always ""blue.""
- The position of ""lug"" in the input doesn't affect its output even when it appears at the beginning, middle, or end of a sequence.

Looking at each of the following scenarios where ""lug"" is used:
1. ""wif lug"" correlates with ""red blue"" and ""lug zup"" with ""blue yellow.""
2. The sequence ""dax lug zup"" translates to ""green blue yellow.""
3. ""wif lug dax"" becomes ""red blue green.""
4. ""dax zup lug"" is represented as ""green yellow blue.""
5. ""lug zup bluf dax"" means ""blue yellow yellow green.""

From the above evidence, it is clear that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Thus, we can deduce the following:

Rule: lug -> blue
To figure out the meaning of ""dax,"" let's take a closer look at the pattern in the provided examples.

Example 1:
- Input: dax zup walm wif walm
- Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Example 2:
- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
- Output: green green red yellow blue

Example 3:
- Input: wif walm dax zup
- Output: red red red green yellow

Example 4:
- Input: dax
- Output: green

Example 5:
- Input: wif zup walm dax zup
- Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Looking at the outputs, we can see that every time the word ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output color is green. Regardless of its position in the input and regardless of the words that follow or precede it, ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule:
Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

So:
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, wif consistently translates to the word ""red."" However, it is important to note that there seems to be a pattern or a set of rules concerning the other words in the sequence and their corresponding outputs. Here is the observed pattern:

- wif always outputs ""red.""
- The word following wif seems to influence the next output; for instance, wif followed by ""walm"" or ""bluf"" results in another ""red.""
- Other words such as ""zup"" and ""dax"" consistently result in ""yellow"" and ""green,"" respectively, regardless of their position in the input sequence.
- The word ""lug"" is unique in the examples provided and its presence in an input sequence results in ""blue.""

Hence, wif -> ""red"".

Rule:
- wif translates to ""red.""
- The presence of certain words after ""wif"" can result in specific colors: 
   - ""walm"" or ""bluf"" after ""wif"" results in ""red.""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- The sequence of additional words does not affect their corresponding output colors; they remain consistent.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by looking at the patterns of input and corresponding output. 

In the first example, ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" Since ""walm"" appears twice and ""lug"" once, yet the output for both words is ""yellow,"" it suggests both map to the same color. We can also see that ""zup"" precedes the sequence of yellows, hinting that ""zup"" might also translate to ""yellow.""

In the second example, ""wif lug zup"" translates to ""red blue yellow."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" showing that ""lug"" has a different meaning when not preceded by ""walm,"" and ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow.""

The third example, ""zup wif,"" translates to ""yellow red,"" which supports our previous findings that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

In the fourth example, ""wif zup dax"" translates to ""red yellow green."" Here we see ""zup"" is again ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is introduced as ""green.""

Finally, the fifth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" In this example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red,"" and ""lug zup walm"" to ""blue yellow yellow,"" which further confirms that ""walm"" is tied to the repetition of ""yellow"" and that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" when followed by ""walm.""

Based on the patterns from the examples, the rule for ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""yellow.""

zup -> meaning. Rule: zup translates to ""yellow.""
bluf -> repeated color

Rule: The word immediately preceding ""bluf"" determines the color to be repeated. For example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and thus the color red is repeated in the output due to ""bluf.""

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because ""wif"" means red, and ""bluf"" doubles it.
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" because ""dax"" means green, and ""bluf"" doubles it.
- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"" because ""wif"" means red, ""lug"" means blue, and ""bluf"" doubles the red.
- ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue yellow red red green"" because each word translates to a color and ""bluf"" doubles the color of the word before it, which is ""wif"" for red.
- ""zup lug bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue blue"" because ""lug"" means blue, ""zup"" means yellow, and ""bluf"" doubles the blue.
From the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" generates a sequence of the color blue. The number of times ""blue"" appears in the output seems to correspond with the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. ""Walm"" produces a series of ""blue"" colors that is one less than the number of words to the left of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Here is how the rule applies to each given example:

1. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   Explanation: ""Walm"" appears in the fifth position of the input sequence and results in the last two colors before the final word being blue (that is, 4 words to its left, hence 4 - 1 = 3 instances of blue).

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Explanation: ""Walm"" is second in the sequence, thus it leads to two instances of blue.

3. Input: lug walm (Repeated example)
   Output: blue blue blue
   Explanation: Identical to the second example, ""walm"" generates two blues.

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   Explanation: Here, ""walm"" occupies the fourth position, generating three instances of blue (4 - 1 = 3).

5. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Explanation: ""Walm"" is third in the sequence, resulting in producing two instances of blue as per the rule (3 - 1 = 2).

So based on the examples and the analysis of ""walm"" in different positions, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" produces a number of instances of the color blue that is one less than its position in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> Generates (n - 1) instances of the color blue, where n is the number of words to the left of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug dax wif walm
    ",Output: red blue green red red red,red blue green red red red,True,191
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the provided examples, it seems that each word corresponds to a color. The direct translation of ""lug"" in various examples consistently corresponds to ""blue."" Here are the translations based on the examples:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow (it appears to be another form for ""zup"" or a typographical error in the input)

Rule: In the given context, ""lug"" means ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" To verify this:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug zup wif,"" and the output is ""green"" followed by other colors correlating to the other words.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is at the beginning, and ""green"" is the first color in the output.
- The third example has only ""dax,"" and the output is solely ""green.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""dax"" is embedded within other words and the corresponding position in the output is ""green.""

Hence, the rule is: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the color 'red' in the output. Regardless of the context or other words that precede or follow 'wif,' the output for 'wif' remains the same. Here's the pattern that emerges:

- 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green'
- 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'
- 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue'
- 'walm' seems to be a repeater of the previous word's corresponding color
- 'bluf' seems to correspond to the color 'green'

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word 'wif' translates to the color 'red' in the output, irrespective of its position or the other words around it.
zup -> meaning: ""yellow""

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should analyze the patterns in the given examples and the corresponding outputs. The input words are listed alongside their output colors, and we will try to find any correlation or rule that applies consistently across these examples.

Example analysis:

1. In the first example, ""dax zup lug bluf"" produced ""green yellow blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, and its corresponding color is ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" resulted in ""blue blue blue red red."" The output has one more color than the input. However, ""bluf"" still corresponds with ""red,"" which is repeated as the final two output colors (""red red"").

3. The third example, ""wif bluf lug,"" gave us ""red red blue."" Again, the word ""bluf"" aligns with the ""red"" color but is repeated twice.

4. The fourth example, ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" In this instance, ""bluf"" correlates with a double occurrence of ""blue.""

5. The fifth example, ""wif zup bluf,"" became ""red yellow yellow."" Once again, ""bluf"" aligns with a repeated color, ""yellow"" this time.

Rule:
Upon inspecting these examples, we can infer that the nonce word ""bluf"" induces a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. For instance, if ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color ""red,"" the output includes ""red"" twice. Similarly, if it follows ""dax,"" which maps to ""green,"" we would expect the output to be ""green"" twice. Thus, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the previous color in the output sequence.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.
Analyzing the given examples, we can identify a pattern based on the correspondence between the input and the output colors. It seems that the word 'walm' corresponds to a sequence of colors in the output. Let's observe the inputs and outputs closely:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'bluf' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
   - Following 'walm', there is an additional 'green'

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
   - Following 'zup', there is an additional 'yellow' before 'walm'
   - Following 'walm', there are two additional 'yellow'

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - Following 'walm', there is one additional 'red'
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
   - Following 'walm', there is an additional 'red'

5. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   - 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
   - Following 'walm', there are two additional 'yellow'
   - 'dax' corresponds to 'green'

From these examples, it is evident that 'walm' causes a repeat of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. The number of repetitions equals the number of times the preceding color has appeared before 'walm'. 

For instance:
- In example 1, 'bluf' corresponds to 'red,' and it appears once before 'walm'; thus, 'walm' adds one more 'red'.
- In example 2, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' and it appears twice before 'walm'; thus, 'walm' adds two additional 'yellow'.
- In example 4, 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' and it appears once before 'walm'; thus, 'walm' adds one 'red'.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word by the number of times that color has appeared before 'walm' in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow blue,True,192
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at the patterns in the given examples:

Example 1:
Input: dax
Output: green

From this example, we can assume that ""dax"" alone translates to ""green.""

Example 2:
Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm zup lug,"" the repeated ""green"" suggests that ""walm"" and ""zup"" also result in ""green,"" but ""lug"" changes the output to ""yellow blue.""

Example 3:
Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Here, we see the pattern of ""green"" repeated for each occurrence of ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup,"" with an additional output of ""yellow"" for each ""walm.""

Example 4:
Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

The order has changed, but ""lug"" now results in ""blue"" when it comes before ""dax."" ""Dax"" and ""walm"" both still result in ""green.""

Example 5:
Input: wif dax zup dax
Output: red green yellow green

Here, a new word ""wif"" results in ""red,"" ""dax"" maintains its ""green"" meaning, while ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" despite previously resulting in ""green"" when following ""dax.""

From these examples, we can induce that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" but it also seems to influence the following words to a degree, with ""walm"" and ""zup"" sometimes translating to ""green"" as well unless they are repeated or altered by the context (as in the last example where ""zup"" changes to ""yellow"").

Given the complexity of the inputs and the variable outputs of other words like ""walm"" and ""zup"" based on context, a clear pattern for those words isn't evident yet. However, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" unaffected by their position or the words that follow.

Rule:
dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce a rule for the meaning of ""zup."" Let's analyze each example:

Example 1:
- Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Example 2:
- Input: dax zup
- Output: green yellow

Example 3:
- Input: zup lug
- Output: yellow blue

Example 4:
- Input: zup wif zup dax
- Output: yellow red yellow green

Example 5:
- Input: dax zup bluf
- Output: green yellow yellow

In these examples, every time the word ""zup"" appears, it corresponds with the color ""yellow."" No matter what word follows ""zup,"" the output remains ""yellow"" as long as ""zup"" is present.

Thus, it appears that the rule for ""zup"" is that it directly corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. It's clear that each non-nonce word corresponds to a color: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The nonce word ""bluf"" should also correspond to a color based on the outputs given.

Let's consider each instance:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow yellow,"" which is the color corresponding to the word ""walm"" and ""zup."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red red,"" it's not immediately clear what ""bluf"" stands for here.

- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" alone corresponds to ""red,"" the same as ""wif.""

- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" which might suggest that ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" like ""lug.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow red,"" again showing that ""bluf"" might correspond to ""yellow,"" like ""zup.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" which once again aligns with ""zup"" being ""yellow,"" suggesting ""bluf"" may also mean ""yellow.""

Given the inconsistencies in what color ""bluf"" could represent, it appears that ""bluf"" reflects the color of the word that comes before it. Therefore, ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the last non-nonce word that appears before it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf.""

For example:
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" represents ""red"" because ""wif"" represents ""red.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" represents ""blue"" because ""lug"" represents ""blue.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" represents ""yellow"" because ""zup"" represents ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" were to come first or there were no words before it, we do not have information from the given examples to predict its output.
In order to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the given examples and their outputs:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
3. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

Looking at the examples:

- In example 1, the word after ""walm"" is not provided, yet three ""yellow"" colors follow ""walm"" in the output.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output has three ""green"" colors followed by ""red"".
- In example 3, the pattern is similar to example 2, where ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and leads to three colors identical to the color that precedes ""walm"" followed by ""red"".
- In example 4, ""walm"" occurs twice and both times it is followed by repetitions of the color that precedes it, with three instances of ""green"".
- In example 5, the output that corresponds with ""walm"" is three ""red"" which is the output for the word ""wif"" that comes after ""walm"".

It seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word before it three times. When it appears at the end of a sequence, it repeats the last color mentioned. If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", the rule changes slightly to involve the color of ""wif"" (which is ""red"") being repeated instead.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times. If followed by ""wif"", repeat the color ""red"" three times instead.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif bluf lug walm dax lug dax
    ",Output: red red blue blue blue green blue green green,red red blue blue blue green blue green,False,193
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Explanation:
From the given examples, each time the word 'lug' appears in the input, the word 'blue' appears in the output. Regardless of the other words and their respective outputs, 'lug' consistently maps to 'blue'.

Let's verify the rule with each example:

- Input: zup lug
  Output: yellow blue
  Rule Confirmation: 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'

- Input: lug wif zup wif walm
  Output: blue red yellow red red red
  Rule Confirmation: The first 'lug' corresponds to the first 'blue'

- Input: wif lug dax walm
  Output: red blue green green green
  Rule Confirmation: 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' in between 'red' and 'green'

- Input: lug walm
  Output: blue blue blue
  Rule Confirmation: The first 'lug' corresponds to the first 'blue', with 'walm' consistently mapping to 'blue' as well

- Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
  Output: blue red blue green green
  Rule Confirmation: Both 'lug' instances correspond to the 'blue' in the output

Therefore, the rule is that 'lug' means 'blue'.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green in each example. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

The other nonce words correspond to their own colors, as seen in the additional context given. For example, ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""lug"" with blue, ""wif"" with red, and ""bluf"" with green. ""Walm"" seems to represent the color yellow based on the recurring output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by analyzing the patterns in input and output sequences.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- Here, ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""yellow red.""

Input: wif zup lug wif
Output: red yellow blue red
- In this sequence, ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow,"" and given the previous example, ""lug"" must correspond to ""blue.""

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- This is the same as the first two words of the second example, reaffirming the pattern.

Input: zup wif zup dax
Output: yellow red yellow green
- ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red,"" and the second occurrence of ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Dax"" at the end corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
- ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" the subsequent ""zup"" also results in ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" based on the second example.

Based on this repeated pattern, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" in the examples is consistently translated to the color red, independent of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the examples given and look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: wif walm dax - Output: red red red green
2. Input: zup wif walm lug - Output: yellow red red red blue
3. Input: dax walm - Output: green green green
4. Input: zup bluf wif walm - Output: yellow yellow red red red
5. Input: zup wif lug zup walm - Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

The word ""walm"" seems to present a pattern where it causes a repetition of the color that would be assigned to the word immediately before it:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to red, then ""walm"" also corresponds to red.
2. ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm"" we see red repeated.
3. ""dax"" corresponds to green, then ""walm"" also corresponds to green.
4. ""wif"" corresponds to red, then ""walm"" also corresponds to red.
5. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, then ""walm"" causes a repetition of yellow.

Based on this pattern, the meaning of ""walm"" is likely associated with the repetition of the output color that corresponds to the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example given.
Considering the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by observing its corresponding outputs in each case:

1. lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> blue red red green blue blue
2. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
3. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
4. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
5. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue

From these examples, we can identify the following patterns:
- When ""dax"" follows ""lug"", ""wif"", or ""bluf"", it translates to ""green"".
- ""lug"", ""wif"", and ""bluf"" consistently translate to ""blue"", ""red"", and ""yellow"", respectively, regardless of their position in the input.
- The position of ""dax"" does not seem to affect its color output which is consistently ""green"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be consistent regardless of its position or surrounding words:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to translate to the color ""red"". Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Here are the proposed rules based on the examples:

1. dax lug wif -> green blue red
2. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
3. dax wif walm -> green red red red
4. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
5. wif -> red

So, wif -> red. Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" irrespective of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
Given the examples, I will try to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf"".

1) In the first example, ""dax zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow"". We know from this that ""bluf"" maps to ""yellow"".

2) In the second example, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""red red yellow yellow red"". This again shows us that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", since both instances of ""bluf"" result in ""yellow"".

3) The third example, ""wif bluf zup"", becomes ""red red yellow"", which is consistent with the previous cases, reinforcing that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".

4) In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug bluf"", we get ""blue red blue blue"". The position of ""bluf"" in this example still results in ""blue"", not ""yellow"". However, this could be due to a surrounding rule based on the word ""lug"" preceding ""bluf"". It is possible that ""lug"" changes the color associated with ""bluf"".

5) The fifth example, ""wif bluf dax"", equates to ""red red green"". Here, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""wif"" and ""dax"". Given that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"", it is not clear from this example alone why ""bluf"" is ""red"", since we would expect ""yellow"" based on previous examples.

6) Given the evidence, there appears to be a rule change dependent on context or surrounding words. The most consistent rule from the data provided is that ""bluf"" alone translates to ""yellow"". However, the fourth example breaks this consistency by showing ""bluf"" as ""blue"", which suggests there may be a modifier rule when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"".

Rule: In isolation or when not preceded by ""lug"", ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"". However, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"", it translates to ""blue"". This rule is based on the examples given but may not account for all possible usages of ""bluf"" without further context.

Therefore, in most cases:
bluf -> yellow

In specific context after ""lug"":
bluf -> blue
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", we have to compare the input and its corresponding output to identify any patterns or rules.

In the first input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times, indicating that ""walm"" might cause the previous color to repeat three times.

In the second input, after ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated once, which is the color corresponding to ""lug."" However, ""zup"" appears twice without ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is not repeated thrice which may indicate that the number of repetitions caused by ""walm"" might depend on how many times the color appeared before ""walm.""

In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and is followed by ""wif"" (red). The color ""red"" is repeated three times again after ""walm,"" while ""green"" is not repeated.

In the fourth input, ""walm"" is again followed by ""lug"" (blue), and ""blue"" is repeated twice, indicating that ""walm"" might lead to the repetition of the last color mentioned, but not always three times.

In the fifth input, ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm,"" and ""blue"" is repeated twice afterwards.

Upon examining these inputs and outputs, ""walm"" seems to cause the last color mentioned before it to be repeated three times if ""walm"" is followed by another word. If ""walm"" is the last word or is followed by the same word/color, the last color mentioned before it is repeated twice.

Rule: walm -> causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times if followed by a different word, or repeated twice if it is the last word or followed by the same word/color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
dax -> meaning. Rule: dax means ""green"". This can be deduced from the outputs whenever ""dax"" appears in the input; the word ""green"" always corresponds to its position.
By examining the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color in the outputs. To deduce the meaning, we can look for patterns before and after ""wif"" in the inputs and consider the respective outputs:

1. Input: dax wif lug dax | Output: green red blue green
2. Input: lug dax lug wif | Output: blue green blue red
3. Input: zup lug zup wif dax | Output: yellow blue yellow red green
4. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug | Output: yellow red red yellow blue
5. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif | Output: blue red red blue red

From these instances, we can see that every time ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"". This suggests that ""wif"" correlates directly with the color ""red"", regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""red"" in the output. I'll test this against each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"".

2. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red
   - Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"".

3. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""blue"".

4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""red"".

5. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the last ""red"".

Looking closely, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color following the pattern of duplication of the color that comes immediately before it. Therefore, ""bluf"" does not directly translate to ""red,"" but rather means ""repeat the last color"". Let's validate this with the examples:

- Example 1 has ""wif"" before ""bluf"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; thus, ""bluf"" duplicates it to another ""red"".
- Example 2 also supports this, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" duplicating it to ""red"" (although this seems like an anomaly or might indicate a mistake in the provided outputs).
- Example 3 has ""lug"" before ""bluf"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""; thus, ""bluf"" duplicates it.
- Example 4 supports the rule, with ""wif"" before ""bluf"" translating to ""red"" again.
- Example 5 has ""wif"" before ""bluf"" translating to ""red"", and ""bluf"" duplicates ""red"".

Given the consistent pattern with one questionable anomaly in the second example, the rule seems to be:

Rule: Bluf -> Repeat the last color.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns of input and output in the examples provided:

1. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
2. dax walm -> green green green
3. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
4. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
5. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Looking for patterns, we can notice that the word ""walm"" is always followed by a sequence of words which are output as the same color repeated.

In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""red"" appearing three times.
In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""green"" appearing three times.
In the third example, ""walm"" is also followed by ""green"" appearing three times before the pattern changes with the introduction of new words.
In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" twice.
In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""red"" once and then after non-""walm"" words, it's followed by ""yellow"" three times.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" denotes a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. The number of repetitions is not fixed and can vary depending on the sequence of words that follow ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow green yellow yellow yellow yellow,green yellow green yellow yellow yellow,False,196
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the outputs when ""lug"" is present versus when it is not.

When ""lug"" is present, the color ""blue"" is present in the output:

- dax walm zup lug dax: green green green yellow blue green
- wif lug: red blue
- lug zup: blue yellow
- lug dax: blue green
- dax lug walm zup wif: green blue blue blue yellow red

Based on these examples, every input containing ""lug"" has ""blue"" immediately following it in the output sequence. When ""lug"" is not present, ""blue"" does not appear in the same position following the words that are paired with ""blue"" when ""lug"" is present. Hence, it seems ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue.
From the given examples, we can deduce a pattern in which each word corresponds to a specific color. Let's align the inputs with the outputs to determine this pattern:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Rule: dax -> green

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Rule: zup -> yellow, walm -> yellow, dax -> green

3. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue
   Rule: lug -> blue, dax -> green, wif -> red

4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
   Rule: lug -> blue, wif -> red, dax -> green, bluf -> green

5. Input: wif lug dax
   Output: red blue green
   Rule: wif -> red, lug -> blue, dax -> green

Based on the consistent appearance of ""green"" in the output every time ""dax"" appears in the input, irrespective of the position of ""dax,"" we can induce the rule that the meaning of the word ""dax"" specifically corresponds to the color green, without dependence on other context or position.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

The word ""wif"" in each example corresponds to the output ""red."" This can be deduced by noticing that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears the same number of times in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Here are the mappings suggested by the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" as seen by its consistent translation in every instance.
- ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" as seen by its consistent translation in every instance.
- ""walm"" seems to represent ""green"" when repeated (as repeating seems to translate to repeating the same color word) and ""red"" when not immediately following another instance of ""walm.""

Given this information, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or repetition, which can be observed in the first and fourth inputs where ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" and both times the output was ""yellow blue."" The same is true for ""zup"" followed by ""dax"" and ""zup"" by itself.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to correlate with the color ""blue"" as well as a repetition of the preceding color. 

Here is the rule induction from the examples:

- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" where ""bluf"" seems to repeat the previously mentioned color.
- ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow,"" again showing ""bluf"" as a repeat of the color before it (which in this case is ""blue"").
- ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow red green blue,"" with ""bluf"" following ""wif"" (which has produced ""red"") but then producing ""blue"" instead of the repetition of ""red.""
- ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red,"" with ""bluf"" here repeating the previous color (""red"").
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red,"" with ""bluf"" repeating the preceding ""yellow"".

Given the inconsistencies, especially in the case where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""bluf"" does not repeat ""red,"" one can deduce that ""bluf"" primarily means ""blue"" but also has a rule of repeating the color immediately before it, except when preceded by ""wif.""

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" and also repeats the previous color unless preceded by ""wif,"" in which case it simply means ""blue.""

Therefore:
bluf ->  ""blue"" and also reinforcement of the previous color, unless preceded by ""wif.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" is used to repeat the color that corresponds to the word directly preceding it, three times. 

Here's the breakdown according to your examples:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"")
2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"" (since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times)
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"")
4. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red"" (since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times)
5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"")

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, three times.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs provided.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""dax"" appears to translate to the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" in the input correlates directly with ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is used in the input, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sentence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" acts as a repeating agent causing the color before it to be repeated an unspecified number of times until a different color (or the end of the sequence) is encountered. Let us analyze each example:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Analysis: The word ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""bluf"", so ""blue"" is repeated until a different color ""wif"" (red) is reached.

2. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   Analysis: Here, ""zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""bluf"", thus ""yellow"" is repeated.

3. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   Analysis: ""Wif"" (red) is followed by ""bluf"", so ""red"" is repeated.

4. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   Analysis: ""Lug"" (blue) is followed by ""bluf"", and ""blue"" is repeated once more.

5. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   Analysis: ""Zup"" (yellow) comes before ""bluf"", hence ""yellow"" is repeated. ""Bluf"" does not affect the sequence after ""wif"" (red) as there is a new color ""lug"" (blue) following ""wif"".

Rule: bluf -> Causes the previous color to be repeated until a different color appears or the sequence ends.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" functions as a repeater for the color denoted by the word just before it. Each example shows that ""walm"" results in a string of the same color appearing three times immediately after it's used.

For instance, when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to the color green, the output is ""green green green"". When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to the color yellow, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which translates to red, the output is ""red red red"". 

So, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,198
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can infer that the word ""lug"" maps to a specific color when used in sequence with other words. Each instance of ""lug"" correlates to the color ""blue"" in the output. We'll examine each instance to confirm:

Input: dax lug dax wif dax
Output: green blue green red green
Here, ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""dax"" and corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
Here, ""lug"" is at the end and follows ""zup"", corresponding to ""blue"" in the output.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
In this instance, ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and is succeeded by ""walm"", and is associated with ""blue"" in the output.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
In this line, ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and is succeeded by ""wif"", associating it with ""blue"".

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
Here, ""lug"" follows ""dax"", and there's nothing after it, with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" in the output.

Since ""lug"" is consistently associated with the color ""blue"" regardless of the words that come before or after it, we can deduce that the meaning of ""lug"" is independent of context in these examples.

Rule: lug -> blue
From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by examining its context and output in each line.

1. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   - ""dax"" at the beginning corresponds to ""green""
   - ""dax"" at the end also corresponds to ""green""

2. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

3. Input: zup lug zup dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

4. Input: dax lug zup dax
   Output: green blue yellow green
   - Both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green""

5. Input: zup lug dax
   Output: yellow blue green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> ""red"" 

Each instance of ""wif"" in the examples corresponds to the output ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, each unique word seems to correspond to a unique color in the output. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in every instance it appears, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for the word ""zup"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" translates to a color. Each instance of “bluf” results in a color output, and it appears to be context-dependent, meaning the color it represents changes in response to the words around it. Let’s examine the patterns to deduce the underlying rule:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color ""green,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green."" This rule is consistent in the given examples ""dax bluf dax"" and ""dax bluf,"" both resulting in ""green green.""
  
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red."" This pattern can be seen in the example ""zup wif bluf zup,"" which translates to ""yellow red red yellow.""

  
However, in the first example ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax,"" resulting in ""blue."" In this case, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and it seems that the occurrence of ""bluf"" results in the color that precedes it rather than follows it.

By cross-referencing these observations, we can infer that the rule for ""bluf"" might be:
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by a word, it takes the color corresponding to that word.

Hence, the rule we can deduce is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" represents the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: If “bluf” is preceded by a word associated with a color, the output color for ""bluf"" will be the same as the color associated with the preceding word.
From analyzing the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is directly translated into a series of colors where the color depends on the word that precedes ""walm"". Here's the breakdown based on the given inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" Since ""wif"" correlates to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the ""walm"" translates to a repeated series of the color that precedes it (""yellow"" in this case).

- In the second example, ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red."" Again, ""dax"" correlates to green, ""wif"" to red, and following ""wif"", ""walm"" translates to a repeated series of ""red.""

- In the third example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" With ""dax"" correlating to green, and ""walm"" following ""dax"", this leads to a series of ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" With ""zup"" correlating to yellow, the following ""walm"" turns into a series of ""yellow.""

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red."" Here, we can notice again, ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to blue, while ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and becomes a series of ""green.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be established as follows:

Rule: walm -> a repeated series of the same color corresponding to the word that directly precedes it.

So, if ""walm"" follows a word that translates to ""red,"" it will result in a series of ""red,"" and the same pattern follows for other colors.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
