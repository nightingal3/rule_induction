"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds with the output ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the input leads to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the words that surround it. Consequently, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's look at the inputs and the corresponding outputs closely.

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

In the first input, we see that the word ""dax"" is directly followed by the word ""wif"" and the output shows ""green"" followed by ""red."" This could imply that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" but we need more examples to confirm.

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow

When ""dax"" appears after ""wif,"" the output for ""dax"" is still ""green."" This reinforces the initial hypothesis that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red

Here, ""dax"" appears near the end, and its output is still ""green,"" further supporting the hypothesis.

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red

Once again, ""dax"" is first in the sequence and the corresponding output is ""green.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Finally, ""dax"" appears with ""walm,"" and the entire output string is green, which suggests that ""walm"" also translates to ""green,"" but we consistently see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the rule as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the given examples, where ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"" each time it appears, regardless of the order or the other words around it, we can determine that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, it is possible to deduce that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Below is the reasoning:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"" or includes ""yellow"".
- The position of ""zup"" in the input doesn't change its corresponding output color.

Here are the observed correlations:

- ""lug"" corresponds to blue since every instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red since every instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output.
- ""zup"" appears alone or in combination with other words, but ""yellow"" is consistently in the output where ""zup"" appears in the input.

This leads to the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, but the specific color it corresponds to is influenced by the word that comes before it. Analyzing each sentence and corresponding output:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" output is ""green green yellow,"" here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and outputs ""green.""
2. ""zup bluf"" output is ""yellow yellow,"" here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and also outputs ""yellow.""
3. ""lug bluf zup lug"" output is ""blue blue yellow blue,"" here ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and outputs ""blue.""
4. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" output is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" here ""bluf"" again follows ""lug"" and outputs ""blue.""
5. ""dax lug bluf"" output is ""green blue blue,"" here ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue.""

The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, with the following associations observed:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the color is ""blue.""

There is no direct evidence from the examples of what ""bluf"" means when following ""wif"" or ""walm,"" as ""bluf"" does not directly follow these words in any of the examples.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, each occurrence of the word ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color word that precedes it. Here's how it breaks down:

- ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue"", where ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is thus repeated three times, followed by the color for ""lug"", which is blue.
- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" gives ""green green green red blue green green green"", where ""dax"" precedes the first ""walm"" and thus ""green"" is repeated three times, followed by the color for ""wif"", which is red, and the color for ""lug"", which is blue, and then ""green"" is repeated three more times because ""dax"" precedes the second ""walm"".
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", with ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" and thus ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm wif lug"" turns into ""blue blue blue red blue"", with ""lug"" preceding the first ""walm"" resulting in three ""blues"", followed by the color for ""wif"", which is red, and then the color for ""lug"" again, which is blue.
- ""wif walm dax"" translates into ""red red red green"", where ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" so ""red"" is repeated three times, followed by the color for ""dax"", which is green.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that precedes ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" appears to consistently translate to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: wif -> red

Every instance where the word ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of whether ""wif"" is at the beginning, middle, or the only word in the input, it consistently translates to ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it can be determined that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow each time it appears in the input. This is consistent across all examples, as ""zup"" is always translated to ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position within the sequence or the surrounding words. The surrounding words have their consistent mappings as well: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the word ""red.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning: The word that directly follows the term ""bluf"" in the input is repeated as the output color. If ""bluf"" precedes a color word, the corresponding color is repeated after ""bluf"" in the output.

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color word or corresponding color immediately following it is repeated once in the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, there appears to be a correlation between the word ""walm"" and repetition in the output. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to result in repeated color words, and the color that is repeated is the color word that precedes ""walm"". 

To illustrate with the examples given:

- ""zup lug walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue. ""Walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated two more times.
- ""zup walm"": Same as the previous example, ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" results in three ""yellow"".
- ""zup wif dax walm lug"": ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, so ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated two more times, and then ""lug"" adds blue at the end.
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"": ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" makes ""blue"" repeat twice, ""wif"" is red, followed by ""lug"" which is blue again, and ""bluf"" adds another blue.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

Note: There is an inconsistency in the number of repetitions in the fifth example given (""lug walm wif lug bluf""), where ""walm"" does not cause three additional repetitions. However, the general rule seems to hold for the other examples, so it is possible that this is an exception or an error in the example.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
Rule: wif -> red

When the word ""wif"" appears, it translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples provided show that whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the output, irrespective of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence. The presence of ""zup"" does not appear to affect the translation of other words in the sequence, which seem to have their independent meanings (e.g., ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue). Therefore, we can conclude that ""zup"" denotes the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" appears to be a command that duplicates the color associated with the word that comes just before ""bluf"". 

Rule: bluf -> the command to duplicate the color of the previously mentioned color word.

Here's the rule application for each given input:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" because ""dax"" results in green, and ""bluf"" duplicates the color.
- ""lug bluf dax bluf"" -> ""blue blue green green"" because ""lug"" is blue, ""bluf"" duplicates blue, then ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" duplicates green.
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" (same as the first example).
- ""wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""red green yellow yellow"" because ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" duplicates the yellow.
- ""dax lug bluf"" -> ""green blue blue"" because ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" duplicates the blue.

Rule: bluf -> duplicate the color of the preceding color word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each instance where it occurs and the corresponding output:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   It follows a pattern of ""lug"" and ""wif"" before ""walm,"" outputting red after ""wif"" and blue after ""lug.""

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""Zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" does not change the color; it repeats ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   After ""wif,"" the color changes to ""red,"" and ""walm"" follows with repeating ""red.""

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""Dax"" and ""lug"" lead to ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively. ""Walm"" follows with repeating ""blue.""

5. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Following ""lug,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue."" After ""zup"" (""yellow""), ""lug"" and ""walm"" return to repeating ""blue.""

Rule:
From the examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word directly preceding it. If the preceding word corresponds to a color, ""walm"" extends the sequence of that color according to how many times ""walm"" is mentioned.

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,2
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the examples:

1. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow"" — in this case, lug comes before zup (yellow) and after bluf (red), corresponding to the color blue in the output.

2. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"" — here, lug is flanked by walm (yellow) and wif (red). The color after lug is blue.

3. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red"" — once again, lug precedes colors that translate from single words - wif (red) and dax (green) - and is followed by blue in the output.

4. ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue"" — dax comes before lug and translates to green. The color after lug is blue.

5. ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red"" — lug comes before wif (red) and walm (assumed to be red, based on repeated red in the output), with the color blue corresponding to lug at the beginning of the output.

Based on these examples, we notice that whenever lug is encountered, the corresponding color in the output is blue, regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be:

dax -> green

Meaning that every time the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output associated with ""dax"" is ""green.""
From the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. Here's the correlation:

- ""wif bluf dax"" produces ""red red green,"" where ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"" and ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
- ""lug wif"" produces ""blue red,"" where ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""lug dax wif lug"" produces ""blue green red blue,"" correlating ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""wif"" once again with ""red.""
- ""wif lug"" produces ""red blue,"" where ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""zup lug wif"" produces ""yellow blue red,"" where ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" again with ""red.""

Based on these examples, the rule appears to be consistent.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow."" Regardless of its position in the sequence of words, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

1. The word that appears immediately before ""bluf"" seems to dictate the output color that ""bluf"" represents.
2. The color output for ""bluf"" is the second color in the pair generated by the word preceding it.

Let's analyze each example:

- ""lug bluf wif"" outputs ""blue blue red"", so ""bluf"" takes on the color ""blue,"" because ""lug"" generates the pair ""blue blue""

- ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow"", so ""bluf"" takes on the color ""yellow,"" because ""zup"" generates the pair ""yellow yellow""

- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" again, consistent with the pattern

- ""zup dax bluf"" outputs ""yellow green green"", so ""bluf"" is ""green,"" because ""dax"" generates the pair ""green green""

- ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" outputs ""yellow green green yellow green"", so ""bluf"" is ""green"" in this context because it follows ""dax,"" which generates the pair ""green green""

Putting all this together, the rule for what ""bluf"" means is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the second color output from the word immediately before it. If the word before ""bluf"" outputs a pair of the same colors, then ""bluf"" represents that color. If the word before it might output a pair with different colors, then ""bluf"" would represent the second color in that output pair (though this instance is not explicitly exemplified, it's a logical extension of the existing pattern).
To determine the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the input phrases with their corresponding outputs, focusing on the word's position and surroundings.

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" results in ""red red red."" This suggests that ""walm"" might mean a repetition of the previous color.

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" again (which now outputs ""red"") and results in ""red red red."" In this case, the word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" The presence of ""walm"" here again seems to create a repetition of the color before it.

3. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" (which outputs ""green"") and the output is ""green green green."" This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" repeats the previous color.

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" (translated to ""yellow"") resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" once more supporting the repetition rule.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   
   ""Walm"" after ""dax"" leads to ""green green green,"" this consistency further backs up the repetition pattern.

From these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in every example provided.
Rule: dax -> green.

Each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we will examine the relationship between the input phrases and the color patterns of the output. Let's break down each example:

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red 
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color associated with the previous word (""green"" in this case)
   - ""wif"" could be a separator or modifier that changes the pattern
   - ""bluf"" might correspond to ""red,"" but given it produces two reds, it may be influenced by ""wif""

2. dax lug wif lug -> green blue red blue 
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" and the color associated with ""lug"" is repeated (""blue"")
   - ""wif"" again seems to introduce a change in the pattern

3. zup wif -> yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

4. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word (yellow)
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

5. wif dax wif -> red green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" introduces ""red"" both times it appears

From these observations, it appears that ""wif"" precedes a change to ""red."" Additionally, ""wif"" may also work similarly to a function that outputs ""red"" regardless of the preceding word, and it could potentially reset the pattern or introduce another instance of ""red"" after the color corresponding to the subsequent word.

Rule: When ""wif"" is present in the input, it modifies the output to include ""red"" immediately after. If ""wif"" appears at the beginning or middle of the phrase, it causes ""red"" to appear before and after the color associated with the subsequent word. If ""wif"" appears at the end of the phrase, it just adds ""red"" to the end of the color pattern. Additionally, ""wif"" seems to reset any repetition pattern established by words like ""walm.""

Therefore:

wif -> meaning: Wif marks the insertion of ""red"" into the output sequence and can also indicate a pattern reset or repeat depending on its position.
Based on the examples provided, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

Clarification of rule: The word that comes before bluf has a color associated with it (e.g., ""dax"" is associated with green, ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""zup"" is associated with yellow), and the word ""bluf"" indicates that this color should be repeated.

Examples based on the rule:
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""bluf"" means repeat the color.
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""bluf"" means repeat the color.
- ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"" because ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""wif"" has no preceding color association in this context so we assume it's red, and ""bluf"" means repeat the color.
- ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""wif"" assumes the same rule as above, and ""bluf"" means repeat the color.
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""bluf"" means repeat the color.
By examining the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern that indicates the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's analyze each example:

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- Here, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correlate with ""red,"" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""walm"" correlates with additional ""green.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds with additional ""blue.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- Repeated example, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds with additional ""blue""

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""walm"" corresponds with additional ""red.""

Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" corresponds with additional ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" acts as a duplicator for the color associated with the preceding word. The color word that comes before ""walm"" gets repeated in the same count of times as ""walm"" is used.

Rule: walm -> duplicates the color output associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning can be interpreted as the word ""blue"".

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green and it appears that the position of the word ""dax"" in the sequence determines its relative position in the sequence of colors. Also, specific nonce words correspond to specific colors. The rules can be summarized as follows:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

The sequence of colors in the output reflects the sequence of nonce words in the input with the corresponding colored meaning for each nonce word.

Rule: ""dax"" -> green. The position of ""dax"" in the input sequence determines the position of the color green in the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

In the first example:
Input: zup wif zup dax
Output: yellow red yellow green

""wif"" is surrounded by two instances of ""zup"" which result in ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in this case, as it appears between the two yellows.

In the second example:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Here, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and is followed by ""red"" in the output. It also appears at the end of the input, again corresponding to ""red"" in the output. In between, ""wif"" follows a pattern where it's preceded and followed by ""red"" in the output.

In the third example:
Input: dax wif dax
Output: green red green

""wif"" is sandwiched between two ""dax,"" which correspond to ""green"" in the output. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

In the fourth example:
Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green

""wif"" here corresponds to ""red"" again, preceding ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

In the fifth example:
Input: dax wif zup
Output: green red yellow

""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" between ""green"" and ""yellow,"" which are represented by ""dax"" and ""zup"" respectively.

Based on the information given in all examples, it seems clear that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output regardless of its position or the surrounding words. Thus, we can state the rule as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> the color word immediately preceding it. 

Explanation: In every example, the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the word that comes before ""bluf."" For instance:

- In ""lug dax bluf,"" ""dax"" translates to green, and ""bluf"" translates to green.
- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"" and translates to blue, so ""bluf"" also translates to blue.
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" translates to yellow, and ""bluf"" translates to yellow.

Therefore, bluf takes on the value of the color word that is immediately before it in the sequence.
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word that precedes it, three times. Looking at the provided examples, after the word ""walm"", the output is the color corresponding to the previous word repeated three times:

- In ""lug wif zup wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In ""dax walm zup walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after the first ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated three times; ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after the second ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In ""wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated three times even though ""bluf"" is present between ""zup"" and ""wif"". This indicates that ""walm"" does not apply to ""bluf"".
- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Thus, the rule is that ""walm"" causes the output to consist of the color of the word before ""walm"", repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following mappings for each word:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue

Since the word ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"" no matter its position in the sequence, we can deduce that ""lug"" means blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Looking at the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Here is what we can observe from the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue.""
2. The word ""dax"" appears to correspond to the output ""green.""
3. The only exception is when ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""wif,"" where the output is ""red"" instead of ""green.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""dax"" generally translates to ""green,"" but there is a context-dependent rule that alters its meaning when a specific condition is met (when ""dax"" is immediately followed by ""wif"").

Rule: 
dax -> green, unless followed by ""wif,"" in which case, the output is ""red.""
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Consequently, the meaning of ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Every instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. No additional context is given that alters the meaning of ""zup"" in any of the examples; it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position or repetition in the sequence. Therefore, we conclude that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" it's important to look for patterns in each input and its respective output. Here's the breakdown for each example:

1. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

2. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

3. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

4. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green

5. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red

Looking at the examples, we can notice the following patterns:

- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" always represents a color switch to ""green"" or from ""green.""
- ""wif"" has a pattern of often switching the color to ""red.""

To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we notice the following pattern associated with ""bluf"":

- In example 1, ""bluf"" outputs ""blue"" when it follows ""lug,"" but it outputs ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""
- Example 2 shows ""bluf"" outputting ""yellow"" immediately following ""zup.""
- Example 3 shows ""bluf"" outputting ""blue"" immediately following ""lug.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" following ""wif.""
- Example 5 again shows ""bluf"" outputting ""red"" following ""wif.""

Given these patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. If there's no preceder that dictates a color (like ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" or ""dax""), it seems to revert to a default color which cannot be determined from these examples.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word. If the preceding word does not correspond to a color, the output cannot be determined from the given examples.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color word before it. Looking at the examples where ""walm"" is used, it always repeats the color that precedes it three times.

Input: zup walm  
Output: yellow yellow yellow  
'zup' translates to 'yellow', and 'walm' causes it to be said three times.

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax  
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green  
'lug' translates to 'blue', and 'walm' causes 'blue' to be repeated three times. The other words are translated to their respective colors.

Input: lug walm dax  
Output: blue blue blue green  
Again, 'lug' translates to 'blue', and 'walm' repeats 'blue' three times before continuing with other translations.

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf  
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue  
'lug' translates to 'blue', 'walm' repeats 'blue' three times before the sequence continues, and 'wif' translates to 'red'.

Input: wif walm  
Output: red red red  
'wif' translates to 'red', and 'walm' causes 'red' to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,6
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the output is consistently ""blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples given, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""green"" in the output. The translation remains consistent regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we have the following mappings from inputs to colors in the outputs:

1. dax -> green
2. lug -> blue
3. wif -> red
4. bluf -> red
5. walm -> blue blue
6. zup -> yellow

Each use of ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. This can be confirmed by the last example where ""wif"" is the only input and ""red"" is the sole output, establishing that the presence of ""wif"" does not depend on other words to be translated to ""red.""

Hence, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word `zup` consistently corresponds to the color `yellow` in the outputs:

- Every instance where `zup` is mentioned in the input, `yellow` appears in the same position in the output.
- When `zup` is not present, other colors or words are outputted accordingly.
  
Thus, the rule for the given examples is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: 'bluf' means repeat the color associated with the previous word. 

Evidence:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"" which implies that 'bluf' repeats the color of 'wif'.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" translates to ""green green red blue yellow"", so 'bluf' following 'dax' repeats 'green'.
- In the third example, ""wif lug zup bluf"" becomes ""red blue yellow yellow"", showing that 'bluf' repeats 'yellow' from 'zup'.
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow"", again showing that 'bluf' repeats 'yellow' from 'zup'.
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow yellow red green"" which indicates that 'bluf' repeats the color of 'zup', which is 'yellow'.

So, the working rule extracted from the examples provided is that 'bluf' takes the color of the word immediately preceding it and repeats that color in the output sequence.

bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
From the provided examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" duplicates the color associated with the word that appears immediately before it. That is, ""walm"" repeats the color output of the preceding word the same number of times as the number of letters in that word. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (dax is associated with green, which has three letters, so the output is green repeated three times).

2. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red"" (lug is associated with blue, which has three letters, hence three blues, while bluf is associated with red which has four letters but only appears once as it is not followed by ""walm"").

3. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue"" (zup is associated with yellow, wif with red, dax with green repeated three times because of ""walm"" and lug with blue).

4. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (lug is associated with blue and is repeated three times because of ""walm"").

5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"" (the pattern continues with ""lug walm"" resulting in three blues, followed by yellow (zup), blue (lug), another yellow (zup), and red (wif)).

Rule: walm -> meaning: repeat the color of the previous word the same number of times as there are letters in the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True,7
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, when the word ""lug"" appears alone or in combination with other words, it translates consistently into the color ""blue.""

Here's how we can deduce the rule:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears, regardless of its position (""lug"", ""dax lug"", ""lug walm"", ""dax lug walm"", ""dax lug zup""), the output always contains ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" when it precedes ""lug"" leads to ""green"" appearing before ""blue"" (e.g., ""dax lug"" becomes ""green blue"").
- The word ""walm"" after ""lug"" adds extra instances of ""blue"" to the output, proportional to how many times ""walm"" is stated. For example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" and ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue.""
- The word ""zup"" when it follows ""lug"" adds the color ""yellow"" at the end (e.g.,""dax lug zup"" results in ""green blue yellow"").

By observing these patterns, we can induce that:

Rule: ""lug"" translates into the word ""blue,"" irrespective of its position or the other words around it.
Based on the examples provided, 'dax' consistently corresponds to the output 'green', regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence and position of other words around it. Therefore, it can be deduced that the word 'dax' represents the color 'green'.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the nonce word ""wif"". We can look at each instance of ""wif"" in the input and see what it corresponds to in the output:

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue : ""wif"" precedes ""lug"", which corresponds to ""red"" preceding ""blue"".
2. Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue : ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" leading to ""red"", followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""red"" and then ""blue"".
3. Input: dax wif -> Output: green red : ""wif"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""red"" following ""green"".
4. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue red green green red : ""wif"" follows ""lug"" and also ""bluf"", which in both cases corresponds to ""red"" following ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively.
5. Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue : ""wif"" precedes ""zup"" leading to ""red"" preceding ""yellow"".

From these observations, we can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"". It doesn't seem to matter where ""wif"" is placed in the input sequence; its presence dictates that ""red"" should appear in the output sequence at the appropriate position.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" in the examples is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"". The other words, ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""wif,"" are translated to ""blue,"" ""blue blue blue"" (repeating the word ""blue"" three times), and ""red,"" respectively. Therefore, the word ""zup"" represents the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input string.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is output directly after it in the sequence. To determine the specific rule for ""bluf,"" let's examine the examples:

- Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
- Input: zup bluf dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow green blue
- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

From the analysis of these examples, we can deduce that whenever we see the word ""bluf,"" the color that follows immediately after ""bluf"" in the input matches the color that is placed in the same position as ""bluf"" in the output. For example, in the first input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and in the output, the position corresponding to ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which is the same color ""dax"" corresponds to.

However, when ""bluf"" is at the end of the input sequence, the color that corresponds to ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""bluf"". For example, in the fourth input (""zup bluf""), ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to ""bluf"" is the same as the color corresponding to the word that immediately follows ""bluf"" in the input. If ""bluf"" is at the end of the input sequence, the color corresponding to ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it.
Reviewing the examples and the corresponding outputs, we'll try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by looking for patterns:

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Comparing the inputs with the outputs, we notice that the word that appears after ""walm"" is always translated to the same color as ""walm."" We can hypothesize that ""walm"" indicates that the following word should be treated as the same as the word before ""walm,"" in terms of the color code.

To formalize:

walm -> the following word should be assigned the same color as the prior word (repeating the color associated with the word just before ""walm"").

Rule: If a word appears after ""walm,"" it is translated to the same color as the word immediately before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug dax zup
    ",Output: yellow blue green yellow,yellow blue green yellow,True,8
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

lug -> meaning. The meaning is consistent across all examples as ""blue"". 

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each instance where it appears, regardless of the position or combination with other words.
Based on the examples provided, it's clear that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"". However, it is also worth noting that the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"" - as seen in the examples where these words are combined with ""dax"". The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The order of the colors in the Output matches the order of the words in the Input.

Thus, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green"" 

When other words are present, they correspond to their specific colors:
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

And the sequence of colors in the Output matches the sequence of words in the Input.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns correlating ""wif"" with output colors across the given examples:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. wif bluf dax -> red red green
3. wif zup -> red yellow
4. dax wif -> green red
5. lug wif lug -> blue red blue

In each instance where ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red."" This is consistent regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence or the words that come before or after it. No other word consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of position. Thus, it can be deduced that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""zup"" seems to be consistent regardless of context. In each instance, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
The nonce word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color green when it follows ""dax,"" red when it follows ""wif,"" and blue when it immediately follows ""lug."" It does not appear alone or in any other context, which could provide further clues regarding its meaning.

From the given examples, the following rules for the word ""bluf"" can be deduced:

- When following ""dax,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to green.
- When following ""wif,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to red.
- When immediately following ""lug,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to blue.

Writing this as requested:

bluf -> meaning
Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on the word that precedes it:
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red.""
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue.""
Based on the inputs and outputs given, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
Input: zup dax walm lug wif -> Output: yellow green green green blue red
Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red

The word ""walm"" appears to cause the output color to repeat three times in a row of the color that precedes it. In every instance where ""walm"" is used, the word that comes right before ""walm"" has its corresponding color appear three times in succession.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: The output for ""walm"" is the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True,9
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, we can infer that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""

Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red red."" This suggests that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""walm"" also means ""blue,"" and ""wif"" means ""blue,"" while ""bluf"" likely means ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"" leads to ""blue red green green green yellow."" This reinforces the idea that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and that ""walm"" is green"", as it also matched with green in the output. However, ""wif"" now appears to correspond to ""red,"" differing from the first example, meaning that ""wif"" might not have a consistent meaning, but ""lug"" stays consistent as ""blue.""

3. In the third example, ""zup lug dax"" results in ""yellow blue green."" Once again, ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" confirming that ""lug"" means ""blue.""

4. In the fourth example, ""lug zup dax wif zup"" translates to ""blue yellow green red yellow."" As before, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""

5. In the fifth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup"" gives us ""green red red red blue yellow."" Again, the presence of ""lug"" accompanies the color ""blue.""

Thus, the rule can be concluded as:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each word in the input is directly translated to a color in the output. The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is as follows:
dax -> green

Meaning: ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. It seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Here's what can be concluded from the examples:

- ""wif"" appears at the start of the sequence in every given input where it's translated as ""red"" at the start of the corresponding output sequence.
- ""wif"" appears amidst other nonce words in the sequence, but regardless of its position, it consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- The appearance of ""wif"" does not seem to affect the translation of the other nonce words; they always translate to the same color (""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to ""green"" based on the recurrence of the words and the associated colors in the output).

Given these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word 'zup' can be deduced as follows:

- Whenever 'zup' appears, the word 'yellow' is produced in the output.
- The word following 'zup' determines the second color in the output, but it is independent of 'zup'. For example, 'lug' translates to 'blue', 'dax' translates to 'green', and 'bluf' translates to 'green' as well.
- The output does not depend on the position of 'zup' in the input sequence. Regardless of where 'zup' is placed, it always corresponds to 'yellow'.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Each appearance of 'zup' in the input is translated to 'yellow' in the output.
Analyzing the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"". Let's observe each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   - After the pattern ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow"", the word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

2. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   - After ""yellow blue yellow"", the word ""bluf"" matches ""yellow"".

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - Following ""green"", the word ""bluf"" results in ""green"".

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   - After ""green"", the word ""bluf"" leads to another ""green"".

5. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   - When ""blue"" precedes it, the word ""bluf"" also turns out to be ""blue"".

From these examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" does not correspond to a static color reference but rather a repetition of the last color mentioned. Therefore, ""bluf"" likely refers to the repetition of the previous color in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color mentioned directly before it.
From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color output of the preceding word multiple times. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to cause the last color to be repeated three times. We can ascertain this by looking at the pattern in each example:

1. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   (Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" makes ""green"" repeat three times.)

2. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   (The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" makes ""blue"" repeat three times. ""dax"" is then green, ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, followed by ""wif"" which is again red.)

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   (""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats it three times.)

4. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   (""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and then ""walm"" repeats the ""blue"" three times.)

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   (""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.)

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,10
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the provided examples and comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug.""

Example 1:
- Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
- Output: blue red green green red blue

Example 2:
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
- Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Example 3:
- Input: lug zup wif lug
- Output: blue yellow red blue

Example 4:
- Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
- Output: yellow blue red green green red

Example 5:
- Input: lug bluf zup lug
- Output: blue blue yellow blue

From the examples, it appears that each instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. When ""lug"" appears more than once in the input, the word ""blue"" is repeated in the output. Therefore, we can conclude that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the given examples and see if any patterns emerge:

1. When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green.""

2. When ""dax"" appears in a list of words, it also results in ""green.""

Observing other examples:
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and both result in ""green.""
- The fourth example also shows ""walm"" following ""dax,"" and the output for both is ""green.""
- The fifth example has ""dax"" twice, separated by ""bluf,"" and ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" despite the surrounding words.

From these examples, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" is not context-dependent and consistently results in the output ""green."" Other words seem to have their own corresponding colors (e.g., ""wif"" -> red, ""walm"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""bluf"" -> blue).

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the same position. 

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""
Given the examples provided:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

And the consistent output whenever the input is solely ""zup"":

zup -> meaning. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at each input and the corresponding output to identify patterns:

1. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   
2. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   
3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
4. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   
5. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

Looking at the examples:

- Every time ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- Every time ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
- ""Bluf"" at the end of the sequence always results in ""yellow,"" regardless of the word that precedes it.

From these observations, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" However, there seems to be some dependency on the word that precedes it:

- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it maintains the color of the preceding word, which is ""yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it still translates to ""yellow,"" but we also get the color associated with ""dax"" which is ""green.""

The context does not provide enough information to understand what happens when ""bluf"" is preceded by other words such as ""walm"" or ""wif"" since it results in ""red red,"" which deviates from previously identified patterns.

Based on this limited data, the rule might be stated as follows:

Rule: ""Bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" or is the last word in the sequence, and maintains the preceding color when placed directly after ""zup."" When following ""dax,"" it also translates to ""yellow"" but retains the color linked to ""dax"" (""green"") before it.

So, bluf -> yellow (with contextual variations as stated in the rule).
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" transforms each preceding word into a series of color words, where each color word is repeated a number of times based on a rule. The color itself is determined by the individual word being transformed:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Further, the repetition of the color word depends on the sequence or order of words. Each instance of the new color word appears to correspond to the position of the original word before ""walm"" in the sequence:

- The first word is transformed into one instance of the corresponding color word.
- The second word is transformed into two instances of the corresponding color word.
- The third word is transformed into three instances of the corresponding color word, and so on.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

walm -> Change each preceding word into its corresponding color repeated as many times as the word's position in the sequence before ""walm.""

Rule: If n is the position of the word before ""walm"" in the sequence, then the output is the corresponding color word repeated n times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the outputs, regardless of the surrounding context.
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" in the provided examples corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". There are no examples that show ""wif"" associated with any other color or word, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Regardless of its position in the input sequence, it consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and corresponding outputs across the provided examples:

1. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   
2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

3. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

4. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Looking at the examples, one can notice that every word in the input is mapped to a color in the output. The repeated presence of the word ""bluf"" in each input and the consistency of one color following ""bluf"" in the output suggests that ""bluf"" is directly linked to this color.

From example 1:
- ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup,"" with the output being green for ""dax,"" green for ""bluf,"" and yellow for ""zup."" There is no immediate pattern here as ""bluf"" is between two other colors.

From example 2:
- ""bluf"" stands alone with ""wif"" and both input words translate to red. This could mean ""bluf"" equals red or that it takes the color of the preceding word.

From example 3:
- ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" again, and both are red. It is followed by ""dax,"" which is green.

From example 4:
- ""bluf"" is preceeded by ""lug"" and followed by ""wif,"" with the output being blue for ""lug,"" blue for ""bluf,"" and red for ""wif.""

From example 5:
- In this sequence, ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""bluf"" (blue), then ""wif"" (red), and ""lug"" (blue) again. However, ""walm"" does not appear in any other sequence to deduce its color from the previous examples.

From the available deciphering, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- In examples 2 and 3, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and both are red.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" and both are blue.
- Example 1 is the exception where ""bluf"" follows a green ""dax"" but without another example to confirm if ""dax"" should be green or another context rule, we can't conclude a rule for this instance.

Given this pattern, here is the rule:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately before it. If ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which is green), it becomes green. If it follows ""wif"" (which is red) or ""lug"" (which is blue), it takes on red or blue respectively.
Observing the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by examining its context and output:

Example 1: ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""
- ""walm"" occurs after ""wif"" (red), which is then followed by ""lug"" (blue).

Example 2: ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- ""walm"" follows immediately after ""lug"" (blue) and the output is three instances of ""blue"".

Example 3: ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green red red red""
- ""walm"" appears after both ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), with each occurrence of ""walm"" converting the preceding color to three instances of that color.

Example 4: ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
- ""walm"" occurs after ""zup"" (yellow), changing ""yellow"" to three instances of this color before ""lug"" (blue).

Example 5: ""wif zup walm dax zup"" -> ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow""
- ""walm"" occurs after ""zup"" (yellow), again resulting in three ""yellow"" before continuing with the subsequent colors.

Based on these observations:

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the previous word three times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,12
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue"".
Analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce the following rules based on the input and output pairs:

1. Given that whenever the input contains the word ""dax"" the corresponding output includes ""green"", we can infer that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" in the output.

2. The word ""dax"" seems to retain its meaning irrespective of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words, suggesting that its translation is context-independent within the provided examples.

Now, let's verify this rule against all examples:

- Example 1: ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" -> ""yellow green green yellow green"" shows that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" consistently.
- Example 2: ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue"" again ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- Example 3: ""dax"" -> ""green"" further confirms that ""dax"" alone also translates to ""green"".
- Example 4: ""zup dax zup wif"" -> ""yellow green yellow red"" shows that ""dax"" is interpreted as ""green"" between yellow and red, which corresponds to ""zup"" and ""wif"", respectively.
- Example 5: ""lug zup dax lug"" -> ""blue yellow green blue"" again confirms that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" no matter if it's preceded by ""yellow"" which corresponds to ""zup"" or followed by ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug"".

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" When paired with the word ""lug,"" the position of ""wif"" relative to ""lug"" determines the order of the colors in the output. If ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" the output sequence is ""red blue."" If ""lug"" precedes ""wif,"" the output sequence is ""blue red."" However, when ""wif"" appears alone, the output is consistently ""red.""
From the given examples, we can deduce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""lug wif"" and followed by ""wif."" Assuming that ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red"" and the second ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" this pattern suggests ""zup"" is ""yellow"" in this context.
  
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" also translates to ""yellow."" Thus, in this case, ""zup"" is followed by a word that translates to the same color, reinforcing it as ""yellow.""

- In the third example, ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow."" This indicates that ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" again reinforcing the notion that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" when it is the last word following a sequence of colors.

- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" similar to ""zup."" In this case, ""zup"" is followed by a word that translates to the same color it represents.

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green,"" suggesting ""dax"" translates to ""green."" ""Zup"" remains consistent as ""yellow,"" regardless of the following word.

The rule:
zup -> yellow

Meaning: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" appears to be that the output color is a repeat of the color immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Example analysis:
- In the first input, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"", so ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"", which is the color corresponding to ""zup"".
- In the second input, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"", which means ""bluf"" leads to ""red"", the same color corresponding to ""wif"".
- In the third input, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red"", so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", the color that ""wif"" represents.
- In the fourth input, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", so ""bluf"" again corresponds to the color that was just stated, ""green"" for ""dax"".
- In the fifth input, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"", with ""bluf"" repeating the color for ""zup"".

Rule: bluf -> The output color is the same as the color of the word immediately before bluf.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the examples provided and the corresponding outputs.

Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup dax walm"" -> ""yellow green green green""
2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
3. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
4. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""dax walm zup lug dax"" -> ""green green green yellow blue green""

Noticing the pattern, we can see that ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes directly before it:

- In example 1, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" results in green being repeated three times.
- In example 2, ""dax"" is again associated with green, and ""walm"" results in green repeated three times.
- In example 3, ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" results in red being repeated one additional time before ""dax"" switches it to green.
- In example 4, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""walm"" results in yellow being repeated three times.
- In example 5, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" results in green being repeated two additional times before ""zup"" changes the color to yellow.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the preceding color in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated consecutively.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Using the examples provided, we can observe that each instance of the input corresponds to a specific color in the output:

Input: wif bluf dax / Output: red red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm / Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: lug dax lug / Output: blue green blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: zup dax lug / Output: yellow green blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: lug dax zup wif / Output: blue green yellow red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Based on the data, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position within the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Reasoning:
- In the first example, ""wif zup wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow red green"". Since ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green"", by process of elimination ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- The second example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"". Since ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"", ""zup"" must translate to ""yellow"".
- The third example, ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue"". The words ""dax"", ""lug"", and ""wif"" translate to ""green"", ""blue"", and ""red"" respectively, leaving ""zup"" to translate to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf zup"" translates to ""green green yellow"". ""bluf"" is not explicitly translated in any other examples; however, given that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" has been established as translating to ""yellow"", it's likely ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"" in this context.
- Lastly, the fifth example, ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"". Since ""lug"" and ""wif"" translate to ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively, and ""walm"" is consistently appearing before ""yellow"", ""zup"" again is confirmed as translating to ""yellow"".

Based on all examples provided, the translation of the word ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow"".
From the provided examples, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a unique color in the output.

For each instance of ""bluf"" in the input, the output is consistently ""red."" 

Thus, the rule is as follows: bluf -> red.
Observing the given input-output pairs, let's try to understand the pattern associated with the word 'walm' and other words.

1. When we see 'wif walm dax zup', the output is 'red red red green yellow.' In this case, 'walm' is preceded by 'wif' and followed by 'dax'. Both 'wif' and 'dax' color outputs are consistently 'red' and 'green' respectively (as shown in other examples), while 'zup' always results in 'yellow'. The word 'walm' here results in 'red'.

2. The second example, 'dax wif walm lug zup,' results in 'green red red red blue yellow', respectively. Again, 'dax' leads to 'green', 'wif' to 'red', and 'lug' to 'blue', 'zup' to 'yellow'. The 'walm' in this case corresponds to 'red' again.

3. In 'lug walm zup', we get 'blue blue blue yellow'. Here 'lug' and 'zup' again resulting in 'blue' and 'yellow' respectively. 'walm' corresponds to 'blue' this time.

4. 'lug walm' produces 'blue blue blue'. Since every instance starts with 'lug' and is consistently 'blue', 'walm' in this context also results in 'blue'.

5. Finally, 'lug dax walm wif' corresponds to 'blue green green green red', where we know 'lug' is 'blue', 'dax' is 'green', and 'wif' is 'red'. 'walm' results in 'green'.

By examining the pattern, it seems that 'walm' takes on the color of the word that is immediately preceding it. 

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word. If there is no word before 'walm', 'walm' does not have a corresponding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

So, the rule is: lug -> blue.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" I will analyze the relationship between the input and the output provided in the examples.

- In the first example, ""wif lug dax"" maps to ""red blue green."" Here, ""dax"" is the third word and corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax lug"" maps to ""red red green blue."" In this case, ""dax"" is the third word again and corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""zup lug walm wif dax"" maps to ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" Here, ""dax"" is the last word and corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax zup dax walm"" maps to ""green yellow green green green."" ""Dax"" appears multiple times and always corresponds to ""green.""
- In the last example, ""wif dax"" maps to ""red green."" ""Dax"" is the second word and corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can notice a pattern where each nonce word is being translated to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every example. Other nonce words translate to other colors; for instance, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow."" Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the examples is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to identify the rule by looking at the output colors corresponding to the positions where ""bluf"" is used. It seems that ""bluf"" causes a repetition or duplication of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red) and the output is ""red,"" suggesting bluf means ""repeat the previous color.""

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Similarly, here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the output is ""yellow,"" reinforcing the same rule.

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   Here, ""bluf"" again follows ""dax"" (green) and the output is ""green.""

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Once more, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the output is ""red.""

5. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the output is ""green.""

Combining the observations from all the examples, we deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color assigned to the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of colors associated with each instance of ""walm"" in the output sequence.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and yields ""red red red.""

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and yields ""blue blue blue.""

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and yields ""green green green.""

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- The first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and yields ""red red red.""
- The second ""walm"" follows ""zup lug zup"" and yields ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and yields ""blue blue blue.""

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color word that precedes it. Specifically:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), it yields ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), it yields ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), it yields ""green green green.""

This suggests a rule that ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,15
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs. We will look for patterns that relate the position or context of ""dax"" with the colors in the output.

1. wif bluf dax -> red red green
2. zup dax walm zup wif -> yellow green green green yellow red
3. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
4. zup lug zup wif dax -> yellow blue yellow red green
5. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red

Here is what we note from the examples:

- Every time ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""green.""
- ""Dax"" seems to operate independently of its position in the sequence as it always translates to the same output regardless of where it appears or what other words are around it.

None of the other words consistently correspond to ""green"" in the output across the examples, meaning ""dax"" correlates uniquely to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its placement in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" translates to a specific color every time it appears. In each instance, regardless of the context or surrounding words, ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule regarding the meaning of ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color word that matches the previous color mentioned in the input. Here's how the rule applies in each case:

1. Input: ""zup bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates the previous color, ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""wif zup bluf"" -> Output: ""red yellow yellow""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" duplicates the color before it, which is ""yellow.""

3. Input: ""wif zup bluf lug"" -> Output: ""red yellow yellow blue""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" duplicates the color before it, which is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

4. Input: ""zup wif bluf zup"" -> Output: ""yellow red red yellow""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" duplicates the color before it, which is ""red,"" and the final ""zup"" repeats ""yellow.""

5. Input: ""wif bluf zup"" -> Output: ""red red yellow""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""bluf"" duplicates the color before it, which is ""red,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> duplicate the previous color word mentioned in the input.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look closely at the outputs following the appearance of the word ""walm"" in each input. By comparing the inputs with their respective outputs, we can attempt to induce the rule governing the term ""walm.""

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

Here, after ""dax walm,"" we have three greens. After ""wif lug dax walm,"" we find that the pattern restarts with green. 

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

After ""zup walm,"" the output is three yellows.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

After ""wif walm,"" the output is three reds followed by a green.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

After ""dax walm,"" the output is three greens.

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

After ""lug walm,"" the output is three blues followed by a red and then a blue.

In each instance, ""walm"" causes the next three colors to repeat the color associated with the word just before ""walm"". So far, we can observe the pattern that ""walm"" has a repeating effect on the preceding color. The instances preceding ""walm"" with ""dax"" lead to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Notably, there are always three repeated colors following ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the next three outputs to be the same color as the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue"" in every instance it is presented. This consistent translation regardless of the surrounding words (e.g., ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" ""zup"") suggests that ""lug"" is not dependent on context within these examples.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the position of the word in each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: lug wif dax | Output: blue red green
2. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug | Output: green green red yellow blue
3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug | Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
4. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
5. Input: dax lug | Output: green blue

From the above examples, we can make the following observations:

- When ""dax"" follows ""lug"" or ""wif,"" the output is ""green.""
- ""Dax"" at the beginning of the sequence also translates to ""green.""
- Regardless of ""dax"" position relative to other words, its presence always results in ""green"" in the corresponding output.

Thus, we can ascertain that the word ""dax"" translates to green regardless of its position in the sequence of words. Therefore, the rule is: 

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's look at each example and identify any patterns:

1. ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red."" 
2. ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red.""
3. ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green.""
4. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" translates to ""green blue blue blue yellow red.""
5. ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" translates to ""red red blue green red.""

We can notice that ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"" in the output. This is consistent regardless of its position in the input. Thus, it would appear that ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> ""red"".
Given the examples provided, I can observe that the output word remains consistent irrespective of the position of ""zup"" among other words. This suggests that ""zup"" translates directly to a single color word rather than it being dependent on the context or position.

Here are the indications for ""zup"":

1. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red,"" and since none of the other words surrounding ""zup"" are consistent across the other examples, ""zup"" must translate to ""yellow.""

2. ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow."" Since ""lug"" is consistently ""blue"" across all examples, this supports ""zup"" being ""yellow.""

3. ""wif zup lug"" translates to ""red yellow blue."" ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" reaffirming that ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

4. ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" where ""wif"" is ""red,"" suggesting ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

5. ""lug zup dax lug"" translates to ""blue yellow green blue,"" where both ""lug"" instances translate to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is consistent with ""green"" as in previous examples, which still points to ""zup"" being ""yellow.""

Based on the consistent translation observed in each example, the rule can be concluded as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be that it doubles the color word associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here is how the rule applies to the provided examples:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red red."" Here, ""wif"" would logically correspond to ""red,"" and the word ""bluf"" doubles the word that comes before it, resulting in ""red red.""

2. ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" is directly followed by ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is doubled due to ""bluf,"" giving us ""yellow yellow.""

3. ""zup dax bluf"" results in ""yellow green green."" In this example, ""dax"" must mean ""green,"" and ""bluf"" doubles it to ""green green.""

4. ""lug dax bluf"" results in ""blue green green."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which we have established means ""green."" Therefore, ""bluf"" causes the ""green"" to double.

5. ""dax bluf zup"" results in ""green green yellow."" This supports the rule, even with the position of ""bluf"" after ""dax,"" showing that the doubling effect occurs regardless of its position after ""dax.""

So the rule is:

bluf -> Doubles the color associated with the word that precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the consistency of the outputs when the term appears.

1. ""dax walm wif bluf"" generates the output ""green green green red red""
2. ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue""
4. ""zup walm"" again leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""dax walm"" corresponds with ""green green green""

In each of these examples, the word ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color word that precedes it (or the color that corresponds to the word preceding it). For instance, in the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"", implying that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The triple repetition suggests that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the preceding color thrice.

Observing this pattern consistently through all the inputs and outputs provided makes it plausible to deduce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,17
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

- ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red,"" suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue,"" which affirms the hypothesis that ""wif"" is ""red"" and supports ""lug"" being ""blue.""
- ""wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""red blue green green green,"" maintaining the consistency of ""wif"" as ""red,"" ""lug"" as ""blue,"" and ""dax"" as ""green.""
- ""lug wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue red yellow red,"" which is consistent with the established meanings of ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and it introduces ""zup"" as ""yellow.""
- ""dax lug dax wif dax"" translates to ""green blue green red green,"" supporting the previously understood meanings of ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
From the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" based on the consistent output across all examples.

Input: zup lug dax
Output: yellow blue green

Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue

In every instance where the nonce word ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output is ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can conclude that ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif."" Let's look at each example and try to correlate them to find the pattern.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- Here, ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" and ""red"" precedes ""blue"" in the output.

Input: lug wif dax wif
Output: blue red green red
- ""wif"" follows ""lug"" producing ""red"" after ""blue.""
- ""wif"" follows ""dax"" producing ""red"" after ""green.""

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- ""wif"" is the last in the series, resulting in ""red"" at the end.

Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green
- ""wif"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" resulting in ""red"" between ""blue"" and ""green.""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" and ""red"" appears after two ""blue"" colors.

In each example, the word ""wif"" alone doesn't correspond to a consistent color. Instead, it seems to be a function of its position or the words around it. Additionally, ""wif"" always results in ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the surrounding words. Given these observations, the simplest pattern that fits all examples is:

Rule: ""wif"" always translates to ""red."" 

Therefore,

wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns seen in the provided examples. Each word seems to correspond to a color. By aligning the input and the output, we can try to identify which word corresponds to which color.

Looking at the patterns, ""zup"" occurs in different positions and is paired with different colors. By comparing the inputs with their outputs, we can infer the following:
- In each instance where ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is also in the output.

From the given examples, we can tentatively conclude the following mapping:
- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow

Now let's verify this with the examples:

**Example 1:**
Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow
Here, ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" when it appears at the beginning and the end.

**Example 2:**
Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red
Here again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

**Example 3:**
Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
The pattern holds once more, with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow.""

**Example 4:**
Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
In this case, even though ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" we can deduce that since ""dax"" also corresponds to green, ""walm"" most likely intensifies the color mentioned before it rather than having a color of its own. Hence, ""zup"" still means ""yellow.""

**Example 5:**
Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Here, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again serves as an intensifier to the colors coming before it rather than signifying its own color.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let’s examine the examples and their outputs.

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: wif lug zup bluf
Output: red blue yellow yellow

Analyzing the occurrences of ""bluf"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. When ""dax"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" influences the first ""green"" in the output and ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""

2. When ""zup"" is before ""bluf,"" the output is two identical colors. ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and since the output mirrors the color both times (yellow yellow), it might indicate that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word directly preceding it.

3. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" it results in an output that includes red, but the next color depends on the following word. In ""wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green green,"" which aligns with our earlier findings that ""dax"" is ""green"" and as stated in point 1, ""bluf"" would then take the color preceding it. Similar reasoning can be applied in the last example.

Given these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color value corresponding to the word directly preceding it in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the second word, then it repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color value of the preceding word.
walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word that has a color association (zup -> yellow, wif -> red, dax -> green, lug -> blue), the output is that color repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax lug
    ",Output: red yellow green blue,red yellow green blue,True,18
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can try to determine the meaning of ""lug"" by looking at its output in each context.

- In the first example, ""lug wif dax wif"" corresponds to ""blue red green red."" The word ""lug"" appears first and translates to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""dax zup lug wif zup"" maps to ""green yellow blue red yellow."" The word ""lug"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""wif,"" and again translates to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug dax"" results in ""blue green."" Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" which has been established to mean ""green"" in the prior examples. ""Lug"" still corresponds with ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" turns into ""blue blue."" ""Lug"" precedes ""bluf"" which seems to also translate to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf lug"" changes to ""yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""lug"" appears at the end and still corresponds to ""blue.""

Given these observations, it is consistent across all examples that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" regardless of where it appears in the sequence. There is no context-dependent variation in the meaning of ""lug.""

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that:

- The word ""dax"" always results in the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input string.
- The terms ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" appear to correspond consistently to ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""red,"" respectively.

Therefore, the rule is as follows: 

Rule: dax -> green

Each of the other nonce words maps to a specific color, and ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the outputs each time the nonce word 'wif' appears and try to deduce its meaning. 

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: lug dax wif lug -> Output: blue green red blue
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: wif lug dax walm -> Output: red blue green green green
Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue

From the examples, we notice that every time the word 'wif' appears, the word 'red' is produced in the output. It seems consistent and independent from the context or position of 'wif' in the input sequence. 'Wif' is not influenced by the words that come before or after it. 

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

wif -> meaning: red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" reliably corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the same relative position.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, it can be determined that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each instance of the word ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to the output color ""blue."" Other words in the inputs correspond to different colors, but ""bluf"" consistently maps to ""blue"" in every example:

- Input: ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"" (bluf -> blue)
- Input: ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> Output: ""red red blue yellow"" (bluf -> blue)
- Input: ""dax bluf"" -> Output: ""green green"" (bluf -> [])
- Input: ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"" (bluf -> blue)
- Input: ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" -> Output: ""blue green green yellow blue red"" (bluf -> blue)

We do not have enough data to determine what ""bluf"" means in the context of the third example where the output is ""green green"" as there’s no direct mapping. It is likely to be an anomaly or a mistake.

Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word walm generates a sequence of color outputs that matches the color output of the word immediately preceding it. Here’s the breakdown of the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Since ""zup"" alone was not previously given, we cannot confirm its output color but we can infer that ""walm"" repeats whatever color ""zup"" represents multiple times, which in this case is presumed to be yellow.
  
- In the second example, ""dax wif walm"" correlates to ""green red red red"". Here we see that ""dax"" is green and ""wif"" is red, followed by ""walm"" which results in the repetition of ""wif""'s color output three times, indicating ""walm"" is repeating the red output.
  
- The third example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" This provides more insight as ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to blue being repeated two more times, then ""zup"" is seen followed by ""lug"" as yellow and blue respectively, with ""wif"" as red. It confirms ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

- The fourth example is ""zup lug walm wif dax"" resulting in ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" Again, we see that after ""lug,"" which is blue, comes ""walm,"" which results in a repetition of blue two more times, confirming the rule of repetition.

- The fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" gives us ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" ""Dax"" is green, followed by ""walm"" which repeats the green output twice. Then ""zup"" presumed yellow, ""lug"" blue, followed by ""walm"" which repeats the blue output twice.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color output of the preceding word multiple times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,19
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
Observing the provided examples:

Input: wif zup dax
Output: red yellow green

Input: dax wif zup
Output: green red yellow

In the first two examples, we can see that ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"" and that the order of the colors corresponds with the order of the words.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: dax
Output: green

In these two examples, ""dax"" alone or followed by ""bluf"" continues to correspond with the color green.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Here again, ""dax"" corresponds with green, following the color pattern established directly before it.

Rule:
dax -> green

This suggests that ""dax"" means ""green"" or represents the color green in these examples. The position of ""dax"" in the input does not alter its meaning, as it consistently outputs ""green"" regardless of where it occurs in the sequence.
Based on the input-output pairs:

- ""wif lug"" generates ""red blue""
- ""wif bluf lug"" generates ""red red blue""
- ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" generates ""yellow blue red green green red""
- ""zup wif"" generates ""yellow red""
- ""lug wif bluf"" generates ""blue red red""

I can observe that irrespective of the word before ""wif"", the output always contains ""red"" immediately after the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""wif"". ""Bluf"" after a ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". Therefore, the color corresponding to ""wif"" seems to be ""red"". Additionally, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" alone corresponds to ""green"".

Based on the examples, the rule: 

wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the inputs corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the outputs, regardless of the context or surrounding words. The other words in the inputs (lug, walm, wif) correspond to their own respective colors.
Based on the given examples, we have to induce the rule behind the word ""bluf"". Let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs systematically:

Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue
Analysis: ""bluf"" occurs as the last word and its color is blue. The color before ""bluf"" is blue too.

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green
Analysis: ""bluf"" corresponds to the second red. There's no blue color before ""bluf"" here.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
Analysis: Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second red.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
Analysis: Once more, ""bluf"" corresponds to red, which is the same as the color associated with the word right before it, ""wif"".

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
Analysis: ""bluf"" corresponds to a green, which is the same as the color associated with the word right before it, ""dax"".

From these examples, a possible rule could be that ""bluf"" represents the same color as the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the color is the same as the color represented by the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the input and corresponding output sequences.

From the first example:
- Input: zup wif walm
- Output: yellow red red red

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""Walm"" is followed by two additional reds.

From the second example:
- Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

We can pinpoint other words' meanings by their repetition. ""Zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" In this sequence, after ""walm,"" there are two more yellows before the pattern diverges with ""dax.""

From the third example:
- Input: zup dax walm lug wif
- Output: yellow green green green blue red

Again, we can identify ""zup"" as yellow, ""dax"" as green, ""lug"" as blue, and ""wif"" as red. After ""walm,"" we notice three greens in the output, which is a repetition of the color that precedes ""walm.""

From the fourth example:
- Input: wif lug dax walm
- Output: red blue green green green

Here, green repeats three times after ""walm,"" which aligns with ""dax"" being green. 

From the fifth example:
- Input: lug zup walm lug
- Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

In this instance, it's the same case: ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that precedes it, i.e., yellow.

Combining the observations from all examples, ""walm"" appears to cause the next color word (or the color corresponding to the next word in the sequence) to repeat three additional times.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug bluf wif
    ",Output: green blue blue red,green blue blue red,True,20
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" is as follows:

Rule: dax -> the color green.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every time the ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output at the same position. Here is how ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" in the examples:

- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (wif corresponds to the first ""red"")
- Input: lug wif -> Output: blue red (wif corresponds to ""red"")
- Input: dax wif lug dax -> Output: green red blue green (wif corresponds to ""red"")
- Input: wif zup bluf wif dax -> Output: red yellow yellow red green (wif corresponds to the first and fourth ""red"")
- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (wif corresponds to ""red"")

Rule:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time it is used in a sequence, it is translated as ""yellow.""
Given the examples, it seems like ""bluf"" as a nonce word corresponds directly to the color that follows its appearance in the output sequence. Here's the breakdown based on the provided Input/Output pairs:

- In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" and ""zup"" is also directly followed by ""yellow.""
- In ""wif bluf lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" and ""lug"" is followed by ""blue.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" both instances of ""bluf"" are immediately followed by ""yellow.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""red.""
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" the occurrence of ""bluf"" is followed by a sequence of three ""blue.""

Now to consolidate this information into a rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The color that directly succeeds ""bluf"" in the output sequence is repeated as many times as the number of syllables present in the word(s) that directly follow ""bluf"" in the input sequence.

Applying this rule:

- ""dax bluf zup"" results in green green yellow because ""zup"" immediately follows ""bluf"" and has one syllable, so ""green"" is repeated once before moving to ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup.""
- ""wif bluf lug"" results in red red blue because ""lug"" immediately follows ""bluf"" with one syllable, implying a single repetition of ""red"" before ""blue.""
- ""zup bluf"" results in yellow yellow because there is no word after ""bluf,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated once by default.
- ""wif bluf"" also yields red red by the same logic as in the ""zup bluf"" case.
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" produces red yellow yellow blue blue blue because ""lug walm"" immediately follows ""bluf,"" with ""lug"" having one syllable and ""walm"" having one syllable, so ""blue"" is repeated twice, one for each successive word.

Therefore, the rule defined seems to fit all the given examples.

Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. To break it down:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", meaning ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times.
2. ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green green green"", so ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times after the sequence ""red blue"".
3. ""dax walm"" again results in ""green green green"", reinforcing the previous rule deduced.
4. ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", meaning ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) three times before the sequence ends with the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).
5. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" results in ""blue green yellow green green green red"", where ""walm"" again repeats the color associated with the preceding word (""dax"" which is green) three times, then followed by a color associated with ""wif"" (red).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    ",Output: green,green,True,21
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time the nonce word ""lug"" is used, the output includes the color ""blue."" However, we need to pay attention to any modifiers that might affect the meaning of ""lug."" 

Let's analyze:

1. lug zup -> blue yellow
 - Here, ""lug"" comes before ""zup,"" and ""blue"" comes before ""yellow"" in the output.

2. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
 - ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and ""blue"" is followed by ""blue blue"" in the output, suggesting that the meaning of ""lug"" might be modified by the word following it, but we have another instance of ""lug"" without ""walm"" directly after it. Given that ""zup"" bookends this example and correlates to ""yellow,"" we can deduce that ""lug"" still translates to ""blue.""

3. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
 - ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" and ""blue"" is followed by ""green"" in the output. This pattern maintains ""lug"" meaning ""blue.""

4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
 - Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times. Despite this repetition, we cannot conclude that ""lug"" alone represents multiple ""blues"" because previous examples indicate that the following word (""walm"") also affects the output.

5. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
 - In this example, ""lug"" results in a single ""blue"" at the end of the output sequence, reaffirming our prior understanding that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Rule:
lug -> blue

This rule holds true regardless of the words that follow ""lug"" in each example, as ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs.
Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   
3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   
4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   
5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

From analyzing the examples, we can induce the following rules:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, it is followed by the color ""green"" in the output.
- It seems each word is associated with a color output. For example, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""walm"" leads to ""green,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" itself does not change its output color regardless of its position in the sequence.
- There is no evidence that ""dax"" affects the words around it, as their associated colors remain consistent regardless of the presence of ""dax.""

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

This means the nonce word ""dax"" is associated with the color green, independent of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word preceding or following ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. Here, we can attempt to match each instance of ""wif"" to the color ""red"":

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red

- ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""red green."" 
- ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red.""
- ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, and the output is still ""red.""

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red

- ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, and the output is ""red.""

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

- ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red.""

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red

- ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red.""
- ""wif"" is at the end, following ""dax,"" and the output is ""green red.""

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

- ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""green red.""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the output is ""red green.""

Based on these instances, ""wif"" does not seem to require any specific word to come before or after it to correspond to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the given examples. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue
   
   In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to a repeated ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" at the end translates to ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" occurs between two ""yellow"" outputs.

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
   In this case, ""bluf"" is also between two ""yellow"" outputs, but since ""lug"" is absent, it does not result in a ""blue"" output, so ""bluf"" itself cannot mean ""blue."" Therefore, ""bluf"" must be responsible for the repetition of the color preceding it, which in this case is ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   
   Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to another ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" but ""bluf"" results in the repetition of ""blue"" before ""red"" is introduced. This reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color preceding it.

4. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   
   In this instance, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" once again results in the repetition of ""green."" This confirms the rule suggested by the earlier examples.

5. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   
   This final example shows ""wif"" -> ""red,"" ""dax"" -> ""green,"" followed by another ""red,"" but after ""bluf,"" the pattern repeats ""red"" before moving onto ""yellow,"" once again indicating that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color seen just before it.

Based on the analysis of these examples, the rule appears to be: 

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word that was just mentioned before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at how the output colors change in relation to the appearance of ""walm"" and the preceding words. Here are the observations based on the provided examples:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" After ""walm,"" the output has multiple greens, indicating ""walm"" may have something to do with repeating the color of the word just before it.

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" ""Walm"" in this case is followed by yellow, but the blue is returned at the end, suggesting ""walm"" may not be as straightforward as replicating the previous color.

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""Wif"" generates a ""red"" and is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in additional reds.

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - Here, ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is red. ""Walm"" again leads to a repetition of red.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - After ""walm,"" there is a repetition of green (""dax"").

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it until a different word with an associated color appears.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to be repeated until a different color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug zup lug
    ",Output: blue green blue yellow blue,blue green blue yellow blue,True,22
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the word ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the output. There is a one-to-one correlation between the occurrences of ""wif"" and the word ""red"" in the outputs provided. Additionally, other words such as ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" seem to correspond to their own unique colors. Given that each input that includes ""wif"" results in ""red"" in the output, regardless of the order of the words or the presence of other words, we can determine the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""

Given these translations, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in every instance. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf seems to mean ""repeat the color of the previous word"".

Explanation:

1. In the first example, ""dax lug bluf dax"", dax corresponds to green and bluf is followed by blue, which is the color of lug. Therefore, bluf represents the repetition of the color of lug, which is blue.

2. In the second example, ""wif lug zup bluf"", wif corresponds to red, zup to yellow, and lug to blue. Bluf is followed by yellow, which is the color for zup, indicating again that bluf represents the repetition of the color of the previous word.

3. In the third example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"", zup corresponds to yellow, wif to red, and dax to green. Bluf is followed by red, which is the color for wif, reinforcing that bluf is the repetition of the color of the previous word.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", bluf is followed by blue, which is the color associated with the word lug that appears right after it. This would suggest a deviation from the initial pattern unless walm also means blue, which would then maintain the rule by showing that bluf is followed by the color blue twice, repeating the color of lug.

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf zup"", bluf is followed by red, which is the color for wif, keeping consistent with the rule that bluf means to repeat the color of the previous word.

These observations lead to the following definition:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" does not have a consistent color output associated with it but causes a repetition of the color that follows it an additional two times. Here's how the rule is deduced from the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" may cause the color that follows (""wif,"" which is red) to be repeated two more times.
- In the second example, ""walm wif walm"" leads to ""green green green red red red,"" following the same pattern of ""walm"" causing the color of the word after it to be repeated two more times.
- In the third example, the sequence ""wif walm lug zup walm"" results in ""red red red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" supporting the rule that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the subsequent color.
- The fourth and fifth examples further support this observation, with ""walm"" causing repeating colors.

Rule:
walm -> causes the color word that follows it to be repeated two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif
    ",Output: red blue red,red blue red,True,23
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Regardless of the context or its position in a sequence, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: Regardless of its position in the input sequence, the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Rule: wif -> red

Every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output always begins with ""red."" There is a consistent one-to-one correspondence regardless of the other words that follow ""wif.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output in the corresponding position. Therefore, it can be concluded that the word ""zup"" represents the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the instances where it appears and the corresponding color that is output. Here is the analysis:

1. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow green yellow green red red."" The presence of ""bluf"" at the end correlates with a repeating color, ""red"" in this case.

2. ""lug bluf dax lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue."" Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""dax,"" yet the color ""blue"" is repeated.

3. ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue."" Directly after ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated, thanks to the presence of ""bluf.""

4. ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and in both cases, it leads to a repeated color, ""yellow"" after ""zup"" and ""blue"" after ""lug.""

5. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" After ""zup,"" we again see that ""bluf"" produces a repeated ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it seems ""bluf"" may induce repetition of the color that is directly associated with the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is tied to a repetition of a colored output, with the specific color being determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm"". The number of repetitions is consistent with the number of syllables in the word that comes before ""walm"". Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"" (lug has one syllable, leading to three repetitions of ""blue"")
- ""zup dax walm"" produces ""yellow green green green"" (dax has one syllable, leading to three repetitions of ""green"")
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" produces ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"" (lug has one syllable, leading to three repetitions of ""blue"", and wif has one syllable, leading to three repetitions of ""red"")
- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"" (zup has one syllable, leading to three repetitions of ""yellow"")
- ""dax walm wif walm"" produces ""green green green red red red"" (dax has one syllable, leading to three repetitions of ""green"", and wif has one syllable, leading to three repetitions of ""red"")

Based on this, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

The coloring rule seems to be independently determined by the word itself:
- lug always corresponds to ""blue""
- zup always corresponds to ""yellow""
- dax always corresponds to ""green""
- wif always corresponds to ""red""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,24
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can analyze the occurrences of the word ""lug"" and its corresponding output in color. Here's a breakdown:

- In the first example, the sequence ""lug wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when it is followed by ""wif"" (red).
- In the second example, the sequence ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue."" This further supports the hypothesis that ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue,"" which is consistent with ""lug"" meaning ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" appears once and corresponds to ""blue."" The other colors in the sequence seem to correlate with other words: ""zup"" with yellow, ""walm"" with yellow, ""dax"" with green, ""wif"" with red, and ""bluf"" with red red.
- The fifth example does not directly help with deducing the meaning of ""lug,"" but it is consistent with previous deductions considering that where ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" follows in the translation.

Each example supports the conclusion that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its surrounding context. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This direct relationship indicates that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position within the sequence of words.

Rule: dax -> green
The examples provided offer a pattern that can be followed to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"".

Here's the breakdown of the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. Input: wif dax  
   Output: red green
   
2. Input: wif  
   Output: red
   
3. Input: wif bluf dax  
   Output: red red green
   
4. Input: lug wif bluf  
   Output: blue red red
   
5. Input: wif lug dax  
   Output: red blue green

Based on these examples, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. When other words like ""dax"" or ""bluf"" are used, they produce the outputs ""green"" and ""red"", respectively, which correspond to their position after ""wif"". Also, the appearance of ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.

Hence, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

Additionally, ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" suggesting that ""wif"" does not change the output associated with these words. ""Lug"" seems to correspons to ""blue"" regardless of its position.
Analyzing the examples provided:

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> Output: red green yellow red green green
Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue

Looking at the correspondences between the input and output:

1. ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"".
2. ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue"".
3. ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" in every instance it appears.
4. ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it is before ""lug"" and ""yellow"" otherwise. But, since in one instance it directly precedes ""zup"" and results in ""yellow yellow"", this indicates that ""zup"" does not depend on ""walm"" for its meaning.
5. There are no instances of ""zup"" influencing the colors that follow.

From these observations, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"", and the meaning of other words that follow ""zup"" conforms with their meanings when ""zup"" is not present. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in each example where it appears:

- Example 1: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug maps to yellow green green red yellow yellow blue. ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"" and in both cases is mapped to ""green.""
- Example 2: lug wif bluf maps to blue red red. ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is mapped to ""red.""
- Example 3: zup dax bluf zup dax maps to yellow green green yellow green. ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and is mapped to ""green.""
- Example 4: lug bluf dax bluf maps to blue blue green green. ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" and maps to ""blue,"" and it precedes ""dax,"" mapping to ""green.""
- Example 5: zup lug zup bluf lug maps to yellow blue yellow yellow blue. ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is mapped to ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the word immediately preceding it. The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that comes before it. 

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> Takes the color of the word before it.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it a certain number of times. Here is the logic deduced from the examples:

1. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and we get ""red"" three times.

2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and we get ""blue"" three times.

3. ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green""
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and we get ""green"" three times.

4. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and we get ""blue"" three times.

5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and we get ""green"" three times.

Rule: 
walm -> causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: yellow green blue green,yellow green blue green,True,25
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" 

Evidence for the rule is as follows:

- In every example where the word ""lug"" appears, the output consistently contains the word ""blue."" 
- Even when ""lug"" is combined with other words, its corresponding output is ""blue,"" and other colors correspond to the other input words (""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""walm"" to ""blue blue,"" suggesting a repetitive pattern, and ""bluf"" does not appear in the input examples, but based on the output, we might assume it translates to ""green"").
- The rule holds for a single occurrence of ""lug"" as well as for multiple occurrences within the same input.
Based on the provided examples, the following pattern emerges related to the nonce word ""dax"":

Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" repeated three times

Input: zup dax walm zup wif -> Output: yellow green green green yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""green"" repeated three times
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""

Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green""

Input: dax -> Output: green
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""

Input: lug dax wif lug -> Output: blue green red blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""

From these observations, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context. Hence, the rule for ""dax"" is:

dax -> green
wif -> red. Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other nonce words. Other words in the sequences are associated with their respective colors as follows: 

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> green (this seems to behave the same as dax, both mapping to green)

Each word is systematically mapped to a specific color in the output sequence, maintaining the order they appear in the input.
Based on the given examples, we can infer that ""zup"" translates to a specific color in the output:

- In the first example, ""dax lug zup"" corresponds to ""green blue yellow."" Since we can see that ""dax"" means green (as evidenced by the fourth input/output pair) and ""lug"" means blue (from the first input/output pair), it's reasonable to deduce that ""zup"" means yellow.
- The second example further supports this by showing ""zup"" alone translates to ""yellow.""
- The third and fifth examples continue to support the rule that ""zup"" means yellow, regardless of the position it holds in the sequence.
- The fourth example shows that ""zup"" maintains its meaning even when repeated or used alongside another word that has been repeated (""dax"").

Therefore the rule is:

**Rule**: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output. To determine which color it represents, let's analyze the examples.

1. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
5. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow

In every example, the word ""bluf"" consistently results in the word ""yellow"" appearing in the output. Furthermore, ""bluf"" does not replace any other word for a color, and its position in the input does not seem to affect its corresponding output. This suggests that ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or context within the string.

Rule: bluf -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the corresponding color outputs for each input phrase:

- In the first example, ""dax lug wif walm"" corresponds to ""green blue red red red."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" the repetition of ""red"" three times seems to be a result of the presence of ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""zup walm dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" We see that ""dax"" is consistent with ""green,"" and ""zup"" appears to correspond with ""yellow."" Since we see ""yellow"" repeated twice, it indicates that ""walm"" might cause the preceding color to repeat.

- The third example, ""zup wif walm,"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and again, there's a repetition of ""red"" due to ""walm.""

- For the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" converts to ""yellow yellow red red red."" We can see that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a color but instead causes the preceding ""yellow"" from ""zup"" to repeat. The ""wif walm"" at the end causes ""red red red,"" once again indicating the repetition effect of ""walm.""

- The fifth example, ""lug wif walm,"" produces ""blue red red red."" Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the ""red"" to repeat.

Considering the common pattern across these examples, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the immediately preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output. Hence, ""walm"" corresponds to tripling the previous color's mention.

Rule: walm -> repeats the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,26
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words. Each additional word in the input sequence corresponds to a different color, with ""wif"" corresponding to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Thus, the rule we can induce from these examples is:

wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to be associated with the color yellow consistently. Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

This means that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that bluf represents the color one step before the mentioned color in the sequence of a predefined color order. If we analyze the examples:

1. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red. ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" also translates to blue, indicating that ""bluf"" is the color before red in this sequence.
2. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow. ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" between two yellows translates to blue, again signifying it's the color before yellow.
3. dax lug bluf dax -> green blue blue green. ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" translates to blue once more, which is consistent with the previous examples.
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow. ""zup"" is yellow, which means ""bluf"" here represents yellow as well.
5. lug bluf zup -> blue blue yellow. ""lug"" is blue, followed by ""bluf"" translating to blue, which again confirms the rule.

From this, we can deduce that the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it represents the color immediately preceding the next color named in a specific color sequence.

Rule: bluf represents the color that comes immediately before the next mentioned color in a sequence. The sequence appears to be (from last to first when reversing the mentioned color): Red -> Blue -> Yellow -> Green. Therefore, bluf before red is blue, before yellow is blue as well, and before green it becomes yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

- Every instance of ""walm"" in the input results in a repetition of the color connected with the immediately preceding word in the output. Furthermore, the color is repeated an additional two times, making three consecutive appearances of the same color.

Analyzing the individual examples:

1. `Input: wif bluf dax walm` results in `Output: red red green green green`.
   - The word preceding ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" After ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.

2. `Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm` results in `Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow`.
   - The first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (""red""), so ""red"" is repeated three times after.
   - The second ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (""yellow""), hence ""yellow"" is repeated three times after.

3. `Input: lug zup dax walm` results in `Output: blue yellow green green green`.
   - ""Walm"" follows ""dax""; accordingly, ""green"" is repeated three times.

4. `Input: wif dax zup walm` results in `Output: red green yellow yellow yellow`.
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

5. `Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif` results in `Output: blue green yellow green green green red`.
   - ""Walm"" follows the second ""dax""; thus, ""green"" is repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be outputted three times in a row.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided context.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by comparing the inputs and outputs.

- Whenever ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- Each example that includes ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Every instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present at the corresponding position in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words surrounding it.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.
From the examples provided, it can be deduced that ""bluf"" changes meaning based on the word that comes before it. Let's analyze each case:

1. `lug dax bluf wif dax` -> `blue green green red green`
   - Here, 'dax' precedes 'bluf,' and 'green' follows 'bluf.'

2. `wif bluf zup` -> `red red yellow`
   - Here, 'wif' precedes 'bluf,' and 'red' follows 'bluf.'

3. `dax zup lug bluf` -> `green yellow blue blue`
   - Here, 'lug' precedes 'bluf,' and 'blue' follows 'bluf.'

4. `dax zup bluf` -> `green yellow yellow`
   - No word precedes 'bluf'; 'yellow' follows 'bluf.'

5. `wif zup bluf` -> `red yellow yellow`
   - No word precedes 'bluf'; 'yellow' follows 'bluf.'

Based on the information above, it appears that 'bluf' corresponds to the color that is mentioned after it, which is dependent on the word preceding it. If 'dax' comes before 'bluf,' the color is 'green.' If 'wif' comes before it, the color is 'red.' If 'lug' precedes it, the color is 'blue.' If no word precedes 'bluf,' the color is 'yellow.'

Rule: 
bluf -> meaning is the color that follows it, as determined by the word preceding it:
- 'dax' before 'bluf': meaning is green
- 'wif' before 'bluf': meaning is red
- 'lug' before 'bluf': meaning is blue
- No word before 'bluf': meaning is yellow
Observing the pattern from the given examples, it appears that the word 'walm' in the inputs correlates with repeating the color of the word immediately preceding it in the outputs. Specifically, 'walm' causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated multiple times.

Let's verify this with each example:

1. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   After 'dax', which outputs green, 'walm' is present, and it is followed by two additional greens before encountering a new word ('wif' -> red).

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   After 'wif', which outputs red, 'walm' is present, and it is followed by two additional reds.

3. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   After 'dax', which outputs green, 'walm' is present, and it is followed by two additional greens.

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   After 'lug', which outputs blue, 'walm' is present, and it is followed by two additional blues.

5. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   After the second 'wif', which outputs red, 'walm' is present, and it is followed by two additional reds.

The rule for 'walm' seems to be that it repeats the color of the immediately preceding word two additional times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the directly preceding word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,28
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Here's the breakdown for each separate input and output:

1. Input: dax 
   Output: green 
   
2. Input: dax walm wif dax 
   Output: green green green red green
   
3. Input: dax 
   Output: green
   
4. Input: dax wif 
   Output: green red
   
5. Input: dax lug 
   Output: green blue

The word ""dax"" itself consistently translates to ""green,"" as seen in each example. Now, let's examine the other words to figure out if we can deduce the pattern for them:

- ""walm"" seems to translate to ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax,"" as in the second input, but there are no other examples of ""walm"" to confirm its meaning outside this context.
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" consistently, whenever it appears after ""dax.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" once, when it appears after ""dax.""

With the information provided, we can't definitively determine the rules for ""walm"" and ""lug,"" since we have an insufficient number of examples. However, for the nonce word ""dax"" and ""wif,"" we have consistent outputs:

Rule:
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue (based on a single instance, hence, less certain)
- walm -> green (based on a single context, hence, less certain)
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is included in the output. The position of ""wif"" in the input does not alter its corresponding output color. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" should be included in the output.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be consistent and straightforward. In all cases, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to consistently correspond to the color blue when it follows the words ""lug"" or ""dax,"" but when it stands alone or is preceded directly by ""zup"", it takes on the color that the preceding word represents. 

Here are the observations from the examples that led to this rule:

- When ""wif lug bluf"" appears, the output is ""red blue blue."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""lug bluf"" consistently corresponds to blue in other examples, it implies that ""bluf"" following ""lug"" means blue.

- When ""zup lug bluf"" appears, the output is ""yellow blue blue."" Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""lug bluf"" consistently outputs blue.

- When ""zup dax bluf"" appears, the output is ""yellow green green."" This indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""dax bluf"" thus appears to be green followed by blue. However, following the pattern from other examples that ""bluf"" after a color indicates a repetition of that color, in this case, ""bluf"" after ""dax"" may imply another green rather than blue.

- When ""zup bluf"" appears, the output is ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup"" and thus repeats the color yellow, instead of representing blue.

- The example ""wif lug bluf"" and its output ""red blue blue"" corroborates the rule deduced from other examples that ""bluf"" following ""lug"" outputs blue.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another color-indicative word directly, it repeats the color of that word. When ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug"" or ""dax,"" it means blue. 

bluf -> meaning: If preceded by ""lug"" or ""dax"", then blue. If preceded by any other color word without ""lug"" or ""dax"" in between, then it repeats the preceding color.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. Each unique word except ""walm"" and ""wif"" corresponds to a color as follows: 

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" (as indicated by the second example where ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"")

The word ""wif"" does not repeat the color following it and seems to represent the color red on its own, as shown in the last two examples.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,29
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue"" regardless of the context in which ""lug"" appears. Whether ""lug"" is in between two other nonce words or on its own, the output remains the same. Therefore, the rule can be determined as:

lug -> meaning: blue

Rule: When ""lug"" is present in the input, translate it to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the word ""dax."" Let's analyze the outputs corresponding to the examples where ""dax"" is present:

1. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue""
2. ""zup lug dax"" results in ""yellow blue green""
3. ""dax zup wif zup"" results in ""green yellow red yellow""
4. ""zup wif dax"" results in ""yellow red green""
5. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green""

Observing the patterns, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the input sequences containing ""wif"" with their respective outputs.

Looking at the examples provided:

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Now, let's analyze these sequences to discover the pattern for ""wif.""

1. In every output sequence, the color ""red"" occurs at least once after the word ""wif"" is mentioned.
2. The number of ""red"" occurrences in the output corresponds to the number of words following ""wif"" in the input, plus one. 

For example:
- In the first input, ""wif"" is followed by two words, and there are two occurrences of ""red"" in the output.
- In the second input, ""wif"" is followed by one word, and there is one occurrence of ""red"" in the output.
- In the third input, ""wif"" is not followed by any word, and we see one ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth input, ""wif"" is followed by one word, and we have two ""red"" in the output.
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" is followed by two words and there are three ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, from these observations, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be that it outputs ""red"" as many times as the number of words that come after it in the input sequence plus one additional ""red"".

Rule: wif -> ""red"" repeated n+1 times, where n is the number of words following ""wif"".
Based on the examples given, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given inputs and outputs, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it corresponds to the color mentioned after the immediate previous color in the sequence. To put this into context:

- ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow"" because the color before ""bluf"" is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" here.

- In the sequence ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"", we see that ""bluf"" is preceded by the colors ""green"" (for ""dax""), so ""bluf"" here is ""green"" in the output.

- When we look at ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""green"" again, and it is ""green"" in the output.

- For the sequence ""zup bluf wif"", ""bluf"" is immediately after ""yellow"" and hence is ""yellow"" in the output.

- Finally, the sequence ""wif bluf dax walm"" indicates that ""bluf"" follows ""red"" and hence it is ""red"" in the output.

Taking all this into consideration, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color immediately before.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color immediately before the word ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the output for each input instance where the word ""walm"" appears:

1. Input: zup walm 
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: wif walm zup 
   Output: red red red yellow

3. Input: lug wif walm 
   Output: blue red red red
   
4. Input: wif dax lug walm 
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   
5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

By comparing all the examples, it seems that ""walm"" does not correspond to any consistent color like other words might. However, ""walm"" being always at the end suggests that it could be a rule relating to repetition. 

In the first and fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the presence of ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated three times. In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which then leads to ""red"" being repeated three times before finally ""zup"" adds a ""yellow."" In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated afterwards. Finally, in the fourth example, we see that ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" lead to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively, but only ""blue"" is repeated after ""walm.""

These examples seem to indicate that ""walm"" requires the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times. However, in the fourth example, ""blue"" is repeated twice, not thrice, possibly due to either an error in the pattern or because the pattern involves the total number of color instances after ""walm"" equaling three, including the original mention.

Assuming the former as the rule (since it is consistent in all but one example), the usage of ""walm"" is to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word a total of three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word a total of three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each output. Here are the deduced matchings:

- lug zup dax lug -> blue yellow green blue
- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
- dax zup lug -> green yellow blue
- zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
- lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Here is the analysis of each example:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green

2. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   - Here, ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" given that the new element in the input results in an additional color in the output.

3. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - This example reaffirms that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - This is consistent with previous examples.

5. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   - In this example, it seems that ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue,"" given that it appears before instances of ""blue"" in the output. There is a new element ""walm"" in the input for which there are two additional occurrences of ""blue"" in the output. It may be that ""lug walm"" together correspond to a repeated ""blue blue,"" or ""walm"" on its own corresponds to two occurrences of ""blue.""

Rule: Based on the given data:

dax -> green

The presence of ""dax"" in the input reliably corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the presence of other words.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Here is how the rule applies to each example:

- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red"" again, producing ""blue red red.""
- In ""zup wif lug wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and the second ""wif"" to ""red"" again, yielding ""yellow red blue red.""
- In ""wif dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" resulting in ""red green.""
- In ""wif"" by itself, it simply corresponds to ""red.""
- In ""zup wif bluf zup,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""red"" again, and the last ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" giving us ""yellow red red yellow.""

Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" is consistent across all examples and equates to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it is evident that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position or the context within the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the rules appear to be as follows:

- The word following ""bluf"" is always repeated in the Output.
- The color associated with the word following ""bluf"" is the color given for ""bluf"" in the Output.

Confirming this rule with the examples:

Input: lug bluf dax lug
- The word following ""bluf"" is ""dax"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"", which is before and after ""bluf"", corresponds to blue.
Output: blue blue green blue

Input: zup bluf
- The word following ""bluf"" does not exist (end of line).
- The color for ""zup"", which comes before ""bluf"", is repeated.
Output: yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf dax walm
- The word following ""bluf"" is ""dax"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""wif"", before ""bluf"", corresponds to red.
- ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and is repeated three times, indicating a green sequence as well.
Output: red red green green green

Input: dax bluf wif lug
- The word following ""bluf"" is ""wif"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" is green, ""lug"" after ""wif"" is blue.
Output: green green red blue

Input: dax bluf wif zup
- The word following ""bluf"" is ""wif"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" is green, ""zup"" after ""wif"" is yellow.
Output: green green red yellow

With this pattern in mind, the rule seems to be:
Rule: bluf -> The color of the word following ""bluf"" (if the word is at the end and no word follows ""bluf"", then the color of the word before ""bluf"" is used), and the word following ""bluf"" is repeated in the Output.
walm -> three repetitions of a color word. The color is determined by the word that precedes ""walm.""

Rule: If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" then the output is ""blue"" repeated three times. If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" then the output is ""green"" repeated three times. If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" then the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times. If ""walm"" follows another ""walm,"" the pattern initiated by the preceding color word continues without adding extra instances of the word ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule appears to be a direct word-to-word substitution.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Here's how the rule is applied based on the examples given:

Input: dax
Output: green
- The sole input ""dax"" corresponds directly to ""green"".

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red
- In this sequence, ""dax"" is associated with ""green"". The other words must have their own color associations since they are consistent where they appear more than once in the input and output pairs (""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is red, and ""lug"" is blue).

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" here as well. Using the same logic as before, ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" is green.

Input: dax lug zup
Output: green blue yellow
- The presence of ""dax"" before ""lug"" and ""zup,"" which are blue and yellow respectively according to previous examples, confirms ""dax"" as green.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" is once again associated with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is also associated with ""green"" here, which may seem inconsistent with the second input. However, since ""dax"" outputs green consistently, it's possible that ""bluf"" can be either red or green depending on context not provided in the examples, or there's a mistake in the examples.

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" consistently means ""green"" regardless of its position in the inputs.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Here is the mapping we can deduce from the given inputs and outputs:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow

With this in mind, let's look at where 'zup' appears and how it corresponds to the output:

- When 'zup' appears after 'wif,' 'bluf' follows and the output is red yellow yellow. The presence of 'zup' did not disrupt the sequence that we know: 'wif' leads to red and 'bluf' leads to yellow. Hence, 'zup' is yellow.
- In the second input, 'zup' comes after 'lug,' which leads to the color blue, and the next color is yellow. Again, 'zup' seems to output yellow.
- In the third input, 'zup' is the only word apart from 'walm,' which we know maps to yellow. Since the output is three yellows, and we know 'walm' maps to one yellow, 'zup' must map to yellow too.
- For the fourth input, 'zup' is followed by 'bluf' and 'wif,' which map to yellow and red respectively, and precedes 'lug' and 'dax,' which map to blue and green. The output sequence is yellow yellow red blue green, consistent with our established mappings, reconfirming that 'zup' is yellow.
- The fifth input again has 'zup' between 'wif' and 'dax,' which gives us red and green in the output as expected. 'zup' corresponds with yellow once again.

Given all these observations, every time 'zup' appears, the output color associated with it is yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> red

Rule: Based on the provided examples, every time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. This rule maintains consistency across all examples given.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" also results in ""green.""
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" where both ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green.""
- ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow.""
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue blue green red red green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the context of ""lug"" preceding it. ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red.""
- ""dax walm"" appears again with the translation ""green green green,"" confirming the previous observation that ""walm"" corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" takes the color value of the word that came immediately before it. In every instance where ""walm"" appears, it duplicates the color of the preceding word.

walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to duplicate the color value of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,32
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"". Here's how it's shown:

- In the first input, ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue."" Since ""dax"" appears in other examples and consistently translates to ""green,"" it is isolated that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- In the second input, ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" translates to ""red red blue green red."" We know ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and a pattern emerges where ""wif"" translates to ""red."" ""bluf"" does not have other examples for comparison, but by process of elimination, it seems to translate to ""red,"" leaving ""lug"" to translate to ""blue.""
- In the third input, the single word ""lug"" directly translates to the single word ""blue,"" further confirming that ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- The fourth input, ""zup dax lug wif dax,"" translates to ""yellow green blue red green."" Here, ""zup"" is consistently paired with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""wif"" with ""red,"" leaving ""lug"" to translate to ""blue"" once again.
- The fifth input, ""zup lug,"" translates to ""yellow blue."" As seen before, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" confirming yet again that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to identify the consistent correlation between the given inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's analyze the instances where ""dax"" appears and what output it consistently translates to.

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Based on the outputs corresponding to the inputs, each time ""dax"" is included in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output. In all instances, ""dax"" correlates directly to ""green."" This suggests that the rule is that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the word ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the examples that relate the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red
2. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
3. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
4. Input: dax wif | Output: green red
5. Input: dax zup walm wif walm | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Let's analyze:

- Each input that contains ""wif"" alone has ""red"" as the last color in the output sequence.
- The word immediately preceding ""wif"" seems to determine the color that precedes ""red"" in the output.

From the given inputs and outputs, the rules seem to be:
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the output.
- The input immediately before ""wif"" translates to another color in the output sequence just before ""red"".

Therefore, the rule could be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"", and the output color immediately before ""red"" corresponds to the color translation of the word immediately preceding ""wif"" in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following meanings for the words used:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- Repeating the word ""zup"" does not change its meaning; it always translates to ""yellow"".
- The position of ""zup"" in a sequence does not alter its meaning; it always translates to ""yellow"".
- The presence of other words before or after ""zup"" does not seem to affect its meaning.

Given these observations, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

This suggests that the meaning of ""zup"" is independent of the context in which it is used.
Given the examples, the rule appears to be that the output word for ""bluf"" matches the color of the word that precedes it:

Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green (bluf follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"")
Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue (bluf follows ""wif"" then ""lug"" and each time matches the color of the preceding word which are ""red"" and ""blue"", respectively)
Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow (bluf follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"")
Input: wif lug bluf -> Output: red blue blue (bluf follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"")
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (bluf follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"")

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in each input relative to the output. Let's consider the number of words in the input and the number of colors in the output:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red""
   - The word ""walm"" gives us three reds, and ""zup"" gives us one yellow before the reds.

2. Input: ""lug walm"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue""
   - ""Walm"" results in three blues, and there is no additional color before them; ""lug"" does not result in a new color.

3. Input: ""zup wif dax walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red green green green""
   - The word ""walm"" leads to three greens following a ""dax,"" and there are two other colors before that: ""zup"" gives yellow and ""wif"" gives red.

4. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green""
   - Again, ""walm"" gives us three greens after a ""dax,"" and the other words provide their respective colors (""wif"" gives us red and ""bluf"" seems to have no impact).

5. Input: ""zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - The word ""walm"" on its own after ""zup"" leads to three yellows.

From the above, it seems that ""walm"" is a word that produces a triplet of colors. The type of color repeated three times is determined by the word that precedes ""walm."" If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it results in three yellows; if ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it results in three greens; and if ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in three blues.

Moreover, it seems that ""zup"" correlates with yellow, ""wif"" correlates with red, ""lug"" leads to blue when followed by ""walm,"" and ""dax"" correlates with green when followed by ""walm."" No other color correlations are seen, and words like ""bluf"" do not seem to affect the outcome.

Rule: ""Walm"" -> meaning. ""Walm"" means a repetition of a color three times, with the specific color determined by the word that immediately precedes it: ""zup"" leads to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""dax"" to green when followed by ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the first word, it repeats the color associated with the word that comes right before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup
    ",Output: green yellow,green yellow,True,33
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in all given examples, regardless of its position in the input phrase.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we will examine the output corresponding to each input that contains ""wif.""

1. When ""wif lug"" is the input, the output is ""red blue."" ""Lug,"" when it appears without ""wif,"" consistently produces the color ""blue.""

2. When ""lug walm zup wif"" is the input, the output is ""blue blue blue yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" consistently produces ""blue"" in other examples (not listed, but implied based on the second example). At the end of this sequence, ""wif"" is producing ""red.""

3. Again, ""wif lug"" leads to ""red blue.""

4. For ""zup wif,"" the output is ""yellow red."" The presence of ""zup"" corresponds to the ""yellow"" in the output. Thus, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. Lastly, ""wif dax zup"" produces ""red green yellow."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again. This implies that ""wif"" is producing ""red.""

Given all the instances where ""wif"" is present in the input, it corresponds to ""red"" in the output. There is a one-to-one correlation between ""wif"" being present and ""red"" appearing in the sequence in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
Given the examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently maps to the output ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Here are the instances:

- Input: ""zup bluf"" leads to Output: ""yellow yellow"". This doesn't help much, as ""bluf"" could also mean ""yellow"", so let us consider the rest of the examples.
- Input: ""zup"" leads to Output: ""yellow"".
- Input: ""dax wif zup dax"" leads to Output: ""green red yellow green"". ""Zup"" is the third word and corresponds with the third output ""yellow"".
- Input: ""zup wif dax walm lug"" leads to Output: ""yellow red green green green blue"". Again, ""zup"" is the first word and corresponds to the first output ""yellow"".
- Input: ""zup walm wif"" leads to Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here too, ""zup"" coincides with the first ""yellow"" in the output.

So, the consistent mapping suggests a rule specifically for ""zup,"" independent of context. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must first identify patterns that include the nonce word and how they correlate with the given outputs. By carefully examining the input and output pairs, we can surmise a rule for ""bluf.""

In each example, the word ""bluf"" has outputs associated with it, as shown below:

1. ""wif bluf lug"" -> ""red red blue""
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug."" Given ""red"" corresponds to each of these words, and ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug,"" we can tentatively hypothesize that ""bluf"" means ""red.""

2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
   This example introduces a new word ""zup"" before ""bluf,"" which produces ""yellow."" After ""bluf,"" ""lug"" appears, which is ""blue."" ""walm,"" a new term, also corresponds to ""blue."" This input is not immediately helpful for deducing ""bluf"" alone as it is between two ""yellow"" instances, so we need to look at more examples.

3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
   ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which produces ""yellow."" In this instance, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow,"" which conflicts with our initial hypothesis from the first example.

4. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""green."" This again conflicts with our prior deductions.

5. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""
   In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif."" It continues to correspond with the output for ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

From the examples provided, it seems ""bluf"" does not consistently correspond to a specific color; instead, it mirrors the color of the word that precedes it:

- In examples 1 and 2, it seems to be ""red"" as it follows ""wif"" (""red"").
- In example 3, it follows ""zup"" and takes the color ""yellow.""
- In examples 4 and 5, it follows ""dax"" and takes the color ""green.""

The rule that can be derived from the examples is:

bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word (or takes on the output associated with the word that directly precedes it)

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is contextual; it replicates the output color associated with the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the correlation between the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input and the color repeated in the output. We can ignore the other words for now which seem to translate consistently into specific colors (e.g., ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red).

Let's analyze the examples line by line:

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output after ""zup"" is repeated ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output after ""dax"" is repeated ""green.""

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output after ""wif"" is repeated ""red.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output after ""zup"" is repeated ""yellow.""

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- Analysis of this instance is a bit more complicated. ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and after the first ""walm"", the output is repeated ""red."" Later, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and the output after ""lug"" is repeated ""blue.""

From the above patterns, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, it causes the color corresponding to the word just before it to be repeated in the output.

Thus, the meaning can be written as:

walm -> causes the color represented by the previous word to be repeated

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,34
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" To verify this, we can look at every example where ""wif"" appears and check if ""red"" is also in the output.

- In the first example, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green."" ""Wif"" precedes ""dax,"" and ""red"" precedes ""green"" accordingly.
- In the second example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red."" ""Wif"" comes after ""lug,"" and ""red"" comes after ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""zup lug wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow blue red green blue."" The position of ""wif"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and the position of ""red"" is between ""blue"" and ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red."" ""Wif"" comes after ""dax,"" and ""red"" comes after ""green.""

In all instances, ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position relative to the other words. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to discern the meaning of the word ""zup"" by analyzing its usage and the output it corresponds to.

In the first example, ""wif dax zup dax"" results in ""red green yellow green"". Here, we notice that ""zup"" precedes the color ""yellow"". In the second example, ""zup lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue"", where ""zup"" directly precedes ""yellow"" again.

Continuing with the third and fourth examples, the word ""zup"" always appears before the output ""yellow"":

- ""lug zup wif lug"" -> ""blue yellow red blue""
- ""lug zup lug"" -> ""blue yellow blue""

The fifth example also confirms this pattern, as ""zup lug"" again translates to ""yellow blue"".

Considering these consistent observations, we can determine that the nonce word ""zup"" directly corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Analyzing the provided examples, we see a consistent pattern:

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

In every instance where ""bluf"" occurs in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"". This suggests that ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each instance of walm and its surrounding context to find patterns.

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red 
   
2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   
3. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   
4. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   
5. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

From these examples, we can see that every time ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" repeated as many times as there are letters in the word ""walm."" Since ""walm"" has four letters, the color is repeated four times. 

Let's validate this by looking at each example:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we have ""red"" repeated three times.

2. ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, ""yellow"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

3. ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which has already been established to correspond to ""red,"" so ""red"" is repeated three times.

4. Here, ""walm"" occurs twice, first after ""dax,"" corresponding to ""green,"" and then after ""wif,"" corresponding to ""red."" Both times, the respective colors are repeated three times.

5. ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

Considering this pattern, we can define the word ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> This nonce word indicates to repeat the color output associated with the preceding word three times. Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,35
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""lug"" has a direct and consistent translation to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is presented in the input, regardless of its position or the presence of other words, the output consistently includes the color ""blue"" in the corresponding position. Here is how the rule can be summarized:

Rule: lug -> blue

This suggests that ""lug"" is a stand-in for the color blue in this set of examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in all provided examples.
Based on the given examples, it is possible to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at the patterns in the input and their corresponding output. 

Here are the patterns observed:

1. When ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
3. When ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" or ""bluf,"" there is a change in the output pattern, indicating ""wif"" on its own is likely to be ""red,"" but its meaning could be influenced by the context or sequence.

By examining these patterns, we can deduce the following rule: 

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" When followed by ""walm,"" it causes a repetition of the color red for each time ""walm"" appears. If ""wif"" appears by itself, it simply outputs ""red.""

Thus, the meaning is:

wif -> red
Examining the given examples, we can try to identify the rule by correlating the presence of the nonce word ""zup"" with the corresponding color in the output:

1. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
2. dax zup dax zup         -> green yellow green yellow
3. dax bluf wif zup dax    -> green green red yellow green
4. dax wif zup dax         -> green red yellow green
5. zup bluf                 -> yellow yellow

In all these examples, wherever the word ""zup"" appears, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output:

1. zup -> yellow
2. zup -> yellow
3. zup -> yellow
4. zup -> yellow
5. zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by analyzing each instance it appears in and its corresponding output:

1. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
2. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
3. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. wif bluf lug -> red red blue

In examples 1, 2, and 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and in the outputs, ""red"" is followed by ""blue."" In examples 4 and 5, where ""bluf"" occurs with only ""wif"" preceding or following it, the output is consistently ""red red."" 

Based on example 3, ""bluf"" occurs between two colors (""yellow"" and ""blue"") that do not follow the red-blue pattern. However, the ""bluf"" here corresponds to an additional ""yellow"" in the output, suggesting that the appearance of ""zup"" before ""bluf"" alters the usual output pattern.

Looking for a consistency in context where ""bluf"" doesn't depend on adjacent words (e.g., ""wif"") and the output color is consistent, we can review example 4, where ""bluf"" appears with ""wif"" and it results in doubling the ""red"" output.

Taking into account all these observations, the most consistent rule that explains all the outputs is:

Bluf corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that the output color sequence correlates with the words preceding ""walm"", with ""walm"" prompting a repetition of the preceding color three times. Let's assess the examples:

1. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   ""lug"" produces ""blue"" and ""walm"" follows, so we get ""blue blue blue"". ""wif"" then produces ""red"".

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""dax"" produces ""green"" and ""walm"" follows, so we get ""green green green"".

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   ""lug"" is before ""walm"", which produces ""blue blue blue"".

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   ""dax"" is before ""walm"", resulting in ""green green green"".

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" is before ""walm"", resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Based on this pattern, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,36
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each occurrence of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to correlate with the color ""green"" in the output. Here's how this pattern presents itself in the examples:

- When ""wif"" precedes or follows ""dax"", ""red"" comes before or after ""green"".
- When ""lug"" precedes or follows ""dax"", ""blue"" comes before or after ""green"".
- ""walm"" seems to correspond with ""blue blue"".
- ""dax"" by itself translates to ""green"".

Using this pattern, the rule appears to be:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, output ""green"" in the corresponding position. The appearance of other words (like ""wif"" or ""lug"") in proximity to ""dax"" leads to the addition of their respective colors (""red"" for ""wif"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"") in sequence. ""walm"" outputs a double ""blue blue"".
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In this sequence, we can confirm that ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The word ""wif"" appears again followed by ""bluf,"" which leads to the output ""red red."" We can presume that ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" likely corresponds to ""red"" as well.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both lead to ""red.""

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which leads to ""red red red."" 

Considering that ""wif"" comes before double instances of ""red"" when following other words but corresponds to a single ""red"" when following ""zup,"" one might initially think that ""wif"" could mean ""double red"" or ""repeat the color,"" but the input where ""walam"" follows ""wif"" leads to three ""red"" outputs, not two. This could indicate that ""walm"" affects the rule of ""wif.""

However, ""wif"" consistently results in at least one ""red"" in the output, so our most straightforward conclusion would be that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in all instances. The additional ""red(s)"" in the output when ""wif"" is followed by another word seem to be dictated by that following word, not by ""wif"" itself.

Therefore, based on the information provided:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color yellow each time it is used. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by adjacent words, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: Bluf translates to the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there's no preceding word, ""bluf"" defaults to the color red.

- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" translates to yellow, so ""bluf"" assumes the color yellow.
- In ""zup lug bluf,"" ""lug"" translates to blue, so ""bluf"" assumes the color blue.
- In ""zup dax bluf,"" ""dax"" translates to green, so ""bluf"" assumes the color green.
- In ""lug bluf wif,"" ""lug"" translates to blue, so ""bluf"" assumes the color blue, and ""wif"" is not relevant.
- In ""wif bluf,"" even though ""wif"" typically translates to red and there is no preceding word to determine ""bluf's"" color, it seems ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word that immediately precedes it, or red if it stands alone or is at the beginning.

Therefore, bluf -> the color of the preceding word; if there is no preceding word, bluf -> red.
Rule: walm -> repeat the last color spoken as many times as there were unique words since the last occurrence of the word ""walm"" (or from the start if ""walm"" has not appeared before). 

Here's the explanation for each input/output:

- Input: dax walm 
  Output: green green green
  (There is one unique word before walm, ""dax"" which is green, so repeat green three times because ""green"" is the last color and there were three words including the word walm itself.)
  
- Input: zup lug walm 
  Output: yellow blue blue blue
  (Two unique words before walm, ""zup"" which is yellow and ""lug"" which is blue, so repeat the last color mentioned, blue, four times including the word walm.)

- Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
  Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
  (There are three unique words before walm, ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" (red), and ""wif"" (does not have a color but is considered for the count of unique words). The last color mentioned before ""walm"" is red, so it is repeated seven times including the word walm itself.)

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  (Repeats as the first input.)

- Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
  (There are three unique words before walm, ""zup"" (yellow), ""bluf"" (no color given, probably an omission), and ""lug"" (blue). However, since ""zup"" is the last unique color before ""walm"" and it appears twice, it seems that the rule is to repeat the last mentioned color, which is yellow, six times including the word ""walm"" and excluding the non-colored word ""bluf"".)

The rule applied consistently indicates that what matters is the number of unique words since the last usage of ""walm"" or the start of the sequence, and then repeating the last mentioned color that many times when ""walm"" appears. However, the fifth example indicates that non-colored words might be excluded from the final color count. This could be an inconsistency in the examples provided or an omission. If we assume no omission in providing colors for words, then the rule would be to include all unique words, regardless of whether they have an assigned color or not.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,37
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we'll look at the commonalities in each example when ""dax"" appears and what output each occurrence of ""dax"" produces.

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - The first and last ""dax"" correspond to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" is before ""red"" in the output, but not directly, as there is an extra ""green"" between them.

3. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   - The first word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" precedes the first ""red"" in the output.
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

4. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   - The last word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" and the second ""bluf"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

5. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   - The first word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From the provided examples, we can conclude the following:
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- Other words correspond to different colors but do not influence the output for ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given:

- When ""zup wif"" is input, the output is ""yellow red"". Here, ""zup"" could mean ""yellow"" and ""wif"" could mean ""red"".
- For the input ""lug wif dax walm zup"", the output is ""blue red green green green yellow"", where ""lug"" could correspond to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""dax"" and ""walm"" both possibly to ""green"", and ""zup"" once again to ""yellow"".
- In the input ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"", the output is ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""bluf"" also to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" once again to ""blue"". ""wif"" is consistent with the output ""red"".
- The single input ""wif"" yields the output ""red"" in both the fourth and fifth examples.

From these examples, we can deduce a rule that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: In every example provided, whenever the word 'zup' appears, it is translated as 'yellow'. Thus, it is consistent to conclude that 'zup' means 'yellow'.
Through examining each example, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" by correlating it with the respective outputs.

Here's a breakdown of the inputs and outputs where ""bluf"" is mentioned:

1. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf | Output: red green yellow red green green
   - ""bluf"" aligns with the color ""green"".

2. Input: wif bluf dax lug | Output: red red green blue
   - ""bluf"" aligns with the color ""red"".

3. Input: dax lug bluf wif | Output: green blue blue red
   - ""bluf"" aligns with the color ""blue"".

4. Input: lug wif lug bluf | Output: blue red blue blue
   - ""bluf"" aligns with the color ""blue"".

5. Input: dax lug bluf | Output: green blue blue
   - ""bluf"" aligns with the color ""blue"".

We can observe that ""bluf"" aligns with different colors in different contexts:

In the first occurrence, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" but in the second example, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"". However, in the third, fourth, and fifth occurrences, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".

It seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that precedes it when it is used in a sequence:

- In example 1, ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") comes before ""bluf"", hence ""bluf"" results in ""green"".
- In example 2, ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") comes before ""bluf"", hence ""bluf"" results in ""red"".
- In examples 3, 4, and 5, ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") comes before ""bluf"", hence ""bluf"" results in ""blue"".

Given this pattern, we can infer a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to determine the color that precedes it. The pattern seems to indicate that ""walm"" causes the word before it to be repeated in its corresponding color in the output. Here is how the rule applies to each input and its output:

In the first example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"":
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- The presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green"" before yellow, which represents ""zup"". It doubles the green color which is coming from ""dax"".

In the second example, ""lug walm dax"":
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- The presence of ""walm"" immediately after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue"", followed by green for ""dax"".

In the third and fourth examples, ""dax walm"":
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- The presence of ""walm"" immediately after ""dax"" results in ""green green green"".

In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif"":
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- The presence of ""walm"" immediately after ""dax"" results in ""green green green"", followed by red for ""wif"".

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,38
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
Based on the given examples, the correspondence between the word ""dax"" and a color in the output is consistent. Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. There are no examples provided that show ""dax"" corresponding to any other word besides ""green."" Moreover, the presence of other words, such as ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup,"" corresponds to different colors (""blue,"" ""red,"" ""red,"" ""yellow"" respectively) but do not affect the translation of ""dax"" to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:

1. Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds with the color ""red"" in the output.
2. The word ""wif"" does not depend on its position in the input sequence to be translated to ""red""; it is consistent regardless of adjacent words.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" means ""red"" in this context.
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" is in the input, the color ""yellow"" is in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of the context or position of ""zup"" in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the pattern of inputs and corresponding outputs to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

- Example 1 Input: ""zup lug bluf wif"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue red""
- Example 2 Input: ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> Output: ""green yellow blue blue""
- Example 3 Input: ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> Output: ""red red blue green red""
- Example 4 Input: ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
- Example 5 Input: ""lug bluf dax bluf"" -> Output: ""blue blue green green""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" 

Rule: bluf -> ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Each example has the word ""walm"" following another word, and the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the preceding word:

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""walm"" results in green being repeated thrice.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
In this example, ""zup"" corresponds with the color yellow, and ""walm"" leads to three yellows.

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) and results in three greens.

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which is blue) and we see blue repeated three times.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
""Walm"" comes after ""dax"" again, and thus, green is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning: ""Walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,39
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Every time the word ""lug"" is used, the output includes the word ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Additionally, the translation of other words seems consistent whenever they appear alongside ""lug.""

Here are the translations deduced from the examples:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue
- wif -> red

The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, independent of the position or other words in the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in an input, the output is ""green,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" correlates to the color red. Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is presented in the output. However, there is not enough context to determine the meaning or rule behind the other words such as ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or ""bluf"" as they each appear only a limited number of times, except for ""lug,"" which consistently correlates to the color blue when preceded by ""wif.""

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can make the following observations:

1. When the input is only ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
2. In a sequence with other words, ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""

Now, we must look if other words have consistent meanings as well. We notice the following patterns:

- Whenever ""dax"" is present, the output contains ""green.""
- Whenever ""wif"" is present, the output contains ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the sequence it appears.
- The word ""walm"" results in a consecutive repetition of ""blue"" and ""red"" based on its position in the sequence.
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

There appears to be no context dependency that alters the meaning of ""zup"" in different scenarios; it consistently corresponds to ""yellow."" Thus, we can conclude that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates into a sequence of colors. The rule for what ""bluf"" means seems to be dependent on the words that precede it. Let us consider the patterns:

1. When the word ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
2. When the word ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" whether directly (""lug dax bluf"") or with ""wif"" and ""walm"" in between (""wif walm lug bluf""), the output includes ""blue."" Notably, ""lug dax bluf"" results in a repetition of ""green"" after ""blue,"" suggesting that ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
3. When the word ""zup"" is present (""zup wif bluf"" and ""zup walm lug wif bluf""), ""yellow"" appears in the output.

From these observations, we might infer the following relationships:
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and has a potential influence on the color sequences that follow.
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" seems to act as a signal to repeat the output colors of the words that come before it in the sequence.

Considering these patterns, here is the rule induction for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> triggers the repetition of the color sequence associated with the preceding word(s) in the order they appear before ""bluf."" If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""blue"" is added to the sequence.
Based on the examples provided and how the word ""walm"" influences the output, it seems that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it thrice. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times. When it follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times. And when it appears after ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> repetition of the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,40
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" The other words seem to correspond to other colors when appearing with ""lug."" For instance, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" Without additional context for these other words outside of the examples with ""lug,"" the most straightforward rule is simply the translation of ""lug"" to a specific color.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently, regardless of its position in the input sentence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the input.
To discern the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" examine the commonalities in each input-output pair where ""bluf"" appears:

- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow""
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue yellow yellow""
- ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""green green red blue""

From the examples, we can observe that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color it corresponds to in the output is the same as the color for the word immediately preceding it:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and both correspond to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" takes on the meaning (color) of the word that directly precedes it. Thus, we can write the rule as:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning - Bluf corresponds to the color of the word that directly precedes it in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can identify a pattern regarding the repetition of colors in the output corresponding to the presence of the word 'walm' in the input:

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
- 'dax' correlates with 'green' (repeated thrice)
- 'wif' correlates with 'red' (repeated thrice)
- 'walm' seems to indicate a repetition

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
- 'wif' correlates with 'red' (repeated thrice)
- 'lug' correlates with 'blue' (repeated twice)
- 'bluf' was not present in the previous examples, but given the output, it seems to correlate with a double repetition of 'blue'

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- 'lug' correlates with 'blue' (at the beginning and end)
- 'zup' correlates with 'yellow' (repeated twice)
- 'walm' follows 'zup' and precedes 'lug'; it does not cause a repetition here

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- 'dax' correlates with 'green' (repeated thrice)
- 'walm' appears after 'dax' and seems to be related to the thrice repeated 'green'

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- 'lug' correlates with 'blue' (repeated thrice)
- 'walm' appears after 'lug' and seems to be related to the thrice repeated 'blue'

From these observations, the rule for the nonce word 'walm' in the context of the given examples seems to be that it causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times. The words 'dax', 'lug', and 'wif' have clear color correlations (green, blue, and red, respectively), while 'walm' does not have a distinct color associated with it but influences the repetition pattern.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding noun to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True,41
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" seems to equate to a repeated sequence of the word ""blue,"" specifically three occurrences of ""blue."" Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" correlates with ""blue blue blue.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red,"" where ""lug"" again is represented by ""blue.""
- ""lug"" alone translates to ""blue.""
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" where each occurrence of ""lug"" correlates with ""blue blue blue.""
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the pattern where ""lug"" equals ""blue blue blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue blue blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the given examples and see how the word ""dax"" changes the output each time it appears. Here's what we can observe:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output includes ""red green.""
3. When preceded by ""lug,"" the output includes ""blue green.""
4. When ""dax"" is followed by other words like ""zup walm wif walm,"" it seems to cause the word ""green"" to be followed by other colors with a frequency based on the new words. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and each ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as well; each appearance of ""wif"" after ""dax"" seems to add ""red.""
5. In the case where ""lug zup dax walm,"" we receive ""blue yellow green green green,"" indicating ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" again seems to imply ""green,"" but the presence of ""walm"" once again increases the number of ""green"" in the sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" The words preceding it can add their respective colors (""wif"" adds ""red"" and ""lug"" adds ""blue"") while the words following ""dax"" affect the number or sequence of the colors mentioned, with ""walm"" repeating the last color mentioned and ""zup"" inserting ""yellow"".

So the rule for ""dax"" would be represented as:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Here is the induction:

- Every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- There is no contextual dependency observed; ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Each time zup appears in the input, the corresponding output is yellow, regardless of its position or the other words present. There is a direct mapping from the nonce word zup to the color yellow. 

Rule: Every instance of the word zup corresponds to the color yellow in the output.
From the given examples, it seems that each word is mapped to a color. The color following the word ""bluf"" is always green, irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup dax bluf"" outputs ""yellow green green,"" where ""bluf"" is directly followed by a green.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green"", with ""bluf"" once again followed by a green.
- In the third example, ""wif bluf dax lug"" outputs ""red red green blue,"" and we see that ""bluf"" precedes a green, while the following word ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- In the fourth example, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" outputs ""red blue blue yellow yellow green,"" and the two occurrences of ""bluf"" are both followed by the color that is assigned to the word ""bluf,"" which is green.
- In the fifth example, ""dax zup lug bluf"" outputs ""green yellow blue blue,"" and again ""bluf"" is followed by a blue which signifies the word ""bluf"" should output green.

Based on these observations, each word seems to be associated with a specific color output, and ""bluf"" consistently outputs green.

Rule: bluf -> green.
From the provided examples, it seems like ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. To verify the rule, let's break down each example:

- Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
  ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" repeats the color word before it, which is red, resulting in ""red red red"".

- Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow
  ""zup"" is yellow, and since ""walm"" follows ""zup"", it repeats the color yellow three times.

- Input: wif walm dax | Output: red red red green
  ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" repeats red, and ""dax"" translates to green.

- Input: dax zup walm wif walm | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
  ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" repeats the yellow three times, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats red three times from the last instance of ""wif.""

- Input: zup walm wif | Output: yellow yellow yellow red
  ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow three times, and ""wif"" is red.

Based on these observations, ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance where the word ""lug"" appears in the input corresponds directly to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the position or the other words around it.
Based on the examples provided, we can try to identify a pattern between the input words and their corresponding colors in the output. Let's examine each instance of ""dax"" and its output.

1. In the first example, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" maps to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" ""Dax"" appears after a ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) and is followed by ""walm"" (which corresponds to green). The output for ""dax"" in this sequence is green.

2. In the second example, ""dax walm"" maps to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" is the first word, followed by ""walm,"" which again is associated with the color green. The output for ""dax"" standalone is green.

3. In the third example, ""wif lug dax lug"" maps to ""red blue green blue."" ""Dax"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue) and is followed by another ""lug."" The output for ""dax"" here is green.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax wif zup"" maps to ""green red yellow."" ""Dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, but ""dax"" still outputs green.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" maps to ""green blue red red."" ""Dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" outputting green for ""dax.""

From these examples, every time ""dax"" appears in the input, its corresponding output is green, regardless of the words that come before or after it or their corresponding colors. There doesn't appear to be a variation in the output based on context.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following correspondences:

- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red"".
- The word ""lug"" when preceded by ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""blue"".
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"".
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"".
- The word ""dax"" when preceded by ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""green"".

We can infer from these examples that ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red,"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words. Additionally, there appears to be a rule where the presence of ""wif"" might modify the output for the words that immediately follow it, as seen with ""lug"" and ""bluf"".

Rule: ""wif"" means ""red"". When ""wif"" is present, it outputs ""red"", and it could potentially affect the color that follows it. ""lug"" by itself doesn't have an independent output, but when it's preceded by ""wif"", it leads to the color ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" may have a similar interaction with ""wif"".
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" appears to translate to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" is determined by the word that comes immediately before it. The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color indicated by the word preceding it, except when the preceding word is ""dax,"" in which case ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""

Let's analyze the given examples to determine the rule:

- In ""lug dax bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and the output is ""green.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is the same color as ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" the first ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and becomes ""red,"" and the second ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" so it becomes ""green.""
- In ""zup dax bluf zup dax,"" the ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" so it becomes ""green.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" the ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and it takes on the same color as ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

From this analysis, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: bluf -> meaning.
- If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- If the preceding word is any other word that translates to a color, then ""bluf"" means the same color as the preceding word.

This rule appears consistent with the examples given.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will analyze the input examples and their corresponding output examples to find a consistent pattern. 

Here are the given examples and their translations:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

5. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow

We notice that every time the word ""walm"" appears, the color of the output that corresponds to it is directly repeated from the color before it. For example, in the first input, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and the first appearance of ""walm"" thereafter gives ""blue"" as well. The next word, ""wif,"" correlates to ""red"" and the ""walm"" immediately after translates to ""red"" again.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,43
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can try to find a consistent meaning or rule for the word ""lug."" 

- In the first example, ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue."" Since ""wif"" appears in other examples corresponding to ""red,"" we might tentatively assign ""lug"" the meaning ""blue.""
- In the second example, we have the same input and output as in the first, reinforcing our initial tentative assignment.
- The third example, ""lug bluf zup,"" corresponds to ""blue blue yellow."" We know ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and if ""lug"" indeed means ""blue,"" then it would follow that ""bluf"" could mean ""blue"" as well, but we might suspect there's an error or special rule, as ""bluf"" is close to but not the same as ""lug.""
- The fourth example, ""wif dax wif lug wif,"" translates to ""red green red blue red."" Here, ""dax"" seems to consistently mean ""green,"" ""wif"" is still ""red,"" and our tentative meaning for ""lug"" remains ""blue,"" fitting into the pattern.
- The fifth example, ""zup dax lug,"" gives ""yellow green blue."" Again, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" appears to consistently correspond to ""blue.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""lug"" appears to be consistent across all examples, suggesting that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""dax"" appears, it is translated to ""green"". Therefore, the nonce word ""dax"" means ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" correlates to a particular color in the output each time it is used. Specifically, it seems to translate to the color red. Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the inputs corresponds to ""red"" in the outputs:

- ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"" (wif corresponds to the second 'red')
- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""green red green yellow yellow"" (wif corresponds to the second 'red')
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" represents the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided and the corresponding pattern observed, it is clear that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the context or position in the input sequence. Each instance of ""zup"" in the input is directly associated with ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf."" To do this, we will examine the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding output colors.

In the first example:

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" is also green, and ""zup"" is yellow.

In the second example:
Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is red, and ""dax"" is green.

In the third example:
Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green

""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and ""dax"" is green.

In the fourth example:
Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red

""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is yellow when preceded by ""zup"", and ""zup"" is yellow.

In the fifth example:
Input: zup bluf lug zup
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow

""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" is yellow after ""zup"", ""lug"" is blue.

When analyzing the examples, two consistent patterns emerge:

1. The color of ""bluf"" seems to match the color of the word immediately preceding it unless it is the first word, in which case it's green.

2. The colors for other words seem consistent: ""dax"" is always green, ""wif"" always red, ""zup"" always yellow, and ""lug"" always blue.

Given these observations, we can deduce a possible meaning for ""bluf"":

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it; if ""bluf"" is the first word, it is green.

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by another word, it has the same color as that word; if it is the first word in the sequence, its color is green.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, and this color is repeated three times. Here's the breakdown:

- dax -> green (dax walm -> green green green)
- lug -> blue (lug walm -> blue blue blue)
- wif -> red (wif walm -> red red red)

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it takes the color associated with the preceding word and outputs that color three times in a row.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,44
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

In the first example, ""wif lug zup"" translates to ""red blue yellow"". The word ""lug"" is between ""wif"" and ""zup"", which correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively. Given that ""lug"" in this context translates to ""blue,"" we can initially hypothesize that ""lug"" stands for ""blue.""

The hypothesis appears to hold in subsequent examples:

- In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" with ""lug"" again translating to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue,"" with ""lug"" once again translating to ""blue.""
- The fourth example, ""zup lug zup lug wif,"" becomes ""yellow blue yellow blue red,"" consistently showing that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- The fifth example, ""lug dax lug wif,"" translates to ""blue green blue red,"" further confirming that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" in the context of these examples is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Using the examples provided, I will deduce the meaning of the nonce word dax.

1. ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow""
2. ""zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow green red""
3. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
4. ""dax wif zup"" translates to ""green red yellow""
5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green""

The word ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input. Each time dax appears, the output includes the color green. So, the rule for dax is that it directly translates to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". 

Each instance of ""wif"" in the examples consistently results in the output ""red"". There is no example that contradicts this rule, and the surrounding words (""zup"", ""dax"", ""lug"", ""bluf"", and ""walm"") correspond to other colors. 

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each usage of the nonce word ""zup"" is associated with the word ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow

In this first example, the word bluf corresponds to the second yellow in the output. Since yellow is already associated with zup, this suggests that bluf maps to the same color as a word that is directly preceding it.

Let's test this with the other examples:

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Here, bluf maps to red, which is the same color as the word right before it (wif).

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

In this example, bluf maps to green, which is the same as the word before it (dax).

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

Again, bluf maps to red, which is the same as the word before it (wif).

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

Here, bluf maps to yellow, which is the same as the word before it (zup).

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" maps to the same color as the word that directly precedes it in the input sequence.

Therefore, bluf -> meaning. Meaning: bluf represents the color of the word that precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs for each input that contains ""walm"":

- ""zup wif walm"" --> ""yellow red red red""
- ""wif walm"" --> ""red red red""
- ""lug walm dax"" --> ""blue blue blue green""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" --> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
- ""dax lug walm"" --> ""green blue blue blue""

The presence of ""walm"" in the inputs consistently results in a sequence of three identical colors in the outputs. The color that is repeated three times corresponds to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in each input. For example:

- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"" colors.
- In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"" colors.
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is three ""blue"" colors after the colors that correspond to ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" themselves.

Given these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input, convert it to three consecutive outputs of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm zup
    ",Output: red red red yellow,red red red yellow,True,45
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""dax"" seems to be consistent. Regardless of position in the sequence or surrounding words, ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green."" 

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif"". If we look at each instance where ""wif"" appears and what output it corresponds to, we see the following pattern:

- Input ""wif"" corresponds to output ""red"".
- In the input ""zup walm lug wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to two consecutive ""red"" outputs.
- In the input ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"", ""wif"" appears twice and so does ""red red"" in the output, before and after ""yellow"", which corresponds to ""zup"".

Given that every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is always ""red"", and there are no counter-examples to refute this, we can induce the rule that the nonce word ""wif"" means ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, let's analyze the invariable element to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"":

1. Input: zup wif  | Output: yellow red
2. Input: lug zup lug | Output: blue yellow blue
3. Input: zup wif | Output: yellow red
4. Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green
5. Input: lug wif zup wif walm | Output: blue red yellow red red red

In every instance where the word ""zup"" is used, the output always includes the color ""yellow."" Thus, we can deduce that ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" Since other words correspond with other colors and are not the focus of this induction, we conclude:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the pattern in which colors replace the given words. Let's break it down.

- In the first example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" becomes ""blue red green green red blue."" Given that ""lug"" appears at both the beginning and the end, and ""blue"" also appears at both the beginning and the end, it's likely ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" The word ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" and ""dax"" seems to be linked to ""green.""

- The second example, ""zup wif bluf,"" becomes ""yellow red red."" From the first example, we can infer that ""wif"" translates to ""red."" The only word left is ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" appears at the end of the first example as ""blue"" but here appears as ""red,"" its meaning must depend on context or position.

- In the third example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" becomes ""blue blue blue red red."" Since ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" does not appear in any other examples, it is safe to assume that ""walm"" translates to ""blue."" Given that ""wif bluf"" once again translates to ""red red,"" ""bluf"" does not seem to consistently translate to the same color but possibly depends on the presence of ""wif"" before it.

- The fourth example, ""lug wif lug bluf,"" becomes ""blue red blue blue."" Here, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" in conjunction with ""lug"" which also means ""blue."" This may suggest that without ""wif"" preceding it, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf,"" becomes ""yellow yellow."" Given the previously established pattern, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" It appears that ""bluf,"" when not preceded by ""wif,"" translates to the color directly preceding it.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes the color of the word directly preceding it unless it is preceded by ""wif,"" in which case it translates to ""red."" So, ""bluf"" refers to:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word immediately preceding it, but if it is directly after ""wif,"" it translates to ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" has the meaning of repeating the color associated with the word just before it. Here's how the rule works according to the given examples:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue"" which means ""walm"" takes on the color value of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" meaning ""walm"" replicates the color value of ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" duplicates the color value of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- For the fourth example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" showing that ""walm"" again takes on the color value of ""wif,"" which is red.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, the pattern ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow,"" which further confirms that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that is immediately before it.

So, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> The same color as the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,46
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. Each example shows a direct correlation between the input that contains ""lug"" and the output where ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". Here is a breakdown of each input and the corresponding output, with attention to the presence of the word ""dax"":

1. Input: dax
   Output: green

2. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   Analysis: ""dax"" appears once and is followed by ""walm"" repeated twice which is produced as ""green"" twice consecutively. Then ""wif walm"" results in ""red red"", suggesting that ""walm"" changes its associated color to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"".

3. Input: zup lug wif dax lug
   Output: yellow blue red green blue
   Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""Dax"" appears once and results in ""green"". ""Lug"" follows ""dax"" and maintains its same color ""blue"".

4. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   Analysis: ""Dax"" appears twice and both instances provide the output ""green"". The other words retain their previously associated colors.

5. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""Dax"" leads to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" is a new word which also results in ""yellow"". The word ""dax"" does not affect the output of ""bluf"".

Based on the above, we have not seen a deviation from ""dax"" resulting in the output ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the words surrounding it.

Rule: dax -> green
Observing the examples:

Input: wif zup dax -> Output: red yellow green
Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue
Input: lug wif -> Output: blue red
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red

One can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in every example provided, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can derive the following pattern:

Input: `dax lug zup wif bluf dax`
Output: `green blue yellow red red green`

Input: `lug wif bluf lug wif`
Output: `blue red red blue red`

Input: `lug bluf`
Output: `blue blue`

Input: `zup bluf`
Output: `yellow yellow`

Input: `dax walm wif bluf`
Output: `green green green red red`

We can observe that every time the word `bluf` appears in the input, the output seems to match the color that directly follows `bluf` in the sequence. Additionally, the color that `bluf` represents becomes the color for the word that came immediately before it. 

Bluf seems to be a ""color copier"" that takes the color of the word immediately following it and applies it to the word immediately preceding it. Assuming the sequence starts with a word to the left of `bluf`, `bluf` will mirror the color of the word to its right. If there is no word to the left (as seen in the examples provided), only the repeating color appears as the output.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Bluf represents a mirror or duplicator for the next color word in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the color outputs relating to the presence of the word ""walm"" in each input. 

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and because ""walm"" is linked to two additional ""yellow"" outputs, it suggests that ""walm"" may mean to repeat the color associated with the word that comes before it.
 
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the output is ""red red green green green,"" meaning ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" does not seem to correspond to anything in the output, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" again seems to cause the preceding color word (""dax"") to be repeated twice more, supporting the earlier observation.

- In the third and fourth examples, ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" and ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green,"" both reinforcing that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated two more times.

- The fifth example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif,"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red,"" which again fits with the idea that ""walm"" causes the word before it to repeat, since ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times total. The pattern of other colors appearing is directly based on their respective words (""dax"" for ""green,"" ""zup"" for ""yellow,"" ""wif"" for ""red""), without repetition, because they are not directly followed by ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word two additional times.

So, walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue blue blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,False,47
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Whenever ""lug"" is mentioned, it translates to ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's compare each input with its corresponding output to find out what pattern the word ""dax"" is associated with:

In the first input-output pair:
Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

Here, ""dax"" appears twice and is followed by ""green"" in both instances in the output.

In the second input-output pair:
Input: dax zup dax zup wif
Output: green yellow green yellow red

Again, ""dax"" appears twice and both times is represented as ""green"" in the output.

In the third input-output pair:
Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green

""Dax"" is followed by ""green"" in the output.

In the fourth input-output pair:
Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green

""Dax"" appears twice and each time corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

In the fifth input-output pair 
Input: dax lug walm 
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in the output.

From the above inputs and outputs, it seems clear that the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the usage of the word ""wif"" in the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
From the examples given, it appears that:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""bluf"" might correspond to the color ""yellow,"" but in the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" Maybe there is another rule affecting this. However, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again, which is inconsistent with the third example.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

However, the inconsistency with the word ""bluf"" necessitates further examination. Since there is not enough context or examples to determine a secondary rule affecting the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will focus on the consistent mappings observed.

Rule: ""zup"" -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to determine the rule by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs. To do so, let's analyze each of the given examples systematically:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: lug wif bluf
  - Output: blue red red

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: dax zup bluf
  - Output: green yellow yellow

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: wif bluf
  - Output: red red

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: wif bluf
  - Output: red red

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: dax wif bluf
  - Output: green red red

Analyzing the examples, we notice that the output always contains colors and sometimes repeats one color multiple times. Here’s what we can infer:

1. Each word preceding ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to a single color in the output. We see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

2. The word ""bluf"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is repeated twice. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

Given these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the last color mentioned before it to be repeated once more in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf"" in the output sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word 'walm' relates to the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it.

Here is the rule I have induced:

- When 'walm' follows a color word, the output is that color word repeated three times.

Now let’s apply this to the examples to verify:

- 'zup walm' results in 'yellow yellow yellow' because 'zup' means 'yellow' and it is repeated three times due to following 'walm'.
- 'dax walm' results in 'green green green' because 'dax' means 'green' and it is repeated three times due to following 'walm'.
- 'zup dax walm lug wif' results in 'yellow green green green blue red'. Here, 'dax walm' causes 'green' to be repeated three times, 'zup' translates to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red'.
- 'zup lug walm wif walm' results in 'yellow blue blue blue red red red'. 'Lug walm' turns into 'blue' repeated three times, 'wif walm' translates to 'red' repeated three times, and 'zup' remains 'yellow'.
- 'zup lug walm wif dax' results in 'yellow blue blue blue red green'. 'Lug walm' transitions to 'blue' repeated three times, 'zup' is 'yellow', 'wif' is 'red', and 'dax' is 'green' without repetition because it is not followed by 'walm'.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' is:

Rule: When 'walm' follows a word representing a color, it causes that color word to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue blue blue green,red blue blue blue green,True,48
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context in which it appears within the list of nonce words.
Rule: dax -> green

The examples consistently show that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is used in the corresponding output. This suggests that ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red"". Here is how it maps out:

- lug zup wif zup -> blue yellow red yellow 
- zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green
- wif lug -> red blue
- wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
- zup wif lug wif -> yellow red blue red

From these examples, the word ""wif"" does not appear to change meaning based on position or context. Each time ""wif"" is used, it is translated as ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given where the output is consistently associated with certain inputs, we can deduce the following mappings between the input words and the colors:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red (reused color)

Thus the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond with the output ""red"". Each instance of the word ""bluf"" in the input results in the word ""red"" in the output. However, there seems to be a relationship between the number of words preceding ""bluf"" and the number of ""red"" words that occur consecutively in the output.

To underline this relationship, let's analyze the examples:

- Example 1: ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
- Example 2: ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
- Example 3: ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
- Example 4: ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
- Example 5: ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

From the above examples, we note the following pattern:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by two words, the output has two ""red""s.
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by three words, the output has two ""red""s.
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by one word, the output has two ""red""s.
4. When ""bluf"" follows one word, the output has two ""red""s.
5. When there's only one word before ""bluf"", the output has two ""red""s.

From these observations, it seems like the presence of ""bluf"" always yields two ""red"" words in the output, regardless of how many words precede it in the input.

However, there is a potential inconsistency in Example 2, where ""bluf"" is preceded by three words, but the output still contains only two ""red""s instead of an increasing number based on the preceding words. Therefore, based on the given data, the rule is that the word ""bluf"" results in exactly two ""red"" words in the output, but since there's an inconsistency, we must be cautious in forming a definitive rule.

Given the anomaly in Example 2, the cautious interpretation would be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to two ""red"" words in the output, occurring consecutively. The number of red words does not seem to increase with the number of words preceding it based on the provided examples.
Rule: walm -> the color associated with the word that directly follows walm, repeated three times.

- In the first example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" walm is followed by no word, but within the sequence, ""wif"" corresponds to red and it's the first occurrence after walm, leading to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" walm is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, hence ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm wif,"" walm is followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, so we get ""blue blue blue red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup walm,"" the first walm is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and the second walm is followed by no word, but within the context, the most recent color associated is ""zup,"" so again yellow is used, yielding ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" walm is followed by ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, thus ""green green green yellow blue green.""

Thus the rule for walm appears to be consistent across the given examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to the color blue in the output, independent of its position or surrounding words.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each time ""dax"" is used in the input, ""green"" is the corresponding output in the exact same position. Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: dax -> green.
Given the examples provided:

- ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red.""
- When ""lug"" follows ""wif,"" the output adds ""blue"" after ""red.""
- With ""wif lug walm,"" ""walm"" seems to add three instances of ""blue"" after ""lug.""
- ""wif zup lug"" introduces ""yellow"" before ""blue,"" suggesting ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- Finally, in ""lug wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is between ""lug"" and ""bluf,"" producing ""blue red red,"" indicating that while ""lug"" maintains its ""blue"" output, ""wif"" still translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" might also be related to the color ""red.""

Based on these examples, the rule for ""wif"" could be that it always translates to ""red,"" irrespective of its position or the context of other words present.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. The meaning of ""zup"" based on the given examples is the color ""yellow.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

Here is the breakdown of the examples and how ""bluf"" operates:

- dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green
  ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) and ""zup"" (yellow).

- zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow
  ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow).

- wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
  ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red).

- lug bluf -> blue blue
  ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"" (blue).

- zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
  ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green).

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.
From the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Let's analyze each example:

1. zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and we see that after ""walm"", ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

2. zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Again, after ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

3. dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"", followed by ""walm"" making ""red"" repeated three times.

4. wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Here ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""walm"" results in ""red"" repeated three times; lastly, after ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

5. wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   ""wif"" correlates to ""red"", and ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times.

Considering the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" is a rule that repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm zup lug bluf wif
    ",Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue red,blue blue blue yellow blue blue red,True,50
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the given outputs. Each instance of ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" In each example, regardless of position or surrounding words, ""dax"" always results in ""green.""

There is not enough context to definitively determine what ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""wif"" correspond to, except that these words seem to consistently map to the colors ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""red"" respectively, in the given examples. It is reasonable to assume that each of these words could also represent a specific color, as ""dax"" does.

Thus, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the presented examples, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"". Regardless of its position in the input, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" in the output. Here is the interpretation:

- ""zup wif zup dax"" yields ""yellow red yellow green,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"".
- ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" gives ""green yellow red red blue,"" with ""wif"" again translating to ""red"".
- ""wif dax wif"" results in ""red green red,"" with both instances of ""wif"" becoming ""red"".
- ""zup walm wif"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""wif"" is once more ""red"".
- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red,"" with ""wif"" remaining consistent as ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each instance where it is used in the input, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can attempt to identify a pattern by looking at the corresponding outputs in each example. The word ""bluf"" appears multiple times, and we should consider the context in which it's used to figure out the rule.

Here are each of the examples with ""bluf"" and their respective outputs:

1. lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green
2. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
5. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green

Upon examining these examples, we can observe that the output for ""bluf"" is dependent on the context of the words that come before it. Specifically, it seems to follow a rule that ""bluf"" takes the color of the prior word and repeats it in the output sequence. Here's the rule in action for each example:

1. ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" so the output is ""green green.""
2. ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" hence the output is ""yellow yellow.""
3. Since ""zup"" is the word before ""bluf"" and produces ""yellow,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow yellow.""
4. ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" and therefore the output is ""green green.""
5. ""bluf"" first follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" resulting in ""blue blue,"" and the second time it follows ""zup"" for ""yellow yellow.""

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> the output color for ""bluf"" is a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.
From the provided examples, it appears the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the previous word. Here is the reasoning:

1. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which suggests ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""green,"" the color associated with ""dax.""

2. ""dax wif walm"" turns into ""green red red red."" ""wif"" by itself isn't present in the examples without ""walm,"" but assuming ""wif"" by itself would correspond to ""red,"" ""walm"" here causes ""red"" to be repeated.

3. ""zup wif walm lug"" yields ""yellow red red red blue."" We know from the other examples that ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" Once again, ""walm"" repeated the color associated with ""wif.""

4. ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red."" As in the previous case, ""walm"" repeated the ""red"" color.

5. ""dax walm lug"" leads to ""green green green blue."" ""Dax"" is associated with ""green"" and ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" caused ""green"" to be repeated.

Using these examples, we see that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

The rule for the nonce word ""dax"" indicates that it translates to the word ""green"" in the given examples. Every time ""dax"" appears in an input sequence, the corresponding output is ""green,"" regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the sequence. This consistency across examples confirms the meaning.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the output. Regardless of whether ""wif"" precedes or follows other words, or even if it stands alone, the output always includes the color red. Here are the observations:

- ""zup wif"" leads to ""yellow red"" (notice ""zup"" seems to correspond to yellow)
- ""dax wif"" leads to ""green red"" (it seems ""dax"" corresponds to green)
- ""wif"" by itself is simply ""red""
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" leads to ""red blue yellow yellow"" (if ""lug"" translates to blue and ""bluf"" also leads to yellow, then ""wif"" still corresponds to red)
- Again, ""wif"" by itself gives the output ""red""

From these observations, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is used in a sequence with other words, each of those words corresponds to a specific color. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:

zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that the word directly preceding it represents.

Explanation: 
- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue,"" confirming that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- This pattern continues in the subsequent examples, where ""bluf"" follows a color word and the output is that color word repeated.

Therefore, bluf -> The color of the word before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the outputs associated with its presence in each input:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and since ""green"" appears three times, it suggests that ""walm"" may mean to repeat the color associated with the previous word, while ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" (which produces ""red"") again causes the output color to repeat three times.

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" and with ""walm"" following, ""blue"" is repeated three times. ""dax"" appears at the end, translating to ""green.""

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - Similar to the previous examples, ""walm"" following ""lug"" (""blue"") results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - This example confirms that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. ""lug"" yields ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times, while the other colors match the words not affected by ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated two additional times, for a total of three instances of that color in the output.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to repeat two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's examine the commonalities and differences in the examples provided. Each usage of ""lug"" is paired with a specific color output, so we can try to correlate the color responses with the presence of ""lug.""

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

""Dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Lug"" is followed by ""yellow"" once, and then ""walm,"" which we know is ""green,"" is turned into ""blue.""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

""Wif"" on its own corresponds to ""red,"" and paired with ""lug,"" it results in an additional color, ""blue.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

In this case, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and changes ""walm's"" output from ""green"" to ""blue.""

Input: dax zup lug
Output: green yellow blue

""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and when ""lug"" is added, we see an additional ""blue"" at the end.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

This example is the same as the second one and confirms the pattern; ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and adding ""lug"" leads to a ""blue.""

Rule:
Based on these examples, it seems that ""lug"" modifies the color output sequence by either adding ""blue"" to the end of the sequence or changing the following color to ""blue."" Given that ""lug"" is consistently associated with ""blue"" in some way, and it can both add blue and change an adjacent color to blue, it seems to act as a modifier rather than a term with a fixed color assignment.

lug -> meaning: When ""lug"" is present, it adds the color ""blue"" to the sequence or changes the next color in the sequence to ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, we will analyze the occurrences of the word ""dax"" and its corresponding output to deduce its meaning:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the end of the sequence.

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""dax"" is at the beginning of the sequence and corresponds to ""green"".

3. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - When ""dax"" is the only word in the input, it corresponds to ""green"".

4. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" and corresponds to ""green"".

5. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" and corresponds to ""green"".

Given the consistency in the output whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it can be concluded that ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the presented examples, we can attempt to induce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by examining its consistency across the different inputs and outputs.

- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red
- Input: lug wif bluf
  Output: blue red red
- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red
- Input: zup dax zup wif
  Output: yellow green yellow red
- Input: wif lug
  Output: red blue

Analyzing the patterns, we can note the following:
- Whenever ""wif"" appears followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- If the word sequence is altered or more words are added into the sequence, the output pattern changes accordingly; however, ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red"".
- In the third example where ""wif"" appears at the end after ""zup dax zup"", the output ends with ""red"".
- In the last example, ""wif lug"" produces ""red blue"", showing once again that ""wif"" yields ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a particular color. Moreover, the color corresponding to the word ""zup"" remains consistent across all examples, suggesting that ""zup"" represents a specific color rather than a rule that changes based on context.

In each instance, ""zup"" results in the output ""yellow."" There are no counterexamples to suggest that ""zup"" has a context-dependent meaning.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, bluf corresponds to the color blue every time it appears. Here are the rules according to each provided example:

1. ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow."" In the series, bluf is associated with the color blue, while zup is consistently correlated with the color yellow.
   
2. ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow."" Here, bluf follows zup, and both are translated as yellow, but we can infer from the other examples that bluf actually maps to blue.

3. ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red."" Bluf comes after lug and both map to the color blue, while wif maps to red.

4. ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red."" In this case, bluf is replaced by red, following wif. However, since in all other cases bluf mapped to blue, this example appears inconsistent with the rule deduced so far.

5. ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue."" Both lug and bluf map to the color blue.

Looking at the examples where bluf directly corresponds to a color without contradiction, the pattern suggests that bluf means blue. However, the fourth example provides conflicting information, potentially due to an error or outlier since it contradicts the pattern observed in all other examples.

Rule: bluf -> blue. (with the exception of the fourth input which might contain an error)
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze how the outputs correlate with the inputs, focusing specifically on the occurrences of ""walm"" and the words that appear before or after it.

- In the first example, ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue."" The word ""walm"" appears after the colors green and blue, resulting in repeating blue three times.
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" follows the color yellow, which is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup"" gives us ""red red red green yellow."" ""Walm"" occurs after red and is followed by green and yellow associated with ""dax"" and ""zup"" respectively. Here, ""walm"" corresponds to the color red being repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" outputs ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" is last, and it follows ""zup,"" which correlates to yellow. This results in yellow being repeated three times.
- In the final example, ""zup wif dax walm"" yields ""yellow red green green green."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with green, and the output shows green being repeated three times.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" might dictate that the color preceding it should be repeated three times in the output sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug
    ",Output: blue green blue blue,blue green blue,False,53
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the examples, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" seems related to the color that follows after each sequence. Every sequence that ends with ""dax"" concludes with the color ""green"" in the output. This fact suggests that ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the presence of ""wif"":

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

2. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

3. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue

4. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

5. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Now let's look for patterns. In every output, the presence of 'wif' correlates with the color 'red' in a specific position:

1. ""wif"" appears third in the sequence, followed by ""zup,"" resulting in ""red"" fourth in the output.
2. ""wif"" appears first in the sequence, resulting in ""red"" first in the output.
3. ""wif"" appears again first, with ""red"" first in the output.
4. ""wif"" appears first, with ""red"" first in the output.
5. ""wif"" appears last in the sequence, resulting in ""red"" last in the output.

From these observations, we can induce that the word ""wif"" has a direct translation to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The position of ""wif"" corresponds to where the ""red"" appears in the sequence of colors in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""zup"" has a consistent representation across all instances. Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. Thus, the rule can be established as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on the word that precedes it.

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by dax, ""bluf"" translates to red.
   Example: dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by zup, ""bluf"" translates to yellow.
   Example: zup bluf -> yellow yellow

3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by wif, ""bluf"" translates to red.
   Example: wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red

4. When ""bluf"" is preceded either by dax or lug, ""bluf"" translates to blue.
   Example: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it mirrors the color of the word before it if it is ""dax"", ""wif"", or ""zup"".

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" means the same color as the word immediately preceding it, if the preceding word is ""dax"" (red), ""wif"" (red), or ""zup"" (yellow). If the preceding word is ""lug"", then ""bluf"" means blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's match each example with its output and identify patterns for how the other words correspond to colors:

- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue""
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red""

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""walm"" in relation to the output colors:

1. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""
   - The ""walm"" here is associated with the color ""blue,"" which is the same color that ""lug"" corresponds to.

2. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
   - The ""walm"" here is associated with the color ""green,"" which has not been directly linked to another word previously.

3. ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow""
   - Here, ""walm"" appears twice, both times following ""wif,"" and it corresponds to the color ""red"" in both cases. 

4. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   - In this example, the first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red,"" but the second ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green green green red""
   - The ""walm"" here follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green,"" similar to example 2.

Observing these patterns, we can deduce that the color associated with ""walm"" is influenced by the word that immediately precedes it. Specifically, ""walm"" takes on the color value of the word before it:

- After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" is blue.
- After ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" is red.
- After ""dax,"" though we have no direct word-color association, ""walm"" is green, which we could guess is the color for ""dax.""
- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" is yellow.

Given this pattern, we can define the following rule:

Rule: walm -> same color as the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,54
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- Single instances of ""lug"" translate to ""blue.""
- Other words like ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" also have consistent color outputs each time they appear.

This allows us to derive the following meanings:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> yellow
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

Rule: Every instance of the word ""lug"" represents the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"":

1. In every instance, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green.""
2. The word ""dax"" does not appear to change its meaning based on position in the sequence.
3. The word ""dax"" does not appear to change its meaning based on the words around it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" I will analyze the common factor in each input containing ""wif"" and its corresponding output.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

From these examples, we can see that every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is included in the output. Other words such as ""zup"" and ""walm"" produce different colors in the output.

Rule: When ""wif"" is present in the input, the output is ""red."" Therefore:

wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each specific word corresponds to a specific color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue""

The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the examples provided. There is no variance in output regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input string or the words around it. Thus, it appears that ""zup"" is independent of context.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the output whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
3. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
4. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
5. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue

In every instance, the word following ""bluf"" in the output is not determined by the position of ""bluf"" in the input (because ""bluf"" appears at different positions, and the following word is not the same in each output). Hence, we should look for a pattern regardless of the word ""bluf"" position.

Comparing inputs and outputs where ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax"" suggests that ""dax"" is always mapped to ""green"" and ""bluf"" is also mapped to ""green.""

In the example ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" results in ""red red."" In that sequence, each word is mapped to a color, but ""bluf"" corresponds to two repeated colors.

A possible interpretation is that ""bluf"" duplicates the color output of the word that immediately follows it. Let's test this hypothesis:

- In example 3, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" which is mapped to ""yellow."" The output after ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which is mapped to ""red."" The output after ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" which hasn't appeared elsewhere without ""bluf""; however, the output is ""blue blue,"" suggesting ""lug"" would map to ""blue.""

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" itself maps to ""green"" and causes the color corresponding to the next word to be repeated in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> green and duplicates the color of the following word in the output.
To ascertain the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will inspect each input and its corresponding output, keeping the position of the word ""walm"" as a focal point.

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

""Walm"" appears at the end of the sequence. The last three outputs are ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting that ""walm"" may be causing the color yellow to repeat thrice.

2. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

""Walm"" appears after the word ""lug"" (which translates to blue) and is followed by ""dax"" (which translates to green). Since the output is ""blue blue blue"" after ""lug,"" it seems that ""walm"" creates a repetition of the color that comes before it. In this case, it repeats the color blue three times.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to yellow), and once again the output is a threefold repetition, reinforcing the earlier interpretation of ""walm"" inducing a triadic repetition.

4. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

When ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" (which translates to green), the output is ""green green green."" This maintains the pattern that ""walm"" has the effect of repeating the previous color three times.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" yet again (green), prompting a triple replication of green as seen in the output.

Rule:
Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color word immediately preceding it to repeat three times in the output sequence, regardless of the original word's place in the input sequence.

Walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color word three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,55
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in all the given examples, regardless of the context or the position of the word within the sequence.
Based on the given examples, we observe the following correlations:

Input: dax lug wif bluf -> Output: green blue red red
Input: lug zup dax lug -> Output: blue yellow green blue
Input: dax zup lug -> Output: green yellow blue
Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
Input: dax lug zup -> Output: green blue yellow

From these examples, we notice that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Hence, we deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, it appears that each occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"". In every example, regardless of the context or surrounding words, ""wif"" is translated to ""red"". There is no evidence of ""wif"" meaning anything else or being dependent on any contextual clues.

Rule: wif -> red. ""Wif"" means ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every given example, regardless of the context or the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the correspondence between the appearance of the word ""bluf"" in the input and the colors in the output.

In the given examples, whenever ""bluf"" is present:
- ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green.""
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""
- ""wif bluf"" again corresponds to ""red red"" (confirming the previous correspondence).
- ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow.""
- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green.""

From these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color green. However, we also need to explain why we see two greens in each output that contains ""bluf."" 

One hypothesis could be that ""bluf"" means green, and the number of times green is repeated in the output is directly dependent on the presence and position of ""dax"" or ""wif.""

Rules:
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- When ""bluf"" is present alongside ""dax"" or ""wif,"" the output repeats the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) or ""wif"" (red), indicating that ""bluf"" prompts a repetition of the color that is associated with the word occurring with ""bluf.""

According to these observations, the rule could be as follows:

Rule: bluf -> prompts a repetition of the color associated with the adjacent word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns before and after the word ""walm"" in the given examples. 

In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" seems to cause the output to be three occurrences of the color associated with the word prior to ""walm."" There is no word after ""walm"" the second time, and we still see ""blue"" repeated three times, so the color repetition seems to only depend on the word before ""walm.""

In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" Similarly, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and following ""walm"" we see the color ""red"" repeated three times.

In the third example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" As observed before, ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" repeated three times.

The fourth example, ""zup wif walm,"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Again, the pattern holds where ""wif"" means ""red,"" and post ""walm"" we see ""red"" three times.

The fifth example, ""dax walm,"" translates to ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" appears to translate to ""green,"" and ""walm"" again causes the color ""green"" to be repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug
    ",Output: yellow green green green blue,yellow green green green blue,True,56
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" means the color green.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule is straightforward:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we will examine how the output changes when ""zup"" is introduced in various positions within the input.

1. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
3. Input: dax zup lug wif lug -> Output: green yellow blue red blue
4. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
5. Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow

Observations:
- In example 1, ""zup walm"" gives three ""yellow,"" which indicates that ""zup"" might represent ""yellow"" when followed by ""walm.""
- In example 2, ""zup wif walm"" changes the output to ""yellow red red red,"" showing that ""wif"" corresponds with ""red,"" but ""zup"" does not consistently translate to ""yellow"" since it is present but the output contains other colors as well.
- In example 3, ""dax zup lug wif lug"" results in a sequence where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Zup"" appears once and is followed by ""yellow"" in the output. This again proposes that ""zup"" might translate to ""yellow.""
- In example 4, everytime ""lug"" appears, it is translated to ""blue"" in the output. ""Wif"" appears once and corresponds to ""red."" ""Zup"" precedes a ""yellow"" in both instances where it occurs in the input, supporting the notion that it might mean ""yellow.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Zup"" at the end of the sequence is followed by a ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on the observations, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.

Examples analyzed:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"", so ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"".
- In the second example, ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green"", where ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"".
- In the third example, ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow"", with ""bluf"" repeating the color associated with the preceding word, which is ""zup"" (yellow).
- The fourth example, ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"", outputs ""blue blue red blue blue yellow"". In this case, ""bluf"" repeats ""lug""'s color first and then does the same at its second occurrence.
- The fifth example, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"", has the output ""red red yellow yellow red"", with ""bluf"" repeating ""wif""'s color first and then ""zup""'s color at the second occurrence.

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf => Repeat the color of the word preceding ""bluf"".
From observing the relationship between the inputs and outputs, it seems that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color word that comes before it. Here is the underlying rule based on the given examples:

Rule:
- ""walm"" -> Repetition of the previous color word three times.

Explanation:
1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
2. ""dax walm wif zup"" results in ""green green green red yellow"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
3. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" results in ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
4. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" again (not repeated since there's no subsequent ""walm"").
5. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" likely repeats ""blue"" but doesn't follow the ""walm"" sequence, thus is not repeated three times.

In conclusion:
walm -> Causes the previous color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output of ""green."" Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" means green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the given examples.
zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. It functions as a standalone word for the color yellow and does not modify the meaning of the words around it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's break down each example and look for patterns:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

2. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

4. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

From the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word that immediately precedes it. For example:

- In Example 1, ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and then ""bluf"" is placed after ""zup,"" resulting in another ""yellow""
- In Example 3, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and then ""bluf"" immediately follows, resulting in another ""red""
- In Example 5, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and then ""bluf"" follows which also results in ""red""

The same pattern can be seen with ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and other instances where ""bluf"" follows a word. This suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color that was translated from the word directly preceding it and repeats it as its output.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color output of the immediately preceding word.
Based on the examples given:

- ""dax zup dax walm"" outputs ""green yellow green green green,"" with ""walm"" adding two greens to the sequence, following ""dax.""
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" again with ""walm"" adding two blues to the sequence, following ""lug.""
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" appends ""blue blue blue red red"" where ""walm"" again contributes two blues to the sequence.
- ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red"" where ""walm"" seems to add two reds to the sequence this time.
- ""dax walm wif"" produces ""green green green red"" with ""walm"" contributing two greens to the sequence.

Considering all the examples, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and it seems to repeat itself in the output for every occurrence of ""walm"" that follows it in the input.

Based on the given examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" It doesn't seem to change meaning based on position or surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: When ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

- In the first example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" Given that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" we can initially hypothesize that ""wif"" means ""red.""
- The second example reinforces this hypothesis, as ""wif"" on its own outputs ""red.""
- The third example, ""dax bluf wif,"" outputs ""green green red."" This still aligns with the idea that ""wif"" means ""red.""
- The fourth example again confirms our hypothesis, as ""wif"" alone translates to ""red.""
- The final example, ""wif bluf,"" is translated as ""red red,"" further reinforcing our initial hypothesis.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the Output. Other words in the inputs correspond to different colors (e.g., ""wif"" to red, ""walm"" to red, ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue). The rule does not seem to change regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond with the color that represents the word that comes just before it in the sequence.

Here is the analysis based on the given examples:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and takes on its color, yellow.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green"". ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and takes on its color, red.
- In the third example, ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue"". ""Bluf"" appears twice; the first time it follows ""dax,"" taking on green, and the second time it follows ""zup,"" taking on yellow again.
- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue"". ""Bluf"" follows ""dax"" and takes on green.
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow"". ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" and takes on red.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we should look at the correlation between its presence in the input and the pattern of the output. Here, we examine the outputs and look for consistency in the representation of ""walm"":

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

5. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Rule:
- In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the corresponding output colors are ""red red red green.""
- In the second input, ""walm"" appears twice, both times followed by ""zup,"" and the associated output colors are ""red red red yellow"" and ""red red red yellow,"" with an additional ""blue"" following ""lug"".
- In the third input, ""walm"" has no words after it, and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the fourth and fifth inputs, ""walm"" is not the first nor the last word, yet it seems to always result in three ""red"" followed by a color that corresponds to the word after ""walm.""

Considering these sequences, it appears ""walm"" consistently results in a triplet of ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The word that follows ""walm"" determines the color that comes after the three ""red."" Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" translates to a fixed output pattern, specifically three ""red"" followed by the color that corresponds to the word after ""walm."" If there is no word after ""walm,"" then there is no additional color beyond the three ""red.""

Based on the observed patterns, here is the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> three instances of the color red, followed by the color corresponding to the word that comes after ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the last word, there is no fourth color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' appears in the input, it is translated to 'blue' in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word translates to a specific color. However, the only consistent correlation presented is between the word ""dax"" and the color ""green"". The other words (""bluf"", ""zup"", ""walm"", ""wif"") appear only once in the examples with their corresponding colors (""green"", ""yellow"", ""yellow"", ""red""), so we cannot definitively conclude their meanings based on this data alone.

Nonetheless, if we assume that the other words also translate consistently to their respective colors, then we could deduce the following rule:

Rule:
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""bluf"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""walm"" -> yellow
- ""wif"" -> red

It's important to note that this is purely a hypothesis, and more examples would be needed to conclusively determine the meaning of ""bluf"", ""zup"", ""walm"", and ""wif"". However, for the word ""dax"", its meaning seems quite clear:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" We can confirm this by examining each instance where ""wif"" occurs and noting the corresponding output:

Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: lug zup wif -> Output: blue yellow red
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" likely corresponds to another ""red.""

Input: zup dax zup wif -> Output: yellow green yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" at the end.

Input: wif walm lug bluf -> Output: red red red blue blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red,"" ""walm"" may correspond to the second ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to the ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" likely corresponds to the last ""blue.""

Given these observations, the rule appears to be consistent:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Rule: zup corresponds to the color yellow. Every instance of the word zup is translated into the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color in the output sequence that repeats itself once. Here's the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"", which is the color after it.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"", which is the predominant color in that sequence.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"", which is the color before it.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"", duplicating the existing color.

Therefore, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be to duplicate the color directly after the first instance of ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf -> The color directly following ""bluf"" in the input sequence is repeated once in the output sequence.
From the given examples, we can see that the word ""walm"" is repeated a number of times after certain words. The repetitions correspond to a sequence of the same color in the output. The number of times ""walm"" is repeated seems to relate to the number of times the color associated with the previous word is repeated. Let's examine each example:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red."" After ""walm,"" we see ""red"" repeated three times.
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated three times.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times.

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green.""
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times.

4. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red."" After ""walm,"" we see ""red"" repeated three times.
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue.""
   - ""bluf"" is not followed by ""walm,"" hence it's not repeated and correlates to ""blue"" just once.

5. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green.""
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" correlates to ""red."" After ""walm,"" we see ""red"" repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to work as a signal to repeat the color associated with the previous word a number of times (three times based on the examples provided).

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

This rule has been deduced based on the consistent output of the word ""blue"" whenever the nonce word ""lug"" appears in the input, regardless of the other words surrounding it.

Justification:
In every example provided, whenever the input contains the word ""dax"", the output includes the color green at the corresponding position.
- ""wif dax wif"" corresponds to ""red green red"" (dax is green)

- ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" corresponds to ""red green yellow red green green"" (both instances of dax are green)
- ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow red red blue"" (dax is green)

Thus, the rule for the word ""dax"" is that it translates to the color green in the output.
Based on the provided examples:

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

The rule that can be deduced from the examples is:

Rule: wif -> red

This indicates that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the context with other words.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, its corresponding output is the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> green when following the word dax, otherwise it takes on the color value of the preceding word. Rule: If the preceding word is 'dax', then bluf means 'green'. If not, bluf adopts the color value of the word before it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the commonality within the input/output pairs provided:

1. For 'dax walm', the output is 'green green green'. 
   We have two words ('dax' and 'walm') and three instances of the output color ('green').

2. In 'dax zup walm wif walm', the output sequence is 'green yellow yellow yellow red red red' with 'walm' appearing twice.
   Here, we have 'green' appearing once for 'dax', 'yellow' appearing three times for 'zup', and two sequences of 'red red red', corresponding to two instances of 'walm'.

3. For 'wif walm dax', the output is 'red red red green'.
   'walm' gives us 'red red red' and 'dax' provides a single 'green'.

4. In 'zup dax walm lug wif', the output sequence is 'yellow green green green blue red'.
   'zup' leads to 'yellow', 'dax' gives us 'green', 'walm' results in 'green green green', 'lug' is matched with 'blue', and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

5. Lastly, for 'wif walm zup', the output is 'red red red yellow'.
   'wif' results in 'red', 'walm' again provides 'red red red', and 'zup' translates into 'yellow'.

From these examples, we can discern a pattern where 'dax' corresponds to a single 'green', 'wif' leads to a single 'red', 'zup' gives a single 'yellow', while 'walm' always results in 'red red red'. The pattern of the color repetition appears to be three times regardless of the context.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""walm"" correlates with a thrice-repeated color, specifically 'red' in all the example outputs provided. Hence, ""walm"" results in ""red red red"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we must look at the patterns in the examples provided. After analyzing the patterns, here is the deduced meaning:

- Every instance of ""dax"" is translated to ""green.""
- The word ""dax"" does not seem to be affected by its position in the sequence.

Based on the above observations, the rule seems to be:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words such as ""zup"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively, and the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The output colors match the order of the input words.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" 

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, the corresponding output includes the word ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the duplication of the color that follows the last word before ""bluf."" The color that gets duplicated is determined by the word that immediately precedes ""bluf.""

Considering the examples:

1. ""zup wif bluf zup"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" generates a duplication of ""red,"" which corresponds to the previous word ""wif.""
2. ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green,"" so ""bluf"" duplicates ""green,"" the color corresponding to the word ""dax"" just before ""bluf.""
3. ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" duplicates ""blue,"" corresponding to ""lug.""
4. ""dax lug bluf dax"" translates to ""green blue blue green,"" so ""bluf"" again duplicates ""blue,"" the color for ""lug,"" which appears before ""bluf.""
5. ""zup lug bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue red,"" meaning ""bluf"" duplicated ""blue,"" linked to ""lug"" before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Duplicates the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be a rule that requires the previous word to be repeated three times with the color that corresponds to that word.

Here's the reasoning:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" which corresponds to ""dax"" being associated with the color green and being repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" indicating ""lug"" stands for the color blue and is also repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""zup"" is synonymous with yellow and is repeated thrice.

We can confirm this with the longer input where ""walm"" follows specific nonce words associated with colors:

- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""green red yellow yellow red red red,"" which implies that ""walm"" applies the rule to the word ""bluf,"" which is presumably red, based on the pattern (as ""wif"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"" and the output is red).
  
- In the last example, ""dax walm wif dax,"" the rule repeats ""dax"" three times after ""walm"" (""green green green""), and then ""wif dax"" results in ""red green,"" following the established rule for ""wif"" and the given color for ""dax.""

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the previous word three times with the corresponding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,62
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""dax"" appears to be consistent:

dax -> green

Rule: In every example, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. There is no indication that the meaning of ""dax"" changes with context; it always translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the list or the surrounding words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The given examples consistently translate the nonce word ""zup"" to the color ""yellow"". Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
Analyzing the examples given, it seems like the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here are the observations from the examples:

- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (bluf repeats the color of zup, which is yellow)
- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow (bluf repeats the color of zup, which is yellow, as dax's color is green)
- lug bluf -> blue blue (bluf repeats the color of lug, which is blue)
- wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow (bluf repeats the color of lug, which is blue)
- zup dax bluf -> yellow green green (bluf repeats the color of dax, which is green)

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.
To determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the correspondence between the input and output in each example, focusing on the context where ""walm"" is used.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
This example suggests that ""wif"" may correspond to the color red, but it is repeated three times, potentially due to the presence of ""walm.""

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
In this instance, the color blue is repeated three times in the presence of ""walm,"" similar to the first example with red. ""dax"" at the end of the input results in a single ""green"" in the output.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and once again, the presense of ""walm"" causes the color to be repeated three times.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
In this example, each appearance of ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""dax"" to green. ""walm"" causes the color that precedes it to be repeated three times.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
The last example shows ""dax"" resulting in green being mentioned three times, due to the ""walm"" directly following it.

Based on these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word 'lug' consistently translates to the color 'blue' in the given examples.
Rule: dax -> green

Since every occurrence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs, we can infer that the meaning of ""dax"" in this context is the color green.
Considering the examples provided, we can analyze the instances of the word ""wif"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. In the first example, ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" becomes ""red blue blue yellow yellow green."" We see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""lug wif bluf"" becomes ""blue red red."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""wif lug zup"" becomes ""red blue yellow."" Once again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif lug"" becomes ""red blue."" Here too, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" becomes ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Once more, each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Based on all provided examples, we can induce that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the provided examples, every instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of position or surrounding words. The other words in the input seem to correspond to their own color designations (""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" -> blue and then repeating reds for repeating ""walm""), but ""zup"" consistently means yellow.
Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correspond to a specific color. The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue."" However, this does not appear to hold true when it is preceded by ""wif"" in the sequence ""wif bluf,"" which is translated to ""red red,"" implying that when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" it may affect the usual translation of ""bluf"" or there might be a different underlying rule for the combination of ""wif bluf.""

To deduce a consistent rule, let's examine the translations of ""bluf"" in various contexts:

- Alone (or following another word than ""wif""), ""bluf"" seems to always translate to ""blue.""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" the translation is ""red red,"" which suggests that ""wif bluf"" always translates to ""red red.""

Here is a potential rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" except when preceded by ""wif,"" in which case the translation for the sequence is ""red red"" instead of ""blue red.""

Thus:
bluf -> ""blue"" when occurring independently or not preceded by ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" in the sequence ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"".
To determine what ""walm"" means, let's examine the examples and the associated outputs.

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
In this example, ""walm"" seems to add three additional ""reds"" after ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"").

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and seems to produce two extra ""greens.""

3. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   
In this example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and adds two more ""green.""

4. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   
Here ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" resulting in two more ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

In this instance, ""walm"" appears twice: first it follows ""wif"" adding two more ""reds,"" and second, it comes after ""zup"" adding two more ""yellow.""

From the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

When ""walm"" follows another word, it repeats the color associated with the previous word two more times. For example:
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif bluf
    ",Output: blue green red red,blue green red red,True,64
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every example.

Rule: ""lug"" means blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following color associations for the words:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red

The word ""dax"" consistently results in the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can conclude that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". There is a consistent pattern where every instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds directly to the color ""red"" in the output. Meanwhile, other nonce words like ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""bluf"" seem to translate to ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""green,"" respectively, although ""bluf"" specifically seems to always follow with ""green"" regardless of its position, which may require further examples to fully understand.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output includes the color yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correlation between the input and the output.

From the given examples:
1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
2. ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""green green red blue""
3. ""zup lug bluf"" -> ""yellow blue blue""
4. ""lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue green green""
5. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""

In each output, the color that follows the word ""bluf"" is the same as the color that precedes it:
- In the first example, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf,"" we again see ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" the next color is ""green"" again.
- The third and fourth examples follow the same pattern.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""red"" appears again.
  
Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" causes the next output color to be a repetition of the color designated by the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that directly precedes ""bluf.""
By analyzing the provided examples, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

1. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""green green green yellow blue""
2. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
5. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green yellow green green green red""

From the examples, we observe the following patterns:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it.
- The number of repetitions equals the number of letters in the word that precedes ""walm.""

Applying this understanding to the provided examples, we get:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and since ""dax"" has three letters, ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three more times (for a total of three greens because ""walm"" follows ""dax"").
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and as ""wif"" has three letters, ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.
3. Similar to example 1, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes the repetition of ""green"" three times due to the three-letter count in ""dax.""
4. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" which has three letters, resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.
5. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Walm"" follows the second ""dax,"" which has three letters, so ""green"" is repeated three more times. Then ""wif"" leads to the output of red.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated as many times as there are letters in the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word as many times as there are letters in that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Based on the provided examples, each word appears to translate to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Given this pattern, we can see that ""dax"" consistently maps to the color green, regardless of its position in the input. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
Input: zup bluf wif dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow red green blue
Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red

The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words or the other words surrounding it.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow.

Rule: The term ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context within which it is used.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following pattern:

- Whenever the word `bluf` appears, the output is the color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it in the input.

From the examples, we can see:

- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and so does ""bluf"".
- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and so does ""bluf"".
- In ""dax bluf"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and so does ""bluf"".
- This pattern is consistent even when multiple words are involved. In ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and both translate to ""red"".
- We also notice that ""bluf"" can repeat a color output if it follows another ""bluf"" as seen in ""lug bluf dax bluf""; here, the first ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" which gives ""blue"", and the second ""bluf"" repeats the ""blue"" output.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word `bluf` appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word corresponding to the directly preceding word in the input. If preceded by another ""bluf"", repeat the color word corresponding to the last non-""bluf"" word before the series of ""bluf""s.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided. Each example consists of some words followed by a series of colors in the output.

Looking at the first example:
- Input: dax zup dax walm 
- Output: green yellow green green green

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and appears twice in the output. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and appears once. The word ""walm"" appears in the input and is followed by ""green"" repeated three times, so it seems ""walm"" could cause the preceding word's associated color to repeat thrice.

Now, let's look at the second example:
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green

Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to repeat three times.

In the third example:
- Input: lug walm
- Output: blue blue blue

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times, consistent with the previous examples.

In the fourth example, we have multiple words with outputs:
- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
- Output: red red green green red red red blue red

The pattern of word-to-color is maintained with ""wif"" being ""red"" and ""dax"" being ""green."" ""Walm"" appears after ""wif"" and leads to ""red"" being repeated three times, once again supporting the observed pattern.

Finally:
- Input: wif walm
- Output: red red red

""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and with ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

Rule:
Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be output three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when used in a sequence. However, the word's presence also impacts how many times the following words are translated into their corresponding colors. Here's the pattern I have deduced:

1. When ""dax"" is mentioned alone, it outputs the color ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is followed by the word ""wif,"" it repeats the color pattern ""green red"".
3. When ""dax"" precedes another word (not ""wif""), it makes the following word repeat its corresponding color three times.
4. When another word precedes ""dax,"" ""dax"" outputs its color twice (as in example 5).

Let's break down the rules for how ""dax"" affects color repetition in the outputs:

- ""dax"" on its own is ""green.""
- ""dax"" followed by ""wif"" results in the pattern ""green red"" and is followed again by ""green"" if ""dax"" is repeated after ""wif."" Thus, ""dax wif dax"" becomes ""green red green.""
- ""dax"" followed by a word other than ""wif"" triggers the next word's corresponding color to appear three times. For instance, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" and ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" turns into ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow.""
- Another word followed by ""dax"" makes the color of ""dax"" appear twice in succession, as seen in the pattern ""lug bluf dax bluf"" turning into ""blue blue green green,"" where ""dax"" outputs green, which is repeated because it is following ""bluf.""

Therefore, the underlying rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: ""dax"" -> green. ""dax"" affects the repetition of colors in a sequence based on specific rules: alone it is ""green,"" preceded by ""wif"" it's a ""green red"" pattern, influencing the next word to be repeated three times if not ""wif,"" and it doubles its own color when preceded by another word.
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the occurrence of the nonce word ""wif"" and its corresponding output color:

1. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif       
   Output: red green red red yellow red
2. Input: lug wif lug wif lug
   Output: blue red blue red blue
3. Input: wif
   Output: red
4. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
5. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green

Looking closely at the inputs and outputs side by side, we can deduce the following associations:

- Every occurrence of ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"".
- There is no clear pattern showing that ""wif"" changes meaning based on any surrounding terms.

With the evidence at hand, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" irrespective of its position in the input series. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". When ""zup"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow"". Additionally, the number of times ""zup"" is mentioned in sequence (e.g., ""zup walm""), the term ""yellow"" is repeated the same number of times.

To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look at the patterns and occurrences of ""bluf"" in the provided examples and their corresponding outputs.

Here are the patterns observed:

1. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red

In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The word ""bluf"" appears between ""wif"" (red) and ""lug"" (blue) and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""

2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and again, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and the output is ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" as well.

5. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

And here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" gives ""blue"" as the output.

From these examples, a rule about the meaning of ""bluf"" can be inferred:
""Bluf"" seems to mimic the color of the word preceding it.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is as follows:
Rule: bluf -> takes the same color as the word before it. If there is no word before it, it defaults to ""red"".
Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the previous word thrice. 

For example:
- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". Therefore, ""walm"" following ""wif"" results in ""red red red"".
- In ""dax walm wif walm zup"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". The first occurrence of ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times, and after ""wif"", which is ""red"", ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue.

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green

The meaning of ""dax"" in the given context is the color green. Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green.""
Given the examples, we can observe the following:

1. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
2. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
3. Input: dax zup wif -> Output: green yellow red
4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
5. Input: wif dax -> Output: red green

Comparing the inputs to the outputs, it appears that ""wif"" translates to a single instance of the color ""red"". However, the other words also translate to specific colors: ""walm"" to red, ""bluf"" to red, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue.

To confirm the rule, consider the following:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears alone with another word (which also has a corresponding color), you get red followed by the color assigned to the other word (examples 1, 2, and 5).
- When other colored words precede ""wif,"" those colors are listed before the red that corresponds to ""wif"" (example 3).
- When multiple colored words are involved, the pattern of translation follows the order in which the words appear (example 4).

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's look at the patterns emerging from the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

In the inputs, the word ""zup"" always precedes the change in the pattern of the output colors, indicating that ""zup"" likely signifies a shift or a toggle in the color pattern.

- In the first example, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" which suggests that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" introduces a new color ""yellow.""
  
- In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" becomes ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" We see that ""wif walm"" repeated before and after ""zup"" produces the same color sequence ""red red red,"" and then ""zup"" seems to toggle the color sequence. ""lug zup"" leads to ""blue yellow"" as seen before, but here ""walm"" after ""zup"" produces ""yellow"" instead of ""red.""

- The third example, ""zup lug walm,"" turns into ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" generating ""yellow blue,"" the same sequence as when ""lug"" is followed by ""zup."" This suggests that ""zup"" doesn't depend on its position relative to ""lug."" With ""walm"" coming after ""lug,"" the color pattern changes from ""yellow"" to ""blue.""

- The fourth example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup,"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow,"" where the pattern repeats, and the ""zup"" comes after three ""reds"" and switches it to ""yellow,"" followed by a ""blue.""

- In the fifth example, ""zup lug"" produces ""yellow blue,"" mirroring the output of ""lug zup"" in the first example, reinforcing the idea that ""zup"" brings in ""yellow"" when paired with ""lug.""

With these observations, we can interpret that ""zup"" changes the upcoming color pattern, typically bringing in ""yellow"" when followed or preceded by ""lug."" When ""zup"" occurs after ""wif walm,"" it changes the color pattern from ""red"" to ""yellow."" However, when it follows ""lug,"" it maintains the ""blue"" from ""lug.""

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be that it is a toggle or switch that changes the forthcoming color sequence, the specific effect of which depends on the context:

Rule: ""zup"" -> changes the next color in the sequence, often to ""yellow,"" but can maintain ""blue"" after ""lug."" The exact meaning is context-dependent, triggering a switch in the pattern of color output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue when it is preceded by ""lug,"" which itself corresponds to the color blue. In instances where ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""lug,"" it retains its blue meaning, as we can see in the example ""dax bluf,"" where ""dax"" translates to green, but ""bluf"" still translates to blue. 

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word for a number of times. Let's look at each example to determine the exact rule:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Rule: The color red is repeated three times after ""wif"" when ""walm"" follows it.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule: The color blue is repeated three times after ""lug"" when ""walm"" follows it.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: The color green is repeated three times after ""dax"" when ""walm"" follows it.

4. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   Rule: The color green is repeated three times after ""dax"" when ""walm"" follows it, regardless of other colors before it.

5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Rule: The color blue is repeated three times after ""lug"" when ""walm"" follows it, and this pattern is unaffected by the rest of the sequence.

The consistent pattern here is that when ""walm"" is present in the sequence, it repeats the color of the preceding word three times. So, we can infer the following rule:

walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is outputted three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" correlates directly with the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Every instance of ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it seems that dax corresponds to a specific color in the output. Different nonce words appear to correspond to different colors. To determine the rule for ""dax,"" let's analyze its corresponding output in each example:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
   Output: green green red yellow green
   Here, ""dax"" appears twice and both times it corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

3. Input: wif dax zup
   Output: red green yellow
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once more.

4. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

5. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once more.

In each instance, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is that it translates to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each unique word is assigned a specific color:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> green
- bluf -> yellow (inferred from ""zup,"" since it produces the same color output)

Given these associations, it's clear that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" The input sequence doesn't affect the color output for ""wif""; it always results in ""red,"" regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each instance provided.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red in the outputs. Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears at the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm"" by analyzing the pattern of colors in the output.

1. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue

3. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
   - ""bluf"" seems to correspond to yellow (though not seen before in isolation)
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green

5. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red

Looking at the repetitions of blue and green in the outputs whenever ""walm"" is used in the inputs, it appears that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to repeat in the output for a specific number of times. To understand how many times the repetition occurs, we have to count the number of repeated colors that follow the word. It looks like ""walm"" repeats the preceding color three times, except for the last example, where ""walm"" is followed by ""wif lug,"" which deviates from the pattern.

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times. The final example looks like an exception, possibly due to ""wif"" appearing after ""walm"" rather than the usual color repetition. This deviation might indicate an additional rule or interaction introduced by additional color words following ""walm,"" but with the limited examples, we would need more data to understand that interaction fully.

Using the examples provided, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes that word to be repeated three times in the output color sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position within the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern in the outputs that corresponds to each input word. We can try to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by looking at each instance where it appears and the associated color in the output.

1. In the first example, when ""dax"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and ""wif,"" the output colors are ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" The color ""green"" appears twice after ""dax."" It's not clear what ""zup"" and ""wif"" stand for, but it seems ""dax"" consistently results in ""green.""

2. In the input that contains only ""dax,"" the output is ""green,"" reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

3. In the third input, ""zup dax wif zup,"" the word ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

4. In the fourth input, ""dax lug bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""blue."" This further enforces the rule that ""dax"" means ""green,"" and suggests that ""lug"" and ""bluf"" could mean ""blue.""

5. Finally, in the fifth input, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once more.

All these examples show that ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule induced from the examples is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that each nonce word translates to a specific color. The word ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input or surrounding words. Here's the breakdown:

Input: wif
Output: red
Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""red.""

Input: wif lug wif
Output: red blue red
Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""bluf"" again translates to ""red,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Input: wif
Output: red
Rule: ""wif"" again translates to ""red.""

Given the consistency across all examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" Thus, the meaning of ""zup"" in this context appears to be the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can compare the inputs and outputs across the examples given.

In the first example:
- ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green.""

Seeing the second example:
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow.""

And the third example:
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""green green red blue.""

The fourth example shows:
- ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red.""

And the fifth example:
- ""zup bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red.""

The patterns indicate that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color assigned to the word immediately preceding it. For instance, when ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is yellow. Similarly, when ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is green, and when ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf,"" the color output for ""bluf"" is red.

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:

bluf -> The word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that immediately precedes it.
Rule: walm -> repeated color of previous word

The instruction ""walm"" seems to mean ""repeat the color indicated by the previous word"". In the given examples, the color that is named before ""walm"" is repeated for the amount of times ""walm"" is said. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" outputs ""red red green green red red red blue red"", where ""walm"" follows ""wif"", and ""wif"" correlates to ""red""; hence ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""red"".

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue""; ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" twice.

- ""lug zup dax walm"" outputs ""blue yellow green green green""; here ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which correlates to ""green"", and two repetitions of ""green"" follow.

- ""wif lug walm"" outputs ""red blue blue blue""; ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which correlates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

- ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""; ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which correlates to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" causes three repetitions of ""yellow"". The final ""lug"" returns to ""blue"".

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color indicated by the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule: The word 'lug' in each input directly translates to the color 'blue' in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: 'dax' correlates to the output 'green', and every instance of 'dax' in the input results in one 'green' in the output. Additionally, 'walm' seemingly correlates to the output 'green green', possibly due to repetition or emphasizing effect in this context. However, more examples or context would be required to determine the exact rule for 'walm.'
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Here is the breakdown by each input and output example:

1. Input: zup dax zup wif
   Output: yellow green yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" seems unrelated to ""wif"" since it also outputs ""red""

4. Input: dax zup dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow green yellow red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

5. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" is not directly related to ""wif;"" however, walm consistently corresponds to ""red"" and extends to ""green green"" in this case

Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" follows in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif corresponds to the color red.

wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to replicate the color associated with the word preceding it. Therefore, if the word before ""bluf"" represents a color, ""bluf"" takes on that color as output. Here's the rationale:

- ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue,"" suggesting that ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- ""wif bluf lug"" outputs ""red red blue,"" which follows the pattern—the word ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color, ""red,"" and ""lug"" still stands for ""blue.""
- ""lug bluf"" repeats the output ""blue blue,"" consistent with previous findings.
- ""zup dax bluf"" outputs ""yellow green green,"" indicating that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""green.""

So, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Bluf repeats the color signified by the word immediately preceding it.
From the examples given, we can deduce the following pattern in correspondence to the word ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" is surrounded by the same word (""wif"") on either side, and the output color for both ""wif"" and ""walm"" is blue.

- In the second example, the word ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and the output color for both is yellow. The word ""lug"" also precedes ""walm,"" and the word ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" also corresponds to yellow.

- The third example is similar to the first; ""dax"" surrounds ""walm"" on both sides, and the output color is green for both.

- In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes after ""walm,"" and both had the color red in the output. ""Lug"" follows later, which has a different color (blue) than the preceding ""walm.""

- The last example shows ""zup"" followed by ""walm,"" with both translating to yellow.

From these observations, the pattern is that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word before it (i.e., it is the first word), it defaults to yellow. 

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word; if it is the first word, it is yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each of the examples provided.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at its position relative to the other words in the given examples, as well as the corresponding outputs.

Let's examine each example:

1. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both at the beginning and the end of the sequence.

2. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""walm lug,"" which corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

3. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   Regardless of the position next to ""lug,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   ""dax"" follows the sequence ""wif zup walm"" and precedes ""zup,"" still corresponding to ""green.""

5. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green
   ""dax"" is at the end of the sequence and still corresponds to ""green.""

Based on the above examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the surrounding words in the sequences. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. In every example where the word ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" is included in the output. No other word is consistently translated to ""red"". Therefore, the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" means ""yellow."" When ""zup"" stands alone, the output is ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is combined with other words, it contributes ""yellow"" to the sequence of color outputs corresponding to each input word. Here's the interpretation for each example:

- ""wif"" is paired with ""red,"" and when combined with ""zup,"" the sequence ""yellow red"" is produced.
- ""bluf"" is paired with ""yellow,"" and when ""zup"" is added, the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When ""zup"" is the sole input, the output is simply ""yellow.""
- In the input ""wif lug zup bluf,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and the outputs for ""zup"" and ""bluf"" are ""yellow yellow,"" as previously established.

So, the rule can be written as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we look for patterns in the inputs and outputs provided in the examples. Let's analyze the examples provided.

- Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
- Input: dax lug bluf wif -> Output: green blue blue red
- Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red
- Input: lug bluf zup lug -> Output: blue blue yellow blue

Taking these examples into account:

1. Notice that in every example, the word immediately following ""bluf"" is repeated in the output.
2. ""Bluf"" does not have a consistent corresponding color. Instead, its presence in the input triggers a repetition of the color that translates to the word immediately after ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the next word in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, each input that contains ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of colors in the output where the number of color repetitions is consistent with the word that comes before ""walm."" Here is the breakdown of examples:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (three repetitions of blue).
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (three repetitions of yellow).
- ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red"" (one green, followed by three repetitions of red).
- ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" (one blue, followed by three repetitions of yellow and one single blue afterward).
- ""dax walm zup lug dax"" results in ""green green green yellow blue green"" (three repetitions of green, followed by one yellow, one blue, and one green).

It appears that ""walm"" is a modifier that causes the color word that corresponds to the word just prior to ""walm"" to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The term ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string or the other words it is paired with. This suggests that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following pattern: whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the output always starts with ""red"". It seems that ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and is not dependent on its position in the input sequence. The other inputs (""lug"", ""zup"", ""dax"") correspond to specific colors (""blue"", ""yellow"", ""green"" respectively).

Taking this into account, we can summarize the rule for ""wif"":

wif -> meaning: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input. Rule: When ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" should be included in the output at the position corresponding to where ""wif"" appears in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of 'zup', let us analyze its occurrence in each input:

1. 'zup bluf dax' -> 'yellow yellow green'
2. 'zup wif' -> 'yellow red'
3. 'zup dax lug' -> 'yellow green blue'
4. 'zup wif dax wif bluf' -> 'yellow red green red red'
5. 'zup dax' -> 'yellow green'

Judging by these examples, 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow' regardless of its position or the other words it is combined with. It is the only term that remains consistent across all examples. Other nonce words following 'zup' correspond to different colors, but 'zup' itself is always associated with the same color in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples and see if ""bluf"" consistently translates to the same output regardless of the surrounding words. 

Examining the provided examples:

1. lug dax bluf -> blue green green
2. lug bluf -> blue blue
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green

We can see that when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue."" When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red."" When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""

From this, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output on its own; instead, its meaning depends on the word that comes before it. Specifically:

- If ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- If ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""
- If ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" means ""the same color as the first word's output color."" Here is the rule put together:

Rule: bluf -> ""the same color as the first word's output color.""
From the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of colors that are repeated multiple times. Each instance of ""walm"" is associated with a different color based on the word that comes immediately before it.

Looking at each example:

- ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" suggesting that when ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red"" repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green,"" suggesting that when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it translates to ""green"" repeated three times.
- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow"" repeated three times.

However, when ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" we see ""blue blue blue"" in the output, even though the initial word differs (e.g., ""dax lug walm"" and ""zup lug walm""). This indicates that the word immediately preceding ""walm"" determines its color translation and that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of that color three times.

Rule: walm -> a series of three colors. The specific color is determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm."" If ""walm"" is immediately preceded by ""lug,"" it retains the color associated with the word before ""lug.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    ",Output: blue red green green green green,blue red green green green,False,73
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided:
- ""lug walm wif lug"" produces ""blue blue red blue"", where ""lug"" appears at both the beginning and the end, translating to ""blue"" at those positions.
- ""dax zup lug wif lug"" produces ""green yellow blue red blue"", again with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".
- ""lug zup"" yields ""blue yellow"", with ""lug"" once again being ""blue"".
- ""wif dax lug"" gives us ""red green blue"", with the final word ""blue"" being the translation of ""lug"".
- Finally, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"", where ""lug"" is ""blue"".

In all instances, regardless of position or surrounding words, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will examine each instance where the word ""dax"" appears and the output that corresponds to it:

1. Input: dax | Output: green
2. Input: dax walm wif dax | Output: green green green red green
3. Input: zup dax wif zup | Output: yellow green red yellow
4. Input: dax zup dax zup | Output: green yellow green yellow
5. Input: dax | Output: green

From the examples, we can observe the following:

- Every time ""dax"" is mentioned in isolation (examples 1 and 5), the output is ""green"".
- When ""dax"" appears multiple times in a sequence (examples 2 and 4), the output ""green"" corresponds to each occurrence of ""dax.""
- In example 2, ""wif"" appears between two instances of ""dax"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" but this color corresponds to ""wif"" rather than ""dax.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and each instance of ""dax"" still yields a ""green"" output.

Based on the above observations, we can induce that ""dax -> green"" consistently. In other words, every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output in the corresponding position.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples:

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
Input: lug wif -> Output: blue red

From these examples, every single instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". It's also clear that the word ""wif"" always leads to the same output regardless of the words around it, which means its meaning does not depend on context.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context in which it appears. Thus, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" always translates to ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input. The other words seem to translate consistently to the same color as well; ""dax"" is always ""green,"" ""zup"" is always ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is always ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is always ""red.""

Based on the data:

Rule: bluf -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
2. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

From the examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Looking specifically at ""walm"":
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is a repetition of ""green"" three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""walm"" itself after ""zup,"" we again see a repetition of the color corresponding to ""zup"" (""yellow"") three times.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to function as a rule that repeats the color of the preceding color-word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the same color as the preceding color-word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm
    ",Output: yellow green blue blue blue blue,yellow green blue blue blue,False,74
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, wherever the word ""lug"" appears, it is translated into ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to an output that is the same color as the color linked to the next word in the sequence. If ""dax"" is followed by a word representing a color, it produces the output of that same color. If ""dax"" is at the end of the input or is not followed by another word, it defaults to green, given ""dax bluf"" produces ""green green,"" which indicates bluf is green, and ""dax"" on its own is green as well.

To demonstrate this with the examples:

- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" => yellow blue blue blue red green
   In this case, ""dax"" is followed by no word, but the last known color before ""dax"" is red.

- ""zup walm dax lug"" => yellow yellow yellow green blue
   ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" which outputs blue. Hence ""dax"" is green followed by ""lug"" which is blue.

- ""dax lug dax"" => green blue green
   The first ""dax"" has no preceding color word, so it defaults to green. The second ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, but since there's no word after the second ""dax,"" it defaults back to green.

- ""dax bluf"" => green green
   ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which is translated to green, so ""dax"" takes the color green as well.

- ""dax walm"" => green green green
   Similarly, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" which is green, leading to ""dax"" being green too.

Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: dax -> takes the color of the following word. If there is no word after dax or the next word's color is unknown, it defaults to green.
Based on the examples provided, we observe the following:

- When ""wif"" is before another word, the color ""red"" is produced before the color associated with that word.
- The word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue.""
- The pattern of colors follows the order of the words in the input.

Given the consistent appearance of ""red"" preceding the color associated with the subsequent word whenever ""wif"" is used, we can deduce that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. The word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input list. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow every time it appears.
Analyzing the examples provided:

- When ""dax bluf"" is the input, the output is ""green green."" The word ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" so it appears that ""bluf"" may also translate to ""green"" in this instance. However, more evidence is needed.

- With the input ""lug wif lug dax bluf,"" the output is ""blue red blue green green."" Here ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" as previously observed. The last ""green"" corresponds to ""bluf,"" which supports the initial hypothesis that ""bluf"" might mean ""green.""

- In the input ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" This indicates that ""wif"" stands for ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" yields ""red"" as well, it could imply that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word. 

- The input ""lug wif lug bluf"" gives the output ""blue red blue blue."" Here it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word just before it, which is ""lug"" for ""blue.""

- Finally, for the input ""lug bluf wif,"" the output is ""blue blue red."" Again, ""bluf"" seems to be taking on the color of the word before it, which is ""lug"" for ""blue.""

Considering the patterns, it appears the rule is that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that comes before it.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" has a rule related to color output repetition. Specifically, it repeats the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. 

Here is the breakdown of each example:

1. In ""zup lug walm wif dax"", the output is ""yellow blue blue blue red green."" After ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" ""walm"" causes the next color to also be ""blue.""

2. In ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" the output is ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" After ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" ""walm"" causes the next colors to be ""green."" Again after ""lug"" which outputs ""blue,"" ""walm"" causes the next color to also be ""blue.""

3. In ""dax walm wif walm,"" the output is ""green green green red red red."" This follows the same pattern, with ""walm"" causing the next colors to be the same as the color corresponding to the word before ""walm.""

4. In ""zup lug walm,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue blue."" The word ""walm"" after ""lug"" again causes the next color to be ""blue.""

5. In ""wif lug dax walm,"" the output is ""red blue green green green."" The word ""walm"" after ""dax"" makes the next colors ""green.""

Rule: walm -> a word that causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There is no variation in the output related to the presence of the word ""dax"" in the input, suggesting that ""dax"" is directly mapped to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color ""yellow."" No matter its position in the input sequence, ""zup"" always results in ""yellow"" in the output sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Given the examples, it seems that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The task is to determine what the word ""bluf"" corresponds to based on the pattern observed.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule:

Looking at the outputs, ""bluf"" correlates with the color immediately preceding it (with an exception in the second example, which may indicate a different rule or an error). However, in the second example, where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" there seems to be no preceding color as ""walm"" does not have a consistent corresponding color in the other examples.

But, observing closely in other instances:
- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third input, ""bluf"" again follows ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

In considering these patterns, we might deduce that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes immediately before it except in the case where it is immediately preceded by ""lug,"" then it's red. But this rule is based on limited data and cannot account for the anomaly in the second example unless further information reveals a special rule that applies when ""lug"" and ""walm"" are in the sequence.

The best deduction based on the given data is:

bluf -> Takes the color of the word immediately before it, except when preceded by ""lug"", then it's red. However, the presence of ""walm"" preceding ""lug"" that precedes ""bluf"" creates an exception which isn't explained by the data provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern of colors presented in the output corresponding to each input that includes ""walm."" Let's analyze:

1. ""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow""
2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
3. ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
4. ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""
5. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""

Each sequence that includes the word ""walm"" results in three consecutive colors that are the same. This repetition of color occurs exactly at the position where ""walm"" appears in the input:

- For input ""dax walm wif zup,"" ""walm"" appears second, which means the second, third, and fourth colors in the output are the same (green).
- For input ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax,"" hence the repetition of green.
- In ""lug walm dax,"" ""walm"" is the second word and follows ""lug,"" resulting in three blues in a row.
- In ""dax zup dax walm,"" the word ""walm"" is last, making the last three colors green.
- For input ""wif lug walm,"" ""walm"" is the last word and follows ""lug,"" hence the three blue colors at the end.

No matter the position of ""walm,"" it results in a repetition of three colors that match the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm.” 

Thus, we can conclude that the meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the previous word three times. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in all given examples.
Observing the pattern in the examples given, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the meaning of ""dax"". The word ""dax"" in the examples is always associated with a color in the output. Let's analyze the occurences:

1. When ""dax"" appears twice in a row: ""dax wif zup dax"" results in ""green red yellow green"". We can observe that the first ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and the second ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green"". This suggests that ""dax"" could consistently represent ""green"" regardless of its position.

2. ""dax"" in different positions: ""zup lug dax"" results in ""yellow blue green"". Here ""dax"" is at the end and it translates to ""green"". ""lug wif dax walm zup"" results in ""blue red green green green yellow""; ""dax"" is in the middle and again corresponds to ""green"". This supports our initial observation that ""dax"" always represents the color ""green"".

3. ""lug dax lug"" results in ""blue green blue"". Here ""dax"" is sandwiched between two ""lug"" which translate to ""blue"", indicating ""dax"" retains its meaning irrespective of surrounding words.

4. ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"". Again ""dax"" is followed by ""lug"", and it translates to ""green"".

Based on these examples, we can deduce the meaning as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in all provided examples, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
Based on the given examples, let's try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

1. ""zup wif bluf zup"" -> ""yellow red red yellow""
   Here, ""wif"" is surrounded by words that translate to ""yellow"" on both sides, but its output is ""red"".

2. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""
   ""Dax"" gives ""green"", followed by ""wif"" which results in ""red"".

3. ""wif"" -> ""red""
   Standing alone, ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

4. ""lug dax wif"" -> ""blue green red""
   ""Lug"" gives ""blue"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""wif"" again translates to ""red"".

5. ""lug walm wif lug"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue""
   ""Lug"" gives ""blue"", ""walm"" seems to translate to ""blue"" (in this context), followed by ""wif"" which results in ""red"", followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"" again.

Based on these examples, it appears:

""wif"" always translates to ""red"", independent of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""zup"":

1. wif lug zup -> red blue yellow
2. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
3. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
4. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue
5. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue

From these examples, we observe the following:

- Every time ""zup"" is mentioned, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""yellow"" in the output corresponds to the position of ""zup"" in the input.

Thus, it seems that ""zup"" is directly translated to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sentence. There is no indication that the meaning of ""zup"" depends on any other factors in the context.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's examine each instance and the corresponding output color.

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red

From the input and output pairs above, it seems like the output immediately after ""bluf"" is the same as the word before ""bluf."" Let us apply this observation to see if it holds true:

1. ""zup dax bluf"" followed by ""yellow green green"" suggests that ""bluf"" means ""green"" since ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
2. ""wif bluf lug zup"" followed by ""red red blue yellow"" supports this as ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
3. ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" followed by ""red blue blue red yellow"" shows ""bluf"" coming after ""lug,"" and the corresponding colors are ""blue blue.""
4. ""dax bluf wif lug"" followed by ""green green red blue"" further confirms the rule as ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the colors are ""green green.""
5. ""zup lug bluf wif"" followed by ""yellow blue blue red"" shows the same pattern with ""bluf"" following ""lug,"" hence ""blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it is always followed by the same color as the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs, paying special attention to the presence of ""walm"" and its associated color in the outputs:

1. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
2. Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue
3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf | Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup | Output: green red red red blue yellow
5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf | Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

Observing the outputs:

- In every instance where ""walm"" is present, the color ""red"" appears in a sequence of three consecutive instances.
- ""walm"" does not correspond to a single color but rather a repeated sequence of ""red.""
- The other words in the sentences correspond to single colors, as seen in examples where ""walm"" is not present.

From this analysis, we can conclude that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of the color ""red"" in a row.

Rule: walm -> three reds in a row.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True,77
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in the output. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position of the output. 

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Hence, we can deduce the rule as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be consistent, but the rule for other words seems to vary or possibly depend on the context provided by ""wif."" Here is the analysis:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue."" Since this combination appears multiple times with the same output, we can conclude that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" when following ""wif.""
- In the case of the input ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" ""wif"" still translates to ""red,"" but the pattern for the other words becomes more complex. ""Zup"" and ""bluf"" both output ""yellow,"" though whether this is because of their position relative to ""wif"" or an inherent property of the words themselves is unclear. ""Lug"" still outputs ""blue,"" consistent with previous examples. ""Walm"" seems to output ""blue blue blue,"" which is not consistent with anything prior, suggesting that its meaning could be dependent on the number of times it occurs or the context with the previously mentioned words.

Given these observations, the most clear rule is:

Rule: wif -> red.

As for the other words in the context of ""wif,"" the rule is not entirely clear with the information provided, but ""lug"" consistently means ""blue"" when it appears in the sequence after ""wif."" Further examples and context are needed to fully understand the rules behind ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm.""
Based on the examples provided, where the word ""zup"" is surrounded by various other nonce words, we can induce a rule for the meaning of ""zup."" Each nonce word corresponds to a color, and the color that each word represents remains consistent across the examples.

Here is the color mapping from the provided examples:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow

The output for each ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and each appearance of ""zup"" is followed by the word ""bluf,"" which also translates to ""yellow."" Thus, we can induce that the word ""zup"" itself codes for the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding bluf.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, repeat the color that corresponds to the word before ""bluf."" If ""zup"" means yellow, ""zup bluf"" means ""yellow yellow"". If ""lug"" means blue, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"". If ""dax"" means green, ""dax bluf"" produces ""green green"". Finally, if ""wif"" means red, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will look for patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs.

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif"":
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

In both cases, the word after ""walm"" is repeated three times, and the color ""red"" is associated with ""wif.""

2. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax"":
Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

After ""dax walm,"" the color green is repeated twice, and the other colors vary based on the words following ""walm.""

3. When ""walm"" appears with no clear pattern of the word before it:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green

Despite different preceding words, whenever ""walm"" appears, the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> meaning

Based on the above analysis, ""walm"" appears to be a modifier that indicates that the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be repeated three times in the output.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
When ""walm"" is present in the input, the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" is output three times in a row.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

   Test: lug dax red -> blue green red (matches)

5. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   Test: red zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow (matches)

With these tests, all the outputs match when we replace ""wif"" with ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be consistent.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here is the consistent pattern:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" is translated to ""red,"" although it appears only once which makes it less certain than the others.

However, given ""walm zup"" both translates to ""yellow,"" it is possible that ""walm"" also means ""yellow"" or that it is a modifier without additional context.

Given the consistent translation of ""zup"" to ""yellow"" in all examples, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means the color that immediately precedes it should be repeated.

Evidence:
1. ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow blue."" Here, the word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and in the output, ""red"" is repeated.
  
2. ""lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow."" The word ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and in the output, ""blue"" is repeated.

3. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green."" The word ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and in the output, ""green"" is repeated.

4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" The word ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and in the output, ""yellow"" is repeated before continuing with the translation of the following words.

5. ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green."" The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and in the output, ""red"" is repeated.

Therefore, bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it in the input. When ""walm"" follows a color word, the output is that color word repeated three times. Here is the breakdown by example:

- In the first input, ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times in the output.
- In the second input, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times. The word ""wif"" follows with a new instance of ""walm,"" and so ""red"" is repeated three times after ""wif"" corresponds to red. Finally, ""zup"" at the end corresponds to yellow.
- The third input is similar, with the order of words slightly changed but following the same pattern.
- In the fourth input, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" we see ""lug"" is blue and ""walm"" once again causes ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated three times. ""Dax wif bluf"" follows the pattern with their respective colors.
- The fifth input shows that ""lug"" leads to two instances of blue, and ""walm"" following ""lug"" causes another instance of blue, fulfilling the threefold repetition. ""Wif"" and ""dax"" follow suit with their respective colors red and green.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm causes the color word that immediately precedes it to be output three times.

Walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True,79
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"". There doesn't seem to be a context-dependent rule affecting the meaning of ""lug"" across the different examples, as it stands for the same color each time it's used. Thus, the rule for ""lug"" is straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue
To uncover what ""dax"" means in this context, let's analyze the patterns corresponding with each instance of ""dax"" and its associated color in the outputs.

1. In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and ""wif"", with the outputs being ""green"", ""green"", and ""red"" accordingly. This suggests that ""dax"" might be related to the green output, as ""bluf"" does not correlate with the output ""blue"", and ""wif"" doesn't seem to match the color ""red"".

2. In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug walm"" and the outputs are ""green"", ""blue"", ""blue"", ""blue"". Again, ""dax"" correlates with the color green. ""Lug"" correlates with the color blue, and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

3. The third example shows ""dax"" alone produces an output of ""green"". This solidifies the association between ""dax"" and the color green.

4. The fourth example complicates the pattern as ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" and ""dax"", resulting in colors ""yellow"", ""blue"", and ""green"". ""Dax"" still results in a green output, irrespective of its position in the sequence, suggesting that ""dax"" is consistently tied to the color green regardless of preceding words.

5. Finally, the fifth example presents ""lug dax walm wif"" with the outputs ""blue green green green red"". ""Lug"" once again correlates with ""blue"", and ""dax"" follows with ""green"". ""Walm"" seems to carry the color of the word before it, in this case, green, and ""wif"" brings a new color, red, which doesn't seem directly tied to the preceding green.

Given the strong consistent association with the color green, irrespective of position in the sequence or preceding words, the rule is:

Rule: ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in each instance. Consequently, we can establish the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output will always include the word ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is encountered, it is to be replaced with the word ""yellow.""
Through the analysis of the given examples, we can first deduce the following:

- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green""
- ""walm"" maps to ""red""

Looking at how ""bluf"" is treated across each example, it seems that ""bluf"" is not mapping to a consistent color. Instead, it appears to adopt the color of the word preceding it:

1. In Examples 1, 2, and 3, when ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" (which maps to ""red""), the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
2. In Examples 3 and 5, when ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" (which maps to ""green""), the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"".
3. In Example 4, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" (which maps to ""green"") again, and the output is ""green"".

Therefore, the inferred rule seems to be: 

bluf -> Take the color of the preceding word. If no word precedes it, default to green.
Based on the examples, it can be deduced that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup walm dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green blue,"" so ""walm"" caused ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) to be repeated three times before continuing with the sequence.
  
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which means that ""walm"" once again caused ""dax"" (green) to be repeated two additional times.
  
- The third example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" results in ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""walm"" triggered ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated two more times after its initial appearance.
  
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" we get ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" led to the repeat of ""lug's"" color (blue) twice more.
  
- The fifth example, ""zup walm,"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" confirming the pattern that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,80
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, where ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue"", the meaning for ""lug"" can be defined as the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Here are the given examples with this assumption:

- lug walm dax -> blue blue green
- dax -> green
- zup lug dax -> yellow blue green
- dax lug wif -> green blue red
- zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow green yellow green red

In each case, wherever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears at the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red

The pattern here is that every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we must look at how its presence affects the output across all examples. By comparing inputs that contain ""zup"" with their corresponding outputs, we can identify patterns to inform our rule for the meaning of ""zup.""

Here are the observations from the given examples:

1. When ""zup"" appears alone in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
2. Whenever ""zup"" is present in an input sequence, the first color in the output sequence is always ""yellow.""
3. The presence of other words following ""zup"" does not change the initial ""yellow"" output but affects subsequent color outputs, e.g., ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to other colors.

From these observations, the rule for ""zup"" can be induced as:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the output color ""yellow."" It seems to contribute the color yellow to the sequence as the first color whenever it appears in the input, independent of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for the pattern in the word's position and the corresponding output.

In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the output is a color repeated twice. Here is the breakdown:

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
2. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green""
3. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue red green green red""
4. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
5. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""

We can notice that ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the word immediately preceding it. For example, in the second input, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color ""green,"" and the output for ""bluf"" in this case is ""green green.""

So, based on the examples provided:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes the color name of the preceding word and outputs it twice.

Meaning: ""Bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each input-output pair:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

2. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - ""zup"" is consistent with ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green""

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" is consistent with ""green""
   - ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue""

4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   - ""wif"" is consistent with ""red""
   - ""lug"" is consistent with ""blue""
   - ""dax"" is consistent with ""green""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" is consistent with ""green""

Noticing the outputs, every time ""walm"" appears, it results in a repetition of the color associated with the nonce word immediately before it. Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" functions as a duplicator or repeater of the color of the preceding word. 

Rule: ""walm"" -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,81
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's start by looking at the provided examples and their output sequences. Let's list the examples and note the occurrence of ""dax"" to see if there's a corresponding pattern in the output.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm 
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - Here again, ""dax"" is followed by the color ""green.""

3. Input: dax
   Output: green

4. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
   - In this case, ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" yet ""dax"" remains ""green.""

5. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   - ""Dax"" is followed by ""wif"" but its corresponding output is ""green.""

In each case, independent of the words before or after it, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. This suggests a simple direct mapping from ""dax"" to ""green,"" and no context-specific rule is apparent from the given examples.

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at its position and the outputs for each input.

1. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
- Here ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, ""wif"" could possibly alter the color associated with ""zup."" However, ""zup"" on its own is green too, so let's look for more examples.

2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
- ""Wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue."" Since the output is ""red"" right after ""wif,"" it seems that ""wif"" changes the color of the following word, but we need more data.

3. dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green
- ""Wif"" comes between two words that on their own correspond to ""green."" Since the color after ""wif"" is ""red,"" it again suggests that ""wif"" changes the color associated with the following word rather than having a color of its own.

4. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
- ""Wif"" appears at the beginning and between ""zup"" and ""dax."" Each time following ""wif,"" the color ""red"" appears, regardless of the color that ""dax"" or ""zup"" usually represents (""green"" or ""yellow""). Again, this suggests that ""wif"" affects the following word.

5. wif lug -> red blue
- With ""wif"" followed by ""lug,"" which on its own is ""blue,"" we again get ""red"" after ""wif.""

The consistent pattern across these examples is that whenever ""wif"" precedes another word, the output color for that word is ""red,"" regardless of what the normal output for that word would be without ""wif.""

Rule:
wif -> changes the color representation of the following word to red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Every instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of words.
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: If the word before ""bluf"" is...
- ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is the first word or no recognized word precedes it, there is not enough information to determine the rule.
From the provided examples, we can analyze each instance where the nonce word ""walm"" occurs and its associated output to determine its meaning.

In every example, the occurrence of ""walm"" leads to a repeated color in the output, matching the color that would otherwise be represented by the word just before it. Let's break down each example:

1. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue  
   In this case, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" causes the word ""red"" to repeat.

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   ""Lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""blue,"" so ""walm"" triggers more ""blue.""

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""Lug"" is before ""walm"" again, translating to additional ""blue.""

5. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   Once more, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output reflects repeated ""red.""

Based on the information above, ""walm"" seems to function as a command to repeat the color corresponding to the word that appears just before it in the input.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,82
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Here's how that rule applies to each example:

1. ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red.""
2. ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red.""
3. ""dax zup lug bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue blue.""
4. ""dax"" by itself translates to ""green.""
5. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green blue yellow blue red,"" where ""dax"" is between ""lug"" and ""bluf,"" corresponding to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""
2. ""lug wif"" -> ""blue red""
3. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
4. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

In examples (1), (3), and (5) where ""wif"" is followed by a different nonce word, the first color in the output is always ""red."" This suggests a rule where ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

However, in example (2), ""wif"" is following the word ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue red"" since ""lug wif"" is different from ""wif lug"" (example 3).

The example (4) adds complexity but confirms the ""red"" association because towards the end we again see ""lug wif"" resulting in ""blue red,"" with ""wif"" contributing the color ""red.""

So, based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the second position when it follows another word, and in the first position when it precedes another word or when it's the only word after ""wif."" 
In cases where multiple colors are involved and ""wif"" is not at the beginning or end of the sequence, it isn't explicitly clear from the examples what contribution ""wif"" might have, but based on example (4), the rules for the preceding words (e.g., ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""lug"") appear to determine their respective color outputs before ""wif,"" which aligns with our earlier deduction.

Rule: wif -> ""wif"" generally corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". There doesn't appear to be any conditionality or context dependence in its translation; whenever ""zup"" is used in an input, it consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned before it. Here's the breakdown:

1. wif bluf -> red red (wif corresponds to red, then bluf also corresponds to red)
2. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue (here lug corresponds to blue, then bluf also corresponds to blue)
3. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red (in this case, bluf follows dax, which corresponds to green, then bluf also corresponds to green)
4. wif bluf -> red red (as before, wif corresponds to red, then bluf also corresponds to red)
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (zup corresponds to yellow, then bluf also corresponds to yellow)

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word mentioned before it. If the previous word is ""wif,"" bluf means ""red."" If it's ""dax,"" bluf means ""green,"" and if it's ""zup,"" bluf means ""yellow."" If it's ""lug,"" bluf means ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" consistently results in three repetitions of color names in the output. Furthermore, these repetitions are always of the last color name that appears before ""walm."" Here's the rule illustrated with each example:

1. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeated three times.

2. Input: ""lug zup dax walm""
   Output: ""blue yellow green green green""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" once more, and ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated three times after it.

3. Input: ""dax walm"" (same as the first example)
   Output: ""green green green""
   - This is identical to example 1 and further supports the rule.

4. Input: ""zup walm wif""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow"" repeated three times. The word ""wif"" then corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: ""zup bluf wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow red red red""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and with ""walm"" following it, ""red"" is repeated thrice. This provides additional support for ""walm"" causing a triple repeat of the previous color.

Therefore, walm -> meaning. Rule:
walm -> When walm follows a word that corresponds to a color, the output is that color name repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, I will analyze the input-output sequences to deduce the meaning of the word ""lug"":

1. Input: lug => Output: blue
   - Here, ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color blue.

2. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif => Output: blue red red blue red
   - ""lug"" appears twice and both times translates to blue.
   - ""wif"" appears twice and translates to red both times.

3. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif => Output: red red blue green red
   - Again, ""lug"" translated to blue.

4. Input: dax lug => Output: green blue
   - ""dax"" translates to green, and ""lug"" to blue.

5. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif => Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""lug"" appears three times and each time translates to blue.

Based on the examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Thus, we can deduce:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" represents the color green, irrespective of its position or the context within a sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the output ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" being included in the output, independently of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence. Hence, we can deduce that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. 

Here's the pattern we observe:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" (since when ""dax"" is introduced in the input, ""green"" is always part of the corresponding output)
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" (since when ""lug"" is part of the input, ""blue"" is in the output)
- ""zup"" and ""bluf"" have only appeared once each in the examples, but we can infer that:
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (since it is the new element in the third input and ""yellow"" is the new color in the output)
  - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" (which is the same output as ""lug,"" suggesting that either these two words are synonyms or there may be additional context rules for repeating colors in the output)

By looking at these correlations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: Each word in the input is translated into a specific color in the output. The word ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look at its corresponding output in each sentence to see if there is a pattern.

1. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug wif zup wif
   Output: blue red yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In all the examples, regardless of position or surrounding words, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
By analyzing the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf.""

In each example, we see the word ""bluf"" followed by a color as an output. It appears twice in the input and the corresponding color also appears twice in the output. Let's break down the instances:

1. First example:
   - dax wif dax zup bluf => green red green yellow yellow
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""yellow.""

2. Second example:
   - lug bluf zup lug => blue blue yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" again to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" again seems to correspond to ""blue.""

3. Third example:
   - lug bluf dax bluf => blue blue green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" here corresponds to ""green.""

4. Fourth example:
   - lug bluf wif => blue blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

5. Fifth example:
   - wif bluf zup bluf wif => red red yellow yellow red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From the available data, we can see that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the previous word in the sequence.
To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's break down the examples provided and look for patterns regarding the word's placement and the corresponding outputs.

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" seems to correspond to the word ""yellow,"" given that it's the only word before ""walm"" and that the output is three yellows.

2. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue,"" since it's the only word before ""walm"" and the output repeats blue three times.
   - ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and translates to ""green,"" based on the output.

3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" repeating the first rule.
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" suggesting ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
   - ""walm"" appears twice and in both instances, it repeats the color before it three times (blue blue blue, red red red).

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - The pattern of ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" followed by their respective color outputs holds.
   - There's one instance of ""walm,"" which is preceded by ""lug"" (blue), and the output is three blues.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" results in three blues.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times.

Rule:
walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,84
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

- When ""lug"" is translated it consistently results in the color ""blue"".
- It seems to retain this meaning regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

So the rule is:
lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

- In the first and fourth examples, the sole input ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"", indicating that the presence of ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green"". 
- In the second example, we have a sequence ""zup wif dax walm"" which yields ""yellow red green green green"". If we associate ""dax"" with ""green"" based on the first example, we can then infer that ""walm"" following ""dax"" also translates to ""green"". 
- In the third example, the sequence ""dax walm zup walm"" results in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"". This suggests that ""walm"" after ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow"".
- The final example, ""lug dax zup dax wif"", translates to ""blue green yellow green red"". We already suspected that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" based on previous examples. Since ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"", the pattern holds for this sequence as well.

Looking across all examples, ""dax"" on its own or in different positions consistently translates to ""green"". Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of ""dax"" is green.

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color red. Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Here's the pattern observed:

- Input: ""wif bluf"" -> Output: ""red red.""  
  The presence of ""wif"" corresponds to a single instance of ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

- Input: ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> Output: ""red red red blue blue.""  
  Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" again to ""red.""

- Input: ""wif"" -> Output: ""red.""  
  Alone, ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red.""

- Input: ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red.""  
  ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to ""red red.""

- Input: ""wif bluf"" -> Output: ""red red.""  
  The same as the first example, reinforcing the association of ""wif"" with ""red"" and ""bluf"" also with ""red.""

Therefore, the rule can be described as:
Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"" (Each occurrence of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red."")
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in English.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the given examples and outputs:

1. Input: wif lug bluf --> Output: red blue blue
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""blue,"" it seems that ""bluf"" follows the color of the word preceding it.

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup --> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""bluf"" corresponds again to the color preceding it, which is ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm --> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Again ""bluf"" takes the color of the word right before it, which is ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif bluf --> Output: red red
""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" follows suit, being ""red"" as well, corresponding to the preceding word.

5. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax --> Output: green green yellow yellow green
""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and again ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the preceding word.

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. 

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, walm seems to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it three times. Here is the analysis:

- ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green"" ('dax' corresponds to 'green,' followed by 'walm,' which turns into 'green green green')
- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" ('dax' is 'green,' followed by 'walm,' resulting in 'green green green')
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" ('lug' is 'blue,' followed by 'walm,' which gives 'blue blue blue')
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red"" ('dax' is 'green,' resulting in 'green green green;' 'wif' corresponds to red, but 'walm' here only repeats the color of 'dax')
- ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"" ('dax' is 'green,' 'zup' is 'yellow,' and 'walm' repeats the 'yellow' three times; 'wif' is 'red,' but 'walm' here again repeats the color of 'dax')

Therefore, walm seems to mean: repeat the color of the word immediately before it three times. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green,green red yellow green,True,85
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue regardless of its position or context within the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following meanings for each nonce word including ""dax"":

1. dax -> green
2. lug -> blue
3. wif -> red
4. zup -> yellow

However, the presence of ""bluf"" on the list seems to change the output it is associated with, depending on where it occurs relative to ""dax."" Let's examine its appearances:

- When ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" as in ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" comes before ""zup,"" as in ""bluf zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" changes to ""yellow,"" which is normally the output for ""zup.""
- The color ""yellow"" is consistent for ""zup,"" regardless of its position relative to ""dax"" or ""bluf.""
  
Given the inconsistencies with ""bluf,"" the rule for ""dax"" seems quite straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green

But it seems we might need additional context or more examples to accurately deduce the rule for ""bluf,"" assuming there is a fixed rule at all. It might be that ""bluf"" takes the color of whatever word follows it, or there may be another rule at play that we cannot determine from the given examples.
Based on the examples provided:

- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red""
- ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow""
- ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red""
- ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" translates to ""green green red yellow green""
- ""dax lug dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue green blue red""

Each example that contains ""wif"" outputs red at the position where ""wif"" is located. Regardless of its position in the input, ""wif"" consistently translates to red. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". When other color-associated words follow it, ""zup"" seems not to change the original meaning inferred from its isolated use. When it precedes other color-associated words, it results in the translation of those words to their respective colors. Hence, ""wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" does not have a direct translation but seems to repeat the color word preceding it three times based on the last input example. 

zup -> ""yellow""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the inputs and outputs:

1. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
2. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red""
3. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow""
4. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
5. ""lug zup bluf dax"" -> ""blue yellow yellow green""

By examining each instance of ""bluf"" in the inputs and seeing how it maps to the corresponding outputs, we can deduce that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in each case. The word ""bluf"" consistently results in the word ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input.

So, the rule here is:

bluf -> ""red""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the color associated with the preceding word. Whenever ""walm"" is mentioned, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated an additional two times. Here's the breakdown based on the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" resulted in ""red red red"", indicating that ""walm"" causes the color of ""wif"" (red) to be repeated three times in total.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" led to ""green green green"", showing that the color for ""dax"" (green) is outputted three times when followed by ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""dax walm lug"" again shows ""dax"" with its associated color (green) repeated three times due to ""walm"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" led to ""blue blue blue"", with ""lug"" being blue and ""walm"" causing the color to be repeated three times.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax walm"", without any subsequent word, still resulted in ""green green green"", reaffirming that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previously mentioned color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,86
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue' in each example provided.
From the given examples, we can attempt to induce the rule for the meaning of the word ""dax."" Let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs to see if we can find a pattern.

Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
Input: lug dax wif lug -> Output: blue green red blue
Input: zup dax lug walm zup -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
Input: wif dax wif -> Output: red green red

From these examples, the word ""dax"" appears to correlate with the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Furthermore, other words in the input (""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""zup"") correspond to colors that remain consistent across all examples—lug corresponds with blue, wif corresponds with red, and zup corresponds with yellow.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word translates to a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> blue blue
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

Therefore, the rule seems to be that each nonce word corresponds to a particular color or sequence of colors. Since ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in all examples, the rule can be formulated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we deduce the following translations:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> multiple repetitions of blue turning to red

Now, we need to determine what ""zup"" means. We can see that ""zup"" appears in different positions and is translated as ""yellow"" in each instance. It does not appear to change based on position or surrounding words. Therefore, it's consistent across all examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of bluf can be deduced as follows:

When preceded by lug: bluf means ""blue"".
When preceded by wif: bluf means ""red"".
When preceded by zup: bluf means ""yellow"".
When preceded by dax: bluf means ""green"".

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is determined by the color word that precedes it, taking the same color as that word. If ""bluf"" is not preceded by a color word, then its default color appears to be yellow, as seen in the last example.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze each input against its corresponding output, relating the nonce word to the repeated word in the output.

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" repeated three times.

- Input: zup wif dax walm
  Output: yellow red green green green
  Here ""walm"" appears after ""zup wif dax"" and corresponds to ""green"" repeated three times. 

- Input: wif walm
  Output: red red red
  In this case, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" repeated three times. 

- Input: lug walm dax
  Output: blue blue blue green
  Here, ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" and corresponds to ""blue"" repeated three times. 

- Input: dax zup walm wif walm
  Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
  In the first case, ""walm"" follows ""dax zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow"" repeated three times. In the second case, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red"" repeated three times. 

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" is not tied to a specific color but to the repeated output of the color connected to the word that comes right before ""walm."" Also, ""walm"" seems to cause the color to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be: 

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,87
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the examples provided. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the term ""blue"" is included in the corresponding output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the given outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each appearance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in isolation or within a sequence of other words.
Based on the examples provided, the word 'wif' correlates with the color 'red' whenever it appears. In every example, the presence of the word 'wif' in the input results in the word 'red' appearing in the corresponding position in the output. 

Additionally, the examples suggest a consistent mapping from other words to colors:

- 'lug' maps to 'blue'
- 'dax' maps to 'green'
- 'zup' maps to 'yellow'
- 'bluf' maps to 'red' (since 'wif bluf' leads to 'red red')
- 'walm' seems to map to 'blue' (since 'zup lug walm wif dax' leads to 'yellow blue blue blue red green')

Therefore, the rule behind the nonce word 'wif' is that it maps to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be the following:

zup -> repetition of the previous color word.

Rule:
- When ""zup"" follows another color-label word (e.g., ""wif"" for red, ""dax"" for green, ""bluf"" for blue), it causes the previous color word to be repeated in the output.
- If ""zup"" appears at the beginning of the input or as a standalone input, it defaults to the color yellow in the output.
- The number of times ""zup"" appears determines the number of repetitions of the previous color word. If ""zup"" is the first word or stands alone, yellow is output once for each occurrence of ""zup"".
Based on the given examples where the output is a sequence of colors, it seems that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. Also, the word 'bluf' appears to result in a different color based on the context of its appearance among other words. To determine the rule governing the meaning of 'bluf', let's examine each instance where it occurs:

1. Example: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green

2. Example: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

3. Example: wif bluf
   Output: red red

4. Example: wif bluf
   Output: red red

5. Example: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

The 'bluf' term appears to consistently take on the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. In examples 3 and 4, 'bluf' follows 'wif' and the output color is 'red red'. In example 1, 'bluf' follows 'zup' and the output is 'yellow yellow'. In example 2, 'bluf' also follows 'lug', and the output is 'blue blue'. In example 5, 'bluf' follows 'dax', and the color is green which fits the rule that 'bluf' takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the immediately preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and the output in each example.

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
In this example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The word ""walm"" is followed with ""red red."" 

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Here, the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which gives us two more ""green"" outputs.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

This example is identical to the second one and provides the same color pattern.

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

This example is identical to the first one and provides the same color pattern. 

5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Here, we have more data. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" as well. ""Lug"" is a new word here, corresponding to ""blue.""

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" does not have a fixed color output but rather seems to be doubling the output of whatever the previously mentioned color word dictates. In the first and fourth examples, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" resulting in an additional ""red red.""  In the second and third examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" resulting in an additional ""green green.""

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" could be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word immediately before it.

Thus:

walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True,88
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue. Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by comparing the inputs and outputs.

Observing the outputs, we can postulate that each word in the input is translated into a color in the output. Thus, each unique word in the input has a corresponding unique color in the output.

Let's examine the use of the word ""dax"" and its resulting color across the examples:

1. Input: dax walm zup walm Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, we see ""dax"" translates to green. ""Walm"" also translates to green, as it repeats with the same color. ""Zup"" translates to yellow.

2. Input: lug dax Output: blue green
   - ""Dax"" is green again, corroborating the first example. ""Lug"" appears to translate to blue.

3. Input: dax zup wif Output: green yellow red
   - Once more, ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow (consistent with example 1), and ""wif"" is red.

4. Input: wif dax zup bluf Output: red green yellow yellow
   - ""Dax"" is green, aligning with prior instances. ""Wif"" starts the sequence with red as in example 3. The word ""bluf"" is also translated to yellow, which hasn't been linked to a color before, but since ""zup"" precedes it and is yellow, the last yellow in the output corresponds to ""bluf.""

5. Input: dax lug zup dax Output: green blue yellow green
    - ""Dax"" starts and ends the sequence with green, ""lug"" is in the middle with blue, and ""zup"" is yellow. The appearance of ""dax"" in different positions and consistently yielding green strengthens the rule.

Based on this analysis across all examples, we can consistently see that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. There is a pattern between the input nonce words and the output colors:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color ""yellow""

Regardless of the other words in the sequence, ""wif"" always results in the color ""red"". Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is consistent and does not depend on context within the given examples.

Rule: wif -> red
Given the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow."" There are no conditions provided within the examples that indicate ""zup"" changes meaning based on context; it always corresponds to the same color regardless of its position in the input string or the words around it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to repeating the color that is related to the word that immediately precedes it. Here is how the rule applies in each example:

- In the first example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" repeats the color red.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"". ""Wif"" is ""red"", and ""bluf"" repeats it. ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats the color green twice.
- In the third example, ""dax bluf zup"" results in ""green green yellow"". ""Dax"" is related to ""green"", and ""bluf"" repeats the green color. ""Zup"" changes the sequence to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue red green green red blue"". Here ""dax"" is ""green"" and followed by ""bluf"" which repeats the green color. ""Wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", both appearing unchanged on either end of the sequence.
- In the fifth example, ""dax bluf lug wif"" gives us ""green green blue red"". ""Dax"" corresponds to green, with ""bluf"" again repeating the green color. ""Lug"" then changes the sequence to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" produces an output that is identical in color to the output of the word that immediately follows ""walm"". 

Here is the breakdown of each example:

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug"", the output is ""green green green yellow blue"". Just before ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""green"".
- In the second example, ""zup walm lug"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue"", and similarly ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""zup walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif lug walm"", the output is ""red blue blue blue"", and ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", the output is ""blue blue blue red blue blue"". ""walm"" is in-between ""lug"" and ""wif"", where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and that is what ""walm"" corresponds to as well.

Rule: walm -> copies the color of the following word's output. If the following word's output is ""red,"" ""walm"" outputs ""red""; if it is ""blue,"" ""walm"" outputs ""blue"", and so on. If there is no word after ""walm,"" then the rule doesn't apply as there is nothing to copy.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word 'lug' translates to the color 'blue' in all provided examples.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for patterns and compare the input with the output in each example:

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue
- dax corresponds to green
- bluf corresponds to green
- wif corresponds to red
- lug corresponds to blue

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- dax corresponds to green
- wif corresponds to red

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red
- lug corresponds to blue
- dax corresponds to green
- bluf corresponds to green
- zup corresponds to yellow
- lug corresponds to blue (consistent with the first appearance of Lug)
- wif corresponds to red (consistent with the first appearance of wif)

Input: dax
Output: green
- dax corresponds to green

Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
- dax corresponds to green
- walm corresponds to green
- wif corresponds to red
- dax corresponds to green (consistent with previous appearances of dax)

By examining the input and output across different examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax corresponds to the color green. 

Therefore:
dax -> meaning. The meaning of dax is the color green.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following mappings for the words:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> red

In every instance, the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the word 'zup' in different contexts to deduce its meaning. We look for patterns before and after 'zup' and their corresponding outputs.

In the first example, when 'zup' precedes 'walm' and follows 'wif', the output for 'wif' is red and for 'walm' is yellow. When 'zup' appears twice, it corresponds to yellow both times.

In the second example, 'zup' appears at the beginning, followed by 'lug', and the output for 'lug' is blue; the output for 'zup' itself is yellow.

In the third and fourth examples, 'zup' is followed by 'wif', with outputs yellow and red respectively, consistent with prior examples.

In the fifth example, 'zup' follows 'dax' (green) and precedes 'wif' (red), and the output for 'zup' is once again yellow.

Given these observations, the examples do not indicate that 'zup' affects the color change of subsequent words, as its placement before another word does not seem to systematically alter that word's corresponding output. Furthermore, 'zup' always correlates to the same output regardless of its position.

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning: Each instance of the word 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position or the words that come before or after it in the sequence.
Rule: bluf -> green when the previous word was ""dax,"" blue when the previous word was ""lug,"" red when the previous word was ""wif,"" and yellow when the previous word was ""zup.""
walm -> meaning. Rule: walm means to repeat the color associated with the previous word.

For every instance of ""walm"", the color that corresponds to the previous word is repeated an additional two times. Here is the breakdown:

- ""zup walm"": ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so after ""walm"" there are two more instances of ""yellow"" making three ""yellow"" in a row.
- ""dax walm"": ""dax"" corresponds to green, so after ""walm"" there are two more instances of ""green"" making three ""green"" in a row.
- ""lug zup walm lug"": ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellow"". The final ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Therefore, the rule concerning the word walm is that it causes the color corresponding to the word before it to repeat two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Analyzing the examples provided:

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- ""wif"" translates to red, ""lug"" translates to blue.

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red
- ""lug"" is consistent with blue, ""walm"" with blue, and ""wif"" with red.

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
- ""lug"" translates to blue, ""zup"" translates to yellow.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- ""lug"" consistently translates to blue, ""bluf"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" to red.

Input: lug dax wif lug
Output: blue green red blue
- ""lug"" translates to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red.

With ""lug"" always translating to ""blue"" regardless of its position or neighboring words, we can conclude that the rule is lug -> blue.
Analyzing the provided examples, we can induce that every occurrence of the word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green"" in the output. To confirm this, we will look at the position of the word ""dax"" in each input example and its corresponding position in the output.

- Input: lug zup dax wif zup | Output: blue yellow green red yellow
- Input: zup dax | Output: yellow green
- Input: wif dax zup bluf | Output: red green yellow yellow
- Input: zup dax lug | Output: yellow green blue
- Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue

In all cases, ""dax"" is present in the input, and in the exact same position in the output, the word ""green"" is present, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" I will first map out the words to their corresponding colors in each example.

1. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow
2. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red
3. wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
4. wif dax -> red green
5. wif bluf dax -> red red green

From the above mappings, I can derive the following observations:
- Each instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- Other words such as ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""blue,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively. 
- The word ""wif"" does not seem to influence the color associated with the words that follow it.

Based on these observations, the deduced rule for the word ""wif"" is:
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" No matter its position in the input sequence or the context it's used in, ""zup"" correlates with the output ""yellow.""

Therefore, we induce that the rule for ""zup"" is as follows:

zup -> yellow. Meaning of ""zup"" is the color yellow. Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, the output includes ""yellow"" at the corresponding position.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means the color of the word that follows it. If ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence, it refers to the color of the first word in the sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.

- In ""lug bluf zup lug"", ""bluf"" means blue because ""zup"" follows ""bluf"" and ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, which is the color for ""bluf"" in this context.
- In ""wif dax bluf"", ""bluf"" means green because it is at the end, so it takes the color of ""wif"" which corresponds to red, which means ""bluf"" is green in this case.
- In ""wif zup bluf lug"", ""bluf"" means yellow because ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue which is the meaning of ""bluf"" in this context.
- In ""zup bluf dax lug"", ""bluf"" means green because ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- In ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"", ""bluf"" means red because ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and outputs to identify any consistencies. Let us analyze the examples given:

1. ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"": Here, ""lug"" seems to correlate with ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.
   
2. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" outputs ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"": ""dax"" gives ""green,"" ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" gives ""red."" ""Walm"" repeats the color of the immediate preceding word three times.

3. ""wif lug dax walm"" outputs ""red blue green green green"": The rule seems to hold as ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" from ""dax"" three times.

4. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"": Each word translates to a color, and ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue"" from ""lug"" three times.

5. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" outputs ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue"": Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats ""red"" three times and later follows ""lug"" and repeats ""blue"" three times.

Rule: ""Walm"" -> When ""walm"" follows another word, it repeats the color associated with that word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
dax -> meaning. Meaning: green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" is present in the output.
wif -> meaning. The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the input results in the output ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each individual word corresponds to a color in the output:

- ""walm"" -> yellow
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green

Given these mappings, the word ""zup"" seems to always correspond to yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
The examples provided suggest that ""bluf"" has a function rather than a direct one-to-one word meaning. Instead, it seems to indicate repetition of the colors associated with the previous words. I'll analyze each example to deduce the rule.

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Here, ""wif"" must mean ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes the color ""red"" to repeat once.
- In the second example, ""dax zup bluf"" becomes ""green yellow yellow."" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color before it once, which is ""yellow.""
- The third example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" corresponds to ""red red blue yellow."" Following the pattern, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" repeats the ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug bluf wif"" translates to ""green blue blue red."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" repeats the ""blue,"" and ""wif"" ends with ""red.""
- The final example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red red."" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""walm"" causes the ""blue"" to repeat, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" subsequently causes ""red"" to repeat once.

Based on the examples and analysis, here is the rule for ""bluf"":

bluf -> meaning: The rule for ""bluf"" is that it causes the color associated with the immediately previous word to be repeated once.

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color word that precedes it.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with a repeated color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Here is the deduced rule for each input and output pair:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color blue (associated with ""lug"") three times.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color red (associated with ""wif"") three times and the color yellow (associated with ""zup"") three times after their respective preceding words.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color blue (associated with ""lug"") three times.

4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color blue (associated with ""lug"") three times and, upon its second occurrence, again repeats the color blue (associated with ""lug"") three times.

5. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color blue (associated with ""lug"") three times after the second ""lug.""

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue blue blue green,red blue blue blue green,True,92
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, whenever the input includes the word ""lug,"" the output consistently contains ""blue."" This suggests that the word ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's first assign a color to each distinct word based on the Outputs provided:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> ?
- lug -> blue
- walm -> green

Now let's analyze the patterns:

- When ""dax"" is surrounded by ""wif"" (examples 1 and 5), the corresponding color for ""dax"" is green.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (examples 3 and 4), the color sequence is all green, including the position for ""dax"". 
- When ""dax"" follows ""lug"" (example 2), the color is green. 

From these observations, the pattern indicates that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, wif appears to correspond to the color red. Each time 'wif' is mentioned within an input, 'red' appears in the corresponding output. The other words in the examples (lug, zup, bluf) seem to correspond to other colors based on their position relative to 'wif'.

Here's the correlation observed in the provided data:

- ""lug wif lug"" maps to ""blue red blue,"" where 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'.
- ""wif"" on its own maps to ""red.""
- ""zup wif bluf zup"" maps to ""yellow red red yellow,"" where 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow' and 'bluf' corresponds to 'red'.
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" maps to ""red red red blue blue,"" where 'walm' has not been provided before, but based on this pattern could be inferred to correspond to 'red' since it is surrounded by 'red' in the output; 'lug' corresponds to 'blue' as seen before, and 'bluf' seems to potentially correspond to 'blue' here.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the presented examples, we can see a pattern that suggests each individual word corresponds to a color in the output. The word 'zup' appears in each example and consistently maps to 'yellow'. Other words, such as 'dax', 'bluf', and 'wif' map to 'green', 'yellow', and 'red', respectively. When 'zup' appears alone as an input, the output is only 'yellow', further supporting the idea that 'zup' directly translates to the color 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow
By analyzing the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to infer the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's examine each instance where ""bluf"" appears and its associated color in the output:

1. Example: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   
   Here ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and the output color associated with ""bluf"" is green, which is the same color that follows ""dax"".

2. Example: zup lug bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue red
   
   In this example, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"" and the output color for ""bluf"" is blue, which is the same color associated with ""lug"".

3. Example: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   
   Again ""bluf"" is after ""dax"" and the output color is green, which is the same as the output for ""dax"".

4. Example: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and once more the output color is green, aligning with ""dax""'s output color.

5. Example: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
   In this last example ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output color for ""bluf"" is red, which corresponds to the ""wif""'s color.

From these observations, we can imply that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" outputs a color that matches the color of the word right before it.

Thus, we can write:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with the preceding word.
Analyzing the given examples, let's observe the patterns:

1. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green

2. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

3. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Looking at the outputs adjacent to ""walm"" in each example, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output that follows ""walm"" to repeat the color that was output immediately before ""walm"". Based on these examples, the rule can be phrased as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> When ""walm"" is present in an input, the output color that directly follows ""walm"" repeats the color of the output that directly precedes ""walm"".

For example:
- In the first input, the color before ""walm"" is green, and the colors after ""walm"" are green and green.
- In the second input, the color before ""walm"" is yellow, so the color after ""walm"" is green (since ""dax"" outputs green), but ""walm"" itself leads to the repetition of the yellow color three times before the green.
- In the third and fourth input, the same rule applies where the repetition occurs, with ""walm"" leading to a repeated yellow in the fourth input before outputting the green for ""dax"".
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the red color before the green that follows for ""dax"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True,93
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever the word ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" appears with other words, it still translates to ""blue,"" and the presence of ""lug"" doesn't change the output for the other words.

It can be concluded that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it is used.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

The examples indicate that whenever the word ""dax"" is used, the corresponding output is ""green."" Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in each example related to ""wif"":

1. When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
2. Regardless of where ""wif"" is positioned or how many times it appears, it always corresponds to ""red.""

Now, looking at other words:

- ""walm"" and ""dax"" also yield ""red.""
- ""zup"" yields ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" yields ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" yields ""yellow.""

Since ""walm"" and ""dax"" yield the same output as ""wif,"" and assuming 'wif' is independent of its position in the input sequence, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> red.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let’s analyze the pattern from the examples given:

- When ""zup"" appears alone, it is translated to ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" appears with another word, it seems to correspond to the color ""yellow"" and the following word (if any) is translated into another color.

From the examples given:
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" translates to ""yellow.""

The pattern suggests that ""zup"" by itself or ""zup"" before another word translates to ""yellow,"" and the words following ""zup"" are translated into their respective colors, as observed from the input-output pairings.

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is followed by another word, it still means ""yellow,"" and the following word is translated to its respective color as per the pattern established by the examples.
Based on the provided examples, each word seems to correspond to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> red

Given this pattern, the word ""bluf"" should correspond to the colors that follow it in the output. Let's observe the instances where ""bluf"" appears and the colors that follow it:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
3. wif dax bluf -> red green green
4. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
5. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow

Considering these sequences, we can notice that ""bluf"" is followed by a repetition of the colors corresponding to the words immediately preceding ""bluf"". However, the number of repetitions differs across the examples. Here is the breakdown:

- In example 1, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", and ""yellow"" is repeated twice.
- In example 2, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", and ""red"" is repeated twice after the sequence.
- In example 3, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", and ""green"" is repeated twice.
- In example 4, it's more complex with multiple instances of ""wif"" and ""lug"" before ""bluf"". After ""bluf"", ""blue"" is not repeated as previously, which indicates that ""bluf"" might mirror the entire pattern before it.
- In example 5, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", and ""yellow"" is repeated twice.

The pattern is not completely consistent, and based on the provided data, the most consistent rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it refers to repeating the colors of the words preceding it.

This leads us to a potential rule: ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the sequence of colors just mentioned."" However, the irregularities in example 4 make it challenging to confirm this as a definitive rule.

Given the inconsistencies, an attempt to define ""bluf"" could be:

bluf -> meaning. Repeat the sequence of colors just mentioned or some variation thereof depending on additional context not provided in the examples. Rule: Repeat preceding colors.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the color that follows it in the sequence. The pattern seems to be that ""walm"" causes the next color word to repeat the number of times equivalent to the position of that color in the sequence (excluding ""walm""). To verify this, let's examine each example:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" appears before the last ""lug"" (blue). There are three instances of ""blue"" before ""walm"", hence ""lug"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" (blue), of which there is only one instance before ""walm,"" hence ""lug"" is repeated one more time after ""walm.""

3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" appears before the second ""wif"" (red). There is one ""red"" before ""walm,"" therefore ""wif"" is repeated once after ""walm.""

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Analysis: ""walm"" appears before ""wif"" (red). There are no previous instances of ""red,"" hence ""wif"" is not repeated after ""walm.""

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" appears before ""wif"" (red). There are two instances of ""red"" before ""walm,"" hence ""wif"" is repeated two times after ""walm.""

Based on the analysis, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the subsequent color word to repeat as many times as that color word has appeared before ""walm"" in the sequence.

The exception is when the color word has not appeared before at all, in which case it appears once (as usual in the sequence) following ""walm.""

Therefore:
walm -> causes the next color word to repeat a number of times equal to its prior occurrences in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the nonce word lug consistently translates to the color blue in the output. Every instance where lug appears in the input, the word blue appears in the corresponding position in the output. The pattern is straightforward without any deviations, irrespective of surrounding words or context.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, each occurrence of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the other words present, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. It does not depend on the context or its position within a sequence. No matter what other words it is combined with, 'wif' always translates to 'red'.

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples provided consistently show that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the output. Every occurrence of ""zup"" in the input leads to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" or the other words around it.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, consistent across all examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" might act as a rule for repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the input. Here are the inputs and outputs analyzed to identify the pattern:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with green, leading to a repetition of the color green.

2. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   Once again, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is associated with yellow, resulting in the color yellow being repeated.

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   ""Walm"" comes after the second ""wif,"" which translates to red, thus we see the color red repeating after ""walm.""

4. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green, and green is repeated after ""walm.""

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   As before, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" which leads to the repetition of green, the color associated with ""dax.""

Rule:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm.""

Hence, the rule associated with the word ""walm"" is: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word.

To deduce the meaning of 'dax', we should look at its corresponding outputs in the provided examples.

1. In the first example, 'dax' corresponds to 'green' both times it appears:

4. In the fourth example, 'dax' corresponds to 'green' yet again:

   Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue

5. In the fifth example, 'dax' corresponds to 'green' once more:

   Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In all the examples, 'dax' consistently corresponds to 'green', indicating that the meaning of 'dax' is the color 'green'.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red. The meaning is a specific word and does not change with context.

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, it is translated to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, a pattern can be observed that suggests the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Here is the breakdown of the translation from the input to the output, identifying the pattern for the nonce word ""zup"":

- In the first example, ""lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue yellow red,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""red"" again, ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup dax wif zup"" translates to ""blue yellow green red yellow,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and the second ""zup"" to ""yellow"" again.
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" (which previously corresponded to ""red"") also translates to ""yellow"" this time, which might be an inconsistency unless ""bluf"" is context-dependent or a mistake in the examples.

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Considering the pattern from the provided examples, we can deduce that:

zup -> yellow
lug -> blue
dax -> green
wif -> red

Every time the word ""bluf"" appears between any pair of words, it translates to the color that corresponds to the word that comes after ""bluf."" Thus:

In the first example, ""bluf lug zup"" results in ""blue yellow,"" with ""bluf"" taking the color of ""lug"" that comes after it, which is blue.
In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by the translation of ""yellow,"" but it seems that ""bluf"" will not repeat the color that immediately precedes it (""zup"" which translates to yellow), given that there is no output of ""yellow yellow"" in this case.
In the third example, ""bluf zup bluf"" results in ""blue yellow yellow,"" following the same rule of ""bluf"" adopting the color of the next word.
In the fourth example, ""bluf dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" once again showing ""bluf"" adopting the color of the following word, which is green associated with ""dax"".
In the fifth example, the pattern continues with ""bluf wif bluf"" translating to ""yellow red red.""

Putting all this information together, we can infer:

bluf -> The color corresponding to the word that immediately follows ""bluf"" in the sequence when it doesn't repeat the color immediately before it.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it, but it will not repeat the color of the word that precedes it. If ""bluf"" is preceded and followed by the same color-indicating word, it will take the color of the following word for the first instance and may not have a corresponding color output for subsequent instances when it repeats the previous color. However, the given examples are inconsistent with this rule. If we presume the last input ""zup bluf wif bluf"" should have output ""yellow blue red blue,"" the rule holds up. If ""yellow yellow red red"" is correct, then ""bluf"" may have an exception to its rule when followed by ""wif.""

Assuming that all the outputs provided are correct and that there are no errors, our derived rule may need to consider possible exceptions or additional conditions that are not fully clarified by the provided examples. However, given the information we have, the rule stated above is the closest we can get to a consistent pattern.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" serves as a repetition indicator for the color immediately preceding it. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to cause the previous color word to be repeated three times in the output. Here's a breakdown based on the examples:

- Example 1: ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which represents blue, and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- Example 2: ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which represents green, and the output is ""green green green.""
- Example 3: Here ""walm"" is used twice; both times the previously mentioned color is repeated three times in the output: first ""green green green,"" then ""red red red.""
- Example 4: ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which represents yellow, resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the output.
- Example 5: ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which represents green, and again the output is ""green green green.""

Rule:
walm -> Causes the previous color word to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red blue red yellow blue,red blue red yellow yellow,False,96
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples. Each time the word ""lug"" is mentioned, the output is ""blue"".
Through the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern related to the presence of the word ""dax"" and the output ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the respective output color is ""green."" No other word consistently matches this pattern. It can, therefore, be concluded that the word ""dax"" directly corresponds to the output color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word.

Rule: wif means red.
Based on the provided examples:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: lug dax zup wif
Output: blue green yellow red

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" corresponds directly to the word ""yellow"". There seems to be a direct mapping between each input word and a color in the output. Thus, the rule is:

Rule: zup means yellow. 

So, zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" always corresponds to the output ""yellow"" when following ""zup,"" and ""blue"" when following ""lug."" Also, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it still outputs ""blue."" There are no examples provided where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or stands alone without context; hence, it is not possible to deduce its meaning in those cases. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" when it is preceded by the word ""zup,"" and it means ""blue"" when it is preceded by the words ""lug"" or ""wif.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe patterns in the examples provided:

1. Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
3. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug | Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm | Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif | Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

It appears that the output is a repetition of the color word that precedes ""walm"" in the input. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the color mentioned directly before it to be repeated three times in the output. Here's the breakdown:

1. The word before ""walm"" is ""zup"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""; hence, ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
2. The word before ""walm"" is ""wif"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""; hence, ""red"" is repeated three times.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"", and therefore ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" again, resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"", and since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color indicated by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True,97
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in each example, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the given examples, one can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Analyzing the given examples, we can identify a pattern that connects the input to the output. Here's the pattern observed for each instance:

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   Observation: ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" which is translated into ""red,"" and ""lug"" on its own translates to ""blue.""

2. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red
   Observation: ""lug"" now comes before ""wif,"" indicating a change in order affects the output colors accordingly.

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Observation: The ""wif"" at the beginning gets translated to ""red."" The next two words, ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" yield ""yellow,"" ""lug"" becomes ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color ""blue"" for each occurrence.

4. Input: lug wif dax
   Output: blue red green
   Observation: ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is assigned ""green.""

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Observation: ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" turns into ""red"" and repeats as many times as it appears.

Taking all these observations into account:

**Rule:**
""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Thus:
wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: In every example, each occurrence of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input, the output consistently uses ""yellow"" where ""zup"" appears, indicating that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow."" Every occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output. It is also worth noting that the output does not seem to be dependent on the context or position of ""bluf"" within the sequence, as its translation to ""yellow"" is consistent regardless of the other words present or their order.

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" based on the examples provided, let’s look at each instance where the word walm appears and its corresponding output. 

1. Input: lug walm dax - Output: blue blue blue green
2. Input: wif walm lug bluf - Output: red red red blue blue
3. Input: dax walm - Output: green green green
4. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif - Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
5. Input: wif walm dax zup - Output: red red red green yellow

By analyzing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can see that the word following ""walm"" dictates the color that appears three times before ""walm's"" color appears once. Let us see what this word is in each input:

1. lug -> blue
2. wif -> red
3. dax -> green
4. wif -> red
5. wif -> red

Notice that when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color red is repeated three times. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color green is repeated three times. Therefore, we can conclude that the word ""walm"" causes the next word's corresponding output color to be repeated three times before producing its own output color.

As for the color output of ""walm"" itself, it is always the color associated with the next word in the sequence:

1. dax -> green
2. lug -> blue
3. (No word after ""walm,"" so it repeats green for ""dax."")
4. dax -> green
5. dax -> green

In conclusion, the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the next word's corresponding color to be output three times, followed by the color corresponding to the word that comes right after ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the last word or there's no word after ""walm"" in the sequence, it repeats the color for the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> output the following word's associated color three times, followed by the color associated with the next word. If ""walm"" is the last word, it repeats the color associated with the word that preceded it once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax
    ",Output: green yellow green,green yellow green,True,98
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" by examining the patterns between the input and the output.

From the first example:
Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Since ""lug"" is the last word in the input and ""blue"" is the last color in the output, it might suggest that ""lug"" means ""blue"".

Testing this with the second example:
Input: wif zup lug zup lug
Output: red yellow blue yellow blue

Here, ""lug"" still corresponds with ""blue"" in two instances, supporting our initial deduction.

In the third example:
Input: lug wif lug
Output: blue red blue

Again, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"" each time it occurs.

The fourth example:
Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

And once more, ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"".

Finally, the fifth example:
Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red

Here, ""lug"" is in the middle and corresponds with ""blue"".

All examples consistently point to the conclusion that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds with the output ""green"" consistently, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. 

Here is the induction based on the given examples:

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output.
- The other words in the inputs (""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"") correlate with different colors: ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" ""bluf"" with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""
- The presence of the word ""dax"" does not appear to change the output associated with the other words—it only adds its corresponding output ""green"" to the sequence.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" acts as a delimiter or a signal for a transition in the sequence of colors. Specifically, before ""wif"" appears, the colors follow a certain pattern. Once ""wif"" is present, the color sequence changes, and the significant observation is that after ""wif,"" the output color is consistently ""red,"" regardless of what word follows ""wif.""

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif walm,"" we have ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""green"" for ""walm"" before ""wif,"" and after ""wif,"" the color for ""walm"" changes to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""dax lug dax lug wif,"" the color pattern is ""green, blue, green, blue,"" and immediately after ""wif,"" the color becomes ""red.""
- The third example, ""zup dax lug wif dax,"" shows ""yellow, green, blue"" before ""wif,"" and once ""wif"" occurs, the color for ""dax"" changes from ""green"" to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is by itself, and the output is ""red.""
- The fifth example, ""wif bluf,"" when no other words precede ""wif,"" the color is ""red,"" and even with an additional word after ""wif,"" the color remains ""red.""

Given this consistent pattern, the rule for ""wif"" seems clear:

Rule: ""wif"" indicates that any subsequent outputs should be ""red,"" regardless of the word that follows. If ""wif"" is the only input, the output is ""red.""

wif -> meaning: wif marks the transition to ""red"" in the color sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.
Rule: bluf -> blue

From the examples given, we can see that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The word ""bluf"" appears in various positions and combinations, and in each case, ""red"" is added for ""wif,"" ""green"" for ""dax,"" and ""blue"" is added whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input. Since the only consistent result with ""bluf"" is an additional ""blue"" in the output, it suggests ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
From the given examples, we can infer that ""walm"" is a nonce word used to indicate repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Let's examine the examples:

1. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", so ""walm"" following ""lug"" causes repetition of ""blue.""

2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", so ""walm"" following ""wif"" causes repetition of ""red.""

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", so ""walm"" following ""dax"" repeats ""green.""

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Again, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", confirming the repetition of ""blue"" with ""walm.""

5. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", which supports the repetition rule.

Rule: ""walm"" -> repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm zup
    ",Output: blue blue blue yellow,blue blue blue yellow,True,99
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the consistent patterns in the examples provided:

- In Example 1, ""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue,"" while ""zup walm"" produced ""yellow yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""lug"" might be linked to the color ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes a triple repetition of whatever color it follows. 

- In Example 2, ""lug"" appears twice and each time it is followed by ""blue,"" regardless of the word that preceded it (""zup"" or ""bluf""). This supports the idea that ""lug"" might mean ""blue.""

- In Example 3, ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue,"" reaffirming the pattern that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and that ""walm"" causes repetition.

- In Example 4, ""lug"" is followed by different color words (""red"" and ""green""), none of which correspond to ""yellow,"" the color linked to ""zup."" This further supports ""lug"" being a unique color word, with the standing hypothesis being ""blue.""

- In Example 5, ""lug"" is consistently followed by ""blue,"" even when the sequence is ""lug bluf zup lug,"" which includes different nonce words, suggesting the meaning of ""lug"" is not context-dependent.

Considering all the examples, it is evident that ""lug"" causes the output ""blue"" consistently, regardless of the context or surrounding nonce words.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in its appearance and the associated outputs. By examining the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can try to identify a consistent rule.

1. In the first example, every time the word ""dax"" appears, it is followed by the color ""green"" in the output. This is also true for the second example where ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" So, every instance of ""dax"" correlates directly with ""green.""

2. In the third example, ""zup lug wif dax lug,"" the word ""dax"" is preceded by different words and followed by ""lug."" Here, ""dax"" still results in ""green.""

3. In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" is followed by a sequence of ""blue blue blue,"" but those blues correspond to ""lug"" and ""walm,"" so ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green.""

4. Lastly, in ""lug dax,"" ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green.""

Across all examples, regardless of the words that precede or follow ""dax,"" the output associated with ""dax"" is always ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the given input/output pairs to discern a pattern.

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Looking at the examples, it appears that ""wif"" is consistently translated into ""red"" in the output. Regardless of the position or the surrounding words, ""wif"" is associated with the word ""red."" From this pattern, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

zup -> yellow
Analyzing the input and the corresponding output, we can attempt to induce the rule that the word ""bluf"" represents. To do this, we look for patterns in the usage of ""bluf"" and the resulting colors in the output.

Looking at the second example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" which implies that ""bluf"" on its own translates to the color green. However, this clashes with the first example ""dax lug wif bluf,"" which outputs ""green blue red red."" Here, ""bluf"" results in the color red, not green.

We also notice that the occurrence of ""bluf"" in the output is not just a single color but rather a repetition of a color. Every time ""bluf"" is mentioned, two colors are given in the output. The repeated color always ends with red but the color before that changes.

Now, analyzing each usage of ""bluf"":
1. ""dax lug wif bluf"" results in ""green blue red red""
2. ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green""
3. ""zup bluf wif"" results in ""yellow yellow red""
4. ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red""
5. ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow green yellow green red red""

By examining these patterns, we can see that whenever ""bluf"" is used:
- The last color in the output is always red.
- The color before the last is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

So, ""bluf"" seems to act as a modifier that causes the preceding color to be repeated followed by the color red.

Based on the data, the inferred rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: When ""bluf"" is used in the input, it translates to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word, followed by the color red. If ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax,"" then the sequence is ""green green"" as seen in example 2. If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the pattern is ""color color red,"" where ""color"" is the color corresponding to the word that appears before ""wif."" If ""bluf"" is preceded by any other word/color combination, the first color in the output will be the same color that corresponds to that word, followed by red.
Observing the patterns in the given examples, the word 'walm' seems to correspond to a color that repeats the color which immediately precedes it. For example:

- In the first example, 'walm' follows 'zup,' resulting in 'yellow yellow.'
- In the second example, 'walm' follows 'lug,' resulting in 'blue blue.'
- In the third and fourth examples, 'walm' follows 'wif,' resulting in 'red red.'
- In the fifth example, 'walm' follows 'dax,' resulting in 'green green.'

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word immediately before 'walm'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug zup bluf wif bluf
    ",Output: red blue yellow yellow red red red red,red blue yellow yellow red red,False,100
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'lug' is consistently translated to 'blue' regardless of its position in the sentence or the other words surrounding it. Therefore, we can induce the rule that 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue'.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the input and corresponding output for each example to identify any patterns.

1. Input: lug dax
   Output: blue green
In this example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" to repeated ""red,"" and ""dax"" again to ""green.""

3. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
We see ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""walm"" to repeated ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

4. Input: zup wif dax
   Output: yellow red green
Again, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

5. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green
""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and the second ""dax"" remains ""green.""

From the examples, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of the context. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Examining the available examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently maps to the output ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Other words like ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" seem to correspond with ""green,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

Based on this analysis, the word ""wif"" in these inputs consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the outputs.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the exact same position in the output. Other words correlate with other colors (""dax"" with ""green"", ""wif"" with ""red"", ""lug"" with ""blue""), but the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's break down each given input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

2. Input: wif lug bluf
   Output: red blue blue

3. Input: zup lug bluf
   Output: yellow blue blue

4. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

Based on the outputs, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the colour associated with the word immediately preceding it. Looking at the examples:

- In the first and fifth examples, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats that as ""green.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" again repeats the ""blue.""
- In the third example, similar to the second example, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is positioned after ""zup,"" which is associated with ""yellow,"" and thus, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can establish the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the colour associated with the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, ""walm"" appears to correspond directly to repeating the color associated with the previous word three times. The colors associated with other nonce words are as follows:

- lug -> blue (as ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"")
- dax -> green (as ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"")
- wif -> red (as ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""; ""wif"" is followed by three ""red"")
- zup -> yellow (as ""zup lug walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue"")

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" requires you to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. Thus, we can articulate the rule as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the examples is consistently translated to ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" correlates with the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input is translated to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, it is translated to ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" results in repeating the color of the word that is immediately before it in the sequence. 

To illustrate:

- ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", and therefore ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"".

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"". ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", so ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"".

- ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow"". The ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which translates to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".

- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"".

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"". Even though ""dax walm"" isn't directly influenced by ""bluf"", it's worth noting that ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", and therefore ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" as well.

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that precedes it.
Based on the provided examples, walm appears to correspond to the repetition of the color word that precedes it.

Example 1: lug (blue) zup (yellow) walm (yellow) lug (blue)
The 'walm' repeated the color yellow that precedes it.

Example 2: lug (blue) wif (red) lug (blue) walm (blue) zup (yellow) walm (yellow) wif (red)
The first 'walm' repeated the color blue, the color of 'lug' that precedes it. The second 'walm' repeated the color yellow, which is the color of 'zup' that precedes it.

Example 3: dax (green) walm (green) zup (yellow)
The 'walm' repeated the color green, the color of 'dax' that precedes it.

Example 4: lug (blue) zup (yellow) walm (yellow) lug (blue)
The 'walm' repeated the color yellow, the same as in example 1.

Example 5: dax (lug) walm
The 'walm' repeated the color blue, the color of 'lug' that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> meaning. The meaning of 'walm' is to repeat the color of the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". The other words translate to different colors (“zup” to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red""), and they keep their meaning whether they are before or after ""lug"".

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. The context or position of the word ""dax"" within the input sequence does not seem to affect this correspondence. 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the following observations can be made regarding the correlation between the input and output:

- Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output.
- The standalone presence of ""wif"" in the input results in only ""red"" in the output.
- The presence of ""wif"" followed by another word potentially adds additional colors corresponding to the following words, e.g., ""wif zup"" leads to ""red yellow.""

These observations lead to the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Other words in the sequences may correspond to different colors, but ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze the provided examples and identify any consistent patterns. We'll examine each example to see how ""zup"" influences the output.

- In the first example, ""zup walm lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Walm"" must mean ""yellow yellow yellow"" since ""lug"" means ""blue"" according to the last example.
- In the second example, ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red."" We cannot directly deduce what ""wif"" stands for, but ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" again.
- The third example, ""zup walm,"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which further reinforces that ""walm"" means ""yellow yellow yellow"" and ""zup"" leads with ""yellow.""
- The fourth example, ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" results in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Since we've deduced ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" would correspond to ""green.""
- Finally, ""lug zup"" translates to ""blue yellow,"" which means that the positioning of ""zup"" does not affect its meaning since it corresponds to ""yellow"" whether it's in the beginning or end.

Considering all this, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""Zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to depend on the preceding word. Here is the observed pattern:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color that ""dax"" stands for (green). Thus, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""

- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color that ""wif"" stands for (red). Thus, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color that ""zup"" stands for (yellow). Thus, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow.""

- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color that ""lug"" stands for (blue). Thus, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf repeats the color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let’s examine the contexts in which it appears:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   
We see ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" but when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" we get multiple ""blue"" before another color follows, suggesting ""walm"" may amplify or repeat the preceding color.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
Here ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""green"" being repeated.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
Once again, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""blue"" is repeated.

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   
In this string, every time we see a color name followed by ""walm,"" the preceding color is repeated multiple times. ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" without repetition when not followed by ""walm.""

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Notice that ""walm"" is following ""zup"" and the output is repeated ""yellow."" The output of ""zup bluf"" is ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" does not have a direct translation in the output string, ""zup"" preceding ""walm"" leads to repeating ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can induce the rule that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug means blue.
Given the examples, we are trying to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by analyzing its placement and the corresponding outputs. Let's start by looking at each example:

1. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green

2. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue

3. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

4. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

5. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red

Looking at examples 1 and 5, ""dax"" appears in different positions. Example 5 suggests that ""dax"" can't simply translate to a static color because when ""dax"" comes after ""lug"", the output becomes blue, but when it comes before ""lug"", the output for ""lug"" is different (green).

Example 2 suggests that ""dax"" translates to green when it is the first word in the sequence, considering that both ""dax"" and ""walm"" translate to green.

In examples 3 and 4, ""dax"" follows the words ""wif"" and ""bluf"", and the corresponding outputs are red and red, but ""dax"" leads to green in both cases despite the distinct words preceding it.

From the evidence provided, one potential rule could be that ""dax"" translates to green independent of its position or the other words around it. However, this rule would not explain why ""dax lug"" leads to green blue, whereas ""lug"" in a different context (example 2, as the third word) is blue.

Let's test this rule by assuming ""dax"" is always green:
- Example 1: ""wif"" must then mean red, and ""zup"" would be yellow.
- Example 2: This holds, as dax walm lug translates to green green green blue, meaning ""walm"" also translates to green and ""lug"" to blue when it is the last word.
- Example 3: This still holds, as ""wif"" meaning red aligns with the first output, and ""bluf"" corresponds to green.
- Example 4: ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is still red even though it was green before (this contradicts our prior inference and is problematic for a static meaning for ""bluf""), but ""dax"" is still green.
- Example 5: ""lug"" here is blue, which is inconsistent with example 2's output if ""lug"" has a static meaning, but ""dax"" is still green as the first word, ""bluf"" switches to blue, and ""wif"" returns to red.

After considering the examples, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" translates to green, with the caveat that other words may not have a fixed color and instead change based on their position or the words around them. The significance of ""lug"" seems to change, perhaps taking the color blue when it is the last word in the sequence or is directly preceded by ""dax"". ""Bluf"" appears green or red, which suggests that its color might also depend on position or context.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently, regardless of its position in the sequence or the context provided by other words. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow"" in the Output. This can be confirmed, as every time ""zup"" appears in the Input, ""yellow"" is added to the corresponding position in the Output. There is no example that contradicts this finding.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" means the word that precedes it should be repeated. For instance, ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" and ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to cause the subsequent word's color to be repeated that number of times equivalent to the color's usual position in a color ordering (e.g., RGB color model, where Red is 1st, Green is 2nd, Blue is 3rd, etc.). To support this, let's analyze the examples:

Example 1:
Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: The word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which translates to yellow), and the output repeats ""yellow"" three times after ""zup."" Yellow might be considered the third color in some ordering (possibly after red and green).

Example 2:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Explanation: The word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which translates to red), and the output is red said three times. This implies that red could be the first color in the ordering.

Example 3:
Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
Explanation: Here ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and again yellow is repeated three times. ""Wif"" (red) at the end appears only once, confirming that ""walm"" does not affect words after it.

Example 4:
Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
Explanation: ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" (which translates to green), and the output is green said three times. Green being the second color in the ordering.

Example 5:
Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), causing yellow to be repeated three times.

Judging from these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" duplicates the color associated with the word that precedes it, with the number of repetitions being based on the presumed order of colors. The sequence of colors may be following the order red (1 repetition), green (2 repetitions), yellow (3 repetitions), but this rule doesn't account for blue (which should follow green in RGB order).

However, based on the examples given, it would be impossible to deduce the specific order intended without further information or examples. For now, with the limited dataset and pattern given, the best I can determine is the following:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated a number of times that corresponds with some kind of inherent order of the colors.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif bluf
    ",Output: green red red,green red red,True,104
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the given examples, ""dax"" seems to be a signal word that triggers a color sequence, always starting with ""green."" Following ""dax,"" each subsequent word appears to be associated with a specific color:

- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue""
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" and ""walm"" appear to be instructions to repeat the color that follows them a certain number of times. In the given context, ""wif"" is not directly followed by a color, but it seems to indicate a repetition of one instance of the color. ""walm"" consistently precedes a color word and causes that color to be repeated three times.

Thus, ""dax"" could mean ""start the sequence with green and then continue with the colors associated with each subsequent word, where 'wif' means repeat the following color once and 'walm' means repeat the following color three times.""

Rule:
- dax -> Start with green.
- Each word after ""dax"" corresponds to a color.
- ""wif"" -> Repeat the following color once.
- ""walm"" -> Repeat the following color three times.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, every time the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's examine each instance where it appears and identify any patterns:

- When ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""red yellow.""
- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
- When ""lug"" is surrounded by ""zup,"" the pair of ""zup lug"" results in ""yellow blue.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""zup lug zup,"" the output for ""zup dax"" is ""yellow green.""
- In the sequence ""zup lug zup lug wif,"" ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" and when ""wif"" follows the sequence ""zup lug zup lug,"" the output is ""red"" at the end after the sequence of ""yellow blue yellow blue.""

From these examples, it is apparent that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is included in the output sequence, either directly before or after the color associated with the following or preceding word.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that comes right before it. 

- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" makes it repeat, hence ""red red.""
- In ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" so ""bluf"" repeats it resulting in ""green green,"" and then we continue with ""red yellow red"" for ""wif zup wif.""
- For ""zup bluf wif bluf,"" we have ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" repeats it, and ""wif"" gives ""red,"" with another ""bluf"" that repeats ""red.""
- In ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" repeats it, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug bluf"" again repeats ""blue,"" finally ""zup"" gives ""yellow.""
- Lastly, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" because ""dax"" stands for ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats it.

The rule for bluf is: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine the patterns before and after ""walm"" in the input and compare them to the output.

In the first example, ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow"". ""Lug"" translates to blue and ""zup"" to yellow. What's interesting here is that instead of getting one instance of blue in the output, we have it appearing three times before a yellow appears.

In the second example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", which implies that after ""zup"", we have three instances of yellow.

In the third example, ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red"". ""Dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red. Here, ""walm"" seems to multiply the color red three times in the output.

In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" becomes ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". Each color appears once before ""walm"" and then the last color before ""walm"" (""lug"" which is blue) appears three times in the output after ""walm"".

In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red"". Here ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" which is green, and in the output, green appears three times.

From these examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" has the rule of repeating the last mentioned color three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,105
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can see that every time ""lug"" is used in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. Its position in the input does not appear to affect its corresponding position in the output since ""lug"" comes before ""dax"" and after ""zup"" but still translates to ""blue"" each time. Additionally, given that each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" it suggests that individual words are being directly translated to colors.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word (lug, wif, dax, zup, bluf, walm) corresponds to a color.

We can infer the following:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> green (seen in both the second and fifth examples)
- walm -> yellow (since ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" and we know the first four colors corresponding to the first four words)

Now, given these associations, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"":

""lug wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" (yellow) and follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in the output ""green.""

""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" indicating that ""dax"" is ""green"" because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Whenever ""dax"" appears in the other examples, it also corresponds to the output ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the same position in the output, regardless of the other words present. Thus, we can deduce that:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" means ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
Input: zup -> Output: yellow
Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
Input: lug zup lug -> Output: blue yellow blue
Input: zup -> Output: yellow

The consistent rule across all these examples is that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will analyze the patterns in which the output colors correspond to the input words. Here's the breakdown:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
2. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
3. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif -> Output: red red blue green red
4. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
5. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red

First, let's identify the color that each word seems to correspond with:
- ""dax"" corresponds with the color ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds with the color ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds with the color ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds with the color ""blue""

Given the above associations, let's look at when ""bluf"" is used:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might repeat the color of the word before it.
2. After ""wif bluf"" in the third and fifth examples, the color ""red"" is repeated. Again, this reinforces the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.
3. In the input where ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""yellow"" is repeated in the fourth example.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to be a rule that dictates that the output repeats the color corresponding to the word preceding ""walm"" three times. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" three times. When it follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" three times, and when it follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" three times. 

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by looking for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here is the analysis of the examples:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Rule observed: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

2. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   Rule observed: ""dax"" still corresponds to the color green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red.

3. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   Rule observed: ""dax"", ""lug"", and ""wif"" retain their meanings. ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as ""wif"", which is red.

4. Input: wif dax zup wif
   Output: red green yellow red
   Rule observed: ""wif"" still corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and a new word ""zup"" is introduced, corresponding to yellow.

5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   Rule observed: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and a new word ""walm"" seems to correspond to repeating the color listed just before it, which in this case is yellow.

From these examples, we can deduce:

Rule:
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""walm"" seems to repeat the color listed just prior to it.

This rule is made with the assumption there are no additional examples or contexts that could contribute to the meanings of these nonce words and that the pattern observed above holds consistently across any other use of these words.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

Input: wif lug → Output: red blue
- This indicates that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Input: dax lug wif walm → Output: green blue red red red
- This demonstrates that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and both ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red.""

Input: wif → Output: red
- This confirms that ""wif"" alone produces ""red.""

Input: wif dax → Output: red green
- This verifies that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: wif bluf dax → Output: red red green
- This shows that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" does not introduce a new color and likely corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" as confirmed earlier corresponds to ""green.""

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: bluf -> the color that precedes it. If no color precedes it, repeat the color last mentioned.

- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" lug corresponds to blue, and thus bluf takes the color blue that precedes it.
- In ""wif dax bluf,"" wif corresponds to red, and dax to green, with bluf coming after dax, it takes the color green.
- In ""zup bluf,"" zup corresponds to yellow, and since it's the only color, bluf repeats the color yellow.
- In ""wif zup bluf,"" wif corresponds to red, and zup to yellow, bluf follows zup and thus is yellow.
- In ""dax bluf wif,"" dax corresponds to green, thus bluf is green, which precedes wif that is red.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the input-output patterns:

- When ""zup walm"" is given, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" It seems that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color coded for ""zup,"" which is yellow, three times.
- When ""dax walm wif zup"" is given, the output is ""green green green red yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times before continuing with the pattern. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- When ""dax walm wif dax"" is given, the output is ""green green green red green."" The pattern is consistent with ""walm"" repeating the color for ""dax,"" which is green, three times.
- When ""zup wif walm"" is given, the output is ""yellow red red red."" The placement of ""walm"" at the end results in three repetitions of ""red,"" the color that corresponds to ""wif"".
- When ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" is given, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here again, ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of ""yellow,"" the color for ""zup,"" preceding the pattern for ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" followed by ""wif"" and ""bluf"" which correspond to ""red red.""

Based on these patterns, ""walm"" appears to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,107
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue regardless of the context in which it appears.
dax -> meaning. From the given examples, it is clear that each time ""dax"" is presented in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"".

Rule: The word ""dax"" means ""green"".
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following associations:

1. Input ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" is followed by another word, a second color appears in the output, suggesting that the second word determines the second color.
3. ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" leads to ""red,"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green.""

Now, considering the constant element in all inputs is the presence of the word ""wif,"" and it always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" If ""wif"" is followed by another noun, it will produce a second color based on that noun. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore:

wif -> red
lug (when following wif) -> blue
bluf (when following wif) -> red
dax (when following wif) -> green

In summary, the rule is that ""wif"" signifies the color red and any word following ""wif"" will correspond to a specific color. This nonce word acts as a color indicator, with red being its default representation.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". When ""zup"" is present in an input by itself, the output is solely ""yellow"". When combined with other words, such as ""wif"" or ""walm"", the output includes ""yellow"" in addition to other colors that correspond to those words. Thus:

zup -> meaning. The meaning of ""zup"" is the color ""yellow.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" should appear in the output at the corresponding position for ""zup"".
bluf -> reduplicates the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When bluf appears in a sequence, it takes on the color value of the word that comes directly before it and outputs that color value again.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's how that rule applies to each example:

- ""lug walm"": ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" means that ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""zup dax walm zup wif"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeated three times, flanked by ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""
- ""wif walm"": ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" yields ""red"" repeated three times.
- ""wif zup walm dax zup"": ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" means ""yellow"" is repeated three times, followed by ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" once more for the final ""zup.""
- ""lug walm dax"": ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and hence ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times, followed by ""green"" for ""dax.""

The rule for ""walm"" therefore seems to be: Repeat the color associated with the word before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True,108
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""blue."" Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" from the given examples, let's closely examine the input-output pairs:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green.""

2. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   - The presence of ""zup"" results in ""yellow."" When ""dax"" follows, the output is ""green.""

3. Input: dax lug dax lug wif
   Output: green blue green blue red
   - The pattern here shows that ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

4. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" seems to result in ""green"" as well, indicating that ""dax"" consistently means ""green.""

5. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" is translated to ""green"" once more, ""wif"" to ""red,"" and the addition of ""zup"" at the end translates to ""yellow.""

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that ""dax"" always translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" The association of ""wif"" to ""red"" does not appear to depend on the context of other words; its meaning remains constant regardless of position or surrounding words. Thus, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Regardless of the context or position in the sequence, whenever ""zup"" appears, it translates to ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning or rule of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correspondence between the input and output of each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Analysis: 'wif' maps to 'red', 'dax' maps to 'green', but 'walm' does not appear elsewhere to ascertain its meaning.

2. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red
   Analysis: 'lug' maps to 'blue', 'wif' maps to 'red'. Since 'bluf' is surrounded by 'wif' and outputs red, this doesn't give any additional information about 'bluf' apart from it also mapping to 'red' in this instance.

3. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Analysis: 'dax' maps to 'green', 'zup' maps to 'yellow'. Since 'bluf' appears after 'zup' and the output is yellow, this might suggest that 'bluf' repeats the color of the word before it.

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   Analysis: 'dax' maps to 'green', 'wif' maps to 'red', 'zup' maps to 'yellow'. The occurrence of 'bluf' after 'dax' corresponds with another 'green', supporting the hypothesis that 'bluf' repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

5. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   Analysis: 'wif' maps to 'red', 'dax' maps to 'green', and 'bluf' follows 'dax' with the output also being green. This continues to support the hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' takes the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: 'bluf' repeats the color of the preceding word.
From the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" correlates to multiple repeating outputs, specifically of the color that precedes it. Let's examine each example to deduce the rule:

1. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it is followed by ""walm"" which results in three ""yellow"" outputs in a row.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and it is followed by ""walm"" which results in three ""red"" outputs in a row.

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" followed by ""walm"" which results in three ""red"" outputs in a row.

4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   Both instances of ""wif walm"" result in three ""red"" outputs in a row, maintaining consistency with the previously observed pattern.

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it is followed by ""walm"" which results in three ""yellow"" outputs in a row.

Based on the observed pattern in the examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the output to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it three times. Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True,109
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, lug consistently translates to the color blue.

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems consistently to correspond to the color ""green."" Each instance where ""dax"" is used in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position of the output. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the color 'red'.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will analyze each input and its corresponding output, focusing on the consistent patterns that emerge around the use of the word ""bluf.""

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", and the output is ""red red"". This might suggest that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   Output: green green red yellow blue
   - In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" but the output following ""bluf"" is ""green green,"" it reinforces the concept that ""bluf"" might cause repetition, as ""green"" is repeated here.

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - The word ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""wif."" Both ""yellow"" and ""red"" are repeated in the output, and since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" this supports the idea that ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat.

4. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   - In this example, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax."" ""Green"" is the color associated with ""dax"" and is repeated once again in the output. The sequence ""bluf zup dax"" results in ""green yellow green,"" suggesting continuity in the rule of repetition.

5. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   - Here, ""bluf"" is following ""wif,"" and once again, there is a repetition of ""red"" in the output. The continuity of red following ""bluf"" further cements the repetition interpretation.

Putting together these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the word that precedes it to be repeated in the output sequence.

Therefore, the meaning is:
bluf -> causes the repetition of the color of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence. 

In each example, the word that follows ""walm"" is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm"". 

Example analysis:
1. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   (walm follows lug, which is blue, so walm is blue)

2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   (walm follows dax, which is green, so walm is green)

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   (walm follows wif, which is red, so walm is red)

4. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   (walm follows dax, which is green, so walm is green)

5. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   (walm follows lug, which is blue, so walm is blue)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,110
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue

Every occurrence of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output. When ""lug walm"" is given as an input, the output is ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may also mean ""blue,"" or that the repetition of ""lug"" in some form results in the repetition of ""blue"" in the output. However, there is not enough information provided about ""walm"" to determine its meaning. Based on the information given, we can only definitively conclude the meaning of ""lug.""
Given the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" refers to a color, but we also need to consider how it affects the following words. 

In the first two examples, we notice that ""dax"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""walm"", and in both cases, ""zup"" equates to yellow and ""walm"" equates to green. The colors that follow ""dax"" in both cases also adopt the color green, suggesting that ""dax"" might set a rule for following colors to be green.

However, in the third example, ""dax"" comes after ""bluf"", yet the output is still green, which does not change the color that follows.

The fourth example confirms that the presence of ""dax"" turns following colors into green because ""lug walm"" both turn out to be blue but are green after ""dax"".

Lastly, when ""dax"" stands alone, the output is green, which implies that the inherent color represented by ""dax"" is green.

The rule seems to be that ""dax"" represents the color green, and when used in a sequence before other words representing colors, it turns those following words into the color green until a sequence or input ends.

Rule: dax -> the color green.
When used in a sequence, it turns the following words representing colors into the color green until a new sequence starts or the input ends.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" I will analyze the patterns present in the examples you have provided.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- Here ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: wif
Output: red
- When ""wif"" is alone, the output is ""red,"" reinforcing our previous observation.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" once again corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
- In this sequence, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: dax lug dax lug wif
Output: green blue green blue red
- This example also supports the previous correspondences.

Given these observations, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

So, ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the given examples.
zup -> meaning. Meaning: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" repeats the color word that precedes it. For example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" which means ""bluf"" takes the meaning of the color word before it, resulting in a repetition of the color word.

Rule: Bluf repeats the preceding color word.
Given the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the output color words. To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the color patterns in the outputs relative to their inputs:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

4. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

From examples 1 and 2, ""dax walm"" consistently results in ""green green green,"" suggesting that the presence of ""dax"" preceding ""walm"" correlates with a green output. However, examples 3 to 5 show that introducing other words before ""walm"" changes the output colors.

In example 3, ""wif"" before ""walm"" results in an output of ""green red red red,"" where only the first color is green, and the rest are red.

Example 4 further suggests that the word ""walm"" alone does not determine the output color but its combination with other words prior to it does. The word ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" and the output is all red except for the last word, which is yellow.

Finally, example 5 has the word ""zup"" before and after ""walm,"" with other words in between. It leads to an output where ""zup"" correlates with yellow, except when followed by ""walm,"" where it results in two yellows and a blue for ""bluf,"" which follows the pattern where ""walm"" affects the output colors of the words that come before it.

Based on the outputs, ""walm"" seems to function as a rule that transforms the preceding words into a color pattern. However, without an explicit rule regarding how ""walm"" translates into those specific colors for each input word, the best we can deduce is:

Rule: ""walm"" changes the output colors of words that come before it, with the specific pattern depending on the combination of the preceding words and possibly their position relative to ""walm."" The consistent factor is that ""walm"" does not correspond to a single color but affects the patterning of the color output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif bluf zup lug wif
    ",Output: red red yellow blue red,red red yellow blue red,True,111
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Examining the examples provided, let us identify the pattern between the input and the output to deduce the meaning of ""dax"".

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

In this instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: zup lug zup dax
Output: yellow blue yellow green

Here, we see ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" at the end of the sequence. So far, ""dax"" has consistently been associated with the color ""green.""

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

Once more, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and in between them, ""dax"" is ""green.""

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

In the absence of other words, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: zup dax lug wif dax
Output: yellow green blue red green

Here we have a longer sequence, but the pattern remains consistent with ""zup"" for ""yellow,"" ""lug"" for ""blue,"" ""wif"" for ""red,"" and ""dax"" for ""green.""

Therefore, based on the input-output examples provided and the consistency of color association, we can induce that:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" when translated from the input to the output.
Based on the examples provided, a pattern emerges where ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This can be observed in the following mappings:

- ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow""
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue""
- ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green""
- ""bluf"" seems to be a repetition of the previous color or possibly corresponds to the color ""blue"" explicitly, but appears redundant when following ""lug.""

In each example, ""wif"" is followed or preceded by colors, and the output consistently includes ""red"" each time ""wif"" is mentioned. The word ""wif"" does not seem to affect the color mapping of the other words; it only contributes its own mapping to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Reviewing the given examples, it seems the word ""zup"" relates directly to the output color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position of the output.

Input: dax bluf zup | Output: green green yellow  
Input: lug dax zup wif | Output: blue green yellow red  
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red  
Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow  
Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif | Output: yellow blue red green green red  

Based on these observations, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent regardless of context, and it translates directly to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze each example and output pair:

1. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   
   In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Given that ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of ""red"" before ""blue,"" it suggests ""bluf"" may mean ""red"" or echo the previous color.

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""bluf,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated. This again suggests that ""bluf"" could mean repeating the previous color.

3. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   
   In this sequence, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after it, ""bluf"" results in another ""green."" This reinforcement suggests ""bluf"" continues to mean repeating the previous color since ""green"" is repeated.

4. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow
   
   Again, following ""bluf,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated, which aligns with the pattern we've been observing.

5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   
   ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" results in another ""red.""

From these examples, we can deduce that the definition of ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> means repeat the previous color.
From the examples provided, we can induce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" based on the output colors associated with it:

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
(Associating ""lug"" with blue, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""dax"" with green, but there are three greens at the end suggesting ""walm"" also means green)

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
(""wif"" seems to be associated with red, and ""dax"" with green, but ""walm"" here is between two reds and doesn't change the output color to green immediately, suggesting it inherits its color from the preceding word)

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
(Again, ""dax"" is green and ""zup"" is yellow; ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is green)

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red
(""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""wif"" with red. ""walm"" here follows ""lug"" and the output is blue until ""wif"" changes it to red)

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
(""dax"" is associated with green and ""walm"" follows it with an output of green)

Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" doesn't have a fixed color associated with it but instead takes on the color of the word preceding it.

Rule:
walm -> ""walm"" takes on the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If there is no word before ""walm"" to set a color, the default or implied color is green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup lug dax bluf
    ",Output: blue green yellow blue green green,blue green yellow blue green green,True,112
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"". This is clear because every Output containing ""lug"" always includes ""blue,"" regardless of the other words present in the Input. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the word ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence of nonce words or the other words present.

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently means ""green.""
wif -> meaning. Rule: wif translates to the color red. The position of wif in the input sentence determines the position of red in the output sequence. If wif comes first, then red comes first; if wif comes second, red comes second, following the pattern established by the color associated with the other word in the sequence. For example, zup is associated with yellow.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. When ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included in the output at the position corresponding to where ""zup"" appeared in the input.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the given examples and match the words to the patterns in the outputs:

Example 1: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
Analysis:
- ""lug"" matches with ""blue""
- ""wif"" matches with ""red""
- ""walm"" is not explicitly paired with a color in the output, but we can infer its pair based on its position and the following pattern.

Example 2: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
Analysis:
- ""wif"" matches with ""red""
- ""dax"" matches with ""green""

Example 3: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue
Analysis:
- ""wif"" matches with ""red""
- ""dax"" matches with ""green""
- ""lug"" matches with ""blue""

Example 4: zup bluf wif
Output: yellow yellow red
Analysis:
- ""zup"" matches with ""yellow""
- ""wif"" matches with ""red""

Example 5: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red
Analysis:
- ""zup"" matches with ""yellow""
- ""lug"" matches with ""blue""
- ""wif"" matches with ""red""
- ""dax"" matches with ""green""

From these examples, we can determine that ""bluf"" is consistently mapped to ""red"". Additionally, in examples 1 and 5, where ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""wif,"" the output results in two reds in a row, indicating that ""bluf"" could potentially replicate the color immediately following it. However, this pattern does not hold in Example 4, where ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the result is ""yellow red"" instead of ""red red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" is not simply a replication mechanism.

Given all examples, the consistent relation is that ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red.
To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the given examples and look for patterns.

From the inputs and their respective outputs, we can observe that:

- ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue.""
- ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red.""
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue.""
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red.""
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red red.""

In each output, ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color that directly precedes it. Specifically:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" again follows a color word (""wif"") which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is ""red red red.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" resulting in the output ""red red red.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" leading to the output ""blue blue blue.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" resulting in the output ""blue blue blue.""

Based on these patterns, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes a repetition of the color word before it three times.

Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,113
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word 'dax' consistently maps to the color 'green' in every example where it is present.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green

This means that the nonce word 'dax' corresponds to the meaning 'green.'
Based on the given examples, here's the rule I've deduced:

- Each unique word, when first introduced, is associated with a specific color (e.g., ""dax"" with green, ""zup"" with yellow, ""bluf"" with green, ""lug"" with blue, ""walm"" with red).

- When the word ""wif"" appears, it is associated with the color red and indicates that previously introduced unique words will repeat their associated colors.

Following this rule:

1. ""dax zup dax zup wif"" leads to ""green yellow green yellow red"" because ""dax"" and ""zup"" are followed by their colors, and ""wif"" introduces red at the end.

2. ""dax bluf wif lug"" leads to ""green green red blue"" because both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" correlate with green, ""wif"" results in red, and ""lug"" is new and gets blue.

3. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" since ""wif"" starts with red, and each new instance of ""walm"" repeats the color red.

4. ""wif walm lug bluf"" leads to ""red red red blue blue."" ""Wif"" introduces red, ""walm"" repeats red, ""lug"" is blue as it was introduced earlier, and ""bluf"" repeats blue.

5. ""wif"" leads to ""red"" as it directly denotes the color red.

Thus, the rule is: 

Rule: wif -> red. Whenever ""wif"" appears, it is associated with the color red, and any repeated words that follow continue with their previously associated colors.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Other words also seem to correspond to specific colors: ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red. The word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color green.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word bluf means ""repeat the previous color output an additional two times."" 

Evidence:
- When the input is ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" results in repeating ""red"" two more times.
- In the input ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" the sequence ""red yellow yellow"" follows ""wif zup,"" with ""bluf"" causing ""yellow"" to be repeated two more times. ""lug"" and ""walm"" then correspond to ""blue blue blue,"" though ""bluf"" does not directly interact with these colors.
- For the input ""wif lug zup bluf,"" the output is ""red blue yellow yellow."" After ""wif lug zup"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow,"" ""bluf"" repeats the last mentioned color ""yellow"" two more times.
- The input ""zup dax bluf"" gives the output ""yellow green green,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" repeats ""green"" two more times.
- With input ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""green red green yellow yellow."" ""dax wif dax zup"" corresponds to ""green red green yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the last color ""yellow"" two more times. 

bluf -> Repeat the previous color output an additional two times.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine each input-output pair to see how the use of ""walm"" affects the output.

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". After ""walm"" is introduced, the previous color repeats except in the case where ""wif"" follows ""walm"", which translates to a sequence of ""yellow"".

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
- In this case, ""lug"" once again translates to ""blue"", and after ""walm"", the color blue repeats. This is followed by ""wif"" translating to ""red"". Again, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the previous color or an alteration when followed by ""wif"".

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"", yellow is repeated.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""Dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". After ""walm"", blue is repeated.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""Wif"" translates to ""red"", and after ""walm"", red is repeated. This is followed by ""dax"", which translates to ""green"", and then ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

From these examples, it can be concluded that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the previous color name unless that previous color name is ""wif"", in which case the output sequence changes to ""yellow"". 

Therefore, the rule seems to be: 
When ""walm"" follows any color word other than ""wif"", the same color word is repeated in the output. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it changes the sequence to ""yellow"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color in the output sequence unless the previous word is ""wif"", in which case output ""yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup lug
    ",Output: green yellow blue,green yellow blue,True,114
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" 

Here are the correlations drawn from the inputs and outputs:

- ""wif"" on its own results in ""red.""
- ""lug"" appears to correspond with the color ""blue."" 
- ""zup"" corresponds with the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green.""

Rule: wif -> red.
To figure out the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's first look for patterns in the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs. 

1. Input: zup lug dax - Output: yellow blue green
2. Input: lug zup wif zup - Output: blue yellow red yellow
3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf - Output: yellow red green red red
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif - Output: green green red yellow red
5. Input: zup lug walm - Output: yellow blue blue blue

Breaking down the inputs and outputs:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""yellow"" in the output corresponds with the position of ""zup"" in the input.
- No other word in the input consistently maps to ""yellow"" in the output, and ""yellow"" does not appear in the output in the absence of ""zup"" in the input.

Based on these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is the following:

Rule: zup maps directly to the color ""yellow.""
From the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to one of the colors mentioned in the output, but it's not immediately clear how ""bluf"" is related to a specific color because it results in different colors in the output each time. Let’s analyze the examples to deduce the rule.

- Example 1 (Input: zup bluf wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow red red) shows that the word ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup"" and is translated as ""yellow"" and when it follows ""wif"" it is translated as ""red"". 

- Example 2 (Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green) shows that ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green"".

- Example 3 (Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow) reinforces the rule noted in example 1 where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow"".

- Example 4 (Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf -> Output: blue red red green blue blue) shows ""bluf"" following ""wif"" results in ""red"" as seen before, and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" results in ""blue"".

- Example 5 (Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red) demonstrates ""bluf"" following ""dax"" results in ""green"" as seen before.

From these examples, we can deduce that the rule for the word ""bluf"" is as follows:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word that precedes it. Specifically, it has been shown to take the following correspondences:
- After ""zup,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"".
- After ""wif,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""red"".
- After ""lug,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""blue"".
- After ""dax,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""green"".

Therefore, we can summarize the rule for ""bluf"" as taking on the color of the word that precedes it in the examples provided.

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the word that precedes it.
To analyze the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns where it appears:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

We can see that the presence of ""walm"" in the input results in repetitions of colors in the output—specifically, repetitions of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" For example, in Input 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the output features ""red"" repeated three times, followed by ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax.""

From these observations, we can conclude that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. We haven't seen ""walm"" initiate a sequence or have a word follow it except for ""dax"" (which yields ""green""). Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it triggers the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,115
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples given, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"". So, in this context, dax -> green.

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" translates to ""red"". However, the position of ""wif"" relative to other words affects the other words' translations as well. The position of ""dax"" and ""lug"" before or after ""wif"" changes their outputs.

Here is a breakdown of the examples:
1. ""dax wif"" results in ""green red"".
2. ""wif dax"" results in ""red green"".
3. ""dax lug wif"" results in ""green blue red"".
4. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" results in ""blue red blue green green"".
5. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green"".

From these examples, it appears that the word directly preceding ""wif"" translates to ""green"" when followed by ""wif"", while ""wif"" itself translates to ""red"". Additionally, ""wif"" seems to influence the translation of the word directly after it -- ""lug wif"" yields ""red blue"" and ""wif dax"" yields ""red green"". However, ""dax"" before ""wif"" consistently translates to ""green"".

In the fourth example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" results in ""blue red blue green green"" which doesn't introduce any extra rule beyond what we've established for the individual translations and the effect of the position of ""wif"".

The fifth example, ""dax walm wif dax"", introduces ""walm"", which results in ""green"" when it comes before ""wif"", just like ""dax"", and ""wif"" is still ""red"". The second ""dax"" after ""wif"" is still ""green"".

From these observations, the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and the word directly preceding ""wif"" always translates to ""green"". The immediate word following ""wif"" takes on a color translation independent of ""wif"". 

Therefore:
wif -> ""red""
Based on the given examples, we can induce that the word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Here are the data points that contribute to this rule induction:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup - Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: zup lug bluf wif - Output: yellow blue blue red
3. Input: zup lug dax - Output: yellow blue green
4. Input: wif dax zup dax - Output: red green yellow green
5. Input: zup - Output: yellow

In each case where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the examples provided, we can induce a pattern between the nonce word ""bluf"" and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
2. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green
3. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
4. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue
5. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red

By analyzing each example and focusing on the word ""bluf"" and the corresponding output, it is clear that ""bluf"" is associated with the color blue.

Thus, the rule is: bluf -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs in each example and try to find a pattern.

In each case where ""walm"" appears, the output is a repetition of the word ""blue"". This suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to the repeated use of ""blue.""

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- When ""lug"" and ""walm"" are separated by another word (""lug walm lug wif""), ""blue"" appears three times before another color, indicating that ""walm"" might still relate to the triple ""blue"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" regardless of what other words are around (""wif lug walm"" or ""dax lug walm""), the output is still ""blue"" repeated thrice.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" in this context means repeating the word ""blue"" three times. Hence:

Rule: walm -> ""blue blue blue"" (repetition of the word ""blue"" three times).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,116
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" affects the color that follows it in the sequence. Based on the output, ""lug"" seems to repeat the color that comes immediately after it. Let's analyze the examples to confirm this:

1. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Since ""blue"" comes both at the beginning and the end after ""lug"", and ""yellow"" is repeated three times following ""zup walm lug"", it looks like ""lug"" repeats the color that follows it.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""Walm"" is immediately followed by a ""blue"", and since there are three ""blues"" in the output, it again seems that ""lug"" causes the following color to repeat.

3. Input: lug wif dax wif
   Output: blue red green red
   ""Wif"" is followed by a ""red"", and since ""lug"" is at the beginning, the ""blue"" is followed by ""red"". Considering ""lug"" causes repetition, there should be another ""red"" after the ""green"", which there is, suggesting ""lug"" repeats the following color.

4. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   ""Lug"" is at the end and the output after ""lug"" is ""blue"", which may imply that the output repeats the previous color, but because there's an example where ""lug"" is not at the end (""lug wif dax wif""), this suggestion does not hold consistently across all examples.

5. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   ""Lug"" is at the end, and the color that follows is ""blue"". In this case, no color follows in the input, but from the previous patterns, we know that ""lug"" repeats the color.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""lug"" -> when ""lug"" appears in a sequence, the output will replicate the color that immediately follows ""lug"" in the input. If ""lug"" is the last word in the sequence, the output will repeat the color that immediately precedes ""lug"".
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be as follows:

dax -> green

Whenever the input includes the word ""dax"", the output includes the color ""green"". The other words in the inputs correlate with different colors as follows:

zup -> yellow
lug -> blue
wif -> red
walm -> blue (since it follows 'lug' and the output is blue just as with ""lug"")
bluf -> red (since it follows 'dax' which is green and the output is red just as with ""wif"")

Rule: Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"". Other words correspond to other fixed colors.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following mappings:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red (as seen by the fact ""lug wif bluf"" outputs ""blue red red"")

In every instance, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" There is no example where ""wif"" corresponds to any color other than red, even when its position in the sequence changes. Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of the surrounding words. There does not appear to be a context-dependent rule influencing the meaning of ""zup""; it seems to be a direct mapping. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and output examples.

- Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
The output is ""green"" repeated three times.

- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
Here, ""green"" occurs once, followed by ""blue"" repeated three times.

- Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
This output is a single instance of ""blue,"" ""red,"" ""green,"" and then ""yellow"" repeated three times.

- Input: dax lug dax lug walm -> Output: green blue green blue blue blue
Each color in the output repeats once for each corresponding input word before ""walm,"" except the color immediately preceding ""walm,"" which is doubled.

- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
Here, ""red"" is repeated three times then followed by a single ""green"" and a single ""yellow,"" aligning with the position of ""dax"" and ""zup"" after ""walm.""

From these examples, the pattern emerges that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the colors corresponding to the words preceding ""walm"" in the input, where each color is repeated the same number of times as the total number of words before ""walm."" However, the last color stated before ""walm"" is doubled.

Rule: walm -> causes repetition of the output colors corresponding to each word preceding ""walm,"" repeated as many times as the number of words before ""walm"" minus one, with the last color doubled.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every example given. The other words in the examples (""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm"") correspond to different colors, and ""lug"" is the only word that always results in the output ""blue.""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we will compare the outputs associated with the input phrases containing ""dax.""

From the examples given:

- When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""
- Two instances of ""dax"" without other words in between result in ""green green.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow green.""
- When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red green.""
- ""dax"" alone with ""zup"" following it yields ""green yellow"" again.

From these patterns, it is observed that regardless of the word that precedes or follows ""dax,"" the output for ""dax"" is consistently ""green.""

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Based on the given examples, it appears that:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""bluf"" also correlates with ""blue""
- ""wif"" always correlates with ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence

Hence the rule appears to be that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words surrounding it. Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in the input and output examples provided. Let's break down each example and find a possible rule.

Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and when followed by ""bluf,"" the output is also ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif bluf | Output: blue red red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

Input: lug bluf dax bluf | Output: blue blue green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The ""bluf"" that follows replicates the ""blue."" Then ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which again replicates the ""green.""

Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" following ""dax"" gives us another ""green.""

Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
- This example is identical to the first one, where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" replicates that same color.

Rule:
From these examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it.

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Observing the patterns between the inputs and the corresponding outputs, it seems that 'walm' influences the color output based on the word that precedes it. Each word except 'walm' corresponds to a color:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> blue

When 'walm' appears, the output is a sequence of the same color, with the number of repetitions and color dependent on the word preceding 'walm':

- When 'zup' precedes 'walm', the output is 'yellow' repeated three times.
- When 'lug' precedes 'walm', the output is 'blue' repeated multiple times, with the number of times equivalent to the total number of 'lug' appearances + 1.
- When 'wif' precedes 'walm', the output is 'red' twice then 'blue' once.
- When 'dax' precedes 'walm', the output is 'green' repeated twice, and then one additional 'green' per any 'lug' that follows.

From the examples given, it appears that 'walm' requires a preceding word to determine its output, and if that word corresponds to a color, 'walm' outputs a sequence of that color.

Therefore, based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can infer this rule for 'walm':

walm -> meaning. 'Walm' outputs a series of colors, where the color and the number of repetitions are determined by the word immediately preceding 'walm' and possibly influenced by words following 'walm'. The specific rules seem contingent on the color-word associations and their positions relative to 'walm'. 

Rule: 'walm' results in a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes it, the amount and exact sequence can vary based on the preceding word and the context provided by any following words.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: The word ""lug"" signifies a single occurrence of the color ""blue"". Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, a ""blue"" is added to the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" maps directly to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. So, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Given the provided examples, we can deduce a rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

1. In the first example, ""wif"" alone translates to ""red"".
2. In the second example, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"", which may suggest that ""wif"" still means ""red"" and ""walm"" causes a repetition of the previous color.
3. In the third example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red"", which could imply that ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the previous color ""red"".
4. In the fourth example, ""dax lug wif lug"" translates to ""green blue red blue"". Here ""dax"" could be ""green"", ""lug"" might be ""blue"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and the second ""lug"" reiterated the ""blue"" from before.
5. In the fifth example, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"". Here ""zup"" seems to be ""yellow"" consistently, ""lug"" seems to be ""blue"", and ""bluf"" might be the repetition word as it caused ""blue"" to repeat. ""wif"" at the end translates single-handedly to ""red"".

Summarizing this information, the consistent pattern for ""wif"" is that it represents the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"".
Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever 'zup' appears, the output is 'yellow'.
- No other inputs, like 'lug', 'walm', 'dax', or 'wif', produce a 'yellow' in the output. 
- 'zup' appears to translate consistently to 'yellow' regardless of its position in the input sequence.
- Other words, when repeated, change their output color, for example, 'walm' goes from 'blue' to 'blue blue blue'; however, 'zup' remains 'yellow' even when repeated, as seen in the third example.

Rule: zup -> 'yellow'.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"" and how it is used in context:

1. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""
5. ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""

From these examples, we observe that the word following ""bluf"" is repeated in the output and that ""bluf"" triggers a repetition of the color that immediately follows it in the input. However, there is no following color in example 1 and 2; instead, the color that corresponds to the word before ""bluf"" is repeated. Thus, ""bluf"" seems to induce repetition of the last mentioned color.

Rule: ""Bluf"" causes the last mentioned color to be repeated in the output. If ""bluf"" is the last word, the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" is repeated once. If ""bluf"" is followed by another word representing a color, it makes that color repeat instead.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the previous non-walm word the same number of times as the position of that word in the sequence. Let's break down the examples to deduce this:

- Input: lug walm
  Output: blue blue blue
  Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to blue. ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which is the first word, so it is repeated once (totaling three times since ""lug"" is the first word).

- Input: wif dax lug walm
  Output: red green blue blue blue
  Rule: ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which is the third word, so blue is repeated three times.

- Input: dax walm wif walm zup
  Output: green green green red red red yellow
  Rule: The first occurrence of ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which is the first word, so green is repeated once. The second occurrence of ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which is the third word, so red is repeated three times.

- Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
  Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
  Rule: ""walm"" follows the second ""zup"", which is the fifth word, so yellow is repeated five times.

- Input: zup bluf wif walm
  Output: yellow yellow red red red
  Rule: ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which is the third word, so red is repeated three times.

Given this pattern, the rule induced for the word ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word as many times as the position of that word in the sequence. If ""walm"" follows a word that is the first in a sequence, that word's color is repeated once; if it is the second word, it is repeated twice; and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"". In each example, whenever ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Every time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" is stated once in the output. It also appears that ""walm"" could correspond to ""green"" as well since ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", implying a repetition determined by the number of nonce words used. However, since the rule for ""dax"" is specifically requested, the most straightforward rule we can deduce from the given data is:

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" by looking at the corresponding outputs. Let's examine the examples:

1. Input: dax lug wif lug
   Output: green blue red blue
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" appears to correspond to red.

2. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   In this case, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", corresponding to the sequence red green.

3. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   This repeats the pattern from the previous example, reinforcing the association of ""wif"" with red.

4. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds with green, ""lug"" with blue, ""zup"" with yellow. ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" but produces red. This suggests ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" corresponds to red when following ""wif"".

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   In this sequence, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""walm"" also corresponds to yellow. ""wif"" at the end corresponds to red again.

From these examples, we see that regardless of the position or the words around it, ""wif"" always results in ""red"" in the output, suggesting that ""wif"" translates to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" produces an output that matches the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Let's verify this by examining the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.
- In the second example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which means ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" yellow.
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" so here ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" again results in ""blue blue,"" supporting our previous observation.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" indicating ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax,"" which is green.

Considering all cases, the rule for ""bluf"" seems consistent:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color represented by the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the given examples.

- In the first input ""zup wif walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" in this case must be represented by the repeated ""red,"" since ""wif"" also gives ""red.""

- In the second input ""zup dax walm,"" the output is ""yellow green green green."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" appears to be ""green."" Again, ""walm"" is translated to a repetition of the color that precedes it (""green"" in this case).

- In the third input ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" the output is ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" The pattern holds: ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""walm"" after ""wif"" translates to repeated ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Finally, ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in repeated ""yellow.""

- In the fourth input ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red"" as before. Here ""bluf"" seems to give another ""yellow."" ""Walm"" again follows the color of the word before it, resulting in repeated ""red.""

- In the fifth input ""lug walm wif lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red blue."" ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" gives us ""red,"" and again ""walm"" follows the color of the word before it, resulting in repeated ""blue.""

From these examples, it can be determined that ""walm"" represents a rule: the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> repetition of the preceding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word dax corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that ""wif"" indicates a change in the sequence of colors that follows it. More specifically, ""wif"" seems to signal the repetition of the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word an additional number of times before proceeding with the next color sequence. Here's how the rule applies to the given examples:

- Example 1: ""zup wif zup dax"" yields ""yellow red yellow green"". ""Wif"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow), and the sequence repeats the color yellow once (""red"" corresponds to ""wif"") before moving on to ""dax"" which is green.

- Example 2: ""dax walm wif zup"" yields ""green green green red yellow"". The word prior to ""wif"" is ""walm"" (which corresponds to green). After ""wif"", we see green repeated twice more before moving on to ""zup"" which is yellow.

- Example 3: ""dax walm wif walm zup"" yields ""green green green red red red yellow"". Here, ""walm"" precedes ""wif"", so we repeat the color corresponding to ""walm"" (green) twice more, resulting in three greens in total before ""wif"", and then we have the red signifying ""wif"" and repeat red twice more for the following ""walm"", before concluding with yellow for ""zup"".

- Example 4: ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" yields ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""wif"" is at the start, and it correlates to red. The triple occurrence of red suggests that ""wif"" itself is given a color (red), and it repeats the color of the word following it (""walm"" which is yellow), before proceeding with ""lug"" (blue) and then ""zup"" and ""walm"" (yellow).

- Example 5: ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" yields ""yellow yellow red blue green"". Here ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" (which does not seem to have a corresponding color, but does not interrupt the sequence), and we see ""red"" for ""wif"", followed by the new color blue for ""lug"".

The rule appears to be that ""wif"" translates to the color red and its placement within the sequence means the color corresponding to the word immediately after ""wif"" is repeated the same number of times as the instances of ""wif"". However, since there is only one instance of ""wif"" in each example, the rule for ""wif"" causing repetition is based on the assumption that ""walm"" carries over with a repeat pattern influenced by ""wif"".

Rule: wif -> red (and repeats the color of the subsequent word an equal number of times to the instances of ""wif"").
zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
The examples show that ""bluf"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it:

- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"", meaning ""bluf"" repeats the color red which is associated with ""wif"".
- ""zup dax bluf"" gives ""yellow green green"", where ""bluf"" repeats the green that is associated with ""dax"".
- ""dax zup bluf"" results in ""green yellow yellow"", again ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word right before it, which is ""zup"" in this case, represented by yellow.
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"", directly repeating the color for ""dax"".
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" becomes ""green green red blue"", once again ""bluf"" duplicates the color of ""dax"" before moving on to the colors for ""wif"" and ""lug"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".
Based on the given examples, one can notice that ""walm"" consistently results in the color ""yellow"" appearing in the output each time ""walm"" appears in the input, regardless of its position or the other words around it. Additionally, each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input results in three ""yellow"" outputs, which suggests that ""walm"" is associated with a triplet of ""yellow.""

Here's the breakdown of each example supporting this:

- Input: wif walm dax zup
  Output: red red red green yellow
  (walm corresponds to three reds turning into yellows)

- Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
  Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
  (walm corresponds to blue turning yellow and another three yellows afterward)

- Input: lug walm zup
  Output: blue blue blue yellow
  (walm corresponds to three blues turning into one yellow)

- Input: zup lug walm
  Output: yellow blue blue blue
  (walm corresponds to the last three colors, all blue, being replaced by a single yellow)

- Input: dax walm zup
  Output: green green green yellow
  (walm corresponds to three greens turning into one yellow)

Hence, the rule seems to be:
Rule: walm -> converts the three previous colors into a single yellow. If there are fewer than three colors before it, convert whatever is present into one yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the output ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" also translates to ""green"" when it follows ""lug,"" and considering the second example, where ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green green green,"" it seems that ""walm"" by itself or following ""lug"" results in multiple ""green"" in the output.
- The word ""dax"" independently translates to ""green,"" just as in the last example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""dax"" by itself is green and does not necessarily affect the output of ""lug"" or ""walm"" following it.

So, based on the given examples, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" we can look at each pair of inputs and outputs and try to identify a pattern. Let's examine the given examples:

1. Input: dax zup wif zup
   Output: green yellow red yellow

2. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

3. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green

4. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

From these examples, we can make the following observations:

- Every instance where ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output starts with ""green.""
- The word following ""dax"" has its own associated color: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""green"" as well.
- The ordering of the words does not change the associated color, and the same pattern holds for all occurrences of that word. For example, both ""dax zup"" and ""zup dax"" have ""green"" followed by ""yellow.""
- The appearance of ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red,"" but it is not influenced by the position of ""dax.""

With these observations, we can reliably deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each instance. Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
Upon analyzing the examples, a pattern emerges where the word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. Each instance of ""wif"" produces the color ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.

Based on the examples:

- ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red"", implying that both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" represent the color ""red"".
- ""dax zup wif"" yields ""green yellow red"", where ""dax"" stands for ""green"", ""zup"" for ""yellow"", and ""wif"" for ""red"".
- ""zup walm lug wif"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""; here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""walm"" to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"".
- ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" yields ""green green red yellow red"". Each instance of ""wif"" has produced a ""red"" in the output, consistent with the previous examples.
- ""wif zup"" yields ""red yellow"", reinforcing that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" can be deduced by looking at the consistent output across different inputs:

- In every instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red.""
- The word ""bluf"" does not seem to modify the output of adjacent words; it consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" in the context of these examples seems to be as follows:

bluf -> meaning: red
Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the provided examples. Let's analyze each input/output pair.

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

To understand the rule, we should look for instances of ""walm"" in the input and what color it translates to in the output, with particular attention to the words that come before and after it. Let's observe:

- Whenever ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it becomes blue.
- Whenever ""walm"" is not preceded by ""lug,"" it becomes yellow.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" translates to blue if it is immediately preceded by ""lug,"" and translates to yellow if it is not.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" means blue when it follows ""lug"" and yellow otherwise.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can observe the correlation between the appearance of the nonce word ""lug"" and the color ""blue"" in the output. Regardless of the position of ""lug"" in the input and which words precede or follow it, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. This consistent one-to-one mapping across all the examples suggests that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red."" No matter the position of ""wif"" in the input string, ""red"" is always included in the corresponding output. Additionally, other words in the input like ""lug"" and ""dax"" correlate with their own colors as well: ""lug"" with blue and ""dax"" with green. However, the significance of the word ""bluf"" is not determined with just one example, although it appears to produce ""red"" in the given example.

Therefore, the rule I can induce is:
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in an input, ""red"" is a part of the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" mimics the color value of the word immediately preceding it. Here is the evidence for the rule:

- In the first example, ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" right after it also results in ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, it again yields ""yellow.""
- The third example is consistent with this, with ""zup"" leading to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" after it also translating to ""yellow.""
- The fourth example shows that when ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the result is ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" took the color value of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green,"" and accordingly, ""bluf"" produces a ""green"" as well.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Take the color of the word that comes immediately before it. If no word comes before it, the rule cannot be applied, as there is no example given for such a scenario.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and their corresponding outputs, focusing on the presence and position of ""walm"" in the input strings:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

In examples 1 and 2, ""wif walm"" generates the output ""red red red,"" implying that ""walm"" is related to the color red. Additionally, in example 3, ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red,"" which supports this conclusion because ""wif"" is consistent with the color red and ""zup"" with yellow; however, ""walm"" provides an additional red output.

In examples 4 and 5, whenever ""walm"" appears, it is followed by the color green. This suggests that ""walm"" not only relates to the color red but also causes the following color to be green.

Taking all this into consideration, the rule seems to be:

walm -> meaning. ""walm"" turns the following word into the color green. The word ""walm"" itself is represented by the color red.
Rule: If ""walm"" is present, color the word ""walm"" red and the word immediately following ""walm"" green, regardless of what that word is.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,123
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can see a pattern in which each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

dax -> green
zup -> yellow
lug -> blue
wif -> red

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems consistently associated with the output ""red."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words, the presence of ""wif"" always results in ""red"" being part of the output. The other words ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" must then correspond to the colors ""red,"" ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

Therefore, the rule appears to be a straightforward mapping from the nonce word to a specific color.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" translates to consecutive instances of ""yellow"". The exact number of ""yellow"" repetitions seems to be dictated by the count of words preceding ""zup"" within the same input series, up to that point. Each unique word before ""zup"" corresponds to one instance of ""yellow"" in the output.

Here are the rules inferred from the given examples:

1. Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
   Interpretation: ""zup"" translates to one ""yellow"" because it is the first word and there are no other words before it.

2. Input: wif zup lug -> Output: red yellow blue
   Interpretation: ""zup"" translates to one ""yellow"" because there is one word (""wif"") before it.

3. Input: zup wif lug wif -> Output: yellow red blue red
   Interpretation: ""zup"" translates to one ""yellow"" because it is the first word and there are no other words before it.

4. Input: lug walm zup walm -> Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   Interpretation: ""zup"" translates to three consecutive ""yellows"" because there are three unique words (""lug"", ""walm"", and ""zup"" itself) before it.

5. Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
   Interpretation: ""zup"" translates to two consecutive ""yellows"" because there are two unique words (""wif"", ""lug"", ""bluf"") before it. Note that ""bluf"" is not counted twice.

Therefore, the inferred rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be stated as:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to as many instances of the word ""yellow"" as there are unique words preceding it in the input, up to and including ""zup"".

Hence, zup -> consecutive instances of ""yellow"" based on the count of unique preceding words.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" when translated always results in a color that is identical to the preceding word’s translation. Here's the observed pattern:

- zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue (The word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" which is the same color associated with the word before it, ""zup."")
- zup dax bluf -> yellow green green (The word ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" which is the same color as the word before it, ""dax."")
- wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red (The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" which is the same color as the word before it, ""wif."")
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow (The word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" which is the same as the word before it, ""zup."")
- lug bluf -> blue blue (The word ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" which is the same as the word before it, ""lug."")

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. The translation of ""bluf"" is the same color as the translation of the word preceding it.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correlate with the repetition of the color word that appears directly before it. 

For instance, in the first input ""lug walm,"" the word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and the output is ""blue blue blue."" This indicates that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times.

This pattern holds true in all given examples:

- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to one red, one yellow, one blue, one green, two yellow, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the yellow color three times because ""zup"" means yellow.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" gives us one blue, one yellow, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the yellow color twice, and then we have another blue.
- ""wif lug walm"" translates to one red, one blue, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the blue color three times.
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" means one yellow, one blue, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the blue color three times, then one red followed by ""walm,"" which repeats the red color three times.

Based on these observations, it seems that the general rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the previous color word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the previous color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position within the sequence. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
wif -> meaning. In this context, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" can be articulated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" means the color ""yellow"".
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at each example where it appears and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

   In this case, ""bluf"" leads to the output ""green,"" the same color assigned to ""dax.""

2. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   
   Here, ""bluf"" results in the output ""red,"" which matches the color assigned to the word ""wif"" that precedes it.

3. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   
   ""Bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow,"" again matching the color of the word that precedes it, ""zup.""

4. Input: dax zup lug bluf
   Output: green yellow blue blue
   
   ""Bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" also matching the color assigned to ""lug"" that comes right before it.

5. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green

   Here, ""bluf"" aligns with the first ""red,"" which is the color of ""wif"" positioned before ""bluf.""

From these observations, we can deduce the general rule regarding the word ""bluf"":

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it in the list.

Therefore, ""bluf"" -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is that it is a placeholder for the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf is the color of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word's output color as many times as the number immediately following ""walm"" (when counting in base 1).

Explanation of rule application to examples:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. 
   - The word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" which outputs green. 
   - There is no number mentioned, so by default we repeat the previous color once.
   Output: green yellow green green green.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - First ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which outputs red, and it is repeated three times (since ""lug"" was the third word after ""walm"").
   - Second ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which outputs yellow, and it is repeated twice (since ""walm"" was the second word after the previous ""walm"").
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow.

3. Input: zup walm dax lug
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, but because there is only one instance of ""walm"", we repeat the previous color (yellow) twice (based on the position of ""lug"" being the second word after ""walm"").
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - There is only one word after ""walm,"" so we repeat the previous color (blue) once.
   Output: green blue blue blue.

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""bluf"" was not previously defined but does not affect our understanding of ""walm.""
   - Only one instance of ""walm"" after ""lug"" repeats the color blue as many times as there are words following ""walm"" (three times).
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can look for patterns to decipher the meaning of the nonce word ""lug.""

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red
Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green
Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue

Analyzing the first two examples:
- ""wif"" is immediately followed by ""lug,"" giving us ""red blue.""
- ""lug"" is immediately followed by ""zup,"" giving us ""blue yellow.""

In the third example, ""lug"" appears between ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" giving us ""blue blue red."" Since ""wif"" has consistently led to ""red"" being one of the output colors, we can deduce that it corresponds to ""red.""

Comparing the other instances:
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, there is a ""blue"" in the output.
- In Input 4, ""dax"" follows ""lug"" which results in an additional color ""green"" at the end, similar to how ""wif"" following ""lug"" added ""red.""
- In Input 5, ""walm,"" an unknown word, follows ""lug,"" and the output includes ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that each ""blue"" in the sequence might correspond with ""lug"" and an additional ""blue"" with ""walm.""

Considering the above examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output sequence regardless of its position or the surrounding words, while the surrounding words influence the other output colors.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each instance where it is used and the corresponding output:

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Following this, ""dax"" might correspond to ""green.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" is followed by three instances of the color ""blue"" which correspond to ""lug walm.""
- This suggests ""dax"" might have resulted in the first ""green.""
- It's not clear what ""lug"" or ""walm"" correspond to individually or if they together correspond to repeating ""blue.""

Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" seems to be followed by multiple instances of ""blue"" again.
- ""dax"" precedes multiple ""green,"" but this time there is no ""walm"" following it.

Input: lug zup dax lug dax
Output: blue yellow green blue green
- ""lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue"" at the beginning.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when immediately following ""zup,"" and it appears at the end following ""lug,"" resulting in ""green"" as well.
   
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" seems to correspond to a repeated ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" and ""walm"" are followed by repeating ""blue,"" with ""dax"" in between.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and it's followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

From these examples, it becomes clear that regardless of the other words, ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, wif can be associated with a color. In each case, ""wif"" precedes a color in the output:

1. The first ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to red, and the second ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to green.
2. In the second and third examples, ""wif"" is the last word and the corresponding color is red.
3. In the fourth example, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to red.
4. In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to red again.

In all examples, regardless of the position or context, wif corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word zup consistently translates to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should examine the outputs corresponding to different inputs while paying attention to the position and inclusion of ""bluf"" in the sequences.

From the given examples:

1. ""wif bluf"" produces ""red red""
2. ""zup wif bluf"" produces ""yellow red red""
3. ""lug bluf wif"" produces ""blue blue red""
4. ""zup dax bluf"" produces ""yellow green green""
5. ""wif bluf"" (again) produces ""red red""

To decode the pattern, let's analyze the transformation:

- When ""wif"" is present, whether it is before or after ""bluf,"" ""red"" appears in the output.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" These words seem to retain their color outputs regardless of the presence or position of ""bluf.""
- The first word in the input always seems to correspond to the first word in the output. There is a consistent color mapping for ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax.""
- The inclusion of ""bluf"" always results in the next word in the output sequence being a duplicate of the previous color word.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated in the output sequence.

Therefore, bluf -> The rule is the duplication of the preceding color word in the output sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word just before it, three times. Here is an analysis of the examples given:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"", which results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", as before.

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""zup"" before ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeating three times.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Same as the first example.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- ""wif"" is followed directly by ""walm"", hence ""red"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True,126
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is encountered in the input, the output will be ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the word ""wif"" appears to be consistent across all examples, as it always translates to the same output. The rule is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the examples given. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, ""zup"" consistently leads to the output ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll compare the input and output pairs, looking for patterns associated specifically with the occurrence of the word ""bluf.""

When ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output seems to include only one color, which is reduplicated according to its position after ""bluf."" Let's check this pattern across the provided examples:

1. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red green red red."" Here ""bluf"" follows two ""wif"" and produces two instances of red.

2. ""zup bluf"" matches ""yellow yellow."" In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and produces a duplication of yellow.

3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" produces ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and generates another yellow before proceeding with the sequence, maintaining the pattern of duplicating the color corresponding to the word directly before ""bluf.""

4. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" has an output of ""red green yellow red green green."" Again, ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word right before it, which is ""dax"" corresponding to green.

5. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue green green."" The replication is consistent with previous examples, duplicating the color for ""dax"" which is green.

Based upon this analysis, it appears that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color indicated by the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Causes the duplication of the color associated with the word directly preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look at the pattern in each of the examples provided:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Each color in the output corresponds to a word in the input. The words ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" all produce colors consistently: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

When ""walm"" appears in the input, the color that follows in the output is the same as the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm,"" and it repeats as many times as the word ""walm"" is used plus one additional time for the preceding word:
- After ""wif,"" ""red"" appears, and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
- After ""lug,"" ""blue"" appears, and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated.
- After ""zup,"" ""yellow"" appears, and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- After ""dax lug,"" ""green blue"" appears, and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times, which is one more than the number of times ""lug"" is said before ""walm.""
- After ""dax zup,"" ""green yellow"" appears, and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times, corresponding to ""zup"" before ""walm.""

From this pattern, we can deduce the general rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated sequentially in the output the same number of times as the word 'walm' is used, plus one additional time.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,127
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The meaning of ""lug"" in these examples is ""blue"".

Rule: When you see the word ""lug,"" it should be replaced with the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, every time the word ""dax"" is used, the output includes the word ""green."" Thus, the rule suggests that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Given the examples provided, we can analyze the outputs following each input to deduce the rule or meaning of the nonce word 'wif':

1. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

2. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red

3. Input: wif
   Output: red

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

5. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

By examining the inputs and corresponding outputs, we notice the following patterns:

- Whenever 'wif' is present alone or as the first word, the first color in the output is red.
- When 'wif' is followed by other words, 'red' appears in the output, followed by a sequence of other colors. The position of other colors doesn't directly correspond to 'wif', but to other words following it.
- Whenever 'wif' is followed by 'zup', 'yellow' occurs in the sequence after the occurrence of 'red'.
- The presence of 'wif' at the beginning of a sequence results in 'red' being the first color in the output each time.

From these observations, we can deduce that 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red' in the output. The other words in the sequence influence the subsequent colors in the output, but 'wif' consistently means 'red'.

Rule: wif -> red
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we look at the consistent presence of the word ""zup"" and its corresponding outputs in each example:

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
Input: zup wif zup -> Output: yellow red yellow
Input: zup dax zup wif -> Output: yellow green yellow red
Input: zup lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow blue yellow red green
Input: zup -> Output: yellow

In every instance where the word ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, it can be deduced that ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow"", irrespective of position or surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
By examining the sequences given and looking at the corresponding outputs, we can infer a rule for what ""bluf"" likely means. Here is the breakdown:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears after a word that has not been repeated, the output color is the same as the color corresponding to the word before it:
   - In ""lug bluf zup,"" ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and the following ""bluf"" also results in ""blue.""
   - In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and the following ""bluf"" also results in ""red.""

2. When ""bluf"" appears after a word that has been repeated in the sequence before it, the output is ""yellow"":
   - In ""wif zup bluf,"" ""wif"" and ""zup"" result in ""red yellow,"" and then ""bluf"" also results in ""yellow,"" likely because ""zup"" was repeated earlier in the overall sequence.
   - In ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" the sequence ""bluf wif"" results in ""green red,"" but the last ""wif"" results in ""red"" because it's being repeated.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to suggest that ""bluf"" outputs the color of the directly preceding unique word unless the preceding word is a repetition from earlier in the sequence, in which case ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> If the preceding word is unique (not repeated earlier), output the same color as the word before ""bluf"". If the preceding word has been repeated already, output ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the outputs in relation to the presence of ""walm"" in each input example.

1. In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to the color sequence ""green green green"" the first time it appears and ""blue blue blue"" the second time it appears. However, other words in the example also seem to correspond to specific colors: ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue.

2. The second example, ""lug walm,"" shows that ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""walm"" again corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""

3. In the third example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" to ""green green green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""lug"" to blue. The second ""dax walm"" is also outputting ""green green green.""

4. The fourth example, ""dax lug wif walm,"" follows the same color correspondence for ""dax"" (green), ""lug"" (blue), and ""wif"" (red). The ""walm"" at the end corresponds to ""red red red.""

5. The fifth example, ""dax walm zup walm,"" shows ""dax"" corresponding with green, ""walm"" with ""green green green,"" and ""zup"" with yellow. The second ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times. However, when ""walm"" is the first word, it defaults to green as shown in example 1.

Final deduction:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times; if ""walm"" is the first word, the color is green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,128
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, there is a consistent output every time the input includes the word ""lug,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Thus, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue

Meaning, whenever the word ""lug"" is encountered, it represents the color blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"". Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that ""dax"" means ""green"" in these examples.
Observing the examples given, it appears that ""wif"" correlates to the output of the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the color ""red"" is present in the output.

- In the first example, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" implying that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" Here ""wif"" correlates with the first ""red,"" ""walm"" and ""lug"" each with a subsequent ""red,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" relates to a second ""red,"" following the pattern of ""wif"" relating to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, only ""wif"" is present, and the output is solely ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" further supporting the pattern of ""wif"" relating to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the input and output pairs provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" each time it is used, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent and does not depend on context within these examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The color indicated by the nonce word ""bluf"" depends on the position of the word in the sequence. The nonce word ""bluf"" is replaced by the color that corresponds to its position based on the sequence: ""wif"" (red), ""dax"" (green), ""lug"" (blue), ""zup"" (yellow). When ""bluf"" appears in the same position as ""wif,"" it means red; when it appears in the same position as ""dax,"" it means green; when it appears in the same position as ""lug,"" it means blue; when it appears in the same position as ""zup,"" it means yellow.

Bluf -> Depending on its position, ""bluf"" translates as follows: if ""bluf"" is in the first position, it means red; if in the second position, it means green; if in the third position, it means blue; if in the fourth or higher, it means yellow.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Explanation:
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (green) three times.
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
- ""dax walm zup walm"" leads to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow,"" showing the repetition of the color associated with ""dax"" (green), followed by the repetition of the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow), each repeated three times.
- ""dax lug dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue green blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the last color word said before it, which is ""lug"" (blue), three times.
- The final example, ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow"" again, confirming the rule.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it. Thus:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided inputs and outputs, we can deduce the following patterns:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is produced in the output.
- Other words in the input correspond to other colors in the output, such as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- The word ""wif"" does not have a consistent color output before it, but after it, ""red"" is always produced.

Given this information, we can conclude the meaning of the word ""dax"":

dax -> green

Rule:
Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates to ""green"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's isolate the instances where it appears and what follows it each time:

1. lug bluf wif lug -> blue blue red blue
2. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
3. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
4. lug dax lug wif -> blue green blue red
5. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red

Now, let's look at the color immediately following ""wif"" in each example:

1. Red (followed by blue)
2. Red (followed by nothing)
3. Red (followed by red)
4. Red (followed by nothing)
5. Red (followed by nothing)

From these observations, it appears that ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red, regardless of the word that follows it or if any word follows it at all.

Rule: wif -> red

Each time ""wif"" is used in the input, the word ""red"" is used in the output.
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" Regardless of the words that come before or after it, ""zup"" remains the same. There are no examples that show ""zup"" changing meaning in different contexts.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at its context in the given examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   
2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   
3. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   
4. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
   
5. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green

From these examples, the presence of ""bluf"" does not result in any consistent color in the output. It seems to depend on the context, specifically the words that come before ""bluf."" Let's examine:

- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" (Ex: 1, 3, 4).
- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" (Ex: 2, 5).
- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" (Ex: 4, 5).

Hence, it seems that ""bluf"" acts as a sort of mirror to the word preceding it, taking on the color that corresponds to that word. This is evidenced by the repeated colors in the outputs whenever ""bluf"" follows a particular word.

Rule: bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's take a look at each example and the associated outputs:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

4. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red

5. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it, and the repetitions continue for three times.

For example:

1. ""dax"" corresponds to green, and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green red red red,"" where green is repeated three times before moving on to the next word, ""wif,"" which has the output of red.
2. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the color blue three times.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug bluf dax
    ",Output: blue blue green,blue blue green,True,130
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever the input is solely ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" is combined with another nonce word ""zup,"" as in ""lug zup lug,"" the output follows the pattern ""blue yellow blue,"" with ""lug"" consistently translating to blue and suggesting ""zup"" translates to yellow.
- In the input ""zup wif walm lug,"" the corresponding output is ""yellow red red red blue,"" wherein ""lug"" remains consistently blue, ""zup"" remains yellow, and ""wif"" and ""walm"" both produce an output of red, although there's not enough information to determine if there's a distinction between ""wif"" and ""walm"" or if they both simply translate to red in this context.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in the provided examples and their corresponding outputs. Let's look at each instance where ""dax"" is used and the color that follows it:

1. Input: ""dax walm wif"" | Output: ""green green green red""
2. Input: ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" | Output: ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
3. Input: ""zup dax zup wif"" | Output: ""yellow green yellow red""
4. Input: ""dax zup lug"" | Output: ""green yellow blue""
5. Input: ""dax wif"" | Output: ""green red""

Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" follows it in the output. There is no instance where ""dax"" is followed by a different color. It seems that ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green,"" regardless of its position relative to other words in the sequence. None of the other words (""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,” ""bluf,” ""lug"") consistently map to ""green"" across different examples.

Based on the examples given, we have sufficient evidence to deduce the rule for ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context or the surrounding words. Here is a breakdown of what each input word translates to in the outputs:

- ""wif"" always results in ""red.""
- ""zup"" and ""walm"" both translate to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" always translates to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" (like ""lug"").

Therefore, the rule I can deduce for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""zup"" appears consistently to be ""yellow."" 

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red."" In each example, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output includes the color ""red.""
Based on the examples given, the word ""walm"" correlates with an output of three instances of the color green when preceded by ""dax,"" but with red when it occurs in other contexts. 

Let's analyze each example:

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
Explanation: The non-walm words map to their own colors: ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""bluf"" to red. The word ""dax"" seems to modify the meaning of ""walm,"" leading to the repetition of green three times.

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
Explanation: Here, each instance of ""walm"" that is not preceded by ""dax"" corresponds to a sequence of red repeats. The other words each map to a color, but ""walm"" consistently generates multiple reds unless modified by ""dax"".

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Explanation: Again, ""walm"" involves repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
Explanation: ""walm"" after ""wif"" produces two additional reds.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Explanation: This is the same as a previous example and confirms the pattern.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning appears to be a repetition of the color red three times when it stands alone, but when paired with the preceding word ""dax,"" it yields three repetitions of the color green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,131
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the outputs, consistently appearing every time the word ""dax"" is presented in the input. Additional words in the input correspond to other colors (""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue""), but ""dax"" specifically corresponds to ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Each example that contains the word ""wif"" consistently includes ""red"" in the output, regardless of the other words present or their order. Here is how it breaks down:

- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" suggesting ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- ""wif dax zup"" translates to ""red green yellow,"" suggesting ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" suggesting ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" translates to ""blue red green green green yellow,"" suggesting ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" is likely modifying ""dax"" to repeat ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""wif zup"" again translates to ""red yellow,"" further confirming ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, zup seems to be a replacement for color words. To understand the rule, let's map each example:

1. wif zup -> red yellow
2. zup wif zup -> yellow red yellow
3. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
4. lug zup dax walm -> blue yellow green green green
5. zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue

Observations:

- wif always translates to red.
- zup corresponds to yellow when it precedes or follows wif.
- dax corresponds to green.
- lug corresponds to blue.
- walm corresponds to red when following wif, but it seems to repeat the color of the directly preceding word if it's not following wif.

From examples 3 and 4, we notice that zup takes the meaning of yellow outside the context of other color words that have been defined, such as wif, dax, and lug. When zup is paired with walm, as seen in example 5, it does not affect the color repetition pattern of walm.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's analyze each example and its output:

1. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   
In this example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   
In this example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
   
Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" but the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   
Again, ""bluf"" is ""red.""

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   
In the above example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Given these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when it is not preceded by ""zup."" When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is in the output instead. However, if ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" this relationship does not hold. It's possible that the context of the word following ""bluf"" could change its meaning, or that there is not enough consistency in the examples to derive a definitive rule.

Considering all the information, the following rule might govern the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" unless it is directly preceded by ""zup,"" in which case the output color is ""yellow.""

bluf -> ""red"" ('default'), ""yellow"" (if preceded by ""zup"")
To understand the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and outputs given in the examples. Let's analyze each instance where walm appears and its corresponding output.

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green

Now, let's look for patterns.

- The word ""walm"" correlates with a sequence of colors in the output, where the number of colors is one more than the number of words preceding ""walm"".
- The replicated color in the output seems to be the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"".

For instance:
- In example 1, ""walm"" is preceded by one word ""wif"", which outputs ""red"", and the additional color is ""green"".
- In example 2, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" and the sequence has three ""red"" colors, following the color of the word immediately before ""walm"", which is ""red"".
- In example 5, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" and the sequence following it is three greens, which is the color corresponding to ""dax"".

The output before ""walm"" follows the normal pattern as observed for inputs without ""walm"", assigning a specific color to each different word.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Outputs a sequence of the same color that corresponds to the word immediately before it, repeated one more time than the number of words before ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,132
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Using the given examples:

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Input: dax zup lug wif zup
Output: green yellow blue red yellow

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

The word 'lug' appears to consistently translate to the color 'blue'. Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input string or the other words present, the output always includes ""green"" at the position corresponding to where ""dax"" appears in the input. Additionally, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Here is the pattern observed:

Input: dax wif -> Output: green red -> ""dax"" appears first followed by ""wif.""
Input: dax -> Output: green -> Only ""dax"" is present.
Input: wif dax zup -> Output: red green yellow -> ""wif"" appears first, followed by ""dax,"" and then ""zup.""
Input: wif zup dax -> Output: red yellow green -> ""wif"" appears first, followed by ""zup,"" and then ""dax.""
Input: dax -> Output: green -> Only ""dax"" is present again.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red,"" irrespective of the other words it is combined with. Here's how it works out based on the input-output pairs given:

- ""lug wif"" becomes ""blue red.""
- ""lug wif lug"" becomes ""blue red blue.""
- ""dax lug wif walm"" becomes ""green blue red red red"" ('wif' results in one 'red' despite the number of 'walm's which also translate to 'red').
- ""zup wif zup"" becomes ""yellow red yellow.""
- ""wif"" on its own becomes ""red.""

Therefore, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color yellow each time it appears.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" seems to take on the meaning of the word that precedes it. If ""lug"" means ""blue,"" then ""lug bluf"" means ""blue blue."" Similarly, if ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" then ""zup bluf"" means ""yellow yellow,"" and if ""wif"" means ""red"", then ""wif bluf"" means ""red red."" Therefore, the rule is that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color word that comes before it.""

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and the output in the given examples.

- Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
  Output: red red green green red red red blue red
  Note: The word before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which is associated with ""red,"" but we also see ""walm lug"" which maps to ""red blue."" ""Lug"" is new and not previously mapped, so ""walm"" there does not help inform its meaning yet.

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  Note: ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and so does ""walm"" in this context, indicating ""walm"" could mean ""green,"" or at least takes on the value of the color preceding it.

- Input: zup walm wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow red
  Note: ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" takes on this color before the sequence switches to ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

- Input: zup walm wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow red
  Note: This repeat example confirms the pattern observed in the preceding instance.

- Input: dax walm zup
  Output: green green green yellow
  Note: We have ""dax"" (green), followed by ""walm"" (also green), and then ""zup"" (yellow). This implies that ""walm"" either has the color green or is repeating the color of the word before it.

Taking the context of these examples into account, the most consistent rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word before it. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> It takes on or repeats the color attribute of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,False,133
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that:

- When ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
- The appearance of ""dax"" seems to add a ""green"" for each occurrence in the input.
- Other words (""wif"", ""zup"", ""lug"", ""walm"") have consistent outputs associated with them too (red, yellow, blue, green respectively).
- ""dax"" does not seem to modify the meaning of other words around it; rather, it seems to contribute its own meaning independently.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it appears that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. The word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output, and ""walm"" results in three repetitions of ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule induction suggests:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When ""zup"" is encountered in the input, it is translated to the word ""yellow"" in the output. If other words are encountered, such as ""wif"" or ""walm"", they correspond to a color or a repetition pattern as observed in the examples. ""Wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""walm"" translates to ""yellow"" repeated three times.
Based on the examples provided, bluf seems to correspond to the color yellow. Each time the word bluf is used in the input, the output contains the color yellow in the same position. 

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions matches the number of times that word has occurred in the sequence before ""walm"". Let's examine the instances:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and since this is the first occurrence of ""zup"", ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated once (total appearances = 1).

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" correlates with green, and this is its first occurrence, so ""walm"" repeats ""green"" once (total appearances = 1).

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- The second ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""dax"" has appeared twice (2nd appearance), hence ""green"" is repeated twice.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" is in front of ""walm,"" and since this is its first occurrence, ""walm"" repeats ""red"" once (total appearances = 1).

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" which is on its second occurrence, therefore ""yellow"" is repeated twice for a total of three (""yellow"" occurrences before ""walm"" = 2).

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated. The number of repetitions is equal to the current total number of occurrences of that word in the sequence (including the one before ""walm"").

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word a number of times equal to the count of that word's occurrences in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,134
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: ""blue""

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Despite the presence of other words such as ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug,"" which correspond to other colors (""walm"" and ""wif"" both correspond to ""green"" when in conjunction with ""dax,"" but ""wif"" alone doesn't appear, so its individual meaning cannot be established; ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""), the appearance of ""dax"" always results in ""green"" being in the output. The ""zup"" term appears to correspond to ""yellow,"" given that it surrounds ""dax lug zup"" without affecting the color associated with ""dax"" (green) or ""lug"" (blue).
Based on the given examples, it is possible to infer the following conversion rule:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> green
- wif -> red

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
The examples indicate that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color output. By analyzing the instances where ""zup"" appears and the color output associated with its position, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"".

In the examples provided:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" (note: ""bluf"" appears twice and both times it corresponds to ""green"", which supports this association)
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

By isolating the instances of the word ""zup"" and looking at the color output in those positions, we can observe that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow
Analyzing the provided examples, we can try to understand the pattern and meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" in the context of the input and output relationships.

Input 1: wif bluf
Output 1: red red

Input 2: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output 2: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Input 3: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
Output 3: blue blue red blue blue yellow

Input 4: dax walm wif bluf
Output 4: green green green red red

Input 5: wif bluf dax walm
Output 5: red red green green green

By observing these examples, we can infer that each instance of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the output. Here's the reasoning based on given examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" immediately follows, causing the output to repeat ""red"".
- In the second and third examples, ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word just before it for as many times as the instances of 'lug' that follow sequentially. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and we see ""blue"" repeated multiple times depending on the number of ""lug"" that come after ""bluf"".
- In the fourth and fifth examples, we see that the words after ""bluf"" have their colors repeated exactly once, which matches with the meaning we've inferred for ""bluf"".

Therefore, based on the given examples, we can define the rule as follows:

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the output, the repetition count equals the number of times the word that translates to ""blue"" follows it sequentially. If there's no immediate repetition of ""blue"", repeat the previous color once.
walm -> green when preceded by dax, yellow when preceded by zup, blue when preceded by lug, and red when following wif regardless of the preceding word.

Rule: The word ""walm"" changes its meaning based on the word that precedes it. If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the meaning is ""green."" If ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the meaning is ""yellow."" If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the meaning is ""blue."" When ""walm"" directly follows ""wif,"" regardless of the preceding words, its meaning is ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the examples provided:

1. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   
2. Input: lug
   Output: blue
   
3. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   
4. Input: wif zup lug zup lug
   Output: red yellow blue yellow blue
   
5. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

Inspecting the outputs whenever ""lug"" appears, it consistently translates to ""blue"". No other context is changing this outcome. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look for a consistent pattern associated with ""dax"" in the given examples.

Looking at the first two examples where ""dax"" is used:

Input: zup wif dax walm lug 
Output: yellow red green green green blue

Input: zup dax wif 
Output: yellow green red

In both cases, the output corresponding to ""dax"" is ""green.""

By cross-referencing all instances of ""dax"":

Input: wif dax
Output: red green

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue

In every input, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. There does not appear to be any context-dependent rule based on the position of ""dax"" in the input, as it consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of the surrounding words.

From these observations, the rule is straightforward:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided input-output pairs, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""wif"" appears consistently with the output ""red.""

Here's the mapping from the provided examples:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Using these mappings, we can induce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> repeat the color of the previous word. If there is no previous word, output yellow. 

Rule: If ""zup"" is the first word or follows a word that was translated to a color, it outputs yellow. If ""zup"" follows a word that has been repeated, it outputs the color corresponding to that repeated word as many times as the word was repeated before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the patterns of correspondence between the input and the output.

In the first example:
- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by another ""yellow,"" which is what ""bluf"" must correspond to.

In the second example:
- Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and it is repeated both in the input and output, ""walm"" does not seem to appear in the output, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The final ""bluf"" once again corresponds to ""blue.""

In the third and fourth examples:
- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow
- Just like in the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by another ""yellow."" ""Dax"" is new, and corresponds to ""green,"" but ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""yellow.""

In the last example:
- Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow
- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" appears between a ""red"" and a ""blue"" in the output, it must correspond to ""red"" here.

In every example, the word ""bluf"" is placed after a word whose color we know. The output color for ""bluf"" is always the same as the color that comes before it. Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that comes immediately before it in the input sequence.
To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the examples given and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

5. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

From these examples, we can try to find a pattern that connects the input with the output.

If we look at the element that appears immediately before ""walm"" in the input and its corresponding color in the output, we notice something interesting:

1. In the first example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
2. In the second example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. In the third example, there are two occurrences:
   - ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"".
   - ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red"".
4. In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"".
5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green"".

Based on this analysis, it appears that ""walm"" means to repeat the color that corresponds to the word right before it, three times. In essence, ""walm"" replicates the color of the previous word thrice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,136
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
To deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine each instance where ""dax"" is used and the corresponding output:

1. ""dax walm wif dax"" gives ""green green green red green."" Here, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and at the end. Its first instance correlates with ""green,"" and its second instance correlates with ""green"" again, although there's a ""red"" before it that appears to relate to ""wif."" This suggests that ""dax"" may not be dependent on its position for its meaning.

2. ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green."" ""Dax"" is used once, and ""green"" appears three times which could mean that it is a repeating pattern and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" gives ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Dax"" occurs once and is followed by ""green."" The rest of the sentence contains words that match with different colors, but ""dax"" still means ""green.""

4. ""zup dax"" gives ""yellow green."" The word ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" with ""green"" again when it's the second word in the sequence, reinforcing that its meaning is independent of the position.

5. ""dax"" by itself gives ""green."" This further supports the consistency in the meaning of ""dax.""

From these examples, it is clear that regardless of its position in a sentence, ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green."" Hence, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", we can analyze each example to see what is consistent when ""wif"" appears. Here's what we get from the examples:

1. wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green
- ""wif"" appears twice: at the beginning and in the middle. Both instances of ""wif"" translate to ""red.""

2. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue
- Here ""wif"" is at the beginning and is translated as ""red.""

3. dax wif -> green red
- ""wif"" is in the second position after ""dax"" and is translated as ""red.""

4. wif -> red
- ""wif"" is the only word and translates to ""red.""

5. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
- ""wif"" is at the beginning and is translated as ""red.""

In all cases, irrespective of position or surrounding words, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" indicates a repetition of the color word that follows it until a new color word appears. Let's examine the evidence:

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red  
Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" (yellow), and ""yellow"" is repeated until ""lug"" (blue) appears.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red  
""zup"" precedes ""wif"" (red), and ""yellow"" is outputted before the expected ""red,"" indicating that ""zup"" may denote ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red  
Again, ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), and ""yellow"" precedes it; ""green"" is repeated until the second ""zup,"" which precedes ""wif"" (red), causing ""yellow"" to be outputted before ""red.""

Input: lug bluf zup lug
Output: blue blue yellow blue  
""Zup"" is placed before ""lug"" (blue), and ""yellow"" is outputted before another ""blue."" This suggests that ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red  
Here, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" (which might be assumed to mean yellow as well), and ""yellow"" appears twice before moving on to ""wif"" (red) which is repeated as expected when a new color word is presented.

Based on these observations, ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule would be:

Rule: ""zup"" indicates the color yellow that is repeated until a new color word is introduced. If a color word is not immediately after ""zup,"" then ""zup"" is simply translated to ""yellow.""

zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output. To deduce the specific color relationship, let's examine the input-output pairs in more detail:

- ""zup bluf wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red red red"".
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green green green red red"".
- ""lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue red"".
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"".
- ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red blue green"".

Looking carefully at each instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, it is consistently translated to ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: bluf -> red.
Analyzing the examples given, we can determine a pattern for the word 'walm' by looking at its position in the input sequence and the corresponding output sequence. We are trying to establish a rule that determines the meaning of 'walm' based on its context:

1. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - 'lug' translates to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red'. After 'walm', there are three 'red's.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - 'zup' translates to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red'. 'walm' is followed by three 'yellow's.

3. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Here 'walm' is at the end, and it is preceded by two 'yellow's, corresponding to the two 'zup's before it, with no regard for 'wif' and 'lug' that came in between.

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - 'walm' is followed by three 'yellow's corresponding to one 'zup' before it.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - 'walm' is followed by three 'yellow's corresponding to one 'zup' before it.

Based on these observations, it seems that the meaning of 'walm' is to repeat the color associated with 'zup' (yellow) three times. 'walm' takes the occurrence of the word 'zup' immediately before it and translates it into three repetitions of the equivalent color in the output.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with 'zup' (yellow) three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True,137
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue. Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> meaning. The meaning of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". 

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output always includes the color ""green"". The position of ""dax"" among other words does not change its associated color, but the order of words in the input does affect the order of colors in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

Example 1:
Input: wif
Output: red
Here, ""wif"" corresponds directly to ""red.""

Example 2:
Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
Here, ""wif"" results in a single ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of ""red"" two more times, suggesting that ""walm"" might mean to repeat the preceding color twice.

Example 3:
Input: zup dax wif zup
Output: yellow green red yellow
In this case, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and based on the previous rule, ""wif"" still means ""red."" The last ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow,"" indicating consistency in translation.

Example 4:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Here, ""wif"" remains ""red,"" and ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the color red once, implying that ""bluf"" might mean to repeat the preceding color once.

Example 5:
Input: wif zup lug zup lug
Output: red yellow blue yellow blue
In this string, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" following the pattern established from prior instances and maintaining their respective translations.

Rule:
wif -> red

Based on the evidence, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of context within the string.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's the pattern observed in each example:

- dax bluf -> green green (bluf took the color of dax)
- wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow (bluf took the color of wif)
- lug bluf dax bluf -> blue blue green green (first bluf took the color of lug and the second bluf took the color of dax)
- zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow (bluf took the color of zup)
- dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red (bluf took the color of zup)

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color associated with the directly preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns associated with this nonce word in the examples given. The patterns should help us understand the conditions under which the term `walm` occurs and the output it generates.

The examples provided are consistent in using ""walm"" as a term that is directly translated in the output:

1. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
2. Input: dax walm zup | Output: green green green yellow
3. Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
4. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm | Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug | Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Looking at the examples, let's analyze them one by one:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and translates to the second ""green"" in the output. However, ""dax"" also translates to ""green,"" so no additional information about ""walm"" is gleaned here, as ""walm"" appears to simply replicate the color associated with ""dax.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"" but the output for ""walm"" remains ""green,"" consistent with ""dax.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" The first instance of ""walm"" here translates to a ""green,"" which deviates from the preceding ""red."" For the second instance of ""walm,"" it translates to two sequential ""blue,"" which follows ""lug,"" which also translates to ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and translates to a single ""red,"" which is consistent with ""wif.""

From these observations, it looks like ""walm"" does not have a consistent translation into a color of its own but rather takes on or influences the output based on its neighboring words or context. Notably, when positioned after ""dax"" and ""wif"" it results in ""green"" and ""red"" respectively, despite the natural translation of ""dax"" and ""wif"" being ""green"" and ""red"" themselves. When positioned after ""lug,"" it results in a duplicated color of the one associated with ""lug,"" namely ""blue blue.""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" itself doesn't have an intrinsic color associated with it but rather it potentially extends or affects the output color related to the previous word. So, if the previous word is associated with a color, ""walm"" may either repeat or extend that color in some way. This behavior, however, is not entirely consistent since in example 4 ""walm"" results in a change from ""red"" to ""green,"" which suggests that the surrounding context might influence its output.

Given these observations, we might tentatively say that ""walm"" affects the color output based on the previous word or context but does not have a consistent direct translation into a color on its own.

Rule: walm -> modifies the color output in a context-dependent manner, with potential repetition or extension of the preceding word's associated color, but does not have a consistent standalone color association.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of the context in which it appears in the examples provided.
Rule: dax -> green

In all given examples, whenever the word dax appears, it is translated as ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Below are the examples and the corresponding outputs that support this conclusion:

1. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
   ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""walm"" translates to ""red"".
   Since we have one instance of ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" which outputs ""red red red"", we can deduce that ""wif"" is ""red"".

2. lug wif dax wif -> blue red green red
   ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
   Again, instances of ""wif"" correspond to ""red"".

3. wif dax wif -> red green red
   ""dax"" translates to ""green"", while the instances of ""wif"" correspond to ""red"".

4. wif lug -> red blue
   ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

5. zup dax wif zup -> yellow green red yellow
   ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"", while ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look for patterns in its use:

In all examples, zup is followed by a different word (e.g. wif, bluf, walm, lug) or by zup itself. The output after zup is always ""yellow,"" regardless of the following word. This suggests that zup translates to ""yellow.""

Let's verify this with each example:

1. Input: dax zup wif -> Output: green yellow red
   ""zup"" is between ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue green blue
   After ""wif"" (red), ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf"" (yellow), and so on.

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   The two instances of ""zup"" both result in ""yellow.""

4. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" both are translating to ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup lug dax lug -> Output: yellow blue green blue
   ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"". The word ""zup"" means ""yellow"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, it can be seen that the presence of ""bluf"" in an input results in the output having two of the same color in sequence. There is no variation in color when comparing outputs with the same nonce word before ""bluf."" For example, ""wif bluf"" consistently outputs ""red red,"" while ""zup bluf"" consistently outputs ""yellow yellow."" The specific color is determined by the word preceding ""bluf,"" not by ""bluf"" itself. Therefore, ""bluf"" does not correspond to a specific color but appears to duplicate the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the recurring patterns associated with each instance of ""walm"" in the given examples:

1. In the first and fourth examples, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since the word ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" the presence of ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color associated with the preceding word, resulting in three yellows instead of one.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red green."" We can see that ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""dax"" corresponds to green, while ""lug"" corresponds to blue. The word ""walm"" appearing after ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" being replicated two more times.

3. In the third example, ""zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the word ""walm"" follows it, ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated two additional times.

4. In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""wif"" corresponds to red, but we observe ""green"" repeated two additional times before the red which suggests that ""walm"" is responsible for this.

Based on these observations, the rule for the word ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color word immediately before it two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif dax
    ",Output: red green red green,red green red green,True,139
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. There is no variation observed in the output in relationship to ""lug"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. The word ""lug"" therefore translates straightforwardly to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following about the nonce word 'dax':

1. When the input is a single ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
2. When the input is ""dax wif dax,"" the output is ""green red green."" This suggests that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" while ""wif"" may represent ""red.""
3. When ""dax"" appears alongside other nonce words such as ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" or ""bluf,"" it still corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Now let's analyze the third input-output pair in detail: 

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Here we see the string 'dax' followed by 'wif' results in 'green red,' confirming the second example where 'dax wif dax' gave 'green red green.'

Let's look at the order of the nonces and their corresponding colors:
- ""zup"" appears twice and both times it precedes ""yellow"" which would indicate ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" only appears once and it precedes ""blue"" indicating that ""lug"" could translate to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" appears before two ""yellow"" outputs, suggesting a possible rule, but without more examples of ""walm,"" it is difficult to confirm with certainty.
- ""bluf"" also only appears once and is followed by ""red red,"" it's unclear if ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" or if some other rule is applying.

Finally, considering the fourth example:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

If ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" then the remaining ""walm"" corresponds to the additional ""red"" in the output, however, this is inconsistent with the third input-output pair where ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow.""

Considering all the examples, it is evident that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the string of nonce words.

If we were to summarize the rule for ""dax"" based on the information available, it would be as follows:

dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" is consistently ""green"" in every context it appears in within the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, the word 'wif' consistently yields 'red' in the output, regardless of the position it appears in the input or the context of surrounding words. The surrounding words, such as 'lug', 'zup', and 'walm', produce 'blue', 'yellow', and 'blue' respectively in the output. Therefore, 'wif' seems to have a direct translation to the color 'red'.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Based on the provided examples, whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is included in the output. The position of ""zup"" in the input sequence does not appear to affect its representation as ""yellow"" in the output sequence.
From the given examples, we can deduce the rule for the word ""bluf"" as it appears consistently associated with a specific color in the output.

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""blue""

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
- ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""blue""

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- A single instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", but given it is preceded by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"" in all other instances, we're seeing a repetitive pattern that suggests ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the repetition of ""red"" is due to the appearance of ""wif"".

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is consistent regardless of its position relative to other words.

Based on these observations, the rule we can deduce is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at how it's used in various inputs and the corresponding outputs.

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

From the examples given, we can propose the following observations:
1. ""walm"" when preceded by ""lug"" leads to a series of three ""blue"" in the output. Example 1 and 3 showcase this rule.
2. ""walm"" followed by another word that is not ""lug"" leads to ""green"" in the output, and it appears to cause a repetition of ""green"" until another color (or possibly word) follows. Example 2 and 5 demonstrate this effect.
3. Example 4 also follows the repetition rule but we see after ""walm"" there’s a different word ""wif"" which is followed by a ""red"" indicating the pattern is broken after ""walm"" is followed by a word that prompts a new color in the output.

Rule:
Walm -> a series of three identical colors; ""blue"" when following ""lug,"" ""green"" when following ""dax,"" and that series continues until a different color word appears in the input or the end of the input is reached.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,140
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"". Every instance of the word ""lug"" in the input is directly replaced with the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's compare the input and output of each example to identify a pattern.

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. dax walm wif -> green green green red
3. zup dax lug -> yellow green blue
4. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

Based on these examples, the color that follows ""dax"" consistently changes even when the word before ""dax"" remains the same. This suggests that ""dax"" does not relate to a specific color. However, in each output, the word ""dax"" is represented by the color green. 

There is no clear variation in the color associated with ""dax"" as it follows the pattern of being green regardless of the surrounding words. Hence, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", let's analyze the patterns of input and output:

1. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

2. Input: lug zup dax wif
   Output: blue yellow green red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - The sequence ""wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""red blue red""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" 

Looking at these examples, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule:
wif -> ""red""
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we can compare the inputs and outputs from each example:

- In the first example, ""zup"" produces ""yellow"" when it follows ""dax"" (which produces ""green"") and when it precedes ""wif"" (which produces ""red"").
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that both ""zup"" and ""walm"" translate to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and then ""dax,"" which translates to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" and ""lug"" translate to ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively, and ""walm"" continues to translate to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug zup"" translates into ""blue yellow,"" confirming that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position.

Based on these examples, it is evident that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the words that precede or follow it. Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a color in the output, but its exact color is dependent on the preceding word. Let's try to derive the rule by examining each input and its corresponding output.

- In the first example, ""dax lug bluf"" becomes ""green blue blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"".
- The second example, ""wif bluf,"" turns into ""red red"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and translates to ""red"".
- In the third example, ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"". Again, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and becomes ""blue"" and follows ""zup"" to become ""yellow"".
- For the fourth example, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green yellow red green green"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green"".
- In the final example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" we get ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""bluf"" following ""zup"" becomes ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" following ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

By analyzing these patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word:

- After ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""green"".
- After ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""red"".
- After ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" becomes ""yellow"".
- After ""lug"", ""bluf"" remains ""blue"" as no color is specified for ""lug"" but it is directly associated with ""blue"" in the examples.

Rule: bluf -> The color of ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between its appearance in the input and the corresponding output.

- In the first example, the output sequence is ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"" which corresponds to ""dax walm zup lug walm"". Since ""dax"" correlates with a single ""green"" before the sequence ""walm zup lug walm"" which translates to ""green green yellow blue blue blue,"" it suggests that ""walm"" contributes to the repetition of the preceding color. This is reinforced by the fact that we see three ""green"" before the color changes to ""yellow"" and then to ""blue"" indicates another change after ""lug"".

- In the second example, the sequence ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" results in ""blue blue blue green red blue red"". Here, ""lug walm"" correlates to the repetition of ""blue,"" and ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red,"" suggesting again that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the preceding color and that ""wif"" correlates to a switch to red after ""dax"".

- In the third example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". We can observe ""bluf wif"" corresponds to ""red red"", indicating that ""bluf"" has a direct red association, and ""walm"" again confirms the repetition as we see ""red"" repeated after ""wif"".

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow"". This reiterates that ""walm"" is connected to the repetition of the preceding color.

- Finally, the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red blue"". Here, ""lug walm"" leads to repeated ""blue,"" and after ""wif"" we see a change suggesting that ""wif"" is associated with the color change, and after that ""lug"" alone corresponds to a single ""blue"".

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to be a function word that directs the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. When ""walm"" follows a color word (""dax,"" ""lug,"" or ""zup""), it results in the repetition of the color output.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color output associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,141
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the provided input and output pairs, we can attempt to infer the meaning or rule attached to the nonce word ""lug.""

In the first example, ""dax lug wif"" becomes ""green blue red,"" and the word ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.

In the second example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" becomes ""red red blue yellow,"" and again, the word ""lug"" comes out as blue.

In the third example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" becomes ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow,"" which maintains the pattern of ""lug"" translating to blue.

In the fourth example, ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" turns into ""green yellow red red blue,"" where again ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

In the fifth example, ""zup lug bluf wif"" changes to ""yellow blue blue red,"" maintaining the consistent association of ""lug"" with blue.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""lug"" appears to be consistent and straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue
Let us examine each input and output pair to deduce the rule for ""dax"":

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red

2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

3. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green

Analyzing the patterns:

- In each output, ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- The words following ""dax"" are the same color as the word that directly precedes ""dax"".
- The word that follows ""dax"" does not seem to be influenced by it, and has its own color consistent with other instances where that content word appears.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and it also influences the words immediately after it to take on the color of the word immediately before ""dax"".

Rule: dax -> green. Additionally, the word that follows ""dax"" assumes the color of the word preceding ""dax"".
Given the examples provided, we can analyze the pairs of input and output to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif.""

From the first input/output pair:
Input: lug dax wif lug
Output: blue green red blue
It appears that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" because the other words in the sequence are paired with their respective colors.

Similarly, cross-checking with the other examples:

Input: zup wif dax walm lug
Output: yellow red green green green blue
Here, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" fitting the pattern.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Once more, ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
In this instance as well, ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
And again, ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""

Given these consistent pairings, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the input ""zup"" and the output ""yellow,"" regardless of the context or position of the word in the sequence.
bluf -> repetition of the color associated with the word before it. Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, it results in the repetition of the color that the preceding word corresponds to. For example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue."" Similarly, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the following word in the output. The rule appears to be that ""walm"" changes the color associated with the next word to be the same color as the word preceding ""walm"". Thus, the color that follows ""walm"" is a repetition of the color that precedes it.

Here's a breakdown per example:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   (""walm"" causes ""wif"" to repeat the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.)

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   (""walm"" causes the second ""wif"" to repeat the color red, which is the color assigned to ""wif."")

3. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   (""walm"" causes the second ""wif"" to repeat the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.)

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   (""walm"" causes the second ""wif"" to repeat the color of the previous ""wif,"" which is red.)

5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   (""walm"" causes ""zup"" to repeat the color of ""dax,"" which is green.)

Rule: walm -> causes the next word to take on the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug zup
    ",Output: green blue yellow,green blue yellow,True,142
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Considering the input and output patterns provided, the rules for the word ""dax"" and others seem to be consistent. Here are the observations:

1. Whenever the input is just ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" is combined with other words, it still translates to ""green.""
3. Other words such as ""lug"" and ""walm"" have consistent outputs as well. ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"" and ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""

Given this, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- zup -> yellow

When the word ""wif"" appears, the next color mentioned is red, regardless of what the word for that color normally is. This can be seen in:

- ""lug walm wif"" -> blue blue blue red (where the word following ""wif"" is ""lug,"" which normally corresponds to blue)
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" -> green green red blue (where ""lug"" is usually blue but is red here into the position after ""wif"")
- ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" -> green green red blue yellow (same as the previous example with the addition of ""zup"" for yellow)
- ""wif bluf lug"" -> red red blue (where ""bluf"" is usually green but turns red after ""wif"")
- ""zup wif"" -> yellow red (""wif"" makes the following color red, so although ""lug"" isn't stated here, it's implied that if a word followed ""wif,"" it would be rendered as red)

Therefore, ""wif"" changes the color of the word that follows it to red.

Rule: wif -> changes the following color word to red.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- When ""zup"" is part of a sequence with other words (e.g., ""walm"", ""lug"", ""dax"", ""wif""), it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
- When ""zup"" is the sole input, the output is ""yellow"".

Thus, in every instance given, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Examining the examples provided, I notice a pattern pertaining to the word ""bluf"" and the colors in the outputs. Here is a breakdown of the colors that correspond to each word repeated in the input and output:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> no direct color correspondence shown, but it's followed by yellow in the only given example

Now, looking at the specific appearances of ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue in ""lug bluf"" and red in ""wif bluf."" Since ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red, it seems that ""bluf"" possibly repeats the color of the word before it.

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which is yellow), the output after ""bluf"" is also yellow (""zup bluf dax"" results in ""yellow yellow green"").

3. When ""bluf"" appears at the end of a sequence, the color before it is repeated except for the very first example where it does not follow this rule (""dax zup lug bluf"" results in ""green yellow blue blue"", yet ""lug"" is blue and ""bluf"" should be blue following the identified rule).

Using these observations, the rule could be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it or adds an extra instance of the previous color, but there might be exceptions or additional conditions we need to account for, such as in the first example. However, the final example (""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue"") suggests ""bluf"" might sometimes take the color of a word even when it's not directly before ""bluf,"" which doesn't entirely fit the pattern.

Given the above observations, it's clear the rule isn't entirely consistent or maybe not all conditions were presented in the examples. To propose a general rule, we could assume:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally repeats the color of the preceding word, but exceptions may apply based on conditions not fully discerned from the given examples.

So, the potential rule is:
bluf -> meaning: Repeats the color of the preceding word, with potential exceptions.
Through analysis of the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern for the nonce word ""walm"" as follows:

In example 1, the sequence ""lug walm zup walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". If we consider ""lug"" to correspond to a single ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to correspond to a single ""yellow,"" we notice that ""walm"" doubles the color that comes after it.

In example 2, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here, we again see the ""lug"" associated with ""blue"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" coming after ""walm"" turns into ""red"" instead of the expected double ""blue."" This example challenges the previous rule that ""walm"" simply doubles the succeeding color.

In example 3, the input ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" provides the output ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red."" The ""walm"" after ""lug"" leads to a triple ""blue,"" and ""lug zup"" results in alternating blue and yellow. This supports the notion that ""walm"" affects the following color phrase, possibly increasing the count.

In example 4, ""zup walm lug"" generates the output ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" This would indicate that ""walm"" after ""zup"" triples the ""yellow"" and has no bearing on the ""lug"" (blue) that follows.

In example 5, ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red."" This example shows that ""walm"" affects the following ""red"" to produce a triple ""red,"" similar to how it affected ""yellow"" and ""blue"" in previous examples.

Taking into account that ""walm"" does not always double the following color, but rather seems to triple the count of the next color in the output (as observed in examples 1, 3, 4, and 5)—but with an exception in example 2 where it resulted in a single ""red"" instead of a double ""blue,"" potentially because ""wif"" inherently has a different output —we can infer the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next color phrase to be repeated three times in the output. The colors associated with the words ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"" seem to follow a pattern where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif,"" when not preceded by ""walm,"" corresponds to ""red."" When ""wif"" directly follows ""walm,"" the output deviates from the expected repetition and outputs a single ""red"" instead.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green.""

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Analysis: ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red."" ""walm"" does not appear with any other word, making it difficult to discern a pattern; however, considering the repetition of red, ""walm"" might also correspond to ""red.""

3. Input: dax bluf lug wif
   Output: green green blue red
   Analysis: ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""bluf"" is new and corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: lug wif lug
   Output: blue red blue
   Analysis: Consistent with the previous mentions, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""lug,"" when repeated, yields ""blue red blue,"" in which ""blue"" repeats as well.

5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   Analysis: Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""zup"" and ""bluf"" are similar to two ""yellow,"" suggesting they both may correspond to ""yellow.""

Based on the above examples, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or repetition in the input.

Rule: lug -> blue
Reviewing the given examples, it appears that each instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" To confirm this, observe that for every input containing the word ""dax,"" the output always includes ""green"" in the same position relative to other colors.

Here are the occurrences:

- ""dax walm"" correlates with ""green green,"" indicating both ""dax"" and ""walm"" mean green.
- ""dax wif zup"" correlates with ""green red yellow,"" indicating ""dax"" means green, ""wif"" means red, and ""zup"" means yellow.
- ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" correlates with ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue,"" where the placement of ""dax"" corresponds with the first ""green.""
- ""zup lug dax"" correlates with ""yellow blue green,"" again showing ""dax"" at the position of ""green.""
- ""zup dax wif"" correlates with ""yellow green red,"" where ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" can be stated as:

dax -> green. 

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is in the corresponding position in the output. 

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: When ""wif"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples given, each instance of the word ""zup"" directly correlates with the word ""yellow"" in the output. Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. No other word in the inputs consistently translates into ""yellow""; therefore, ""zup"" specifically means ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" and translates to the color ""blue"" when it follows any other word. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"": Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""
2. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is again ""yellow.""
3. ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue blue"": ""bluf"" doesn't follow ""zup"" directly (there's a ""lug"" in between), yet the output is ""blue.""
4. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue"": ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue.""
5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow"": ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow"" when it directly follows ""zup,"" and ""blue"" otherwise.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between the input and output in each example:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

2. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

3. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

Looking at the output associated with the inputs, the word that comes before ""walm"" seems to set the color for the repetitions after ""walm"":

- In example 1, ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" three times.
- In example 2, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" three times, and the pattern repeats.
- In example 3, ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" three times.
- In example 4, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" three times, and there is no preceding word other than ""wif"".
- In example 5, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" three times.

The rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times. Therefore, we can formulate the rule as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a word, it causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Thus:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the following relationship can be deduced:

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
(The word ""lug"" is consistently followed by the color blue.)

Input: zup lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow blue yellow red green
(Again, ""lug"" corresponds to blue.)

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
(""lug"" is directly translated to blue.)

Input: wif lug wif
Output: red blue red
(The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue regardless of its position.)

Input: lug
Output: blue
(When ""lug"" is by itself, the output is still blue.)

Rule:
lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can make some observations and try to deduce the underlying rule for what ""dax"" might represent. Here's the analysis of the given inputs and outputs:

1. ""zup dax bluf zup dax"" yields ""yellow green green yellow green.""
   - ""zup"" consistently leads to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" appears once and is followed by ""green.""

2. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red.""
   - ""walm"" appears twice and seems to relate to ""yellow"" when followed by ""dax"" but ""blue"" when standalone.
   - ""wif"" appears once at the end and results in ""red.""

3. ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue blue.""
   - ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" leads to a sequence of ""blue.""
   - ""dax"" at the beginning results in ""green.""

4. ""zup dax zup lug"" yields ""yellow green yellow blue.""
   - The sequence of ""zup"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green) is consistent.
   - ""lug"" stands alone here and results in ""blue.""

5. ""dax zup dax"" yields ""green yellow green.""
   - This reinforces that ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green.""

From the above observations, it seems that ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Given the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern for the word ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" is used after a word, the output is ""red"" followed by the color associated with the word that comes after ""wif"".
- When ""wif"" is used before a word, it seems to change the output to ""red"" only, without producing the color associated with that word.
- When ""wif"" is present by itself, the output is ""red"".

Let's analyze the examples:

1. ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red"". ""Zup"" produces ""yellow"", and since ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" (which produces ""yellow""), it changes the output from ""yellow"" to ""red"" for the positions that ""walm"" would have normally occupied, resulting in three ""red""s.

2. ""zup walm wif"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here, ""zup"" is yellow and ""walm"" is as well; ""wif"" at the end still yields ""red"" but does not influence the previous ""yellow"" outputs.

3. ""wif"" by itself is simply ""red"".

4. ""dax bluf wif lug"" becomes ""green green red blue"". ""Dax"" and ""bluf"" are ""green"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""Wif"" does not seem to affect ""lug"", indicating that its influence may be limited to the word immediately following it.

5. ""zup wif bluf zup"" turns into ""yellow red red yellow"". ""Zup"" is ""yellow"", ""wif"" before ""bluf"" makes it ""red"", and the second ""zup"" at the end remains ""yellow"".

The rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> changes the color output of the next word to ""red"" if there is a word after it; if there is no word after it or if it is by itself, ""wif"" yields ""red"".
zup -> ""yellow"".

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" each time it appears.
bluf -> repeat the color that corresponds to the preceding word. Rule: When 'bluf' follows a word, the output is the color associated with that preceding word, repeated twice. 

Based on the examples:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

Thus:
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow"" (the color corresponding to 'dax' followed by the color corresponding to 'zup', each repeated once)
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the inputs and outputs in each example closely, looking for patterns:

1. Example: zup wif walm lug -> yellow red red red blue
   We notice that ""zup"" must correspond to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Walm"" in this context adds two additional ""red"" before returning to the pattern.

2. Example: zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" which corresponds to two additional ""yellow."" 

3. Example: wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   ""Walm"" after ""zup"" results in two ""yellow."" This aligns with the previous example.

4. Example: wif walm zup lug zup walm -> red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   In this context, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" resulting in two additional ""red"" before returning to the pattern.

5. Example: zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   Again, ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellow."" 

It seems that ""walm"" results in repeating the color corresponding to the word just prior to ""walm"" two more times. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color two more times.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: dax -> green

When ""dax"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Each occurrence of ""dax"" as a separate word translates specifically to the color ""green"" without dependence on its position within the sequence.

Rule: wif translates to red.

Input: wif dax wif -> Output: red green red
Rule: wif translates to red and dax translates to green, with the pattern repeating.

Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green
Rule: wif translates to red, zup translates to yellow, dax translates to green, and bluf to green as well.

Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
Rule: wif translates to red, bluf translates to red, and lug translates to blue.

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Rule: wif translates to red and lug translates to blue.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red
dax -> green
zup -> yellow
bluf -> red (Note: In the third example, bluf is translated to green, but in the fourth, it is translated to red, which could indicate an inconsistency or context-dependent translation).
lug -> blue

If we consider the inconsistency with 'bluf' due to its representation as green in one example but red in another, we would need more examples or context to fully understand the usage rules for 'bluf'. However, 'wif' consistently translates to red.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""zup"" can be deduced by comparing each input with its corresponding output. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax lug zup"" translates to ""green blue yellow,"" so it seems that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""lug"" means ""blue."" The new word ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""

- The second example, ""dax zup,"" becomes ""green yellow,"" which confirms that ""dax"" means ""green,"" supporting the idea that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

- The third example, ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue,"" where ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" and each instance of ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow."" The unknown ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow,"" which complicates the rule as ""bluf"" does not appear in any other examples to provide additional context.

- The fourth example, ""zup lug zup dax,"" becomes ""yellow blue yellow green,"" which aligns with the previously established meanings for ""lug"" and ""dax.""

- The fifth example, ""zup walm,"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that both ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow.""

From these examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow

This rule seems straightforward, but there is an anomaly: the term ""bluf"" also translating to ""yellow"" in the third example without repeated occurrences in other examples to help define it more clearly. However, based on the information given, ""zup"" can be reliably translated to ""yellow.""
Based on the input-output pairs provided in the examples, we can deduce a pattern for what ""bluf"" means. We can analyze when ""bluf"" appears and what color is output in response.

- In the first input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif walm"" and the output yields ""yellow red red red"". However, we also see ""wif"" correspond to ""red"" in other sequences, so we need to isolate ""bluf"".
- In the second input, ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""lug"" and the output is ""red blue"" after ""bluf"". Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the fourth input, we can infer that ""bluf"" here translates to ""red"".
- In the third input, ""bluf"" is the last word and still, the output ends with two ""red""s after ""bluf"".
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" is the second and last word and the output is ""blue blue"", but this sequence does not give us new information since it lacks context with other words and colors.
- In the fifth input, ""lug wif lug bluf"" correlates to ""blue red blue blue"", showing us that ""wif"" and ""lug"" maintain their colors, ""red"" and ""blue"", respectively. The presence of ""bluf"" does not appear to change the color associated with ""lug"".

Taking these observations into account, it looks like ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Since ""bluf"" does not appear to affect the colors associated with other words, we can deduce that it stands independently regardless of the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> red.
From the examples given, we can induce the following pattern:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" is repeated in the output one less time than the number of words that precede ""walm"". Then, if ""dax"" follows ""walm"", a ""green"" is added to the output.

Analyzing the input and output pair:
- Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green
  - ""walm"" is preceded by one word (""lug""), followed by ""dax,"" so the output is ""blue"" repeated once and then ""green.""

- Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
  - ""walm"" is preceded by one word (""wif""), followed by ""dax,"" (thus ""green"") and then one more word ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

- Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
  - ""walm"" is preceded by one word (""lug""), and there's no ""dax"" after it, hence three ""blue.""

- Input: lug walm zup -> Output: blue blue blue yellow
  - ""walm"" is preceded by one word (""lug""), and it isn't followed by ""dax,"" hence three ""blue"" and then ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

- Input: dax zup dax walm -> Output: green yellow green green green
  - ""walm"" is preceded by three words (""dax zup dax""), no word follows ""walm"", resulting in the output of ""green"" for every occurrence of ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup"" plus two additional ""green"" at the end.

Given this pattern, ""walm"" seems to function as a signal to repeat ""blue"" in the output for each word that precedes it, followed by a ""green"" if succeeded by ""dax"". 

Rule: walm -> ""blue"" repeated a number of times equal to the count of words before ""walm"" in the input, followed by ""green"" if there is a ""dax"" immediately after ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red yellow red,red yellow yellow,False,146
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the pairs of inputs and outputs, paying attention to where ""lug"" appears and what word corresponds to it in the output.

1. wif lug -> red blue
2. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
3. lug dax lug wif -> blue green blue red
4. lug wif dax -> blue red green
5. zup lug -> yellow blue

From the examples, whenever ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. No matter what comes before or after ""lug,"" the presence of ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue"" in the output.

Here are the correlations we can make:
- For the first example, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" since it is followed by ""lug"" which translates to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is also translated to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The repetition of ""wif"" three times at the end corresponds with ""red red red"" in the output. Given that ""lug"" is at the beginning and followed by ""blue,"" it again supports the translation of ""lug"" to ""blue.""
- The third example has ""lug"" followed by ""blue"" twice, and ""dax"" between them translates to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax"" corresponds directly with ""blue red green,"" with ""lug"" falling in place as ""blue"" yet again.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow"" and ""lug"" follows as ""blue.""

Therefore, according to the given examples, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the rules for the colors associated with the words as follows:

1. dax -> green
2. lug -> blue
3. wif -> red
4. zup -> yellow
5. bluf -> yellow

Rule: Each word is associated with a specific color. The output lists the colors in the order of the words presented in the input.
Analyzing the examples given:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

2. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

4. Input: wif
   Output: red

5. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

By looking at these examples, every time ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" It seems independent of its position in the input list. Thus:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output. Here is the correlation:

- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""

So, the rule for ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let’s look at the patterns in each example:

1. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"".
2. ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" results in ""red red yellow yellow red"".
3. Again, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"".
4. Repeating the previous pattern, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"".
5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow"".

Considering that a ""wif"" always seems to map to ""red"" and ""zup"" always seems to map to ""yellow,"" we can figure out the pattern for ""bluf"".

In example 1, the output does not repeat ""red,"" nor in example 3 or 4, which implies ""bluf"" doesn't translate to ""wif"" as it translates to ""red."" 

In example 2, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow."" Since the pattern in the output goes ""red red yellow yellow red,"" ""bluf"" must map to ""red"" again to align with the double representation.

In example 5, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow,"" just like in example 2.

The constant pattern is that ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to ""yellow"" when it follows another color term (be it ""wif"" or ""zup""). The main confusion might come from the first and third examples where ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" but this could be because ""bluf"" is following ""wif,"" and the rule is that ""bluf"" repeats the color mentioned right before it.

Rule:
bluf -> meaning: repeats the previous color in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following pattern for the nonce word ""walm"":

- Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" or ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated three times.
- The color that ""walm"" corresponds to does not depend on any specific word that precedes it, but rather on the word that ""walm"" immediately follows.

Here is the rule induced from the given examples:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color corresponding to that word repeated three times.

Given these observations, the meaning of ""walm"" appears to be a rule that instructs one to repeat the color associated with the previous word, three times. Let's break it down by examples:

- In the first example (wif zup lug dax zup walm), ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" thus the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second example (dax lug walm), ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" thus the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third and fourth examples (dax walm zup) and (dax walm wif), ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" thus the output is ""green green green.""
- In the fifth example (zup lug walm), ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which again corresponds to ""blue,"" thus the output is ""blue blue blue.""

Therefore, ""walm"" serves as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided:

- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the following output is ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red"" regardless of context. Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"", irrespective of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Here is the induction of the rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the input includes the word ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"".
Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word. 

Explanation: 

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and the word immediately after ""bluf"" is ""wif"" corresponding to red, so the output after ""dax bluf"" is ""green green red"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" is green again and followed by ""wif"" which is red, so after ""wif bluf dax,"" the output is ""red red green"".
- This pattern continues with ""bluf"" consistently causing a repetition of the color associated with the word right before it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it three times. Here is the underlying rule deduced from the given examples:

- ""zup walm"" => ""yellow yellow yellow"" (The color yellow, which is associated with ""zup"", is repeated three times.)
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" => ""blue blue blue red red"" (The color blue, which is associated with ""lug"", is repeated three times, and then the color red, which is associated with ""bluf"", is repeated twice due to the presence of ""wif"" before it.)
- ""dax walm wif zup"" => ""green green green red yellow"" (The color green, which is associated with ""dax"", is repeated three times, then the presence of ""wif"" leads to the color red being mentioned once, followed by the color yellow from ""zup"".)
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" => ""green red yellow yellow red red red"" (The sequence follows the color representations of each word with ""walm"" at the end, causing the last mentioned color, ""red"" associated with ""bluf"", to be repeated three times after the presence of ""wif"")
- ""dax walm"" => ""green green green"" (The color green, associated with ""dax"", is repeated three times.)

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,148
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each English word corresponds to a color in the output. To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" we should look for a pattern in the examples.

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

In the first example, the words ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""red."" Since the word ""lug"" appears at the end and the output ends with ""blue,"" we can guess that ""lug"" might mean ""blue.""

In the second example, there is only one word before ""lug,"" which is ""zup,"" and that corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Lug"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow blue,"" reaffirming our initial guess that ""lug"" correlates to ""blue.""

The third example solidifies the pattern since after each instance of ""bluf"" and ""dax,"" the colors ""green"" and ""yellow"" repeat, but the single instance of ""lug"" directly corresponds with the output ""blue.""

The fourth example is interesting because ""lug"" is the first word, and ""blue"" is the first color in the output. ""Walm"" and ""dax"" both appear to correspond to ""blue"" and ""green,"" respectively, according to the previous pattern.

The fifth example confirms the previous observations; ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats as ""blue."" Again, ""lug"" appears and is matched with ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" correlates to the color red. Each time ""wif"" appears in an input, the corresponding output includes the color red. Additionally, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the different inputs and their corresponding outputs. 

Consider the Input/Output pairs:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

2. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

5. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red

From these examples, we can start by identifying the other words:
- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" always translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to a change to green, notably when followed by ""lug"" or ""walm"".
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" unless proceeded by ""dax,"" in which case the result is ""green.""

Next, we try to determine the pattern for ""bluf"":

In examples 1, 2, and 5:
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output color is ""blue"" before ""dax"" changes it to ""green.""

In examples 4 and 5:
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" or precedes ""wif,"" and the output color is ""red"" after ""bluf.""

From the above observations, we can infer the following rule about ""bluf"":

""bluf"" corresponds to duplication of the previous color mentioned. If ""bluf"" is the first word or if there is no previously mentioned color, then there is no direct example to follow.

Based on the observed patterns, we can write the rule as:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.

If there is no previous word, as in inputs that don't start with ""lug"" or ""wif,"" there is not enough data based on the given examples to determine the behavior of ""bluf"" in such cases.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color corresponding to the last color word mentioned before ""walm."" The number of repetitions is one less than the number of letters in the word preceding ""walm.""

Let's look at each example:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Explanation: ""wif"" corresponds to one instance of ""red,"" but since it is followed by ""walm"" and ""wif"" has three letters, ""red"" is repeated three times (one less than the number of letters in ""wif"").

2. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   Explanation: The last color word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" corresponding to ""green."" Since ""dax"" has three letters, ""green"" is repeated three times (one less than the number of letters in ""dax"").

3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Explanation: The last color word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" (green), and since ""dax"" has three letters, ""green"" is repeated three times (one less than the number of letters in ""dax"").

4. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   Explanation: The last color word before ""walm"" is ""zup"" (yellow), and since ""zup"" has three letters, ""yellow"" is repeated three times (one less than the number of letters in ""zup"").

5. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   Explanation: The last color word before ""walm"" is ""zup"" (yellow), and since ""zup"" has three letters, ""yellow"" is repeated three times (one less than the number of letters in ""zup"").

So the rule is: walm causes the last mentioned color to be repeated one less the number of times than there are letters in the word preceding ""walm."" If the preceding word has four letters, you repeat the color three times; if it has three letters, you repeat the color twice, and so on.

Rule: walm -> repeat the last mentioned color based on the number of letters in the word before walm minus one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True,149
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" can be deduced by looking at the corresponding output color in each example and identifying a pattern. Below are the examples with the input words matched to their output colors:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""walm"" -> red
   - ""lug"" -> blue

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" -> red
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""walm"" -> yellow

3. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   - ""zup"" -> yellow
   - ""lug"" -> blue

4. Input: lug wif
   Output: blue red
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""wif"" -> red

5. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""zup"" -> yellow

By observing the examples, it can be seen that regardless of its position in the input, ""lug"" always corresponds to the color blue in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs and identify patterns.

1. `dax bluf wif zup wif` -> `green green red yellow red`

The word ""dax"" here corresponds to ""green,"" and so does ""bluf."" The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. `zup dax` -> `yellow green`

""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" here also corresponds to ""green.""

3. `dax walm` -> `green green green`

The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and so does ""walm.""

4. `dax wif` -> `green red`

Again, the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. `zup dax lug` -> `yellow green blue`

""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and now ""lug"" introduces a new color ""blue.""

From these examples, it seems consistent that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each unique word is associated with a color:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm -> green (since ""dax walm"" results in ""green green"")

When ""wif"" appears in a sequence of words, the output color associated with ""wif"" is always red, irrespective of its position in the sequence:

- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""
- ""lug wif lug"" -> ""blue red blue""
- ""wif lug zup"" -> ""red blue yellow""
- ""dax walm wif dax"" -> ""green green green red green""
- ""zup lug zup lug wif"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue red""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Analyzing the given examples:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: zup wif lug dax
Output: yellow red blue green

Every instance of ""zup"" in the inputs corresponds to ""yellow"" in the outputs. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: zup corresponds to the color yellow.
Reviewing the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""bluf"" is used, ""bluf"" always results in the word ""green"" being the output:

- wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
- dax bluf -> green green
- zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue
- zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
- lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green

Regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the sequence or the preceding words, the outcome related to ""bluf"" is consistently ""green"". Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the word ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" is a rule that causes repetition of the immediately preceding color in the output. To explain:

- Example 1: ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow,"" where ""walm"" causes the ""blue"" to be repeated twice more before moving on to ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""
- Example 2: ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" outputs ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here ""wif"" is linked to ""red,"" ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat two more times, and ""lug zup walm"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow,"" so once again ""walm"" seems to repeat the previous color.
- Example 3: ""lug wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" corresponding to the preceding ""zup.""
- Example 4: ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" outputs ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" and ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated two more times, following the pattern of repeating the color that comes before it.
- Example 5: ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue,"" where ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" from ""dax,"" consistent with the previous examples.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color in the output multiple times (based on these examples, it results in a total of three occurrences of that color, with ""walm"" counting as one of them).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

""Wif"" gives ""red"", ""bluf"" duplicates the ""red"" from ""wif"", and ""dax"" gives ""green"".

3. Input: wif bluf 
   Output: red red

Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" duplicates that ""red"".

4. Input: zup wif bluf 
   Output: yellow red red

""Zup"" gives ""yellow"", ""wif"" gives ""red"", and ""bluf"" duplicates that ""red"".

5. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red

Here, ""wif"" gives ""red"", ""dax"" gives ""green"", the next ""wif"" again gives ""red"", ""bluf"" duplicates the ""red"" from the preceding ""wif"", ""zup"" gives ""yellow"", and the final ""wif"" gives ""red"" once again.

From these observations, we can infer the rule that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediate preceding word.

Rule: bluf duplicates the color output of the word that comes directly before it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us look at the patterns associated with the word in each input compared to the respective output.

- When ""lug wif walm"" is the input, the output is ""blue red red red,"" which suggests that the word ""walm"" might be associated with repeating the color associated with the word before it multiple times. Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The input ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again indicating that ""walm"" might be replicating the color corresponding to ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- When ""lug walm"" is the input, the output is ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" means repeating the color corresponding to ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- In the input ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" the output is ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" is causing the preceding color (""yellow"" from ""zup"") to repeat. We also note here that ""walm"" doesn’t affect the colors that follow after it, as the sequence resumes with ""red blue"" associated with ""wif lug.""
- The input ""wif walm"" leads to the output ""red red red,"" maintaining the pattern that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word before it.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup walm dax lug
    ",Output: blue yellow yellow yellow green blue,blue yellow yellow yellow green blue,True,151
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" every time it appears in the input.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" consistently. 

Here's the breakdown of the examples:

1. ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red"". This indicates that ""dax"" means green, and from this single example, we cannot be entirely sure what ""bluf"" and ""wif"" mean.
   
2. ""dax"" on its own results in ""green"", reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" means green.

3. ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"". This further reinforces that ""dax"" means green, and given the previous examples, it might suggest that ""wif"" does not always translate to the same color; however, ""bluf"" appears to have been red in both instances it has been used.

4. A lone ""dax"" again results in ""green"", lending more evidence to ""dax"" meaning green.

5. ""dax zup dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow green yellow"". This confirms ""dax"" as green once more and suggests that ""zup"" correlates with yellow.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> triggers the color associated with the preceding word(s).

Rule:
- The word immediately before ""wif"" maps to a single color.
- If multiple words precede ""wif"", each word is translated to its corresponding color.
- The color ""red"" is consistently added after the colors corresponding to the preceding words.

**Examples Explanations**:
- ""dax wif"" results in ""green red"" because the word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" adds ""red"".
- ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red"" because ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" adds ""red"".
- ""zup wif lug"" adds ""blue"" for ""lug"" in addition to ""yellow red"" from ""zup wif"".
- ""lug walm wif bluf"" has ""blue"" corresponding to both ""lug"" and ""walm"", hence ""blue blue"", followed by ""bluf"" mapping to ""blue red"", where ""wif"" adds ""red"".
- ""dax zup wif zup"" results in ""green yellow red yellow"" where ""dax"" is ""green"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""wif"" adds ""red"" and the final ""zup"" contributes another ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is mentioned, the output always starts with ""yellow"". The rest of the output seems to be dependent on the subsequent words following ""zup"", but since no examples are given that associate direct meanings to ""wif"", ""dax"", ""bluf"", or ""walm"", we cannot deduce their specific meanings.

However, based on the repetition of the word ""walm"" and its corresponding output ""yellow yellow yellow"", we can hypothesize that ""walm"" could translate to multiple instances of the color ""yellow"", but this is speculative without further examples. For ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""bluf"", there is not enough information to deduce a consistent pattern.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"" in the Output. However, when ""bluf"" is next to the word ""dax,"" the output color is ""green"" instead. This suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent. Let's examine:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" which could imply that ""wif"" also means ""red,"" or it could be that ""bluf"" amplifies the preceding color.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" turns into ""red red green green green."" Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" which changes its corresponding color from red to green, and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color green.
- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" becomes ""red red blue yellow,"" where ""bluf"" retains the color red but does not seem to affect ""lug"" (blue) or ""zup"" (yellow).
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" results in ""blue yellow yellow green."" Notice that ""bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow green"" instead of ""red green."" This implies that when ""bluf"" is after ""zup,"" it could change to ""yellow."" 
- In the fifth example, ""dax wif bluf"" changes to ""green red red,"" showing that when ""dax"" precedes ""wif bluf,"" it does not affect the color produced by ""bluf,"" which is ""red.""

The rules for ""bluf"" may be as follows:

1. ""bluf"" generally corresponds to the color ""red.""
2. When ""bluf"" directly precedes ""dax,"" the color output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
3. The behavior of ""bluf"" between ""lug"" and ""zup"" is inconsistent with the other rules and might be an anomaly or dependent on an unrecognized factor.

For simplicity and given the information we have, I would conclude the rule as:

Rule: bluf generally means ""red,"" but changes to ""green"" when directly preceding ""dax.""

Thus: bluf -> means ""red"" (changes to ""green"" when before ""dax"").
Based on the examples provided, let's look at the pattern of inputs and corresponding outputs to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   
Here, the sequence ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may translate to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Since ""dax"" is followed by three greens, ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the previous color twice.""

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
Following the potential rule, since ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" and after ""walm"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times, this still supports the idea that ""walm"" could cause a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word by two additional times.

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
In this example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by three greens, similar to the first example.

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   
Again, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by blue repeated three times. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" which doesn't seem to directly interact with the pattern of ""walm.""

5. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

""Zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" further supporting the repeating pattern idea.

Therefore, the rule in this context appears to be: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated an additional two times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup wif dax
    ",Output: red yellow red green,red yellow red green,True,152
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each input containing the word ""lug"" results in the word ""blue"" in the corresponding output. No context or additional information suggests that ""lug"" changes meaning depending on adjacent words or placement within the sequence. Therefore, the rule for the word ""lug"" appears to be straightforward:

lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" means ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. Thus, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" can be inferred as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: The word wif corresponds to the color red.

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, here's the observed pattern:

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow

Input: lug bluf dax lug
Output: blue blue green blue

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Input: dax lug bluf dax
Output: green blue blue green

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

In each example, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that immediately precedes it in the Output sequence, with the exception of the first Example where ""bluf"" is duplicated in the Output. ""bluf"" seems to mimic or copy the color that represents the last word before ""bluf"". Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word, and it's duplicated if it is at the end of the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"". Below is the evaluation of each example:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Observation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" appears to be a variant of ""blue."" The repetition after ""walm"" seems to be the color ""red"" (associated with ""wif"") followed by the color associated with ""lug.""

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Observation: ""dax"" appears to correspond to ""green,"" and following ""walm"" there are repeated ""green.""

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Observation: The same input gives the same output, indicating that ""walm"" in association with ""dax"" gives repeated ""green"" outputs.

4. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   Observation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we see repeated ""blue"" before encountering ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   Observation: ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" respectively. After ""walm"" we see repeated ""green"" associated with ""dax.""

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. However, as there is already a repeat pattern for ""dax"" and ""lug,"" the ""walm"" seems to extend this pattern. This is based on the examples provided, as the rule may change if more varied examples are observed. For now, from the given examples:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue blue blue,yellow yellow blue blue blue,True,153
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we aim to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug."" Let's examine each example:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue

3. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue

4. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

It is noted that whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" appears in the output at corresponding positions. However, in the first input where ""lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue,"" it is followed by another color as well as blue.

Looking carefully at other words, we can see that individual words correspond to specific colors: ""dax"" is always green, ""wif"" is always red, and ""walm"" and ""zup"" seem to always correspond to blue. ""bluf"" also consistently corresponds to blue, but given the double blues in the last example when ""lug walm"" is presented, it suggests that ""lug"" might contribute to the blue as well.

Considering these observations, we can infer a general rule for ""lug"":

Rule: ""lug"" translates to blue, with an additional color sometimes preceding it depending on context (as seen with ""yellow"" in the first example).

So, in an attempt to simplify and generalize:

lug -> blue (with potential context-dependent preceding color)
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Each example that contains the word ""dax"" has ""green"" in its corresponding output. Other words in the inputs appear to correspond to other colors in their respective outputs as well.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green 

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.
From the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce what ""wif"" means by looking at what output it consistently produces in different contexts.

In the first example, the input ""zup dax wif"" results in the output ""yellow green red"". 

In the second example, ""lug zup dax wif zup"" translates to ""blue yellow green red yellow"". 

In the third example, ""wif bluf"" produces ""red red"". 

In the fourth example, ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red"". 

Lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup wif walm"" becomes ""yellow red red red"".

Looking at these examples, we can see that ""wif"" always results in the output ""red"", regardless of its position in the input or the other words surrounding it. It’s not dependent on context because it always translates to the same color, unlike the other words which seem to produce different colors based on context.

Based on these observations, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"", irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Each time ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is part of the output. Other words correspond to their respective colors as well, such as ""dax"" for ""green"" and ""wif"" for ""red"". When multiple words appear, their corresponding colors are listed in the same order as the words.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

The word preceding ""bluf"" has a color associated with it (e.g., ""zup"" -> yellow, ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red). When ""bluf"" follows a word, the output repeats the color associated with that preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the given examples.

Let's start by examining each input and corresponding output in line with their respective positions.

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

3. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

Looking at the first example, ""walm"" is the third word in the input, and in the output, the third color is ""red."" However, since ""wif"" also translates to ""red,"" this does not give us much information. Let's consider the second input where ""walm"" appears at the sixth position; in the output, the sixth color is ""red"" once more. This is a hint, but more evidence is needed.

Examining the third example, the third word is ""walm,"" and the third, fourth, and fifth colors are ""blue."" However, we know from the second example that ""lug"" also translates to ""blue,"" and it is in the second and third positions, indicating that ""walm"" might be generating additional ""blue"" outputs.

The fourth example has ""walm"" as the second word, and correspondingly the second and third colors in the output are ""green."" Here, ""walm"" cannot directly translate to ""green"" because ""dax"" has already been established as ""green,"" and ""wif"" in the next positions translates to ""red.""

In the fifth input, without the presence of ""bluf,"" we see that ""walm"" in the second position still outputs ""green"" in the second and third positions, indicating that the rule for ""walm"" is not directly dependent on the colors provided by ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""bluf.""

Analyzing all examples together, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat in terms of output. ""Walm"" does not have a color of its own, but triggers duplication.

Thus the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the immediately preceding word to repeat in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color code of the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: green yellow green blue green,green yellow green blue green,True,154
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the output includes the word ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of context or position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the following observations can be made:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears alone or at any position in a sequence, the output is consistently ""red"".
- ""wif"" doesn't seem to affect the color associated with other words. Other words have a defined color output regardless of the presence of ""wif"" (e.g., ""dax"" always maps to ""green,"" ""lug"" always maps to ""blue,"" etc.).
- The output for ""wif"" does not change in response to preceding or following words.

Considering these observations, it seems that the rule for ""wif"" is independent of context. Thus, the rule can be articulated as:

Rule: wif -> red. ""Wif"" directly translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" appears in an input, the respective output contains the word ""yellow"". The simple presence of ""zup"" in the input does not appear to affect the rest of the output sequence, which seems determined by the presence of other words such as ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax."" Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's start by analyzing the pattern of each color in relation to the words provided.

- In the first example, ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif"" and both are green and red respectively, ""bluf"" here also corresponds to ""green.""

- The second example, ""wif dax bluf,"" becomes ""red green green."" Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Since ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"" as it did in the first example.

- In the third example, ""wif dax zup bluf"" gives us ""red green yellow yellow."" Here, we see ""zup"" before ""bluf"" and it translates to ""yellow."" This aligns with the prior examples where ""bluf"" follows the color of the preceding word.

- The fourth example is ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" translating to ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and in both occurrences, ""bluf"" takes the same color as the word before it, ""blue.""

- The last example, ""zup bluf lug dax lug,"" is translated to ""yellow yellow blue green blue."" Again, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" takes on the ""yellow"" color.

From these observations, we can determine the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore:

bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color output that comes directly before it. The number of times the color is repeated seems equal to the number of words from ""walm"" to the start of the sequence or to the previous occurrence of ""walm."" Below are the examples broken down to illustrate this:

1. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red (""walm"" is 3 words from the start, so ""red"" repeats 3 times)
2. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green (""walm"" is 4 words from the start, so ""green"" repeats 4 times)
3. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow (""walm"" is 4 words from the start, so ""yellow"" repeats 4 times)
4. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue (""walm"" is 6 words from the start, so ""yellow"" repeats 3 times before the final ""lug"")
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (""walm"" is 2 words from the start, so ""yellow"" repeats 2 times)

Rule: walm -> repeats the color output that appears directly before it, as many times as there are words from ""walm"" to the start of the sequence or the previous ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,155
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following mappings for individual words and then deduce the meaning of ""lug"":

- Every time ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
- When ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red"" in one example and ""blue"" in another. However, since ""bluf"" occurs alongside ""lug"" which we know maps to ""blue"", and the output does not repeat ""blue"" in that instance, we can infer that ""bluf"" alone corresponds to ""red"".
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" is consistent across examples:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the input results in the word ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, we can notice that each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Here are the associations highlighted:

- wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
- wif lug bluf -> red blue blue
- dax zup dax zup wif -> green yellow green yellow red
- dax wif lug -> green red blue
- wif lug -> red blue

Comparing these inputs and outputs, we can see a consistent pattern: the word ""wif"" is always translated to the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

From the examples given, I induce the following rule:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. In the first example, ""lug zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue yellow red,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""zup"" must then correspond to ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" We already know ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" Since ""walm"" does not change the output color order and just repeats ""yellow,"" it is likely that ""walm"" means a repetition of the previous color. Thus, ""zup"" remains ""yellow.""

3. The third example's input ""zup bluf"" and output ""yellow yellow"" support our previous deduction where ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" given ""bluf"" does not correspond to any other color and the sequence is ""yellow"" repeated.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup dax wif zup,"" the output is ""yellow green red yellow."" Here, ""dax"" must correspond to ""green,"" and ""zup"" is still ""yellow"" before and after ""dax"" (which we've established as ""green"") and ""wif"" (""red"").

5. The fifth example, ""lug walm zup wif,"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow red."" ""Walm"" continues to indicate repetition, and ""zup"" remains consistently translating to ""yellow.""

With these observations, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" has a duplicating function, where it takes the previous color word and repeats it. Here is the analysis:

- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" meaning bluf takes ""wif"" (which means red) and repeats it.
- ""dax bluf wif lug"" results in ""green green red blue,"" meaning bluf takes ""dax"" (which means green) and repeats it before moving on to the next colors represented by ""wif"" and ""lug.""
- ""wif bluf"" consistently results in ""red red,"" reinforcing the duplication function of bluf.
- Finally, ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" gives ""blue blue red blue blue yellow,"" showing that bluf repeats the immediate previous color word (""lug"" which means blue and ""wif"" which means red).

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color word that comes before it.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" by comparing the inputs with their respective outputs.

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

In this example, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that corresponds to ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Here, ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that matches ""lug,"" which is blue.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

In this case, ""walm"" again seems to be a repetition of the color that matches ""lug,"" which is blue.

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" first repeats the color for ""wif,"" which is red, and later repeats the color for ""lug,"" which is blue.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

In this last example, ""walm"" repeats the color for ""dax,"" which is green.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule:
walm -> causes the repetition of the color denoted by the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word relates to a specific color output. The word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. 

Here's the breakdown:

- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"", suggesting ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"" to ""blue"" repeated as many times as it appears.
- ""dax lug dax wif dax"" translates to ""green blue green red green"", which further supports the notion that ""dax"" is ""green"". ""wif"" appears once and translates to ""red"".
- ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green"" and ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow"", indicating ""zup"" to be ""yellow"" and reinforcing ""dax"" as ""green"". Here the order of the words does change the order of the color outputs, but the color associated with each word doesn't change.
- ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green"".

So, based on these observations, the rule is:

dax -> ""green""
In order to determine the meaning of the word ""wif,"" I will look at each pair of inputs and outputs to see what is consistent when ""wif"" appears.

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

Input: lug dax zup wif
Output: blue green yellow red

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

In each instance where ""wif"" appears, the output includes ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of whatever other words it is used with.

Additionally, other words preceding ""wif"" seem to correspond to their own colors:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" when following ""dax"" and to ""red"" when following ""wif.""

The word ""bluf"" changes its output color depending on the word it follows, which suggests the position or previous word affects the output for ""bluf."" However, ""wif's"" meaning appears consistent despite the position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""bluf,"" let's look at the input and output patterns closely:

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- Applying 'bluf' after 'zup' results in a duplicated ""yellow.""

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
- Here, 'bluf' follows 'wif,' and the output is ""red red,"" so 'bluf' seems to duplicate the color associated with the word that comes just before it.

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- The pattern persists; 'wif' precedes 'bluf' and the color ""red"" associated with 'wif' is repeated.

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red
- Again, 'wif' precedes 'bluf' and its associated color ""red"" is repeated.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- 'Wif' comes before 'bluf' and is followed by ""red red.""

Based on these examples, we can conclude that the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicating the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to reference a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it in the sequence. This can be deduced from observing that the output colors repeat the color of the previous word whenever ""walm"" is used.

For example:

1. In ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" the word ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after ""walm"" comes ""green green."" 
2. In ""wif lug walm,"" the word ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" it's ""blue blue.""
3. In ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and right after ""walm"" it's ""yellow yellow,"" then ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and following ""walm"" it's ""red red red.""
4. In ""wif walm lug bluf,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and right after ""walm"" it's ""red red.""
5. In ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after the first ""walm"" it's ""green green,"" then ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and following the second ""walm"" it's ""red red red.""

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the word just before it to repeat two additional times (totaling three consecutive occurrences of that color).

walm -> repeats the previous color two more times

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, the word ""lug"" maps directly to the color ""blue.""
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each example provided.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color red. Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output:

1. lug wif bluf lug wif -> blue red red blue red
2. wif walm dax -> red red red green
3. dax wif bluf -> green red red
4. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red
5. wif lug dax -> red blue green

Looking at these examples, the consistent mapping is that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" No other context-dependency is indicated from the given examples.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the following color associations are observed:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> green
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, regardless of the position or context in the sequence, 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To induce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and the corresponding output for the given examples:

1. In the first example, among other words, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color ""blue.""

3. In the third and fourth examples, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green,"" but this doesn't directly reveal the meaning of ""bluf"" since it could be related to ""dax.""

4. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears twice and corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" which is similar to the first pair from the end.

Now, let's focus on the instances where ""bluf"" is isolated by other words:

- ""zup bluf lug"" produced ""yellow yellow blue.""
- ""lug bluf"" in the second example resulted in ""blue blue.""
- ""wif bluf zup"" yielded ""red red yellow.""

It appears that ""bluf"" consistently results in the color ""blue"" when it is isolated by different words. Therefore, the other words (zup, lug, dax, and wif) might be altering the color associated with ""bluf"" depending on their position relative to ""bluf"" or their pairing with it.

Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" seems to generally mean ""blue,"" but the output can be influenced by the surrounding words. However, we have a consistent observation that whenever ""bluf"" is isolated from its context, it corresponds to ""blue,"" thus giving us confidence in its meaning.

Rule: bluf -> blue. The meaning is the color blue, regardless of the surrounding context.
Analyzing the provided examples, let's identify a pattern that is consistent with the uses of ""walm"" and its corresponding output.

- Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
  Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

- Input: wif lug walm
  Output: red blue blue blue

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green

- Input: zup lug walm wif dax
  Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

- Input: dax walm wif dax
  Output: green green green red green

Based on these examples, we can deduce that the output color associated with ""walm"" depends on the word that comes before it.

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the repeated color in the output is red.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the repeated color in the output is blue.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the repeated color in the output is green.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" it transitions to yellow but follows with more colors in sequence.

It seems like ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word before it. However, there's another pattern for ""zup walm,"" which suggests that ""walm"" could have a dual function depending on the preceding word.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following rule:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word before it to repeat; with ""zup"" preceding it, ""walm"" triggers a sequence starting with yellow.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red. If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue. If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green. If ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it starts a varied sequence with yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, lug consistently translates to the color 'blue'. 

Rule: lug = blue.
Based on the input-output pairs provided:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively in the single instance they appear

By examining the patterns, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: Based on the supplied examples, the word ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red"". Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the output consistently includes the color ""red"" in the same position. Additionally, other words such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" correspond to other colors (""green,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green green"", respectively), but the word ""wif"" always translates to ""red.""

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following correspondence:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red"" and seems to be followed by an additional ""red.""

Every instance where ""zup"" appears, it translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of the surrounding words. There are no instances provided where ""zup"" results in any other color or sequence of colors. Therefore, we can induce the rule:

zup -> yellow.
bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a rule that the word ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, the color that corresponds to the previous word is repeated. 

- For ""zup wif bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" to red. The presence of ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to be repeated, resulting in ""yellow red red.""
- For ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. With ""bluf"" following, ""yellow"" is repeated, leading to ""yellow yellow.""
- For ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red. With ""bluf"" following, ""red"" is repeated, leading to ""red red.""
- For ""zup bluf,"" as with the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" causes a repetition of ""yellow,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow.""
- For ""wif walm lug bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" and ""lug"" are not associated with a response but seem to correspond to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively based on the output, and ""bluf"" causes the colors associated with ""lug"" (blue) to be duplicated, leading to ""red red red blue blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word multiple times. Here is the breakdown of the examples to support this deduction:

1. ""lug dax walm"" resulted in ""blue green green green."" After ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" the color green is repeated thrice.
2. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" outputted ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" After ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" the color blue is repeated thrice.
3. ""wif zup walm dax zup"" led to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" After ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" the color yellow is repeated thrice.
4. ""lug walm wif bluf"" resulted in ""blue blue blue red red."" After ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" the color blue is repeated twice (the pattern is slightly differed here but it could be the presence of ""bluf"" at the end, which may function differently).
5. ""zup walm dax lug"" produced ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" After ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" the color yellow is repeated thrice.

However, in examples 4 and 5, ""walm"" is followed by two and one words, respectively, making the pattern less clear since the repetition does not continue beyond that point.

Taking these observations into account, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output onwards, unless interrupted by the end of the sequence or potentially by specific other words (like ""bluf"" in example 4).

Thus:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times onwards.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
To determine the meaning of ""dax"", let's look at the provided examples and their corresponding outputs. We will focus on the positions where ""dax"" appears and the color it is associated with.

1. Input: ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" Output: ""green green red yellow red""
   - Here ""dax"" appears at the beginning and is associated with the color ""green"".

2. Input: ""wif dax"" Output: ""red green""
   - Here ""dax"" appears after ""wif"" and is again associated with the color ""green"".

3. Input: ""dax walm"" Output: ""green green green""
   - Here ""dax"" appears at the beginning, followed by ""walm"", and both are associated with the color ""green"".

4. Input: ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" Output: ""yellow yellow red green red yellow""
   - In this case, ""dax"" appears after ""wif"" and the corresponding color is ""green"" again.

5. Input: ""dax zup"" Output: ""green yellow""
   - ""dax"" is at the beginning and associated with ""green""; ""zup"" is at the end and associated with ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence. It doesn't seem to matter what other words ""dax"" is combined with; its output color doesn't change.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's examine each input and its corresponding output for patterns.

1. ""lug zup dax zup"" -> ""blue yellow green yellow""
2. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
4. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
5. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green""

From these lines, we make the following observations:
- Whenever the word ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" follows in the output.
- The color ""yellow"" is not produced by any other input word.

Based on these observations, we arrive at the following rule:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need first to identify any patterns in the input and the corresponding output.

Let's analyze each input and its output:

1. Input: zup bluf dax | Output: yellow yellow green
   Here, zup corresponds to yellow, bluf also to yellow, and dax to green.

2. Input: lug bluf | Output: blue blue
   Here, lug corresponds to blue, and bluf also to blue.

3. Input: zup bluf wif bluf | Output: yellow yellow red red
   We can see again zup corresponds to yellow, and bluf corresponds to yellow. Wif corresponds to red and the second bluf again to red.

4. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup | Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   Again, the associations are zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow, wif -> red, dax -> green.

5. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif | Output: red green red red yellow red
   And once more, wif -> red, dax -> green, bluf -> red (different from previous examples), zup -> yellow.

From the above patterns, we can propose the following rule for the word ""bluf"":

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word before it to adopt a color from, then it defaults to yellow, as seen in the first input where it followed ""zup"" (yellow) and there is no prior occurrence to determine its color.

So based on this, we can write:

bluf -> meaning: The color of the preceding word or yellow if none precedes it.

Note: This rule is based on the given examples and assumes that the positioning of ""bluf"" relative to other words is the determining factor for its meaning. There might still be ambiguity concerning what happens if ""bluf"" is the first word in the sequence because we don't have such an example. However, from the provided input and outputs, this rule seems to hold consistently.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Therefore:

wif walm zup -> red red red yellow: ""walm"" repeats the color red, which is associated with ""wif.""
wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue: ""walm"" repeats the color blue, which is associated with ""lug.""
lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue: ""walm"" repeats the color yellow, which is associated with ""zup.""
lug walm -> blue blue blue: ""walm"" repeats the color blue, associated with ""lug.""
dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green: ""walm"" repeats the color green, which is associated with ""dax.""

Rule: walm -> meaning: ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided where the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" can be determined as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" consistently. However, in the fourth example, there are other words like ""zup"" and ""wif"" corresponding to other colors, but here we are asked only about the word ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule deduced from the examples is:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each occurrence of the word ""wif"" in the input leads to an instance of ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, ""zup"" appears to consistently correspond to the color ""yellow."" However, its position in the sequence also seems to determine an additional color output that follows ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow red."" If ""zup"" comes before ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue.""

The sequence ""wif zup"" has an output ""red yellow,"" which suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position, but the color before ""yellow"" in the output seems to be determined by what word comes before ""zup."" Since ""wif"" is before ""zup,"" it precedes the ""yellow"" with ""red"" in the output.

In the last example, ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" the words ""dax, lug, walm"" translate to ""green, blue, blue"" respectively, and then ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" The color output sequence follows the word sequence until ""zup,"" where ""zup wif"" together outputs ""yellow red.""

From these observations, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and the color that follows directly after ""yellow"" is contingent on the word that comes immediately after ""zup"" in the input sequence.

zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples given, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" copies the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. zup dax bluf zup dax -> yellow green green yellow green
   ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", which is associated with ""green"", so ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"".

2. wif zup bluf lug -> red yellow yellow blue
   ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"", which is associated with ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"".

3. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
   ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", so ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"".

4. lug bluf -> blue blue
   ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"", which is associated with ""blue"", therefore ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"".

5. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green
   ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", hence ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> takes the color associated with the word immediately before it.
To deduce the rule, we must look for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. Here are the given inputs and outputs:

1. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

2. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

3. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

4. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

Looking at the patterns, here's what we can observe:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, the word that comes after ""walm"" in the output is always the same as the word immediately preceding ""walm."" This pattern is consistent across all examples. For instance, in example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" in the input, and in the output, the color after ""blue"" is ""blue"" (indicating ""zup"" is ""blue""). This means that ""walm"" makes the next word repeat the color of the previous word.

Based on this pattern, the rule appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the color that corresponds to the word following ""walm"" will be the same as the color assigned to the word immediately before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, lug consistently translates to the color blue regardless of its position or the words around it. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word lug seems to be:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever you see the word ""lug,"" you should translate it as ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Here's the breakdown of the rules applied to each input and output:

1. Input: zup lug dax lug
   Output: yellow blue green blue
   Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

2. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and in this context, ""walm"" appears to project the same color as ""dax"" which is ""green"".

3. Input: dax wif lug dax
   Output: green red blue green
   Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The first and last ""dax"" translate to ""green"", maintaining consistency.

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   Rule: Again ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"". ""walm"" in the presence of ""lug"" seems to maintain the ""blue"" color, while ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"".

5. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", further confirming the association of ""dax"" with ""green"".

Rule:
dax -> green
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's closely examine the context in which it appears and the corresponding output it generates.

1. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

3. Input: lug zup wif lug
   Output: blue yellow red blue

4. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

5. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

From the examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, there is no other factor that appears to influence this relationship, so we can conclude with high confidence that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color output every time it is used. The color that ""bluf"" is associated with changes based on the words that precede it. To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the context in which it is used and the corresponding output:

- Example 1: ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> Output: green yellow red red blue
- Example 2: ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax"" -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
- Example 3: ""dax zup bluf"" -> Output: green yellow yellow
- Example 4: ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> Output: red red blue green red
- Example 5: ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> Output: blue blue blue red red

By examining the patterns, we can observe that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when it follows certain words, and ""yellow"" when it follows others. More specifically:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" (Examples 4 and 5).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" (Examples 1, 2, and 3).

It appears that ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word preceding it, with ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and potentially other words translating to ""red"" and ""dax,"" ""zup"" translating to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the preceding word; ""red"" following ""wif,"" ""walm,"" or similar, and ""yellow"" following ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or similar.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color that immediately follows it, as evidenced by the repeating colors in the output. Each output color correlates with a specific input word (zup -> yellow, wif -> red, dax -> green, lug -> blue), and the term ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the next word to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the context of the examples consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each instance of the word ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, whenever the nonce word ""dax"" is used in the input, the output consistently includes the word ""green"". This indicates that the meaning of ""dax"" is ""green"".
From the given examples, it's possible to induce that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" This is supported by the fact that every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence.

Input: wif dax zup dax
Output: red green yellow green (wif corresponds to red)

Input: zup bluf wif
Output: yellow yellow red (wif corresponds to red at the end of the sequence)

Input: wif
Output: red (wif alone still corresponds to red)

Input: wif
Output: red (repetition of the input confirms the earlier observation)

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red (wif's position right before ""bluf"" still prompts red as the corresponding output)

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
The rule appears to be that each nonce word corresponds to a color. By comparing the inputs with the outputs, we can deduce the following associations:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Given this pattern, the word ""bluf"" always corresponds to the color red in the outputs.

Rule: bluf -> red
The provided examples consistently show patterns that help us deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"".

First, observe the outputs corresponding to known words:
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Now, let's examine the instances of ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   - Here, ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". The word ""walm"" also results in ""blue"".

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - In this example, ""lug"" > ""blue"", ""wif"" > ""red"". We can't decide what ""walm"" or ""bluf"" individually represent yet, but we have more instances to analyze.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - Again ""lug"" is ""blue"", followed by ""walm"" which also translates to ""blue"".

4. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   - Here ""zup"" > ""yellow"", ""dax"" > ""green"", ""lug"" > ""blue"". ""walm"" falls between ""zup"" and ""dax"" and translates to ""yellow"".

5. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - In this sequence, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", ""wif"" with ""red"", ""dax"" with ""green"", and ""zup"" with ""yellow"". ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow"".

Upon inspection, ""walm"" results in the color that comes immediately before it in the sequence. This rule holds true in all provided examples.

Rule:
walm -> the color represented by the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,163
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" The examples show a consistent association between the input ""lug"" and the output ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" appears to translate consistently to the color ""green"". Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning or rule for the word ""wif,"" we need to analyze the input and corresponding output pairs. The key here is to identify any patterns or consistencies across the examples.

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" ""Wif"" appears at the beginning and corresponds with the first ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds with ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" ""Wif"" is the first word and aligns with the first ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue."" ""Wif"" continues to correspond with ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue."" Each instance of ""wif"" aligns with ""red.""

No matter where ""wif"" appears in the sequence, it consistently corresponds with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". There is no variation in this translation across the different inputs, so it is clear that ""zup"" corresponds directly to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> yellow when following the word zup; otherwise, bluf -> blue.
Analyzing the examples provided, the pattern I notice is that:

- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue""
- ""dax"" results in ""green""

Each time ""walm"" appears, we can observe the number of color words that follow it:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" (three ""yellow"")
2. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" results in ""blue red yellow red red red"" (there's one ""yellow"" followed by two ""red"")
3. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"" (the first ""walm"" is followed by one ""yellow"" and the second ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"")
4. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (three ""blue"")
5. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue green blue blue blue"" (three ""blue"")

It seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color word corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times.

So, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after another word, output the color corresponding to that word three times.

walm -> The color of the word before it, repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm zup
    ",Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow,yellow green blue blue blue yellow,True,164
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples where the output is a sequence of colors correlating to the input sequence of words, we can deduce the meaning of lug from its consistent association with a particular color in the output.

In all examples given, whenever the word lug appears, the color blue is in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, we can induce that the word lug is associated with the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", we need to look for patterns between the inputs and outputs. Let's examine the given examples:

1. dax bluf => green green
2. zup walm lug zup wif dax => yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
3. wif dax bluf => red green green
4. dax walm => green green green
5. zup dax bluf => yellow green green

In examples 1, 3, and 5, we can see that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" since whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

To isolate ""dax,"" we can look at sentences with and without ""dax"" and compare the differences in the outputs. The word ""dax"" appears once in each of the first, third, fourth, and fifth examples, and twice in the second example.

Looking at the differences in the examples where ""dax"" is between two other words or at the beginning followed by another word, we can see that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"". In examples 1, 3, 4, and 5, wherever ""dax"" appears, ""green"" shows up in the output at the corresponding position. In example 2, ""dax"" is the second-to-last word and still translates to ""green"".

Given the above observations, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

The consistent output color associated with the input ""wif"" across all examples is red.
By examining the provided examples, we can infer a pattern in the transition from the input containing the nonce word 'zup' and the corresponding output. Below is an analysis of each input-output pair:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - 'lug' corresponds to a single 'blue' and 'walm' results in three 'blue'. 'Zup' precedes these colors and results in 'yellow'.

2. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'bluf' also corresponds to 'red', and 'zup' follows these colors and translates to 'yellow'.

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'walm' translates to additional 'red', 'dax' is equal to 'green', and 'zup' at the end results in 'yellow'.

4. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red
   - When 'zup' leads the sequence, it results in 'yellow', 'bluf' translates to 'yellow' here, and 'wif' is 'red'.

5. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - 'Zup' leads and corresponds to 'yellow', and 'wif' is consistently 'red'.

From these observations, we can deduce that the nonce word 'zup' always corresponds to the color 'yellow', regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, the nonce word ""bluf"" is associated with the color that had been previously mentioned. To determine the meaning of ""bluf"", let's analyze each example.

1. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows it, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow."" 

2. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green

   In this sequence, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color ""green,"" and ""bluf"" then also corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

   ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and it corresponds to ""red"" as well.

4. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

   In this case, ""bluf"" gives us ""red,"" the same as the color associated with the previous word ""wif."" 

5. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: red red yellow yellow red

   Here, ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and then after ""zup,"" corresponding to ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, which are the colors associated with the preceding words.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color meaning of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat the color of the word prior to ""walm"". Here's the rule induction based on each example:

- In the first example, ""lug dax walm wif"", the sequence is ""blue green green green red"". The word before ""walm"" is ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"" we see repeated ""green"" until a new color word appears (""wif"" -> red).
  
- In the second example, ""lug walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"". Since ""lug"" is ""blue"", and it is followed by ""walm"", the output continues to be ""blue"".
  
- In the third example, ""zup walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and following ""walm"", it continues to be ""yellow"".
  
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"", the output is ""yellow red red red"". ""Wif"" is ""red"", and ""walm"" causes the sequence to continue with ""red"" until the end.

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif"", the output is ""blue blue blue red"". ""Lug"" is blue, and it is followed by ""walm"", so the output continues to be ""blue"" until a new word ""wif"" introduces ""red"".

Rule: walm -> causes the next outputs to repeat the color of the word immediately before it until a new color word is introduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,165
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can see that each instance of the word ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue"" in the output.

Here are the associations between inputs and outputs deduced from the examples:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" always translates to ""blue""
- ""walm"" following ""lug"" still translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue blue""

From the patterns observed, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position within the sequence or the other words surrounding it. Therefore, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green."" Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Here is the correlation for each input and output:

- Input: dax zup bluf // Output: green yellow yellow
- Input: dax lug // Output: green blue
- Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm // Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- Input: lug zup dax zup // Output: blue yellow green yellow
- Input: wif bluf dax // Output: red red green

Rule: dax -> green.
From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" consistently. No matter the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence, it always translates to ""red"" in the output sequence. This direct mapping does not appear to depend on the surrounding words, as ""wif"" always results in the same output without variation.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems clear:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to look at the patterns in the given inputs and their respective outputs:

- ""zup wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red red.""
- ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red green blue.""
- ""lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red red.""
- ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""
- ""dax zup bluf"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow.""

From these examples, we can observe the following patterns:

- When ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" as seen from the instances where these words occur without ""bluf.""
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" as seen in instances where ""dax"" is present without ""bluf.""

With these clues, we notice that ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat, except when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" where it simply translates to ""red"" regardless of the preceding color.

Hence, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, except when preceded by ""wif,"" where ""bluf"" always translates to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word, unless ""wif"" precedes it, then it means ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze how the output changes when ""walm"" is introduced in different examples.

1. zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

In this series, when ""walm"" appears, ""blue"" follows which was the color immediately preceding it, so ""walm"" might mean to repeat the previous color.

2. wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Again, ""red"" follows ""walm,"" which was the color immediately before it.

3. zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Once more, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow,"" which is the color that was before ""walm.""

4. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Each time ""walm"" appears, the color that follows is a repetition of the one just before ""walm.""

5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Here too, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue,"" the color that proceeds it.

Rule: walm -> meaning. Walm means to repeat the color that was mentioned before it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,166
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, dax correlates with the color green each time it appears. It does not seem to matter where in the sequence dax is located; it consistently translates to green. Therefore, we can induce the rule that the nonce word dax represents the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, each individual word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Specifically:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

In each case, the word “wif” corresponds to the color ""red"". Therefore, we can deduce that:

wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" means ""red"".
Rule: The word ""zup"" seems to take on the meaning of ""yellow"" repeatedly after the colors that correspond to the other nonce words that precede it. Each original word corresponds to a color, and ""zup"" adds the color ""yellow"" to the output sequence in an amount equivalent to the number of color words preceding it. Specifically, the following associations can be made:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""

When ""zup"" is used after other color-related nonce words, it repeats ""yellow"" for each color word that precedes it.

zup -> ""yellow"" repeated for each color word preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each of the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

Analyzing the outputs, ""bluf"" always generates the color mentioned immediately before it. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is green followed by another green. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is red followed by another red.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be repeating the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that the word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the last color mentioned before it. In other words, ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color of the preceding word will be repeated for an undetermined number of times. Here's the breakdown of why this makes sense according to the examples:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Explanation: ""wif"" equates to red, which is then followed by ""walm"" causing the red to repeat.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
Explanation: ""dax"" represents green, and ""walm"" proceeds it causing the green to repeat, followed by a ""zup"" which changes the color to yellow.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Explanation: Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and since ""walm"" follows, it results in repetition of the color blue.

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
Explanation: ""dax"" is followed by ""zup"" equivalent to yellow. ""Walm"" repeats the yellow. Then ""wif"" changes the sequence to red.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
Explanation: ""wif"" is red, and ""lug"" is blue. ""Walm"" comes after the blue and so the blue is repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color mentioned immediately before the word ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue

Each example shows the word ""lug"" consistently translating to the color ""blue."" This is evident from its position changing in the sequence but the corresponding color ""blue"" always being present in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in every provided example.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" For each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we need to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by analyzing the patterns of input and corresponding output colors.

1. In ""dax walm zup"" the output is ""green green green yellow."" Here, ""dax"" and ""walm"" both precede ""zup,"" and ""dax"" has consistently mapped to ""green"" in both examples where it appears. Therefore, it does not seem that ""zup"" represents ""green.""

2. In ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" and in ""zup dax,"" the output is ""yellow green."" This suggests that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" when it precedes another word, but we need more examples to confirm.

3. In ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" the output is ""yellow red red yellow blue."" Here, ""zup"" is both the first and the fourth word. According to the output, it is yellow both times, which supports the idea that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

4. Finally, in ""lug bluf zup lug,"" the output is ""blue blue yellow blue."" Once again, ""zup"" precedes the final word ""lug"" and maps to ""yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow,"" no matter where it appears in the sequence of words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples, the term ""bluf"" appears to mean the same color as the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the evidence:

1. ""zup bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow red,"" where ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
2. ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue green blue,"" where ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
3. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" where ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" where ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif,"" which is red.
5. ""lug bluf dax lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue,"" where ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means taking on the color of the word that comes right before it.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" corresponds to a color pattern in the output. To determine its meaning, let's analyze the pattern associated with ""walm"" in each example:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

- ""walm"" corresponds to the second red in the output. The next color is green, which does not seem to follow the pattern of the first ""wif"".

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

- ""walm"" corresponds to the third blue in the output. The first ""wif"" is red. There is no ""dax"" or ""zup"" - only ""lug"" and ""walm.""

Input: lug walm zup lug walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

- ""walm"" corresponds to third blue then yellow, with a sequence of blue before each ""walm"". This is the first instance where we can see a pattern that has a ""zup"" after ""walm"", resulting in a yellow. This might indicate ""walm"" becomes yellow if followed by ""zup"".

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

- ""walm"" corresponds to the second green followed by blue.

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

- ""walm"" corresponds to both the second green and the first yellow, with the pattern being green followed by yellow, indicating the ""walm"" following ""zup"" is yellow again.

From these observations, we can deduce a pattern for ""walm"":

1. When ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax,"" it induces a green color in the output. 
2. When ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" it induces a yellow color in the output. 

Thus, we can conclude:
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" followed by ""zup"" -> yellow

The presence of other words like ""wif"" and ""lug"" does not conclusively change the output color for ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> green when immediately following ""dax""; walm -> yellow when followed by ""zup"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. It appears that each word in the input corresponds to a distinct color in the output, independent of context or position.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" is included in the output sequence, corresponding to the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to green, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue. Regardless of the position of the word ""wif"" in a sequence, it always corresponds to the color red.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules:

1. ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"".
2. ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".
3. ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"".
4. ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".
5. ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the input sequence.

The output for instances of ""zup"" is always ""yellow"". This holds true whether ""zup"" appears at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the sequence. Therefore, we can conclude:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow"".

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   
   
3. Input: lug bluf dax bluf
   Output: blue blue green green
   
   
4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
   
5. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue

Observations:

- ""bluf"" always produces ""blue,"" but the number of times it does so varies.
- The first time ""bluf"" appears, it only produces one ""blue.""
- If ""lug"" appears before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" doubles (from one ""blue"" to two).
- ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""red"" respectively and do not always double like ""bluf"" does under the same condition.

Therefore, based on the given examples, ""bluf"" seems to represent ""blue,"" and when it is preceded by ""lug,"" it doubles the output.

Rule: bluf -> ""blue,"" and when preceded by ""lug,"" the number of ""blue"" in the output is doubled.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to dictate repeating the color of the previous word three times in the output. To confirm this pattern, let's examine each example:

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red
The word ""walm"" is proceeded by the word ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", and the output for ""walm"" is ""red"" repeated three times.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow
Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to the color ""green"", and ""walm"" produces three greens.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
""Walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), leading to ""red"" being output three times.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
""Walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the output for ""walm"" is three instances of ""yellow"".

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and produces red three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True,169
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue"" regardless of what precedes or follows it in the input. Therefore, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"". Each instance of the word ""wif"" in the input is directly translated to ""red"" in the output.

Here are the examples for clarification:

- Input: wif -> Output: red (wif is directly translated to red)
- Input: dax wif -> Output: green red (dax corresponds to green and wif to red)
- Input: dax wif -> Output: green red (repetition of the above example, with the same translation)
- Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow (zup corresponds to yellow, bluf to yellow, wif to red, dax to green, and the sequence is consistent regardless of order)
- Input: lug wif lug bluf -> Output: blue red blue blue (lug corresponds to blue, wif to red, and bluf to blue)

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can observe the corresponding outputs for each input that contains the nonce word 'zup'. It appears that 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the output. Whether 'zup' is at the beginning, middle, or end of an input sequence, the 'yellow' color always appears in the output sequence at the corresponding position.

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red 

Input: zup dax walm lug wif -> Output: yellow green green green blue red 

Input: zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow yellow red 

Input: dax zup bluf -> Output: green yellow yellow 

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax -> Output: yellow green green yellow green 

From this, it is clear that regardless of the position of other words, 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow'. 

Rule: zup -> 'yellow'
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the pattern for the word ""bluf"" by examining its context and the associated outputs.

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"", identical to ""dax"".

Input: lug bluf zup lug
Output: blue blue yellow blue

In this sequence, ""lug"" equates to ""blue"", ""zup"" once again to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" matches ""blue"", the same as ""lug"".

Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

The pattern repeats with ""zup"" meaning ""yellow"", ""dax"" meaning ""green"", ""lug"" meaning ""blue"", and ""bluf"" translating as ""blue"" just like ""lug"".

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

The color ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug"", ""red"" to ""wif"", and once more ""bluf"" matches ""blue"" as with ""lug"". The word ""walm"" does not correspond to any color but we can infer it does not affect ""bluf"" since the output for ""bluf"" remains ""blue"".

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Here we see ""wif"" equals ""red"" and ""bluf"" has the output ""red"".

Rule:
From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word that precedes it directly. If ""bluf"" is the first word, it defaults to ""red"" as in the final example.

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" means the color associated with the word that precedes it; if it's the first word, the meaning is ""red"".
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of its occurrence and the corresponding output colors.

1. In the first example:
   Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""walm"" appears twice and is followed by red red yellow the first time, and by yellow yellow the second time.

2. In the second example:
   Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   ""walm"" appears once and is followed by yellow yellow.

3. In the third example:
   Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""walm"" appears once and is followed by yellow yellow.

4. In the fourth example:
   Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   ""walm"" appears twice; the first time it is followed by green red and the second time by green green.

5. In the fifth example:
   Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""walm"" occurs once and is followed by red red.

Now, let's try to identify a pattern. ""Walm"" seems to always add at least two colors to the output pattern. When we look closely, we see that ""walm"" is associated with an addition of ""red"" and one or more instances of the color that comes before it in the input sequence.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the preceding word, add two instances of that color, and then add ""red."" 

Let's apply this rule to validate each example:

- Example 1: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" is followed by ""red red"" then ""yellow"" from ""zup"" twice.
- Example 2: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow yellow"" as per our rule.
- Example 3: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow yellow.""
- Example 4: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" is followed by ""green green"" and ""red.""
- Example 5: 'wif' corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" is followed by ""red red.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the color from the previous word twice, then add ""red"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax zup wif walm
    ",Output: yellow green yellow red red red red,yellow green yellow red red red,False,170
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue."" Regardless of the word that appears before ""lug,"" the color blue is always part of the output, and when ""lug"" is given alone, the only output is ""blue."" It is also evident that the other words may correlate to other specific colors.

Here's the breakdown:
- wif lug -> red blue (wif correlates with red)
- zup lug -> yellow blue (zup correlates with yellow)
- dax lug -> green blue (dax correlates with green)
- lug -> blue (only lug results in blue)
- lug bluf wif -> blue blue red (bluf does not seem to change the output color set since ""wif"" still correlates with red)

So the rule for ""lug"" can be defined as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Explanation:
In every example provided, whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" This one-to-one correspondence suggests that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output. There is no variation in this pattern, thus the rule is consistent across all examples.
From examining the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Here are the mappings based on the inputs and outputs given:

- ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow green green red yellow yellow blue""

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.
From the examples provided, we can infer that ""bluf"" is a modifier that duplicates the color associated with the word that follows it in the sequence. Each example has ""bluf"" followed by a word that corresponds to a color, and the output is the duplication of that color. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"" – ""wif"" must mean ""red"" and ""bluf"" causes it to appear twice.
- ""zup bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow"" – ""zup"" must mean ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" causes it to appear twice.
- ""zup wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow red red"" – ""bluf"" affects only the word ""wif"" that directly follows it, resulting in ""red"" being repeated.
- ""dax bluf wif zup"" leads to ""green green red yellow"" – ""dax"" must mean ""green"" and ""bluf"" duplicates the ""green"" but does not affect ""wif"" since it does not immediately follow ""bluf"".
- ""dax lug bluf dax"" leads to ""green blue blue green"" – ""lug"" must mean ""blue"" and ""bluf"" duplicates ""blue"" since it immediately follows ""bluf"". ""dax"" at the end stands alone.

Based on this, the rule for ""bluf"" is the following:

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the paired keyword that immediately follows it.

Therefore:

bluf -> duplicates the following color.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a sequence of repeated color outputs. Specifically, the number of repeated output colors depends on the preceding word. Let's analyze each example to understand the pattern.

1. Example: ""wif walm zup walm""
   Output: ""red red red yellow yellow yellow""
   Rule observed: ""wif"" before ""walm"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times before the sequence. ""zup"" before ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times after.

2. Example: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   Rule observed: ""zup"" before ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

3. Example: ""zup dax lug walm zup lug""
   Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
   Rule observed: ""lug"" before ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times.

4. Example: ""wif walm dax zup""
   Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   Rule observed: ""dax"" between ""walm"" and ""zup"" changes the output order from the observed ""red red red yellow"" to ""red red red green yellow.""

5. Example: ""wif bluf dax walm""
   Output: ""red red green green green""
   Rule observed: ""bluf"" does not directly precede ""walm"", and ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", which appears to lead to a repeated ""green"" instead of ""red.""

Combining the observations, it seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of colors, with the specific color and number of repetitions depending on the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Furthermore, the color corresponds to the color associated with the preceding word:
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" (preceding walm and following another word) -> ""green""

It seems that ""walm"" causes the previous word's color to repeat three times if ""walm"" is the immediate next word. If there is an intervening word (""dax""), though, the repetition changes to the color green three times.

Rule:
walm -> Triggers the repetition of three instances of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it unless there is an intervening word like ""dax"", in which case the color green is repeated three times instead.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif dax lug bluf zup
    ",Output: yellow red green blue blue yellow,yellow red green blue blue yellow,True,171
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it translates to the color ""blue"".
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce a direct correspondence between nonce words and specific color words in English. Here's what can be inferred:

- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow""

In each example, regardless of position or surrounding words, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the examples given. By comparing the inputs with their respective outputs, let's try to deduce the rule.

In the first example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"". ""Dax"" by itself isn't given in any other examples, but we know that it results in ""green"" in the output.

In the second example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red"". We can see that ""lug"" precedes ""blue"" in the output and ""walm"" isn’t shown in other examples, but its presence also results in ""blue"" in the output. ""Bluf"" is present and translates to ""red"", which is consistent with ""wif bluf"" resulting in ""red red"".

In the third and fourth examples, ""wif bluf"" consistently translates to ""red red"", indicating that every word in the input is repeated in the output color pattern as many times as there are unique words before 'wif'. Thus, 'wif"" seems to function as a delimiter that ensures ""bluf"" translates to two instances of ""red"".

In the fifth example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red"". We know from the second example that ""lug"" results in ""blue"". It seems that ""wif"" functions as a repeat signal for the color linked with the word before it.

Given this pattern, a rule for ""wif"" could be:

wif -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding unique word as many times as there have been unique words before 'wif'.

Rule: ""wif"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the prior word, with the number of repetitions equalling the count of unique words before 'wif' in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to the word ""yellow"". Here is the analysis:

1. ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"", and based on other examples, ""wif"" is consistently ""red"". This suggests that ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

2. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow"". We can see that ""dax"" is ""green"", repeating the colors for repeating words. Following this pattern, ""walm wif walm"" translates to ""green red green"", and hence ""zup"" at the end must represent ""yellow"".

3. ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" is ""blue"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and given the symmetry, both instances of ""zup"" on either end correlate with ""yellow"".

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow"". Other words are consistently translated as before, leaving ""zup"" as ""yellow"".

5. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". The word ""lug"" repeats as ""blue"", leaving ""zup"" as ""yellow"".

Therefore, based on the examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by comparing the input and the output. 

Looking at the first example:
Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red

The word ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". Since ""bluf"" precedes ""red"" and ""yellow"" without changing the output color, it suggests that ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the previous color"".

To confirm this, we can look at the second example:
Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue

Here, after ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", we again have ""bluf"" followed by its output ""yellow"". Supporting our initial deduction that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color"". ""lug"" translates as a new color, ""blue"".

Let's look at the third example:
Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow

""dax"" translates to ""green"" and is immediately followed by ""bluf"" with the output also being ""green"". Again, this supports the idea that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color"". The words ""wif"", ""lug"", and ""zup"" all lead to different colors, which means they are not affected by the rule we're deducing for ""bluf"".

The fourth example:
Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
Output: green green yellow yellow green

In this sequence, ""dax"" goes to ""green"", and ""bluf"" repeats ""green"". ""zup"" goes to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow"". The final ""dax"" again maps to ""green"". 

The final example:
Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Here, ""wif"" turns to ""red"", and ""bluf"" indeed repeats the ""red"".

So, based on all provided examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that immediately precedes it.
By analyzing the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. Here is the breakdown:

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red. Following ""wif"" we have ""walm"", and the output is the color red repeated three times following the initial red.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue. Following ""lug"" we have ""walm"", and the output is the color blue repeated three times following the initial blue.

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- ""wif"" is red, ""bluf"" is green, ""dax"" is not repeated so it retains the same color, ""bluf"" is green, ""wif"" is red. Following this last ""wif"" we have ""walm"", and the output is the color red repeated three times after the initial red. ""Lug"" produces blue, and the final ""wif"" remains red.

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
- ""wif"" is red. Following ""wif"" we have ""walm"", and the output is the color red repeated three times following the initial red. ""Lug"" produces blue, and since ""bluf"" follows, it also remains blue.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" is yellow. Following ""zup"" we have ""walm"", and the output is the color yellow repeated three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True,172
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

Rule: lug -> blue
From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax."" Each instance of ""dax"" is paired with the color green in the output. The other words in the inputs correspond to different colors in the outputs. For example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Let's list the translations:

- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""bluf"" -> red (observed only in the last example)

With this, we can now deduce the meaning of ""dax"":

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look at the patterns in the given examples:

- In the first example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green."" Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and appears on both sides of ""wif,"" while ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" seems to indicate a transition or an inversion.
  
- In the second example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""wif"" seems to translate to ""red"" in this context.

- In the third example, ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red."" Here, ""wif"" appears between ""walm"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which translates to ""red red red,"" possibly suggesting that ""wif"" causes a repetition or intensification of the color represented by ""walm.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" translates to ""green green red yellow red."" Here, we observe that both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" mean ""green,"" while ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" translating to ""yellow."" The presence of ""wif"" is associated with a change in color.

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" Here, ""wif"" appears at the end of the sequence and results in ""red"" which is not a repetition of the prior colors.

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" signals a change in color and could possibly indicate the color ""red."" However, the rules seem not consistent in all the examples. Specifically, in the third example, ""wif"" seems to cause the duplication or emphasis of a color (""green"" turns into three ""reds""). Also, ""wif"" is always associated with the color ""red"" after it except in the first example.

Therefore, the most consistent rule that can be induced is that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" but context affects its function slightly. In isolation, ""wif"" means ""red,"" but when combined with other words, ""wif"" could mean a transition to a new color or a change in the sequence, often involving the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> ""red"" (with context-specific variations)
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow."" When ""zup"" occurs after another word, it seems to carry over the color attribute from that word when applicable, such as in the example ""zup wif"" where ""wif"" presumably means ""red,"" resulting in ""yellow red.""

Here is the pattern based on the inputs and outputs:

- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red"" (implies ""wif"" might mean ""red"")
- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"" (implies ""bluf"" might mean ""yellow"" or ""zup"" somehow duplicates its own meaning)
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" (consistent output for ""zup"" on its own)
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow"" (further supports the consistency of ""zup"")
- ""lug zup lug"" -> ""blue yellow blue"" (implies ""lug"" means ""blue"")

With the above observations, we can conclude:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it precedes the word ""wif."" However, when it follows the word ""lug,"" bluf translates to ""blue."" To determine if there is a more general rule, let's consider all instances:

1. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
2. zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
3. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
5. wif bluf -> red red

From these examples, here are the observations:

- ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" when it immediately follows ""lug.""
- ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in all other instances where it doesn't immediately follow ""lug.""

Given this, the most consistent interpretation is that ""bluf"" means ""red"" except when it directly follows ""lug,"" in which case it means ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" (general rule); when preceded by ""lug,"" bluf -> ""blue"" (exception to the general rule).
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern in which it appears and the corresponding output.

1. ""dax walm zup"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow""
2. ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""
3. ""dax walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red""
4. ""dax walm wif zup"" corresponds to ""green green green red yellow""
5. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" corresponds to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""

Observing each occurrence of ""walm,"" it seems to produce an output with three colors repeating. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to always result in ""green green green"" or ""blue blue blue"" depending on the word that precedes it, while the other words (""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"") correspond to a single color output.

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" which is then followed by ""green green green"" for ""walm.""
- In example 5, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" which is then followed by ""blue blue blue"" for ""walm.""

Based on these observations, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, for a total of three repetitions of that color.

Rule: walm -> triggers a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:

Rule:
Based on the examples provided, every time the word ""lug"" appears, it is translated to ""blue"". There doesn't appear to be any context-changing factors within the provided examples, as ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other nonce words such as ""zup"" or ""dax"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" when they accompany ""lug"", but the meaning of ""lug"" remains unchanged.

   Output: green blue blue blue
   - Once again, ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"".

Consistently, ""dax"" maps to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Looking at the examples given, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif."" In each instance, ""wif"" appears to correspond with a particular color in the output:

1. ""dax bluf wif lug"" results in ""green green red blue"" -- after ""dax"" (green) and ""bluf"" (green), ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
2. ""dax wif"" results in ""green red"" -- after ""dax"" (green), ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
3. ""zup walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red"" -- after ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" (yellow), ""lug"" (yellow), and ""blue,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
4. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" results in ""green blue blue blue green red red green"" -- ""wif"" comes after a sequence and translates to ""red.""
5. ""lug dax wif lug"" results in ""blue green red blue"" -- ""wif"" comes after ""dax"" (green) and translates to ""red.""

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context it is placed in. Thus, we can conclude the meaning of ""wif"" is ""red"" or that ""wif"" simply translates to the color red in this context. 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that each unique word maps to a specific color. Analyzing the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can make the following associations:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> green green green (as seen in the third example)

Given that ""zup"" appears and the color ""yellow"" is added to the sequence in the output each time, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the word 'bluf' consistently corresponds to the output 'yellow yellow,' regardless of its position in the input or the surrounding context.

Here are the patterns we can see:

- 'zup bluf' produces 'yellow yellow'.
- 'zup bluf wif' adds 'red' to the end of 'yellow yellow,' which might suggest that 'wif' corresponds to 'red.'
- 'dax wif bluf' produces 'green red red,' and based on the previous deduction, the 'wif' likely corresponds to the first 'red.' Given that 'bluf' follows 'wif' here and still results in 'yellow yellow' (the second 'red' and last 'yellow'), it seems 'bluf' keeps its meaning despite the previous word. Thus, 'dax' probably corresponds to 'green.'
- 'dax zup bluf' leads to 'green yellow yellow,' which further supports that 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' 'zup' to 'yellow,' and 'bluf' to 'yellow yellow' regardless of what precedes it.

Therefore, the rule for 'bluf' can be stated as:

Rule:
bluf -> yellow yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each example and the associated output. We can see a pattern where the output changes whenever ""walm"" is present in the input.

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to a triple ""red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to double ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to triple ""red"" as confirmed.
   - ""walm"" appears twice after ""lug"" and ""wif.""

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""walm"" seems to change the output of ""zup"" to a triple ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but it's now next to ""walm.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to triple ""red.""

From these examples, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word a certain number of times. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times, following ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times, and following ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated twice. It is unclear what the exact rule is for the repetition count, as it repeats the color for both one and two words before it. However, based on the limited data, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it a specific but indeterminate number of times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True,174
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"", regardless of its position in a sequence of nonce words. Other words, such as ""walm"" and ""wif"" also correspond to colors, with ""walm"" meaning ""blue"" and ""wif"" meaning ""red"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". The output sequence of colors matches the sequence of nonce words.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Reviewing the input-output pairs:

1. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow red green red red
2. Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green
3. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
4. Input: wif dax lug -> Output: red green blue
5. Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green

By comparing these, we can deduce the following:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" also correlates with ""red"" as seen in the first input-output pair.
- ""walm"" correlates with ""green.""

Now let's focus on ""dax"":

- In the first input-output pair, ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- In the second input-output pair, ""dax"" is again associated with ""green.""
- In the third pair, ""dax"" is the first word and is associated with ""green.""
- In the fourth pair, ""dax"" is again associated with ""green.""
- In the fifth example, which is identical to the second, ""dax"" is consistently associated with ""green.""

In all instances, no matter its position in the sequence, ""dax"" has consistently correlated with the output ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

In every example provided, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" Regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input or the other words surrounding it, the output for ""wif"" remains consistently ""red."" Therefore, it can be concluded that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red."" 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow"". However, it doesn't map to just the word ""yellow"", but rather to a repetition of the word ""yellow"" for each instance of the word ""walm"" following ""zup"" until a different color word is used or the sequence ends.

Here's a breakdown of each given example:

Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
Explanation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""zup"" has one instance of ""walm"" following it, which adds three instances of ""blue"" in the output.

Input: lug walm zup -> Output: blue blue blue yellow
Explanation: ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" and ""zup"" stands alone at the end, corresponding to a single ""yellow.""

Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green
Explanation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""Zup"" occurs at the beginning, followed by two other color words, therefore it's a single ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
Explanation: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green."" Then, ""zup walm"" means there's one ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and two more for the single instance of ""walm"" that follows it.

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
Explanation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""bluf"" to ""green"" again, ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Here we have two instances of ""zup"": the first ""zup"" is followed by other color words, so it maps to a single ""yellow."" The second ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which doesn't have an established meaning, but can be inferred as ""green"" from previous patterns, and it occurs once before ""lug,"" so it results in two ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> the word ""yellow"" followed by additional instances of ""yellow"" for each instance of ""walm"" following it until another non-""walm"" color word or the end of the sequence.

Given the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule by looking at the context in which ""bluf"" is used in each example.

Input: lug dax bluf
Output: blue green green

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green

From the given input-output pairs, we can observe that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green"":

- In the first and second examples, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax lug"" and still translates to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""wif"" and ""dax,"" and it translates to ""red green."" However, ""green"" is consistent with the previous examples as the output of ""bluf.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" occurs twice, preceded by different words each time (""lug"" and ""zup""), yet ""bluf"" translates to ""blue yellow"" which appears to break the pattern. However, the ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug,"" and ""yellow"" to ""zup,"" while the following ""dax"" after ""bluf"" consistently gives us ""green.""

Given this, we can conclude with reasonable certainty that the meaning is:

Rule: bluf -> green. 

The apparent anomaly in the last example is due to the added complexity of the input sequence where ""bluf"" seems to carry over the color of the preceding word as well, but ""green"" is the consistent output for ""bluf.""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to represent a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. It can be deduced from the examples that:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"",
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"",
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and 
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Wherever ""walm"" follows any of these words, the corresponding color word is repeated multiple times in the output. 

Let's break down the given examples:

1. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"":
   - ""lug"" -> ""blue""
   - ""bluf"" is likely a typo or a non-matching word, which has been ignored in the output.
   - ""wif"" -> ""red""
   - ""wif walm"" -> ""red red"", since the ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and repeats the ""red"".

2. ""lug walm"":
   - ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"", ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""lug"" (""blue"") to be repeated two additional times, for a total of three repeats.

3. ""lug walm"":
   - Same as the previous example. 

4. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"":
   - ""wif"" -> ""red""
   - ""lug"" -> ""blue""
   - ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"", ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (""yellow"").

5. ""dax walm zup walm"":
   - ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"", ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (""green"").
   - ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"", ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""zup"" (""yellow"").

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to instruct us to repeat the color word preceding it two additional times, meaning we say the color a total of three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word that comes directly before walm two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,175
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following color associations with the given words:

- wif -> red
- walm -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

Given that ""lug"" implies a change in output without a clear pattern in terms of color specified, we can determine that ""lug"" influences the output, changing the expected color association, for example:

- Example 1: ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" leads to an ""Output"" with a sequence of ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow,"" where we would expect ""red blue yellow"" to repeat, but ""lug"" changes the pattern after its first occurrence, turning the expected ""red"" into ""yellow"" and ""blue.""
- Example 2: ""zup lug"" gives ""yellow blue,"" suggesting that after ""lug,"" a yellow turns into a blue.
- Example 3: ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" leads to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" implying that ""lug"" changed the expected pattern.
- Example 4: ""lug zup dax wif"" leads to ""blue yellow green red,"" and since ""lug"" is at the beginning, it's not altering the pattern but defining it as ""blue.""
- Example 5: ""lug dax"" gives ""blue green,"" reinforcing that ""lug"" on its own is represented by ""blue.""

From these observations, we can infer that ""lug"" on its own is associated with the color ""blue."" However, its presence within a sequence can alter the expected outputs of the following words.

Rule: lug -> blue on its own; alters the expected color sequence of the following words when placed within a sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in every given example. Each time ""dax"" is present in the input, the color green appears in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The order within the output matches the order of the words in the input. Considering the consistent color association for 'dax' with 'green' and 'lug' with 'blue,' and observing the outputs where 'wif' is present, we can induce that 'wif' is associated with the color 'red.'

Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax lug wif"" results in ""green blue red,"" indicating 'dax' is 'green,' 'lug' is 'blue,' and 'wif' would then be 'red.'
- ""lug wif dax"" results in ""blue red green,"" maintaining the order of color assignment, which further supports that 'wif' is 'red.'
- ""wif bluf,"" leading to ""red red,"" suggests 'bluf' is also assigned the color 'red,' making 'wif' again associated with 'red.'
- ""wif lug"" gives ""red blue,"" which continues to align with 'wif' being 'red' and 'lug' being 'blue.'
- ""dax wif"" provides ""green red,"" where 'dax' is 'green,' confirming once more that 'wif' is 'red.'

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern about the word ""zup."" In each case, it translates to the word ""yellow."" However, it is not just a simple mapping. It seems that ""zup"" generates additional outputs following it, specifically ""yellow"" repeats according to the total number of colours mentioned before ""zup"" in the input. 

For example:
- In the first input, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" does not have a corresponding output, which suggests it is a null operator (or it could be ""blue"" as well, as it follows ""lug"" in the third input). Since there is one colour before ""zup,"" it is followed by one more ""yellow"" resulting in ""yellow blue blue blue.""
- In the second input, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Following ""zup,"" there are two yellows, which aligns with the two colors mentioned before it.
- This pattern holds for the rest of the examples, with the output ""yellow"" replicating a number of times equal to the number of distinct color words before ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> the word ""yellow,"" followed by n additional ""yellow""s, where n equals the number of color words that appear in the input sequence before the word ""zup.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the word that precedes it to be repeated in the output with its corresponding color. Here is the analysis:

- In the first example ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"". The word ""zup"" which precedes ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and it is repeated once after ""bluf"".
- In the second example ""dax bluf"", the output is ""green green"". The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and it is repeated in the output after ""bluf"".
- In the third example ""zup bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". Again, the word ""zup"" is repeated in the output after ""bluf"".
- In the fourth example ""wif bluf dax"", the output is ""red red green"". The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and it is the word that precedes ""bluf"", thus it is repeated in the output after ""bluf"".

Having assessed the pattern, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the preceding word to be repeated once in the output with its corresponding color.

Rule: bluf -> causes the preceding word to be repeated once in the output with its corresponding color.
The nonce word ""walm"" appears in various contexts within the given examples. To deduce its meaning, we can analyze its relationship with other words in the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
3. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green""
4. ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" -> ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""dax lug wif walm"" -> ""green blue red red red""

From the first two examples, we can see that the output for ""dax walm"" is consistently ""green green green"". The word ""dax"" by itself must be represented by the first ""green"", and therefore, ""walm"" is represented by the next two instances of ""green"".

In the third example, ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red"", and since we know ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" here is again associated with two output colors ""red red"". This suggests that ""walm"" could be a duplicator or a repeater for the color that precedes it.

In the fourth example, considering ""wif"" maps to ""red"", ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", we see the pattern that ""walm"" appears to be repeating the color word that precedes it, doubling the output.

In the fifth and last example, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"", ""wif"" maps to ""red"", and ""dax"" maps to ""green"". When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it results in two additional ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the consistent rule that can be derived from these examples is that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, doubling the occurrence in the output.

Rule: walm -> doubles the color indicated by the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,176
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.
From the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color green. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the co-occurrence of the word with the associated colors in the input-output pairs:

1. ""lug wif dax"" translates to ""blue red green,"" and ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red."" This suggests that ""lug"" represents ""blue,"" and it seems ""dax"" represents ""green."" Given this, ""wif"" in these contexts translates to ""red.""

2. ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green."" Here, ""dax"" is consistent with our previous deduction of representing ""green,"" and since ""zup dax"" translates to ""yellow green,"" it implies that ""zup"" represents ""yellow."" The ""wif"" stands alone at the start, also leading with ""red.""

3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" With ""bluf"" leading to ""red"" as a result, it seems not to be a direct color representation but rather influenced by the presence of ""wif."" Since ""walm"" translates to ""green green,"" it's likely a repetitive modifier, and ""wif"" again translates to ""red.""

Based on this analysis, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be that it directly translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", we need to identify a pattern in the given examples where the word ""bluf"" is used and how it translates to a color in the output. Let's break down each input-output pair by comparing the output to each instance of ""bluf"" in the input:

1. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and since the output is ""green green"", it appears that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"" in this case.

2. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""bluf"" appears twice and both times it translates to ""blue"".

3. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug -> Output: green yellow red red blue
   - We see ""dax"" as ""green"", ""zup"" as ""yellow"", ""wif"" as ""red"", and ""lug"" as ""blue"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

4. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif -> Output: blue red red blue red
   - We have ""lug"" as ""blue"" and ""wif"" as ""red"". ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" again.

5. Input: wif dax zup bluf -> Output: red green yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

In analyzing the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent one-to-one mapping with a specific color. Instead, the color corresponding to ""bluf"" seems to change depending on some contextual factor within each example. One potential pattern could be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it, but let's verify that:

- In the first example, there is no preceding word, but ""dax"" is in the input, so it's possible ""bluf"" is taking the same color as ""dax"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes the first ""bluf"" and the second ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"". Both are reflected in the output as ""blue"" and ""yellow"", respectively.
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output color for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" also precedes ""bluf"", resulting in ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""yellow"".

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. This rule is consistent across all given examples.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately preceding it in the input.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's break down the examples focusing on the occurrences of ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors.

1. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif""
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - After ""walm,"" blue is repeated three times, and after the second ""walm,"" yellow is repeated three times.

2. ""lug walm zup walm""
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   - Similarly to the first example, ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the prior color (""blue"" is repeated thrice) and then ""yellow"" is repeated thrice after the second ""walm.""

3. ""dax wif walm""
   Output: green red red red
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - Following ""walm,"" there are three ""red"" which was the color before ""walm.""

4. ""dax walm lug""
   Output: green green green blue
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   - After ""walm"" the color ""green"" appears thrice, which was the color prior to ""walm.""

5. ""lug walm dax""
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green""
   - Before ""dax,"" ""blue"" appears thrice after the ""walm,"" which was the color before ""walm.""

From these observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the previous color to repeat three times before moving on to the color represented by the next word.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm lug
    ",Output: red red red blue,red red red blue,True,177
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each appearance of the word ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we must look for patterns in the input and corresponding output. The examples provided have one instance of ""dax"" associated with different colors in the output. Let's analyze each example.

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - Here, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

2. Input: zup dax lug wif dax
   Output: yellow green blue red green
   - ""dax"" appears twice and each time it corresponds to the color green.

3. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, ""zup"" to yellow.

4. Input: zup dax lug
   Output: yellow green blue
   - Again, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow.

5. Input: zup lug dax
   Output: yellow blue green
   - Once more, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

From these examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the given context, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be consistent:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs and look for patterns.

Let's examine each example:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   
In this sequence, we can see that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". The word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it does not seem to affect the meaning of ""bluf"" since ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue yellow

Here, regardless of the position, ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""blue.""

3. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green

The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" still corresponds to ""red"" here as well. This might suggest the rule relies on repeating the color of the word before it.

4. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green

We see a pattern where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" after ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" this time. However, ""bluf"" after ""zup"" (yellow) corresponds to ""yellow."" Thus, it strengthens the idea that ""bluf"" may take on the color of the word before it.

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

Again, ""bluf"" is following the color of the word before it.

Rule:
Given the consistently recurring pattern of ""bluf"" taking the color of the preceding word, we can deduce that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word.""

bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the given examples, the output color for each word appears to be consistent. Each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of three successive ""blue"" words in the output. This consistency allows us to deduce the meaning of ""walm.""

Here's the breakdown:

- Every instance of ""wif"" translates to a single ""red"" in the output.
- Every instance of ""lug"" translates to a sequence of three ""blue"" in the output.
- Every instance of ""dax"" translates to a ""green"" following the pattern of the word before it.
- Every instance of ""zup"" translates to a ""yellow.""

Considering ""lug"" also corresponds to three ""blue"" outputs, we can infer that ""walm"" means the same as ""lug"" or acts similarly in terms of the output it generates. In other words, ""walm"" can be interpreted to mean a sequence of three ""blue,"" just like ""lug.""

Rule: walm -> sequence of three ""blue""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True,178
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

In each instance where ""lug"" is mentioned, the output includes the word ""blue."" This is consistent across different inputs, whether ""lug"" appears alone or within a sequence of other nonce words.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Each example shows the correspondence between a single appearance of the word ""dax"" and the color ""green"" in the Output. Thus, the rule we can induce from these examples is that the nonce word ""dax"" represents the color green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's correlate each input's unique element with the output it corresponds to:

- In examples 1 and 2, each time the word ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" appears in the output. This persistent pairing suggests that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently correlates with ""green"" in the second, third, and fifth examples.
- Similarly, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" in the first and fifth examples.
- ""Zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" in both the first and second examples.
- ""Walm"" only appears once, in the fourth example, and correlates with ""red red red."" However, since ""wif"" has consistently corresponded to ""red"" in all examples, it is reasonable to deduce that ""wif"" itself means ""red,"" and that ""walm"" may be broken down into ""red red."" Note that ""wif walm"" produces ""red red red,"" consistent with two instances of ""red"" after ""wif"" and one additional ""red"" from ""walm.""

Given these correlations, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Regardless of context or position in the input string, each occurrence of ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: When the word ""zup"" is present in the input, it is replaced by the word ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can observe a pattern that allows us to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf."" In each instance, the term ""bluf"" corresponds directly to a color in the output. Furthermore, that color is identical to the color assigned to the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Here are the observations:

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow.""

2. ""lug bluf wif"" -> ""blue blue red""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue.""

3. ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> ""blue red blue green green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to ""green.""

4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue.""

Based on this pattern, we can extract a general rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it.

Hence:

bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the word before it.""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's break down the examples according to the colored outputs they produce:

1. dax walm -> green green green
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
5. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, ""walm"" appears to consistently involve repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. The number of repetitions of the color seems to be one more than the number of times the word preceding ""walm"" appears in the input.

- In example 1, ""dax"" is associated with the color green, and ""walm"" results in three repetitions of green.
- In example 2, ""lug"" is associated with blue, so ""walm"" results in three repetitions of blue.
- In example 3, the pattern appears slightly more complicated. ""zup"" is associated with yellow, but ""wif"" must be associated with red. Since ""wif"" is directly before ""walm,"" ""walm"" results in three repetitions of red (following the association with ""wif"") plus one additional instance of yellow from the occurrence of ""zup.""
- In example 4, ""dax lug"" are associated with green and blue respectively. ""Walm"" after a sequence of different colors results in a repetition of each color, with the quantity of each repetition being dependent on the sequence appearing before ""walm"" (one more than their respective occurrences).
- In example 5, ""wif"" is before the first ""walm"" so it outputs three reps of red, and ""zup"" is before the second ""walm"" so it outputs three reps of yellow. The repetition of ""walm"" itself does not seem to influence the color or the count; it simply applies the rule of the word preceding each ""walm.""

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be outputted, with the number of repetitions being one more than the number of instances that the preceding word appears in the input sequence leading up to ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can determine:

Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green
Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
Input: dax -> Output: green

The word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green,"" regardless of position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"". Each example that includes ""wif"" results in ""red"" being part of the output sequence. There is no context provided that suggests the meaning of ""wif"" changes dependent on placement or adjacent words. Therefore, the rule seems to be quite simple in this case:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonsensical word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.

The rule can thus be formulated as:

zup -> yellow

Meaning:

Rule: Whenever you see the word ""zup,"" it represents the color ""yellow.""
To determine what ""bluf"" means, we need to look for patterns in the examples given. We can start by looking at the color corresponding to ""bluf"" in each of the given outputs.

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green
Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow
In this case, bluf corresponds to the color yellow.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.

Given the inconsistencies, one instance where ""bluf"" means green, another where it means yellow, and another where it means blue, we must consider the possibility that ""bluf"" is a chameleon word that takes on a color based on some characteristic of the words around it:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it has been green.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it has been yellow.
- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""lug,"" it has been blue.

Now we need a rule that ties these observations together. Since ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""bluf"" also corresponds to green when following ""dax"", ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow when following ""zup"", and ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""bluf"" corresponds to blue when following ""lug"", we might hypothesize that the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence.

However, there’s an inconsistency in the first and second examples where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" but corresponds to different colors (green in the first, yellow in the second), so our hypothesis does not hold for all the given examples.

Because we don't have consistent evidence to support one clear rule based on the given examples, it may be best to state that the rule concerning what ""bluf"" means cannot be determined with the current information.

Rule: The pattern for ""bluf"" is inconsistent based on the examples given; therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" cannot be conclusively determined without additional information or examples.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's consider its output color in each example when it appears:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""

3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""

4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""green""

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""red""

The above analysis presents an inconsistency in the meaning of ""walm,"" as it corresponds to different colors in different contexts. However, we can observe a pattern where ""walm"" corresponds to the color of the word preceding it. Let's confirm this rule by examining the inputs and outputs:

1. ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color is blue.
2. ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color is blue.
3. ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color is blue.
4. ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color is green.
5. ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the color is red.

Based on this pattern, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, lug consistently translates to the word ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Rule: Lug corresponds to the word ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the word ""dax"":

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
To deduce what ""wif"" means, we should look for patterns and consistency in the translation of the inputs to outputs. Let's examine each provided example and the corresponding output.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as does ""bluf."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red."" However, ""walm"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively, so ""wif"" being ""red"" is consistent so far.

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
- ""Dax"" continues to correspond to ""green,"" and ""walm"" appears to correspond with ""red"" in this example. ""Wif,"" positioned after colors have been established for ""dax"" and ""walm,"" continues to correspond with ""red.""

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again to ""blue."" ""Wif"" in this instance translates to ""red"" amidst the ""blue"" corresponding to the other words.

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red
- ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to ""red."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in both places it appears.

Rule:
Given that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in every example provided, we can conclude that the word ""wif"" translates to ""red."" There's no evidence in the provided examples that ""wif"" depends on context or position within the sequence to determine its meaning. Therefore:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that zup corresponds to the color yellow. Whenever zup appears in the input sequence, yellow appears in the output sequence at the same position. Here's a mapping of the given inputs to their corresponding outputs considering zup as yellow:

1. Input: lug dax zup -> Output: blue green yellow
2. Input: zup dax walm zup wif -> Output: yellow green green green yellow red
3. Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
4. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red
5. Input: dax zup walm wif walm -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word. Here's the rule:

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the word before it.

So:
- ""wif lug zup bluf"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow"" because ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" for the same reason.
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"", which is ""red"".
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" because ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- The last ""zup bluf"" is identical to the second example and thus translates to ""yellow yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs by identifying patterns.

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- Here, ""walm"" occurs twice and in both cases, it appears to triple the color that precedes it. ""wif"" is red, both of its occurrences followed by ""walm"" lead to triple red in the output. 

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- In this case, ""walm"" occurs once and it triples the color of ""wif"", which is red, just as in the first example.

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and triples the color yellow.

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
- Again, the two occurrences of ""walm"" each triple the color of the word before it - ""wif"" is red and ""zup"" is yellow.

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
- ""Walm"" follows ""dax"", which is green, and the output has triple green followed by the color for ""lug"", which is blue.

From these examples, it seems clear that the word ""walm"" triples the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug walm zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue blue blue yellow blue,yellow blue blue blue yellow blue,True,181
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> ""blue""
Based upon the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". 

Looking at the sequences:

1. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
2. ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" -> ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow""
3. ""wif dax lug"" -> ""red green blue""
4. ""dax wif zup"" -> ""green red yellow""
5. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""

In each sequence, wherever the word ""dax"" is mentioned, the color ""green"" is outputted.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" I will first summarize the input-output pairs you've provided:

1. zup wif -> yellow red
2. wif dax -> red green
3. zup wif -> yellow red
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. lug zup wif -> blue yellow red

Now, let's look for patterns.

- Every time ""wif"" is used, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
- The word ""wif"" comes after ""zup"" twice, and the output both times is ""yellow red,"" suggesting that ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" comes before another word, the first color in the output is ""red,"" and the second color changes based on the second word.
- In the last example, ""lug zup wif"" leads to ""blue yellow red,"" which indicates that ""lug"" might correspond to ""blue"" and supports the idea that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow.

Rule: Regardless of context or the words surrounding ""zup,"" it translates to the color yellow in the output.
Based on the provided examples, each instance of a unique word appears to correspond to a unique color:

- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> blue (since it produces ""blue"" in the fourth input where 'lug' also produces ""blue"")

Given that 'bluf' consistently results in 'red' in the outputs, and we see that 'wif' also always translates to 'red', one might surmise that 'bluf' has the same meaning as 'wif'. However, since 'walm' also translates to 'blue' just as 'lug' does, we can surmise that the colors are not exclusively tied to a single word.

The rule for 'bluf' then might not be based on it being identical in meaning to 'wif' but could pertain to its position in the sequence or its relationship with other words. Yet, given the data provided, we don't have instances of 'bluf' altering its output based on position or surrounding context. 

Therefore, the safest rule based on the provided examples is:

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs where it appears:

1. When ""lug walm"" is the input, the output is ""blue blue blue"". This suggests that ""walm"" might lead to a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"".

2. For ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red,"" showing consistency with the first example where ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" This supports the idea that ""walm"" might cause the repetition of the preceding color word.

3. In ""dax lug wif walm,"" the output is ""green blue red red red."" The single ""walm"" at the end results in a repetition of ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

4. For ""lug dax walm,"" the output is ""blue green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and it causes a repetition of ""green.""

5. In ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Again, right after ""zup,"" ""walm"" produces a repetition of ""yellow.""

These observations suggest that ""walm"" causes the color word that comes before it to repeat three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
The examples given show a consistent pattern where the word ""lug"" is translated to the color ""blue."" There is no context provided that alters the meaning of ""lug"" in different situations, so it seems to be a direct substitution.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax."" Let's compare the inputs with the outputs:

1. Input: lug dax zup lug wif
   Output: blue green yellow blue red
   - ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" maps to ""red""

2. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green
   - The same mappings apply here, confirming our initial assumptions from the first example.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" in this example appears to map to ""green,"" and it's immediately followed by ""walm,"" which also maps to ""green.""

4. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   - Again, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" and ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" with ""dax"" preceding them and mapping to ""green.""

5. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""bluf"" seemingly maps to ""green,"" aligning with the pattern that ""dax"" directly before a word also maps to ""green.""

From these examples, we can see that ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green."" There is also an indication that ""dax"" might have a repeating pattern when it precedes ""walm"" or ""bluf,"" which also map to ""green."" However, we might need more examples to establish if ""dax"" has additional context-dependent meanings or if it's solely denoting the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that each time the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" However, the examples do not provide enough context to deduce what other words like ""bluf,"" ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" mean, except that they produce different colors. It also does not explain the repetition of colors in the output for single words. Without further examples or context, the most straightforward rule we can derive is:

Rule: wif -> red

Whenever ""wif"" is an input, the output is ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be:

zup -> yellow

So, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following pattern:

1. `dax bluf` translates to `green green`. This suggests that ""bluf"" may translate to ""green"", since ""dax"" translates to ""green"" independently.

2. `wif dax zup wif dax bluf` translates to `red green yellow red green green`. We already know from previous examples that ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". The repetition of ""green"" at the end suggests that ""bluf"" also translates to ""green"".

3. `wif bluf lug zup` translates to `red red blue yellow`. The ""bluf"" in the second position translates to ""red"", just like ""wif"". Since ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"", this example also supports that ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word preceding it.

4. `dax wif bluf` translates to `green red red`. Since the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"" which translates to ""red"", ""bluf"" here translates to ""red"".

5. `lug wif lug bluf` translates to `blue red blue blue`. The word preceding ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue"", and thus ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue"" here.

Given these examples, we can induce that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> translates to the color of the word immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided:

- The presence of `walm` consistently results in the color `red` repeated three times within the output sequence.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- After 'wif' comes 'walm', followed by red red red.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- Similarly, after 'wif' comes 'walm', followed by red red red.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
- Here, 'walm' follows 'dax' and is preceded by 'wif', resulting in green green green in the output.

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- In this example, 'walm' directly follows 'zup', leading to yellow yellow yellow in the output, but it is not directly followed by 'wif'.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- 'Walm' directly follows 'wif' and is followed by 'dax', leading to red red red green in the output.

From these examples, it appears that 'walm' following 'wif' leads to red red red (the color 'red' repeated three times), regardless of the words that come after.

Rule: walm -> When 'walm' immediately follows 'wif', it outputs the color 'red' repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it is used. Therefore, the rule appears to be quite straightforward:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. 

Rule: dax corresponds to the color green. Regardless of its position in the input sequence ('dax', 'dax lug', 'zup lug dax'), the output associated with dax is consistently 'green'.
Based on the inputs and outputs provided in the examples, it looks like each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. Looking specifically at the instances where ""wif"" is used and the resulting output gives us the following:

- zup lug wif -> yellow blue red
- wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow
- dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
- wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
- lug wif dax -> blue red green

From this, we can infer that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output, no matter the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence. The color that ""wif"" maps to does not appear to depend on the placement in the input sequence nor on the other words present.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that each word corresponds to a specific color. Matching the input with the output, we can deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"" because it gives the same color output as ""dax."" 

In all examples, ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" no matter the position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent across examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can look for patterns that correspond to the occurrence of the word ""bluf."" Comparing inputs and outputs:

1. ""lug bluf zup lug"" translates to ""blue blue yellow blue""
2. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
3. ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green""
4. ""wif bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red red green blue""
5. ""lug wif bluf"" translates to ""blue red red""

If we analyze the position of ""bluf"" within the inputs and the corresponding outputs, we can notice that when the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is always ""red red"" regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the sentence. Thus, we can conclude that ""bluf"" directly translates to two consecutive ""red"" colors in the output.

Rule: bluf -> red red
To deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the provided input-output examples.

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   - ""wif walm"" is consistently followed by ""red red red.""
   - The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, as seen before.
   - The sequence ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red.""

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" with no additional context and the output is an additional yellow.

4. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - Following the same logic as before, ""zup walm"" leads to an extra yellow.

5. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue. 
   - The sequence ""lug walm zup"" gives us ""blue blue blue yellow,"" showing that the ""walm"" after ""lug"" also leads to an extra blue.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" inherits the color of the word immediately preceding it, leading to a repetition of that color in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True,184
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a pattern between the input and output by comparing the position and repetition of ""lug"" and its corresponding output color. The examples show that ""lug"" translates to a specific color, but that color varies depending on the context.

Looking at the examples:

1. ""dax walm zup lug"" outputs ""green green green yellow blue"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
2. ""dax lug dax lug wif"" outputs ""green blue green blue red"" and each ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue.""
3. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" outputs ""yellow blue blue red green,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" again.
4. ""lug wif bluf"" outputs ""blue red red,"" with ""lug"" at the beginning corresponding to ""blue.""
5. ""dax lug"" outputs ""green blue,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""

From these examples, regardless of its position or the words around it, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the output. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a pattern that associates each nonce word with a specific color output. To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's look at its occurrences in the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue
- Here ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green
- The first ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by another ""dax"" also corresponding to green.

Input: dax
Output: green
- The single word ""dax"" corresponds to green.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- The ""dax"" at the beginning of the sequence corresponds to green.

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
- The first word ""dax"" corresponds to green.

From all the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: wif
Output: red

Input: zup wif zup dax
Output: yellow red yellow green

Input: wif zup lug zup lug
Output: red yellow blue yellow blue

Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output position, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears as the first element (input), ""yellow"" is the first color (output), and vice versa. Also, when ""zup"" appears second, ""yellow"" follows suit and is also in the second position.

Additionally, there are other words paired with ""zup,"" like ""dax"" and ""lug,"" which seem to correspond to other colors: ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

So the rule appears to be:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: When ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"" in the matching position.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in each example given:

In the first example, ""dax bluf wif zup"" translates to ""green green red yellow,"" and we notice that ""green"" corresponds with both ""dax"" and ""bluf.""

In the second example, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue."" Here ""yellow"" corresponds to both ""zup"" and ""bluf.""

In the third example, ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow blue yellow yellow."" The last two inputs, ""zup bluf,"" correspond to ""yellow yellow."" 

In the fourth example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" The ""lug bluf"" pair corresponds to ""blue blue,"" just as in the second example where ""zup bluf"" corresponded to ""yellow yellow.""

In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" The ""wif bluf"" pair corresponds to ""red red.""

From these examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word that comes before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the provided examples, I will analyze the contexts in which it is used and the corresponding outputs. Let's look at each example in turn:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

From the examples, we can make the following observations:

- When ""walm"" appears immediately after ""zup,"" the output is three repetitions of the color corresponding to ""zup"" (e.g., example 3 and part of example 4).
- When ""walm"" appears immediately after ""wif,"" the output is three repetitions of the color corresponding to ""wif"" (e.g., examples 2 and 5).
- When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, as in example 1, it results in a repetition of the previous color (in this case, ""green"") three times.

Considering the consistency across different contexts, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif zup
    ",Output: yellow red yellow,yellow red yellow,True,185
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, lug consistently translates to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words surrounding it. Other words in the examples, like ""wif"" and ""dax,"" correspond to other colors, red and green respectively. There's no evidence in these examples that lug's meaning changes depending on context; it always means the same color.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it seems that the output color depends directly on the input word. Thus, we can attempt to induce the following rules:

1. Every time the word ""dax"" appears, it is translated to ""green"".
2. Every time the word ""lug"" appears, it is translated to ""blue"".
3. Every occurrence of ""bluf"" translates to ""green"", based on the first example.
4. The word ""walm"" can be associated with doubled ""blue blue"" from the second example.
5. ""wif"" is less clear, but given it appears once and corresponds to a ""red"", we might deduce that ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

So, we can infer:

dax -> green
lug -> blue
bluf -> green
walm -> blue blue
wif -> red

Rule: Each word is directly mapped to a color or sequence of colors in the output.
Based on the examples provided:

- Whenever the input contains the word ""wif"" alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is accompanied by ""zup,"" the output is ""red yellow.""
- When multiple words are included in the input with ""wif"" repeated and other words such as ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" interspersed, the output is a series of colors corresponding to each word.

From the given examples, we can deduce:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""green.""

Therefore, it seems that each nonce word is associated with a specific color. The rule here appears to be a straightforward mapping from nonce word to color name.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by looking for a consistent pattern in the outputs corresponding to its occurrence:

1. ""wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""red green yellow yellow""
2. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
3. ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""
4. ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""
5. ""wif zup lug"" -> ""red yellow blue""

In each output sequence, ""yellow"" appears whenever ""zup"" is present in the input sequence. Based on this consistent pattern, we can determine that the nonce word ""zup"" is represented by the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns between the input and the output pairs.

Looking at the input and output pairs:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and both result in ""red red.""

2. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green

""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" again, and both lead to ""green red.""

3. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue

Both instances of ""bluf"" are preceded by different words (""wif"" and ""lug"") but still result in the color ""red.""

4. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red

Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and gives the same output color ""red.""

The consistent pattern that emerges is that ""bluf"" matches the color output of the word that precedes it. When there is no preceding word (as in the last example), ""bluf"" defaults to ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word or defaults to red if there is no preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to investigate the context in which it appears and the corresponding output. Let's analyze each example one by one, focusing on the presence of ""walm"" and the colors it produces:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

We observe that the outputs for ""walm"" are consistently red in color. However, the number of times red appears is variable and seems to follow a pattern:

- When walm is the second position in the input, it results in triple red (example 3: wif walm -> red red red).
- When walm precedes a color word (as in the first example towards lug and bluf), it results in that many reds plus the colors that follow (example 1: walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red, where lug results in three yellows, bluf in one red one blue).

From this, it seems that ""walm"" represents the word ""red"" and additionally duplicates the color coming after it in the sequence. If no color follows walm, it results in a single instance of the color red. If walm is the second position in the input, it results in three reds. 

However, we come across inconsistency with example 5 (wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow). According to our previous observation, we would expect four reds, whereas we only see three followed by green and yellow. This inconsistency suggests that another rule might be affecting the number of reds generated by ""walm.""

Considering this, our understanding of walm from these examples is:

Rule: Walm means red, and when followed by another color (except when it is the second word), it duplicates that color, meaning the color repeats one more time (this rule doesn't apply consistently, as seen in example 5). 

If we focus solely on the sequences that include walm without considering the entire sequence for color repetition:

walm -> meaning: red

Given the examples, we can confidently declare that ""walm"" represents the color ""red,"" but the additional rules involving duplication of the following color and the specific position causing the triplicate response are somewhat inconsistent. We require more examples or context to fully understand the complex rules around ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,186
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" No matter its position in the input sequence or the words surrounding it, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" every time it appears.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided where the word ""wif"" is present and its corresponding output, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all provided examples.
To determine the meaning of bluf, we must look at the patterns in the examples provided. 

The ""Output"" consists of colors, and each ""Input"" word seems to correspond to a particular color in the ""Output"". If we assume that each unique word in the input corresponds to a unique color in the output, we can try to deduce the rule by comparing the inputs and outputs.

Let's analyze the patterns:

1. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
2. ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green""
3. ""lug bluf dax lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue""
4. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
5. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green"" (This is the same as the first example, providing consistency.)

From the data:

- ""dax"" appears consistently paired with ""green"".
- ""wif"" appears consistently paired with ""red"".
- ""lug"" appears consistently paired with ""blue"".

If we look specifically at the second example, ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"", and compare it to its output ""green blue yellow red red green"", we can confirm that ""dax"" is green and ""wif"" is red. ""lug"" has already been identified as ""blue"", and ""zup"" seems to be a new word translating to ""yellow"".

If we now look at the occurrences of ""bluf"", it appears directly before ""dax"" in the first, second, and fifth examples, resulting in ""red green"" immediately after, except in the second example, where ""bluf"" is followed by two instances of the color red. In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green "" when it stands between two ""lug,"" which we've established translates to blue. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is again followed directly by red (twice), and since the word that precedes ""bluf"" in all cases does not impact its color, we can deduce that ""bluf"" by itself is associated with ""red"".

Thus, we can deduce the rule as:
bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns and associations with the outputs provided. Let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" when following ""wif""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" when following ""lug""

3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red""
- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red""

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" when following ""dax""

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

From these examples, we see that the word ""walm"" takes the color of the word preceding it. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is red. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is blue. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is green.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for the word ""walm"" is that it takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule:
walm -> meaning: ""walm"" takes the color of the word before it. If ""wif"" is before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" is red. If ""lug"" is before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" is blue. If ""dax"" is before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" is green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output at its respective position.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce a rule regarding the nonce word ""dax"" and the colors associated with each word in the output. 

First, we can note that every input begins with ""dax"" and its corresponding output begins with green. This pattern suggests that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green"" when it is the first word in the sequence.

To further understand the pattern, let's analyze the remaining words and their corresponding colors:

""walm"" consistently results in ""green"" in both examples where it appears.
""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" immediately following its mention.
""zup"" results in ""yellow"" in the both examples where it's used.
""lug"" results in ""blue"" in the one example provided.
When ""dax"" appears a second time in a sequence (not as the first word), it still translates to ""green,"" as seen in the first and fourth examples.

Given this information, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: Each word in the input is associated with a specific color in the output. ""dax"" correlates with the color green, ""walm"" with green, ""wif"" with red, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""lug"" with blue. The position of ""dax"" in the sequence does not affect its associated color; it is always green.

The meaning can then be defined as:
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" When used in combination with other nonce words, each of those words is associated with a different color.

Here is the rule based on the given examples:

Rule: wif -> red

The other words, regardless of their actual nonce meaning, correspond to other colors like so:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green 
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the word 'zup' always corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the output, regardless of its position within the input sequence or the context of the surrounding words. Given this consistent mapping from 'zup' to 'yellow', we can deduce the meaning of 'zup' as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word 'zup' represents the color 'yellow'.
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to depend on the word that precedes it. The rules for ""bluf"" seem to relate to color translation, as follows:

- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

When ""bluf"" follows any of these words, it repeats the color that the preceding word represents. If ""bluf"" appears alone, it repeats the color of the word that would have come before it if there was one. This is evident from the third input where ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"", suggesting that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color indicated by the word before it.

Rule:
bluf -> repeats the color indicated by the word preceding it. If there is no preceding word, ""bluf"" repeats the color that would have been indicated by such a word if it was present.
To deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   
2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   
3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

Now, let's look for patterns that correspond to the appearance of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue red red red."" Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" in the first case seems to result in ""blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" (yellow), and the output sequence is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" could be repeating the color of the word before it.
- The third example supports this, as ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" with ""walm"" tripling the output for ""dax"" which is ""green.""
- The fourth example has ""lug walm zup lug walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" aligning with the interpretation that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word in triplicate.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" again results in ""red red red,"" which is consistent with the rule we've seen so far.

Therefore, the rule derived from the examples provided is that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the directly preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif
    ",Output: red green red,red green red,True,188
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When ""lug"" is present in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" appears to be consistent and can be deduced as follows:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

Considering this pattern, we can write the rule as:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
wif -> meaning: red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. If ""wif"" appears before another word, then ""red"" precedes the color associated with the second word in the output. If ""wif"" stands alone, the output is solely ""red"".
zup -> meaning. ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: When ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf"", we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's align each input with its respective output, paying close attention to the occurrence of ""bluf"":

1. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

2. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green

3. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

4. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red

5. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow

Here's what we can deduce:
- Every time ""wif"" is in the input, ""red"" is in the output.
- Every time ""lug"" is in the input, ""blue"" is in the output (except in the presence of ""bluf"" after ""lug"").
- Every time ""dax"" is in the input, ""green"" is in the output.
- Every time ""zup"" is in the input, ""yellow"" is in the output.

Now, focusing on ""bluf"":
- In the first input, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" (a repeated blue).
- In the second input, there is one ""bluf"" and its output is one ""green,"" indicating ""bluf"" did not directly translate to ""green.""
- In the third input, the first instance of ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" while the second translates to ""yellow"" (the color associated with ""zup"").
- In the fourth input, ""bluf"" yields two ""red"" outputs, the same as ""wif.""
- In the fifth input, ""bluf"" produces a single ""blue"" output.

From these observations, we can infer that ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it:

- After ""wif"" (red), ""bluf"" results in ""red red.""
- After ""lug"" (blue), ""bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" (first input).
- It is not clear how it works with ""dax"" (green) or ""zup"" (yellow) since we have other instances of ""bluf"" associated with different words that do not maintain this pattern consistently.

Given the ambiguity with the ""dax"" and ""zup"" precedents, we might consider that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word and creates an additional instance of that color or reinforces it somehow.

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" duplicates or emphasizes the color associated with the word preceding it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the color outputs in the context of the presence of ""walm"" in the input strings.

From the first input-output pair:
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue red red red.""
- Here, ""walm"" appears twice, first corresponding to ""blue"" and then to ""red.""

From the second input-output pair:
- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" gives ""blue blue blue green red blue red.""
- Here, the occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to another ""blue.""

From the third input-output pair:
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" gives ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue.""
- Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From the fourth input-output pair:
- ""zup walm lug"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""
- Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From the fifth input-output pair:
- ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red.""
- Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""

To find a pattern, we need to look at any conditions that change the output when ""walm"" is used and the elements that precede or succeed ""walm."" It appears that ""walm"" duplicates the color output of the word directly preceding it:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output is yellow.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), the output is blue.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), the output is red.

Thus, based on the examples provided, we can conclude that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color generated by the word that directly precedes it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the provided context. Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is used in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each time the word ""dax"" is used, the output consistently includes the word ""green."" Regardless of the other words in the input or their corresponding colors in the output, ""dax"" remains unchanged and is always associated with ""green."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

dax -> green. 

Rule: Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, the output will include ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, each word apart from ""wif"" correlates to a particular color:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue
- bluf -> blue

In every case, ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". There does not seem to be any context-based variance in this translation, and ""wif"" stands alone with the same meaning regardless of the other words present. Therefore, the rule appears to be consistent and straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, there is a direct correlation between the nonce word zup and a particular color. Each instance of zup in the inputs corresponds to the color yellow in the outputs. The other words in the sequences also seem to be paired with specific colors: lug corresponds to blue, bluf to yellow, wif to red, and dax to green.

Consequently, the rule for the meaning of zup can be expressed as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Using the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"":

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

2. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green

3. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue

4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

5. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

We can observe that ""bluf"" consistently results in the output ""red"". Additionally, it appears that other words are associated with consistent colors too:

- ""wif"" regularly results in ""red""
- ""dax"" regularly results in ""green""
- ""lug"" regularly results in ""blue""
- ""zup"" regularly results in ""yellow""
- ""walm"" in example 1 might be the reason for the third ""green"", but there are no other examples to confirm its meaning.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in repeated outputs of the last color mentioned before it, with the number of repetitions equaling the total number of words (including ""walm"") up to that point in the sequence.

Here are the deductions based on each example:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow (3 words -> ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and repeated 3 times)

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue (4 words -> ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and repeated 4 times)

3. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue (Same as above)

4. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue (7 words -> ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and repeated 5 times before ""walm"" leading to ""yellow yellow yellow"", followed by the sequence succeeding ""walm"")

5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red (7 words -> ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and repeated 5 times before ""walm"" leading to ""green green green"")

Thus, based on the information available, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" as many times as there are words in the sequence, including ""walm"" itself, up to that point.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green,green red yellow green,True,190
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output. Regardless of position in the sequence or the presence of other words, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
The initial challenge involves decoding the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" based on the corresponding color outputs for different input sequences.

To understand the meaning of ""dax"", we can examine each instance where it appears and the associated color in the output. When ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output color is green.

Here are all instances of ""dax"" with their outputs:

- ""dax walm zup"" => green green green yellow
- ""dax lug"" => green blue
- ""dax zup dax zup"" => green yellow green yellow
- ""zup lug wif dax lug"" => yellow blue red green blue
- ""dax zup bluf"" => green yellow yellow

Isolating the outcomes associated with ""dax"", it consistently results in a ""green"" output, regardless of the words that follow. This constancy implies that ""dax"" definitively correlates to ""green"". The colors that follow ""dax"" in the output are seemingly influenced by the other words in the sequence, not by ""dax"" itself.

Using this information, we can deduce the following:

dax -> green

Rule:
Considering the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently results in a green output color, indicating that the meaning of ""dax"" within the context of this problem correlates to the color green.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" appears to translate to the color ""red."" Here's how this rule applies to each line:

1. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue
   ""Lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" followed by ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and again ""lug"" is ""blue.""

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   It's the same as the first line: ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

4. Input: zup wif lug
   Output: yellow red blue
   Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif"" which is ""red,"" and then ""lug"" is ""blue.""

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   ""Zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and the repetition in the output suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to multiple ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
To induce the rule for the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the outputs in relation to the corresponding inputs:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Whenever we see only ""zup"" as the input, the output is ""yellow."" Therefore, at the most basic level:

zup -> yellow

Let's confirm this with the other examples:

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

The second example adds ""dax"" before ""zup,"" with the output adding ""green"" before ""yellow."" Since ""zup"" is the last term and ""yellow"" is the last color in the output, this supports our initial rule.

Input: zup
Output: yellow

This example reaffirms the initial rule, as it is identical to the first example.

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this example, there are multiple nonce words preceding and succeeding ""zup,"" and their corresponding color outputs. However, ""zup"" maintains its position as the fourth word and correlates to ""yellow,"" the fourth color in the sequence. This reinforces the notion that ""zup"" is associated specifically with ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or the other nonce words present.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

In the final example, ""zup"" follows the other nonce words ""dax"" and ""walm,"" which map to ""green,"" and the rule still holds: ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""

Rule: Regardless of the positioning or the accompanying nonce words in the sequence, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

zup -> yellow
Based on the presented examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to consistently correspond to a color, and it follows a pattern depending on the preceding word.

When the word ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color indicated by the word ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

When ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" Therefore, ""bluf"" takes the color indicated by the word ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

There is no example of ""bluf"" following ""lug"" or ""dax,"" but based on the pattern, we could predict that if ""bluf"" followed these words, it would take the colors ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively, as suggested by the outputs associated with ""lug"" and ""dax.""

Rule: bluf repeats the color of the output associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color indicated by the previous word.
Based on the given examples, walm appears to be associated with a repetition of a color. The color that is repeated corresponds to the word that comes immediately before walm. Here are the observed patterns:

1. In the first and second examples, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"". Here, walm seems to cause the word ""wif"" (which corresponds to the color red) to repeat three times.

2. In the third example, ""wif lug walm"" leads to ""red blue blue blue"". The presence of ""walm"" here results in ""lug"" being repeated as the color blue, three times in addition to its original occurrence.

3. In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup walm"" translates into ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". Both ""lug"" and ""zup"" are followed by walm, and each time, the corresponding color is repeated three times (blue for lug, yellow for zup).

4. In the fifth example, ""wif walm zup"" changes to ""red red red yellow"". Again, walm causes the word before it (""wif"") to repeat as red three times, while ""zup"" remains as a single occurrence of yellow.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug dax wif walm
    ",Output: red blue green red red red,red blue green red red red,True,191
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, wherever ""lug"" appears, the output consistently translates to ""blue."" Therefore, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Considering the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the word ""green"" in the output.

Here's the demonstrated pattern for ""dax"":

- Input: zup dax zup => Output: yellow green yellow
- Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif => Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- Input: dax lug dax => Output: green blue green
- Input: wif dax => Output: red green
- Input: dax lug => Output: green blue

In every instance, the occurrence of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output. There is no indication that ""dax"" is context-dependent in the examples provided.

Rule: dax -> green
By examining the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule behind the word ""wif"". Let's analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red

2. Input: wif
   Output: red

3. Input: wif
   Output: red

4. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green

5. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red

From the first example, we can see that before ""wif"" the word ""walm"" is repeated once and the color ""green"" is repeated thrice. After ""wif,"" the word ""walm"" is repeated and the color ""red"" is repeated three times, suggesting a doubling effect from what preceded the ""wif"". 

In the second and third examples, ""wif"" stands alone and outputs ""red"" in both instances. This indicates that the word ""wif"" by itself triggers the output ""red"".

However, in the fourth example, colors after “wif” do not represent a doubling, as ""zup dax bluf"" produces the sequence ""yellow green green"".

In the fifth example, ""wif"" again follows a ""zup,"" and ""yellow"" is not doubled in the output but is followed by ""red"".

Given the inconsistent doubling effect across the provided examples, we must look for another rule. From the examples, we notice that “wif” always results in the color ""red"" whenever it appears.

Based on this observation, the rule we can deduce is as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: Regardless of the context or position in the sequence, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a sequence of colors in the output. Observing the patterns, the following rules for color outputs related to the input words can be deduced:

- lug: blue
- wif: red
- walm: red
- dax: green
- zup: yellow

Now, for every instance of ""bluf"" in the input, the corresponding output repeats the color associated with the word just before ""bluf"", but if there is no word before ""bluf,"" it defaults to blue. Checking this with the given examples:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red 
   Following the pattern, ""bluf"" here repeats the color ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

2. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
   In this case, ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow"" associated with ""zup.""

3. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
   Here, ""bluf"" repeats the color ""blue"" associated with ""lug.""

4. lug bluf -> blue blue
   ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" and therefore repeats ""blue.""

5. dax zup lug bluf -> green yellow blue blue
   For the last example, ""bluf"" repeats the color ""blue"" associated with ""lug.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"" in the sequence; if ""bluf"" is the first word, output blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I'll examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs in each example:

1. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   - It seems that ""lug"" results in ""blue"", ""wif"" results in ""red"" at the end and ""yellow"" in other positions, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"".

2. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - Here ""zup"" also results in ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" in ""blue,"" consistent with the previous observation. ""wif"" at the end results in ""red"".

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" again results in ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" in ""blue"". ""wif"" not at the end results in ""red"" again.

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" ""lug"" in ""blue"". ""bluf"" is new and corresponds to ""blue."" There's a repetition pattern here that suggests ""walm"" might result in replication of a color.

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" results in ""red"" again, ""zup"" in ""yellow,"" and a new word ""dax"" relates to ""green"".

Now, let's focus on ""walm"" specifically:

- Example 1 suggests ""walm"" following ""lug"" could mean ""repeat the previous color,"" which is ""blue.""
- Example 2 shows ""walm"" after ""zup,"" and the output is still ""yellow,"" again indicating that it triggers the repetition of the previous color.
- Example 3 also has ""walm"" after ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is repeated.
- Example 4 puts ""walm"" at the end after a sequence and the last color, ""yellow,"" is repeated. This is consistent with the previous examples.
- Example 5 has ""walm"" following ""wif,"" and once again the previous color ""red"" is repeated.

Rule: The word ""walm"" results in repeating the color of the word before it.

Walm -> meaning. Meaning: Walm causes the next output to replicate the color of the output corresponding to the word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow blue,True,192
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, it corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax"" from the given examples, let's consider the output colors for each instance where ""dax"" appears and the surrounding words.

Input: dax wif walm  
Output: green red red red  
In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax  
Output: green  
When ""dax"" stands alone, the output is ""green"".

Input: zup wif zup dax  
Output: yellow red yellow green  
""dax"" is at the end after ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"". The pattern here also maintains ""dax"" as ""green"".

Input: wif dax  
Output: red green  
""dax"" directly follows ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", but ""dax"" continues to correspond to ""green"".

Input: wif walm dax  
Output: red red red green  
""dax"" follows ""walm"" (which outputs ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"") and still results in ""green"".

From these examples, regardless of the preceding word, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"". It stands to reason that ""dax"" is not dependent on context; rather, it is independently associated with the output color green.

Rule: dax -> green. The meaning of ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position or the preceding words.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Here's how we can determine that:

- In the first example, ""wif lug"" outputs ""red blue,"" and since ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in other examples, ""wif"" must mean ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif zup dax"" translates to ""red yellow green,"" with ""dax"" consistently meaning ""green."" We don't have another example of ""zup,"" but ""wif"" preceding it results in ""red,"" supporting our assumption.
- In the third example, ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue."" The repetition of ""lug"" with ""blue"" and ""dax"" with ""green"" leaves ""wif"" to be ""red.""
- The fourth example ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" so ""wif"" continues to be ""red.""
- Lastly, ""dax wif"" becoming ""green red"" again supports ""wif"" being ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look at the relationship between the inputs and outputs given:

Input: zup wif            | Output: yellow red
Input: dax walm zup walm  | Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
Input: dax zup bluf       | Output: green yellow yellow
Input: dax wif zup dax    | Output: green red yellow green
Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf | Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Based on the provided inputs and outputs, the following observations can be made:

1. When the word ""zup"" appears once, two instances of ""yellow"" follow it, except when ""zup"" is at the beginning of the sequence. This indicates that ""zup"" could correspond to the word ""yellow.""
2. The word ""wif"" translates to a single ""red"" each time.
3. The word ""dax"" translates to a single ""green"" each time.
4. The word ""walm"" seems to triple the quantity of the next color mentioned.
5. The word ""bluf"" results in duplication of the color that follows it.

Consider only focusing on ""zup."" By ignoring the other words, the pattern suggests that ""zup"" could stand for ""yellow."" However, when examining ""zup"" within the context of each sequence, the surrounding words don't seem to impact the immediate translation of ""zup"" to ""yellow"" – they only affect the quantity or repetition of ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" (where ""zup"" represents the color yellow, and the number of times it is translated into ""yellow"" depends on the words around it, such as ""walm"" causing it to triple or ""bluf"" causing a double replication).
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" can be deduced as follows:

In each example, the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" The provided context does not suggest any additional complexities related to the position of ""bluf"" in the input string or interaction with other words. Therefore, the simplest and most consistent rule is that ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow.
Based on the patterns from the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds with a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the breakdown based on the input and output:

- ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow,"" where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and ""zup"" (yellow), resulting in repetitions of red and yellow respectively.
- ""zup lug walm"" gives ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and the color blue is repeated.
- ""zup walm lug wif"" ends up with ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the color yellow is repeated.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" showing again that following ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" leads to a repetition of yellow.
- ""lug walm zup"" gives ""blue blue blue yellow,"" with ""walm"" following ""lug"" (blue) and causing blue to repeat.

Walm -> meaning: Walm causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to repeat. Rule: If x represents the color associated with the word preceding walm, then walm translates to the repetition of the color x.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meanings of the nonce word ""dax"" by analyzing the outputs corresponding to each input containing ""dax.""

Let's examine each input and its output:

1. Input: zup dax walm -> Output: yellow green green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color which is ""green""

2. Input: dax wif lug dax -> Output: green red blue green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again

3. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color which is ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again

5. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: green green yellow yellow green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" repeats the last mentioned color which is ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" repeats the last mentioned color which is ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again

From these examples, the pattern shows that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There appears to be no context dependency or variation in meaning in the given examples.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it, whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the output includes ""red"" in the corresponding position.

So, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the color ""yellow."" The other words in the input correspond to other colors: ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" as well, but because it was not directly converted in the given examples, its meaning was deduced from the context of the first example.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning or rule for ""bluf,"" let's analyze the color patterns in relation to the presence of ""bluf.""

In every instance where ""bluf"" is present:

- ""bluf"" always follows a color word (lug, dax, wif, zup, walm).
- The output colors include colors that were not explicitly mentioned before ""bluf"" in the input.

Let's assess each instance:

1. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also resulted in ""blue"" in-between.

2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" resulted in the repetition of the color ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
- ""bluf"" came after ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and it resulted in ""green"" again, while it was followed by ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- In this sequence, ""bluf"" seems to result in ""red"" after ""wif"" which is ""green,"" and then followed by another ""dax"" which is ""green.""

5. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
- ""bluf"" followed ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and resulted in another ""yellow,"" and the second ""bluf"" came after ""lug,"" which is ""blue"" and yielded another ""blue.""

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color represented by the word that immediately precedes it in the list.

So: bluf -> meaning: repetition of the preceding color.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following:

1. Every instance of ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"".
2. Every instance of ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" except when it is followed by another word (""zup""), then it changes the sequence to ""blue red red red"".
3. Every instance of ""dax wif walm"" leads to ""green red red red"".
4. When ""lug"" and ""dax"" are in front of ""walm"", their colors (""blue"" and ""green"" respectively) are repeated three times, followed by that color again e.g., ""lug dax walm"" leads to ""blue green green green"".

With these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the word directly before it to repeat its color three times plus one additional occurrence of that color. Since ""wif walm"" and ""dax wif walm"" start with red for ""wif,"" but the sequence is still ""red red red"" and ""green red red red"" respectively, it suggests that ""walm"" requires the word before it to output its corresponding color three additional times after its standard single occurrence.

Additionally, in the context of ""lug wif walm zup"", the presence of another word after ""walm"" changes the rule so that the sequence after ""walm"" starts again at ""red"" instead of repeating the color before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the previous word's corresponding color to repeat three additional times, for a total of four instances. When another word follows ""walm,"" the sequence is ""red"" followed by the color sequence corresponding to the next word instead of repeating the color before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True,194
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sentence, ""lug"" consistently results in the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> meaning. Meaning is ""green.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the output is ""green."" This rule is consistent across all the given examples. The other words in the inputs (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""walm"") don't seem to affect the association of ""dax"" with the output ""green.""
Analyzing the examples provided:

Input: wif lug wif
Output: red blue red
Rule inferred: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Rule inferred: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" despite the second word ""bluf"". There is not enough information about ""bluf"" from this line alone, but it doesn't affect the output for ""wif"".

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
Rule inferred: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" could also correspond to ""blue"" or another rule since we see blue repeated in the output, preceding and following ""wif"", ""lug"" leads to blue.

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
Rule inferred: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and there appears to be a pattern with new words following ""wif"" where the first new word corresponds to ""green"", then ""yellow"". However, ""walm"" was seen previously, and it may have a more complex rule.

Input: wif
Output: red
Rule inferred: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", confirmed when it appears by itself.

Based on the examples, the rule is consistent for ""wif"":

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

zup -> meaning: yellow

Rule:
Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output. This translation remains consistent regardless of the order or the presence of other words in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
Input: wif bluf lug -> Output: red red blue
Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow

The word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to an output color. When ""bluf"" is paired with ""wif"" it results in ""red red"" and when ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"", the output is yellow following the pattern. Notably, wherever ""bluf"" appears, the color red or yellow appears twice in a row in the output. 

This suggests that ""bluf"" means ""the same color as the previous,"" where the ""previous"" is determined by the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which translates to red, ""bluf"" results in red being repeated. When it comes after ""zup,"" which translates to yellow, ""bluf"" results in yellow being repeated.

However, the last statement in the sequence (zup lug zup lug zup bluf) outputs two yellows at the end, despite the ""bluf"" coming after a sequence of ""zup"" and ""lug"". This could indicate an exception to the rule or a pattern not yet fully understood from the provided examples. There might be a more complex rule at play that we cannot deduce with the current examples.

Based on the given information, the tentative rule is:

Rule: bluf -> ""the same color as the color indicated by the word immediately before it, repeated twice"" (with a potential exception or additional complexity to be determined).
Analyzing the outputs corresponding to various inputs that include the nonce word ""walm,"" the rule seems clear. Whenever ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, the output is a repetition of the color that would be output for the preceding word in the input. Here are the observations:

1. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green."" Hence, ""walm"" causes the output color for ""dax,"" which is green, to be repeated three times.
2. ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow,"" insinuating that after ""wif,"" which results in red, ""walm"" leads to two more repetitions of red.
3. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" gives ""blue red green green green yellow,"" indicating that after ""dax,"" which outputs green, ""walm"" triggers the repetition of green another two times.
4. ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that after ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" causes a repetition of yellow another two times.
5. ""lug walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue,"" showing that ""walm"" follows the color of ""lug,"" which is blue, by repeating it twice more.

Based on these observations, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the color output corresponding to the immediately preceding word in the input to be repeated two additional times in the output.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" can be defined as:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the output color of the preceding word two more times.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True,195
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at the commonalities and differences in the examples provided. Let's analyze the occurrences of ""dax"" and the associated output:

- In the first example, ""wif dax wif"" translates to ""red green red."" Since ""wif"" is consistent on both sides of ""dax"" and the corresponding colors are red, we might infer that ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green."" It is not clear from this example alone what ""walm"" or ""dax"" might mean since they both translate to ""green.""
- The third example, ""zup dax,"" turns into ""yellow green."" From this, it appears ""zup"" could translate to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is consistent, translating to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red green red red."" This suggests that ""zup"" is again ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" could translate to ""red.""
- The fifth example, ""dax lug,"" results in ""green blue."" This does not give us information about ""lug,"" but it is consistent with our theory that ""dax"" means ""green.""

Considering all the examples, every occurrence of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of the context or the words that surround it. Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Based on the given examples, whenever wif is input, the output is red. So, wif means red.

Rule: wif translates to the color red.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""zup"" appears consistent regardless of context, always translating to the same output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> duplicating the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: When bluf appears in the sequence, it takes the color value of the word that comes immediately before it and repeats it. For example, ""dax zup wif bluf"" results in ""green yellow red red"" where red is repeated because bluf comes after ""wif"" which is red. Similarly, in ""lug bluf"", blue is repeated because bluf follows ""lug"" which is associated with blue.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples presented:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
4. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   
5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Breaking down the above examples, consider the following observations:

- ""walm"" is followed by a repeating color in each instance.
- The color that repeats is not immediately obvious from the ""walm"" itself; rather, it seems to be related to the word that precedes ""walm.""
- Specifically:
  - When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" repeated.
  - When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated.
  - When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" but another word (e.g., ""dax"" or ""zup"") either follows or precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" repeated, followed by the color associated with the other word (""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup"").
  
Given these observations, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat according to the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" If ""wif"" is involved, it may alter the pattern by inserting its associated color (""red"") until another color from a different word is introduced.

Rule: ""walm"" makes the output color repeat the color associated with the immediate preceding word. If the preceding word is ""wif"" and followed by another word, ""red"" repeats until the color for the following word is introduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow green yellow yellow yellow yellow,green yellow green yellow yellow yellow,False,196
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" always translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: dax -> green

Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a color. Examining the outputs, we can see the following mappings:

- lug consistently translates to blue
- bluf consistently translates to blue or a sequence with two blues in a row
- zup consistently translates to yellow
- dax consistently translates to green

Now, let's look closely at the examples involving the word ""wif"":

1. wif walm lug bluf outputs to red red red blue blue. Since ""lug"" and ""bluf"" map to blue, ""wif"" would correspond to the repeated color, which is red.
2. wif zup bluf lug outputs to red yellow yellow blue. ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" and ""lug"" lead to blue, so ""wif"" is the first color, red.
3. lug zup wif zup outputs to blue yellow red yellow, which again places ""wif"" as red.
4. wif zup bluf wif dax outputs to red yellow yellow red green. ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" is blue, and ""dax"" is green. The remaining ""wif"" translates to the red color set.
5. dax zup wif bluf lug outputs to green yellow red red blue, with ""wif"" contributing to the red in the sequence.

With these comparisons, it is apparent that ""wif"" is consistently linked to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Every instance of the word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
By examining the context in which ""bluf"" is used, we can try to derive the meaning or rule that specifies its translation. Let's analyze the examples given.

1. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green
   In this sequence, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""bluf"" appears once and its translation corresponds to ""blue."" 

2. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   Here ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and translates to ""green.""

3. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" translates to ""red."" ""Bluf"" appears at the end and translates to ""red.""

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Here ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows, also translating to ""yellow.""

In each instance, the word ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word that immediately precedes it. The rule for ""bluf"" appears to be to take on the color of the word that comes right before it in the sequence. 

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning or rule behind the word 'walm,' let's compare input-output pairs, focusing on where 'walm' appears, and what outputs correspond to those appearances.

1. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
   'walm' here leads to three occurrences of 'blue' followed by 'red.'

2. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   'walm' here results in three occurrences of 'yellow.'

3. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
   'walm' here leads to three occurrences of 'blue' followed by 'yellow.'

4. dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
   'walm' here results in three occurrences of 'red.'

5. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
   'walm' here leads to three occurrences of 'green.'

From these examples, it appears that 'walm' translates to repeating the last color mentioned three times. For example, in the first input 'lug,' which maps to 'blue,' appears before 'walm,' and the output is 'blue blue blue.' In the third input, 'lug' precedes 'walm' as well, resulting in 'blue blue blue.' However, in the fourth input, 'wif' precedes 'walm' and the output is 'red red red.'

With this in mind, we may formulate the following rule for 'walm':

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before 'walm' three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax bluf wif lug
    ",Output: blue green green red blue,blue green green red blue,True,197
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From these examples, it seems that the word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.

For instance:

- ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""
- ""zup dax lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue,"" where again ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green,"" with two instances of ""lug"" both resulting in ""blue.""
- ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue,"" with ""lug"" represented by ""blue.""
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" and the lone ""lug"" in this sequence corresponds to ""blue.""

These examples establish a pattern that indicates ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red""
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
- ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green""
- ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red""
- ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow""

It appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" irrespective of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, each unique input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in each example, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can induce that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's compare the inputs and the outputs in the given examples:

1. Input: ""zup bluf wif walm"" 
   Output: ""yellow yellow red red red""
   
2. Input: ""zup""
   Output: ""yellow""
   
3. Input: ""dax zup lug bluf""
   Output: ""green yellow blue blue""
   
4. Input: ""zup lug""
   Output: ""yellow blue""
   
5. Input: ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif""
   Output: ""yellow blue red green green red""

By analyzing the examples provided:

- Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- The word ""zup"" seems to be independent of the context in which it is used, consistently resulting in ""yellow.""

Based on the examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". 

Written in the desired format:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it. Here are the rules deduced from each input-output pair:

1. In ""zup bluf wif bluf"", ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word. ""Zup"" results in ""yellow"", so the first ""bluf"" is ""yellow"". ""Wif"" leads to ""red"", making the second ""bluf"" also ""red"".
2. In ""lug wif bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and thus is ""red"".
3. In ""dax lug bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and is therefore ""blue"".
4. In ""dax bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and is ""green"".
5. In ""dax bluf wif lug zup"", ""bluf"" first follows ""dax"" (yielding ""green""), and there's a second occurrence of ""wif"" before ""lug"" and ""zup"". Since ""bluf"" isn’t mentioned again, it's not clear what color ""wif"" or ""lug"" would turn ""bluf"" into, but the sequence of colors follows the sequence of words, suggesting ""bluf"" simply mimics the preceding word's color.

Rule: bluf -> color that corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding it.
From the given examples, it is noticeable that the presence of ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of colors. The color before ""walm"" repeats itself a number of times after ""walm."" To determine the precise rule, let's look at each example:

- Input: wif walm
  Output: red red red
  In this case, ""wif"" yields one ""red,"" and post ""walm,"" there are two more ""red.""

- Input: wif lug walm
  Output: red blue blue blue
  Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and post ""walm,"" ""blue"" occurs three times.

- Input: lug zup walm lug
  Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  ""Zup"" gives one ""yellow,"" and post ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times before the sequence ends with a ""blue"" from ""lug."" 

- Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
  Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
  ""Zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by three ""yellow,"" then the sequence continues with other colors corresponding to the remaining words.

- Input: wif bluf dax walm
  Output: red red green green green
  Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.

By observing the pattern, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be as follows: walm repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three additional times. Hence, ""walm"" creates a sequence of three additional instances of the last mentioned color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True,198
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following correlations:

Input: ""lug"" yields Output: ""blue""

This output is consistent whenever ""lug"" appears. It's straightforward that ""lug"" maps directly to the color ""blue"".

Input: ""lug dax bluf wif dax"" yields Output: ""blue green green red green""

Here we see that ""lug"" is first and corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""dax"" appears twice and corresponds to ""green"" both times it appears, suggesting a one-to-one mapping of ""dax"" to ""green"". The word ""bluf"" does not provide a direct clue as it appears only once, but since it maps to ""green"" and follows the pattern, it might be a coincidence or part of a larger rule. The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in this sequence but more information would be needed to confirm its exact meaning.

Input: ""wif lug"" yields Output: ""red blue""

Here ""wif"" must correspond to ""red"", as in the previous example, since ""lug"" still maps to ""blue"".

Input: ""zup lug"" yields Output: ""yellow blue""

Considering ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" would map to ""yellow"".

lug -> meaning. Rule:
The nonce word ""lug"" consistently means ""blue"" in the examples given. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""lug"" correlates to the color ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in each given example, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context provided by the other words.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze its occurrences and the corresponding outputs in all given examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: wif dax zup wif
   Output: red green yellow red
   Here, the first occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the second to ""red"" as well.

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

In all instances, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. This suggests that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" consistently.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following mappings:

- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".
- The other words seem to have their own corresponding colors: ""walm"" maps to ""yellow"", ""dax"" maps to ""green"", and ""lug"" maps to ""blue"".
- There are no examples showing ""bluf"" translating to a color individually, but since the output is ""yellow yellow"" and we know ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", it's likely that ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"".

The rule can therefore be stated as:

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs systematically, comparing each instance where ""bluf"" appears.

1. Input: wif lug bluf | Output: red blue blue
2. Input: zup bluf       | Output: yellow yellow
3. Input: dax bluf lug wif | Output: green green blue red
4. Input: wif bluf lug     | Output: red red blue
5. Input: wif bluf dax     | Output: red red green

From the above, when ""bluf"" appears, the output color that follows is always the same as the one that preceded it:

1. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" it's ""blue,"" which followed ""lug.""
2. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf"" it's ""yellow"" again.
3. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""bluf"" it's ""green"" again, before ""lug.""
4. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" it's ""red"" again, before ""lug.""
5. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" it's ""red"" again, before ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" induces the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it in the output sequence.

Rule: bluf -> causes the output to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between the inputs containing ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

Analyzing the inputs and outputs:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is included in the output the same number of times as ""dax"".
- Whenever ""zup"" is present, the color ""yellow"" appears in the output the same number of times.
- When ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" being in the output twice as often as ""lug"" is in the input.
- When ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""red"" being present the same number of times.

Noting that ""walm"" is always followed by three colors, we can observe the following:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it results in three ""green"" outputs.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it results in three ""yellow"" outputs.
- When ""walm"" is after ""lug,"" it leads to two ""blue"" outputs.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it produces three ""red"" outputs.

Given these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" acts as a repeater for the color associated with the preceding word. Specifically:

- If ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), it repeats green three times.
- If ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), it repeats yellow three times.
- If ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), it repeats blue twice (likely because ""lug"" already leads to blue being outputted twice).
- If ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), it repeats red three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word a specified number of times. The number of repetitions seems to be three unless the preceding word already has a rule that multiplies its output, such as ""lug,"" which is why we see less repetition after ""lug walm"" (two blues instead of four).

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word a number of times dependent on the context, generally three times unless otherwise affected by a preceding word's rule.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup wif dax
    ",Output: yellow red green,yellow red green,True,199
